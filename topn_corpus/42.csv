The Narcotics Bureau says the local drug market is now  choked  with heroin that is about 35 percent pure. Last month alone,  police confiscated 128 kilograms of the drug. The total amount  for 1993 was 223 kilograms.    The increase was indicative of a continuing flood of heroin  into the territory and more intensive police operations. Last  month, police recovered 96 blocks of heroin worth $50 million  from the seabed near Lamma Island. The 67-kilogram haul was the  biggest for two years. Despite a month-long nautical  surveillance operation no arrests have been made.    In early March, 33 kilograms of heroin were discovered in a  hut at Yuen Long.    There has also been an increase in the prevalence of the  drug  ""ice,"" a synthetic crystalline methamphetamine.    So far this year, 22 kilograms of ""ice"" has been seized,  more  than the total taken by police in the past two years. Last  year, drug-related arrests rose by 44 percent to 9,246. Deaths  linked to the abuse of narcotics jumped by 34 percent to 92.    Narcotics Bureau chief staff officer, Acting Chief  Superintendent Iain Grant, said the extra drugs seized did not  give police any reason for complacency. ""Obviously, if one  measures success by seizures and arrests, then we can say both  figures are up,"" Mr Grant said. ""But the other side is that  there appear to be more drugs on the streets. There is always  an element of luck in getting these results but a lot of it  boils down to good, old-fashioned police work.""    Mr Grant said police intelligence suggested Hong Kong was no  longer as popular a transit centre for drug deals but many  transactions were still locally brokered or financed. He said  he was particularly pleased with recent police efforts to  destroy drug-cutting centres where pure heroin is diluted for  extra profits and ease of consumption by addicts. In 1993, 30  such facilities were located and shut down. This year seven  have been identified.     "

After an exhaustive debate, the  Potosi Civic Committee board last night decided to demand that  the government investigates the violent incidents against  peasants. They also demand that legislators summon the Justice  and Peace Committee, and that the congressional human rights  committee send representatives to Potosi to investigate the  killings of two peasants. Moreover, people fear the fate of 11  peasants who have been reported missing.    In view of this, mourning has been decreed at the  departmental level and all activities have been suspended. The  Civic Committee also summoned all citizens to attend the funeral  procession today at 1600 at the general cemetery.    Peasant leaders also reported that peasants will march on  the  city.

Narcotics Police Division sources say they are David  Sylvester Foster, 29, a higgler, who died on December 9 at the  Aruba Hotel in Panama City, while preparing to catch a COPA  flight to Jamaica.    Autopsy report shows that he died from an overdose of  cocaine  after a packet in which he had ingested the drug burst in his  stomach.    The other victim has been identified as Yvette Tores, who  died at the airport in Panama City on December 16. She fell ill  as she was about to board a COPA flight for Jamaica and later  died.    She too died of cocaine overdose when the plastic wrapping  in  which she swallowed the cocaine burst and poisoned her system,  local Narcotics Police Division source said. Her body and that  of Mr. Foster are still in Panama.    And an autopsy done at the Cornwall Regional Hospital in  Montego Bay on December 22 on the body of Mrs. Sonia  Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover, revealed that she too  died of a cocaine overdose. When on December 9, she collapsed at  Sangster International Airport, Montego Bay, aboard SAM flight  506 on its arrival from San Andres, Colombia, five packets of  cocaine were found in her brassiere.    The post-mortem examination on Tuesday showed that she had  78  packets of cocaine in her stomach. Also, an empty plastic  wrapping was found in her stomach, indicating that it had come  loose and the cocaine in it had killed her.    Cocaine experts say that ""mules"" hired to smuggle cocaine  into Jamaica in their stomachs, usually swallow between 1 lb.  and 1 1/2 lb of the drug. Medical experts roughly estimate the  death-producing dose of cocaine to be 1.2 grams, but much  smaller doses have been known to cause fatalities. A gram is  roughly equivalent to the weight of a paper clip. When cocaine  is ingested it disrupts the heart rhythm and depresses the  respiratory centre, causing immediate death.     "

0,FT944-7095 ,"FT944-7095 _AN-EK0AOAA6FT 941126   FT  26 NOV 94 / Deaths mount as S African taxi drivers wage war      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   The killing of five people in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, yesterday during a shoot-out between South African police and warring minibus-taxi operators has added to a taxi-related death toll that has started to claim more lives than political violence. Despite calls for calm from the government and repeated attempts by Mr Mac Maharaj, transport minister, to broker truces between rival groups, fierce competition over lucrative routes around the country has resulted in an upsurge in violent confrontation, with hapless commuters caught in the crossfire. Police say that 200 people have been killed this year and more than 110 injured as a result of clashes between opposing taxi organisations, dubbed locally as 'taxi wars'. In large part this reflects the fact that taxi groupings are increasingly taking on criminal characteristics as shadowy operators hire hitmen to kill their rivals and destroy their vehicles. A report on the issue by the South African Police Services, submitted to parliament earlier this month, concludes that the situation is likely to deteriorate further unless there is an immediate clampdown on lawless elements in the industry. 'Taxi associations have developed a distinctive, Mafia-like character to reach economic objectives and to counter economic threats. They frequently strengthen their power bases by using armed units which have no qualms about using violence and committing murder,' the police report observes. The spark for this year's sudden surge in violence was the financial collapse of the South African Black Taxi Association in September 1993. Up to that point Sabta, which was formed in 1986, had been able to act as a loose umbrella for the industry's many regional associations. It had managed to sort out many conflicts internally. But even if an attempt, currently under way, to revive Sabta is successful, it leaves unresolved the underlying economic causes of the conflict. When the minibus industry started in the early 1980s it was hailed as an example of successful black entrepreneurship and by 1990 had managed to claim 44 per cent of the black commuter transport market. Since then the situation has changed drastically. Although no accurate figures of its size exits, analysts estimate that the industry is worth somewhere between R5bn and R8bn (Pounds 909m-Pounds 1.45bn) and employs more than 70,000 people as drivers and ancillary workers. However, since 1990 the number of taxis has continued to grow while the number of commuters has dropped slightly because of the recession. The result is a classic case of an overcrowded market: there are too many taxis and too few commuters. The obvious solution for the government is to impose strict regulation on the industry, curtailing the number of operators on big routes. However, Mr Maharaj is constrained by the fear of causing further job losses and concern that tighter regulation will merely increase the number of pirate taxis in operation. This would exacerbate the violence rather than help eliminate it.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Speaking at the ""Biotechnology and AIDS"" conference  currently  in progress in Florence, Aiuti stressed how these revelations  ""confirm the existence of the virus in Italy in the Seventies.""    In making his claim, Aiuti cited research by virologist  Ferdinando Dianzani and separate research by Carlo Baroni and  two other scientists, who performed biopsies on tissues from  living patients. Dianzani in his address at the conference did  not agree fully with Aiuti but stated that, according to his own  conclusions, the first death by AIDS in Italy occurred in 1978.    Also announced at the conference yesterday by Peter Piot of  the World Health Organization (WHO) was the start of first-stage  trials of an anti-AIDS vaccine within the month on 35 volunteers  from Brazil, Thailand and Uganda, under WHO auspices. The main  aim of the trials will be to determine the safety and the  effectiveness of the vaccine, chosen from a group of 12 possible  vaccines developed over the last few years.    Duke University immunologist Dani Bolognesi, speaking at the  conference, warned however that some of these latest candidate  vaccines, like many of their forerunners, have also come from  laboratory-produced strains and thus may not produce  substantially different results from those already known, and  may not have the same effects on human beings as on laboratory  animals.    Hopes are increasingly turning towards the positive signs  coming from studies into seropositives whose longevities are  longer than expected and whose high levels of anti-bodies, known  as CD-8 Lymphocytes, seem to have a neutralizing effect on the  HIV virus, which causes AIDS.    Bolognesi pointed out that researchers should be looking for  ways to imitate the natural resistance of these anti-bodies in  formulating the next stages of vaccine research.     "

The drug squad of the Vienna Security  Office pointed to this trend in 1984 for the first time.  However, this semi-legal drug trade is not interesting for the  criminal police: In view of the alarmingly rising heroin and  cocaine trade, the use of poppy heads to gain opiate-containing  substances can be neglected.    ""Poppy heads are no problem,"" Karl Lesiak of the Vienna  Security Office says. In particular not now when the Austrian  capital is being swamped with cheap and high-quality heroin.  Within the past two years, the price for one gram of heroin has  gone down from about 3,000 to 800 shillings. The decline in the  price of cocaine is obvious, but not yet as dramatic: One gram  now costs 1,200 to 1,500 schillings on average; two years ago  one could not buy it for less than 2,500 schillings.    Further Increase    In Vienna, the number of deaths from drugs rose from 94 in  1992 to 103 in 1993. This year justifies the fear of a further  increase: By the end of May 63 people had died of drugs. During  the same period in 1993 the number was 48.    According to Karl Lesiak, most deaths are due to heroin  overdoses. For three years one can observe a shift in the  consumption of opiates from poppy head tea and codeine to  high-quality heroin. The largest number of drug deaths are  still caused by the ""Vienna mixture"" (opiates, pharmaceuticals,  and alcohol), but the proportion of people who used heroin  exclusively is rising. With one restriction: As the Forensic  Institute in Vienna has found out in a comprehensive study,  heroin is more and more often diluted with the soporific  Rohypnol--probably without the knowledge of the consumers--which  intensifies the effect.    In the field of drug smuggling, an essential change has also  taken place for the police: Austria's eastern neighboring  countries are used as ""depot countries,"" the drugs are  increasingly brought to Austria in small amounts and at short  notice, depending on the demand.    The authorities have particular problems with the so-called  ""ant trade"" with Bratislava. Addicts ""import"" 50 to 500 grams  of the drugs themselves and finance the amounts they need for  themselves by partly selling off the rest. Taxi drivers are  also often used as drug couriers. At a salary of about 2,000  schillings, they bear the entire risk, police access to the  people behind them is becoming increasingly difficult.  Nevertheless, according to Lesiak, the amount of heroin and  cocaine seized this year has ""increased considerably.""     "

The Narcotics Bureau says the local drug market is now  choked  with heroin that is about 35 percent pure. Last month alone,  police confiscated 128 kilograms of the drug. The total amount  for 1993 was 223 kilograms.    The increase was indicative of a continuing flood of heroin  into the territory and more intensive police operations. Last  month, police recovered 96 blocks of heroin worth $50 million  from the seabed near Lamma Island. The 67-kilogram haul was the  biggest for two years. Despite a month-long nautical  surveillance operation no arrests have been made.    In early March, 33 kilograms of heroin were discovered in a  hut at Yuen Long.    There has also been an increase in the prevalence of the  drug  ""ice,"" a synthetic crystalline methamphetamine.    So far this year, 22 kilograms of ""ice"" has been seized,  more  than the total taken by police in the past two years. Last  year, drug-related arrests rose by 44 percent to 9,246. Deaths  linked to the abuse of narcotics jumped by 34 percent to 92.    Narcotics Bureau chief staff officer, Acting Chief  Superintendent Iain Grant, said the extra drugs seized did not  give police any reason for complacency. ""Obviously, if one  measures success by seizures and arrests, then we can say both  figures are up,"" Mr Grant said. ""But the other side is that  there appear to be more drugs on the streets. There is always  an element of luck in getting these results but a lot of it  boils down to good, old-fashioned police work.""    Mr Grant said police intelligence suggested Hong Kong was no  longer as popular a transit centre for drug deals but many  transactions were still locally brokered or financed. He said  he was particularly pleased with recent police efforts to  destroy drug-cutting centres where pure heroin is diluted for  extra profits and ease of consumption by addicts. In 1993, 30  such facilities were located and shut down. This year seven  have been identified.     "

The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) said in a  statement sent to AFP that the eight were killed after five  policemen were shot dead last Sunday by al-Jama'ah militants in  Sedfa, in the troubled southern province of Asyut.    The group said two militants were killed by police in  fields,  three died in a shootout in Balayza village in Asyut province,  and three others were arrested at home in the same region then  shot by police, who dumped their bodies next to the Balayza  victims, saying all six died in the same gunbattle.    The al-Jama'ah said police had adopted a new tactic of  releasing detained militants and ``liquidating'' them allegedly  for taking part in attacks.    It called on human rights organisations to put pressure on  the authorities ``to stop such practices.''    Islamic militants have targeted the security forces,  foreigners and Coptic Christians in their two-year campaign to  destabilise the country and topple the secular government of  President Husni Mubarak.

The carcass of an elephant was found in south Raidak on  Friday. Wildlife officials suspect it to be the fifth victim of  the disease.    The differences surfaced with the district veterinary  doctors  maintaining that no ""Bacillus anthraxcis"" could be  traced in the blood of the last three victims.    The wildlife officials were however, more than certain that  external symptoms showed evidence of the pachyderms being  affected with anthrax. Not satisfied with the findings of the  district veterinary doctors, they arranged to send blood samples  to Calcutta for re-examination.    The veterinary doctors' attempt to rule out an anthrax  attack  was not without reason. With signs of the disease still  spreading and taking its toll, there was an increasing  possibility of the doctors being criticized for having failed to  give advance warning.    The wildlife officials said that had there been the  slightest  indication of the disease, immunization programmes could have  been taken up in right earnest and the casualties could be  restricted.

The figures come as new evidence discloses serious  shortcomings in surgical practices in many hospitals. Hospitals  in Harrogate, Lancaster, and Eastbourne are among the riskiest,  with death rates from appendicitis and abdominal surgery more  than twice the average, while those in Chesterfield, Bradford  and Bromley are among the safest, with death rates less than a  quarter of the average.    Reasons for the variation are suggested by an investigation  into 2,700 deaths after operations in hospital, published  yesterday, which highlights dangerous practices by some surgeons  and ignorance of safety measures. The report by the National  Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (deaths within 30  days of an operation), says that too many operations are being  performed at night by unsupervised junior surgeons on very sick  patients. Hospitals that lack staff and equipment to care for  patients safely are failing to refer them to specialist centres.    The report is based on confidential questionnaires returned  by more than 1,000 surgeons and aneasthetists. A quarter of  those approached did not co-operate.

It  was more double the 245 deaths recorded in February and also the  fourth highest monthly death rate since the HRC began monitoring  politically related violence in 1990.    The HRC recorded 640 incidents of political violence,  compared with February's figure of 361. Nearly half of this  year's total of 1,529 incidents took place in March.    The death toll in Natal in March increased by 73 percent to  311 deaths compared to February. This was ""the most concerning  element of this months' figure as it is the only region in which  high levels of ongoing violence are occuring"", the report said.    The HRC recorded 4,139 deaths since the election date was  announced in July 1993 and 13,464 deaths since July 1990.    The number of injuries has increased more than three times  from 302 in February to 1,053 in March.    The 643 political arrests were made in March. This was the  highest number of arrests during the past 18 months, excluding  August 1993. The figure was inflated by the arrest of 405  prison warders taking part in an illegal gathering, the report  said.    The Bophuthatswana uprising, the Zulu royalist march through  Johannesburg on March 28 and prisoners' protests contributed to  the high figures, according to the report.     "

The NAD's [narcotics squads] seized 15,000 XTC [ecstasy]  tablets and 3,000 LSD stamps -- substances which were  practically absent from the market in previous years. Synthetic  drugs are in fact cheaper (a tablet costs between 50,000 and  80,000 lire [L], compared to L120,000-150,000 for a heroin  dose). According to the ""carabinieri,"" the increase in the use  of synthetic drugs explains the reduction in the number of  deaths from overdose, which dropped from 1,217 in 1992 to 840 in  1993. Furthermore, the NAD's determined that most of the drugs  came from the Netherlands and their price, at the source, was in  the region of L2,000-3,000. Milan, Genoa, Verona, and Rome are  the major distribution centers.    Yesterday the NAD's exposed a Milan woman doctor who had  been  issuing morphine prescriptions -- in the form of hydrochloride  syrup -- to 35 drug addicts, many of whom had criminal records.  The prescriptions were made out in the name of a person who had  died some time before. Over a three-year period, from 1990 to  1992, she signed 1,600 prescriptions for as many bottles. This  doctor's case is not an isolated one: In the course of the  police operation, more than 1,000 people were arrested,  including 11 medical doctors; 1,584 people were arrested and  subsequently released on bail (including 357 doctors and  chemists); and 598 kilograms of drugs were seized.

By the end of February, legislation assented to last  December  which would repeal Section 29 of the ISA, had still not been  brought into effect.  Detention Without Trial    During February extensive use was made of detention powers  under the ISA, using both Section 29 (on 54 persons) and Section  50 (on 18 persons).    At month end, 30 persons were still being held in detention  without trial.    Deaths in Police Custody    During February, 3 deaths in police custody were reported.    Political Trials    During February, another 13 political trials were completed,  none resulting in jail sentences.    At month end, 55 trials were ongoing involving 548 accused,  nearly half of them in Bophuthatswana    Death Row    Four persons were given death sentences in February. Death  row now has 330 occupants.    Repression of Gatherings and Political Activity    Extensive interference in political activity related to the  forthcoming elections was perpetrated by Bophuthatswana security  forces.    An ANC march in Standerton was banned and broken up see HRC  [Human Rights Commission] Election Watch No.2 for interference  in freedom of political activity in February.    Political Violence    General Comment    February recorded the seventh successive month of decline in  political violence as measured by deathtoll. Average daily  death toll dipped below 9 this month and seems head back to the  level of 6 per day which was prevalent this time last year, and  a far cry from the level of 20 per day during last July.    Incidents of Violence    During February, HRC recorded 361 incidents of political  violence, appreciably down from the 509 of January and from the  464 average of last year.    Deaths and Injuries     The February deathtoll of 245 is significantly down from the  January figure of 328 and reconfirms the strong downward trend  in political violence.    There has been a 60 percent drop since the July peak. The  injury count for February was 302, higher than January, but  below last year's average.    Major Massacres    Two major massacres (10 or more deaths) were recorded in  February, both of them in the Midlands sub-region of Natal:    On the 6th February, 12 ANC supporters were killed at  Masunkazane (Richmond)    On the 18th February, 15 ANC supporters were killed at  Mahlele (Creighton)  Regional Analysis    The PWV deathtoll recorded a dramatic drop to 69 in  February,  compared with 142 in January and vindicated the replacement of  the Internal Stability Unit of the SAP [South African Police] by  units of the SA Defence Force as the primary peacekeeping force  in the area. The PWV region seems now to be well on its way to  being stabilised, but sub regions which are still unsettled are  West Rand, Alexandra, Vaal and of course the East Rand which  accounted for 62 percent of PWV deaths in February.    Natal is now strongly centre-stage in the political violence  with 66 percent of the countrywide deaths in February. The  provisional figure of 161 deaths is nevertheless a little lower  than any figure during the last eight months.    Other regions accounted for 15 deaths, or 6 percent of  national total.    Some Components of the Violence    Security force actions resulted in fewer deaths in February  (7 against 11 in January) but in the high number of 105 injuries  due to the use of rubber bullets and birdshot during incidents  at Standerton and Primrose gold mine.    Attacks on security forces declined noticeably in February,  result in 6 deaths and 16 injuries in the course of 30 incidents.    Right wing activity continues to mount and was responsible  for 2 deaths and 17 injuries in 31 incidents.    Taxi conflict claimed 5 lives in February.    A number of incidents of industrial and education conflict  occurred, but caused no loss of life.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Incidents         |Deaths            |Injuries          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |General Incidents |253               |225               |148               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Security Force Ac-|26                |7                 |105               |  |tion              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Attacks Against S-|30                |6                 |16                |  |ecurity Forces    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hit Squad Activity|1                 |--                |--                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Right Wing Activi-|31                |2                 |17                |  |ty                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Taxi Conflict     |12                |5                 |15                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial Confli-|6                 |--                |1                 |  |ct                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Educational Confl-|2                 |--                |--                |  |ict               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total             |361               |245               |302               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Some Victims of the Violence    Commuters suffered 9 deaths and 2 injuries in February.

In its monthly report the HRC said violence in  KwaZulu/Natal had continued to drop, with the May death toll of  104 the lowest recorded since January 1993.    Despite ongoing tensions in the area, the declining death  toll supported the HRC's repeated calls for the lifting of the  state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal, the HRC said. The 195  deaths in May were considerably lower than the 1994 monthly  average of 365 and the 1993 monthly average of 367.    There were 73 deaths in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging], 104 in Natal, and 18 elsewhere, bringing the year  total to 1,826.    Of the 195 victims, ten were women and five children. Two  white civilians were among those killed in May.    The 226 incidents of violence in May represented a 65  percent  decrease from the April figure of 649. This low level of  violence had not been experienced since January 1993, the HRC  said.    Only one ""major massacre"" took place in May -- the  execution-style killing of 12 people in Thokoza, linked to  fighting between Self-Defence Units in Katlehong.    The right wing, with no deaths attributed to it in May,  appeared to have been neutralised after it caused 24 deaths and  184 injuries during its bombing campaign in April.    Taxi violence, with 14 deaths, increased for the third month  in succession.    On human rights, the HRC recorded declining figures in  detentions without trial, deaths in police custody and political  arrests.    It reported as a violation of the freedom of assembly the  order circulated by Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba banning  civil servants in the province from going on strike.     "

The secretive government cell  has been called in to refute rumours that renegade soldiers were  involved in the massacre of 24 Taiwan tourists in Zhejiang  province.    The Ministry of Public Security unit, which is believed to  have been set up after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989,  has never been officially acknowledged, except, by necessity, in  confidential international police work. Revealing the unit in  connection with the boat tragedy apparently reflects the  seriousness with which Beijing is treating the incident, which  brought cross-straits relations to their lowest point since the  late 1980s.    He Ting, head of the unit, answered reporters' questions in  Hangzhou on Monday. He said there was no evidence of army  accomplices in the tragedy on Qiandao Lake on March 31. ""This  case is 100 percent without any military involvement,"" he said.    A total of nine mainland experts, two of them from the  Ministry of Public Security in Beijing, are testifying in the  trial of four suspects in the incident.    He Ting's first public appearance has become something of a  sideshow, with reporters plying him with questions on everything  from international terrorist groups based in China to attempts  on the lives of senior Chinese leaders. The antiterrorist unit  is also in charge of investigating aircraft hijackings.  According to a report in Ming Pao, one of He Ting's first  assignments as antiterrorism chief in 1989 was to investigate  and handle the extradition from Japan of a Hebei Province man  who claimed political asylum after hijacking a mainland plane to  Japan.    In the five years since then, he has earned a reputation for  taking a hands-on approach. This included taking charge of an  armed assault on the hideaway of a gang of heavily-armed bandits  in the Shanxi capital, Taiyuan.     "

Deaths from AIDS in the capital already account for an  absolute majority of all deaths caused by reportable diseases,  surpassing tuberculosis, meningitis, and schistosomiasis. Now  AIDS is also ahead of traffic deaths. It is surpassed only by  homicides. The survey was made by the Municipal Funeral Service.    Experts used death certificates from April through June of  last year for the survey. During that period, reportable  diseases were responsible for 940 deaths. Of that number, 684  were attributed to AIDS, 147 to tuberculosis, 60 to meningitis,  21 to meningococcal meningitis, 15 to schistosomiasis, seven to  leptospirosis, and four to Hansen's disease. Tetanus and cholera  caused one death each.    In a comparative survey, the study shows that while AIDS  killed 684 persons, homicides were responsible for 991 deaths,  traffic accidents 447, other accidents 383, and suicides and  self-inflicted injuries 98. Other external causes were  responsible for 182 deaths.    Although concerned by the percentage increase in deaths due  to AIDS, which rose from 3.5 percent in 1991 to 4.1 percent in  1993, the Funeral Service notes that as far as general mortality  is concerned, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of  death: 36 percent of Sao Paulo City's residents die of heart  disease, 15 percent die of cancer, and about 14 percent die of  diseases of the respiratory tract. In fourth place are deaths  due to external causes, which include homicide and accidents and  are responsible for approximately 10 percent of all deaths.    The report says that there is still a great deal of  prejudice  regarding AIDS -- so much so that 15 percent of the cases are  discovered only after investigation based on the death  certificate. This is because the physician, generally at the  request of the family, reports the cause of death as an  opportunistic infection rather than AIDS. Epidemiologists, made  suspicious by the fact that a person died in his or her  productive years, contact the physician and then confirm that it  was in fact an AIDS case.     "

The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, through its embassy here,  held the Khmer Rouge guerrillas accountable for the massacre.    The Embassy's open letter, received here recently, said an  armed group of the Khmer Rouge stopped the fishing boat  belonging to Le Van Tuong, 80, and his son Le Van Thanh, 20, who  were claimed to have lived here for a very long time.    The guerrillas were reported to have abducted the two  Vietnamese and beaten them to death on the heads with rowing  oars.    The dead bodies were found afloat in the river recently by  the bereaved family who were searching for the missing members,  according to the Embassy.    The Embassy has criticised the local police for delaying  further investigation when informed by a representative of the  Vietnamese immigrants.    The Embassy also said another four Vietnamese residents were  missing recently and their names and whereabouts have not been  verified yet.    The Vietnamese government looks forward to assistance from  the Royal Government in investigating and taking effective  measures to prevent the recurrence of the incident.    As far as illegal immigration is concerned a number of  newspapers here strongly condemned the Vietnamese government for  what they call encouraging Vietnamese migration to this country,  while the Royal Government has not been able to tackle the  problems of mismanagement and loose administrations within the  concerned authorities.    The newspaper SAKOL recently said ""the influx of Vietnamese  immigrants into this country reveals the long-term objective of  the late communist hardliner `Ho Chi Minh' who wished to annex  and swallow Cambodia two decades ago"".    ""There are new Vietnamese squatters at Chrang Chamres, near  Monivong Bridge, who cannot speak a word in the Khmer language,""  the paper reported.    The paper accused the Royal Government of being indifferent  to the increasing number of illegal immigrants.    However, the Royal Government has managed to resolve some of  these immigration problems.    Reports from Takeo Province said about 50 armed Vietnamese  people have agreed to withdraw from Boreicholasa District where  they came from and did farming without the knowledge or  permission of the host district governor.    Previously, they illegally encroached on the nation's  territory 70 metres deep and 1,500 metres long for rice farming.    After several rounds of negotiations, the two governors of  Takeo-Cambodia and An Giang-Vietnam finally reached a solution.    It should be noted that the National Assembly has already  adopted the Immigration Law but the implementation is rather  slow.     "

Scientists at the Cancer Research Campaign's epidemiology unit in Oxford found that the exodus of more than 1m children from London and other big cities during the second world war resulted in a significant increase in leukaemia in rural Britain. Deaths from the disease in the four years after the war were 47 per cent higher in rural areas that received the largest numbers of urban evacuees. CRC researchers believe that 'population mixing' during the war exposed rural children to city children carrying the unknown infection - probably a virus.

[sentence as received]    A recent report by the Ministry of Health has showed an  alarming rise in mortality rate among Iraqi people, and in  particular among children over the past month of April (three  and a half years after the imposition of the embargo) in  camparison with mortality rate recorded during the same period  in 1989 (a year before the imposition of the embargo).    The report blamed the rise in mortality rate to the dearth  of  food and medicine because of the UN-imposed trade sanctions on  Iraq.    As usual, children are hit hardest by the sanctions.  According to the report some 3,119 children under the age of  five perished because of diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition  related diseases in comparison with some 347 children died over  the same period in 1989.    The Ministry's report attributed the rise in fatalities  among  children to acute shortages of food and medicine because of the  trade sanctions and shortages of clean potable water and  breakdown of a number of water-treatment plants in some parts of  the country due to the bombing by U.S.-allies aircraft during  the war and lack of spare parts for maintenance and repair work.    The Ministry's report noted that during April, 1989, a year  before the imposition of the sanctions, the number of children  struck by malnutrition related diseases was 71, whereas the  number of children fatalities over the same period 1994 reached  some 1,146 scoring an almost a 1,514 per cent increase.    Moreover, the report showed that diarrhea has claimed the  lives of 122 children under the age of five over the month of  April 1989 in comparison with some 940 deaths recorded during  the same period in 1994, that is some 670.5 per cent increase.    Likewise, the number of children fatalities because of  penumonia during April 1994 recorded a sharp increase of 570.8  per cent, the report pointed out, indicating that the number of  deaths registered during April 1989 was 154 in comparison with  some 1,033 deaths for the same period in 1994.    As for patients who suffer from chronic disease, the report  noted that hypertension, diabetes and malignant neoplasms were  the main causes of the death of 1,455 compared with some 454  deaths registered over the same period in 1989.    According to the Ministry's report, some 105 people died  because of hypertension over the month of April, 1989 in  comparison with 401 who died over the same period in 1994,  recording an increase of 281.9 per cent over 1989's figure.    In the meantime, fatalities caused by diabetes have  registered a sharp rise in April 1994, said the report, noting  that some 272 people have died over the month of April 1994  compared with some 92 ones for the same period in 1989, scoring  an increase of 195.65 per cent over 1989's figure.    According to the report, some 783 people who suffer from  malignant neoplames have died during April 1994 compared with  some 257 ones died over the same period in 1989.    The cause of the sharp rise in deaths among patients who  suffer from cancer is blamed on the inadequate radio therapy  received by the patients as a result of dearth of medicine  caused by the embargo.    According to an earlier report by the nuclear and  radioactive  therapy hospital, the hospital's departments face sharp  shortages of chemical and hormone medicines.    The absence of cobalt radioactive element needed for the  treatment of malignant tumours has hit plans to care for people  in bad need for radio therapy.     "

Provincial medical officer Dr. Godfrey Chishimba said 978  cases of measles had been recorded and the death toll could be  higher because some occurred in remote areas without the  knowledge of health personnel.    Dr. Chishimba said most of the deaths occurred between  January and September in nine places under chiefs Kambombo,  Tembwe, Chibale, Mulilo and Chikwa.    A team of medical staff had been sent to the affected areas  to immunise people against the killer disease and that another  group will soon go there to carry out another round of  immunisation.    Dr. Chishimba who complained of erratic supply of drugs to  the province to contain the disease said the situation was under  control.    But reports reaching Chipata from Chama say there is a fresh  outbreak of the disease and more people are dying especially in  Chief Kambombo's area.    [Passage omitted]      "

""It's like a time bomb,"" San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice said. ""One day the  chases will result in some innocent adults or children being killed on the  streets of our city.""    Last month, 10 people were injured after they jumped from a van that Border  Patrol agents were chasing on Interstate 5 in San Clemente. The chase began  when the van's driver sped off while he was being questioned at the checkpoint.      16-Lane Checkpoint Proposed    The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, which runs the checkpoint  near the San Onofre nuclear power plant, proposed three years ago that it be  moved 5 miles south, into San Diego County. The new checkpoint would be  expanded into 16 lanes (the existing checkpoint has four lanes), both to  facilitate traffic on northbound Interstate 5 and to reduce opportunities for  illegal immigrants to evade arrest.    The proposal has the backing of Sen. Pete Wilson (R-San Diego) and Rep. Ron  Packard (R-Carlsbad). The Defense Department, which owns the Camp Pendleton  Marine Corps base, the site of both the present and proposed checkpoints, also  approves of the change, according to Packard's office.    But action has lagged in Congress, mainly because of the $30-million cost of  the project, Packard said last week.    ""It's hard to get money authorized because of the tight budget situations,""  Packard said. But the cost is justified, he said, because the new checkpoint  might save lives as well as aid the government's efforts to stop illegal  immigration and drug smuggling.      Up to 10 Deaths Last Year    Charles Geer, patrol agent in charge of the checkpoint, said that he had no  exact statistics on fatal accidents at the site but that ""about eight to 10""  people have been killed there in the last year.    San Clemente Fire Department paramedics, who respond to such accidents, said  the victims usually are illegal immigrants who jump from vehicles stopped at  the checkpoint and are struck as they dart into southbound traffic on the San  Diego Freeway.    In addition, Geer said, some motorists fail to slow down in time at the  existing checkpoint and slam into the line of stopped vehicles.    ""There would be a minimum traffic backup,"" Geer said, referring to the  multilane design of the proposed new checkpoint. And the chances for high-speed  chases running into San Clemente would be reduced at the new location, he said.    ""I think a new checkpoint would help our situation,"" San Clemente Police Chief  Al Ehlow said. ""The configuration makes it more difficult for a high-speed  chase to begin. Then, too, if a chase were to start, the new checkpoint would  be five miles farther south from San Clemente, giving them more time to head  off the suspects before they got to our city. We've had problems with those  chases for many years.""    Packard said he has pushed the safety angle in trying to drum up congressional  support for a new checkpoint. At one time, he said, the relocation proposal  seemed to have broad support in Congress.    ""But now it seems to be in limbo,"" Packard said.    Last year, Packard and Wilson succeeded in getting $2.7 million earmarked for  engineering and design studies. But at the last minute, a congressional  conference committee deleted the designation, and money was spent elsewhere.      'Back to Square Zero'    ""Now we're back to square zero,"" Packard said. ""Sen. Wilson and I are now  hoping we can get the funding for the checkpoint inserted into one of the  anti-drug bills. If not, I'll try to get the funding into a highway  appropriation bill.""    The checkpoint near San Clemente is the busiest in the nation, according to the  INS. In 1988, agents there captured 54,678 deportable illegal immigrants and  arrested another 800 who were involved in smuggling operations, according to  Packard's office.    The checkpoint also recovered stolen property -- including cars and items  burglarized from homes -- valued at more than $2 million last year. A total of  128 narcotics seizures were made.

Environment Minister Konstandinos Laliotis, a senior deputy  of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, yesterday  expressed support for the controlled distribution of drug  substitutes such as methadone as part of a comprehensive  rehabilitation programme.    His remarks during a radio interview found support from  party  officials across the political spectrum. A major overhaul of  drug policies and their enforcement is expected to be announced  next week.    Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis, meanwhile, has issued  a  directive to all prison officials banning the granting of prison  leave to convicted drug dealers. It was prompted after drug  kingpin Adem Huseinoglu, serving a 22-year sentence in Patras,  failed to return after a five-day leave.    The recent heroin deaths have shocked Greeks, with surveys  showing there are an estimated 400,000 users of hard drugs in  Greece.     "

The riot took place in Penitenciaria de Occidente, located  in  Santa Ana, 68 km west of San Salvador. The commotion among the  inmates broke out Wednesday night with two dead initially. The  situation was aggravated yesterday morning when the resident  inmates rejected the presence of others who had been transferred  from Gotera Prison in the east, where they had participated in a  massacre last November.    It was reported that the Occidente inmates demanded the  retransfer of the rioters, who caused the deaths of two of their  group on Wednesday night. After the riot ended last night with  the mediation of the UN Observer Mission in El Salvador, Onusal,  prison system director Rodolfo Garay Pineda reported nine dead,  six of whom had been beheaded by the old Santa Ana inmates.    The riot concluded after negotiations were held to  retransfer  the dangerous inmates and after inmate committees cooperated by  agreeing to surrender the knives and ice picks used in the riot.     "

The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) said in a  statement sent to AFP that the eight were killed after five  policemen were shot dead last Sunday by al-Jama'ah militants in  Sedfa, in the troubled southern province of Asyut.    The group said two militants were killed by police in  fields,  three died in a shootout in Balayza village in Asyut province,  and three others were arrested at home in the same region then  shot by police, who dumped their bodies next to the Balayza  victims, saying all six died in the same gunbattle.    The al-Jama'ah said police had adopted a new tactic of  releasing detained militants and ""liquidating"" them allegedly  for taking part in attacks.    It called on human rights organisations to put pressure on  the authorities ""to stop such practices.""    Islamic militants have targeted the security forces,  foreigners and Coptic Christians in their two-year campaign to  destabilise the country and topple the secular government of  President Husni Mubarak.

Amnesty lists 415 deaths as a result of police brutality between 1985 and November 1990, but says the true number is likely to be higher. In its report - India: Torture, Rape and Deaths in Custody - Amnesty says that in only three cases listed were police convicted of the use of torture, and in only 42 cases were judicial inquiries ordered. 'A major cause of the persistence of widespread torture in India', the report says, 'is the failure or unwillingness of leading government officials and representatives to acknowledge that torture even exists, let alone that it needs to be vigorously tackled.' In an effort to arouse public opinion and press the government into action, Amnesty is distributing 5,000 copies of the report to prominent Indians, and calling on Indians to write to the prime minister and the home minister. Amnesty's campaign comes at a embarrassing time for the government, because of the country's dependence on bilateral and multilateral aid, and because donor nations are increasingly linking aid to respect for human rights. The government yesterday accused Amnesty of having launched an anti-India campaign. The report says the use of torture has been most systematic in Kashmir, the Punjab and Assam, where the government faces armed opposition. Otherwise, it says the main victims of police brutality are the poor or minority groups - untouchables, tribal people, and Moslems.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

This is the sad result of a weekend of clashes between  Tutsis and Hutus in the capital, Bujumbura. Burundi has not  come out of the infernal cycle of violence and reprisals, and  people are living in fear. Jean-Michel Mostaert reports:    [Mostaert] Everything started on Saturday [19 March] morning  with a grenade attack on a bus in the district of Rusaka, east  of Bujumbura. Four passengers were killed. All were members of  the Tutsi community. Immediately, the Tutsis wanted revenge;  they attacked members of the Hutu community, while Tutsis were  victims of reprisals in the areas with a Hutu majority.    These fresh interethnic clashes are reported to have led to  scores of deaths, maybe 100. They reveal the tense atmosphere  which is continuing in Burundi almost five months after the  abortive military coup of October, when almost 100,000 people  were killed in interethnic violence. Since then, the  authorities have not managed to restore a minimum of trust  between the two communities. On the contrary; in the capital,  Bujumbura, Tutsis and Hutus now live entrenched in their  districts. Many are armed and the slightest incident leads to  bloody reprisals.    The government seems to be powerless. It is divided on  whether to disarm people or not. A UN mission is to arrive in  Burundi tomorrow. It will investigate the situation in the  country. It will only be able to see the drift of Burundi,  which is sinking deeper and deeper into chaos.     "

A representative of Swansea Cork Ferries said the Celtic Pride, owned by the Polish Baltic Shipping Company, would stay in service over the weekend to cater for hundreds of already-booked passengers, but without 95 of its cabins and 210 berths. The two children, Katherine and James Tomlins, of Truro, Cornwall, died in the night aboard the Polish-registered Celtic Pride when gases seeped into their cabin from the ferry's sewerage system. Since the accident, other people who have travelled on the vessel have said they had previously complained to Swansea Cork Ferries, the operator, about strong sewage smells in some cabins. Yesterday the vessel arrived in Swansea to be met by marine surveyors from the Department of Transport and was temporarily held for examination. Afterwards, the British, Irish and Polish authorities agreed that it could remain in service provided the operators made modifications to the sewerage system and sealed off the affected cabins in the meantime. The Department of Transport yesterday issued advice to other ferry companies operating in UK waters advising them to check that their vessels' sewerage systems had adequate venting. The department said it had no plans for an investigation into the accident. It said that was a matter for the Polish authorities. The lack of an investigation has caused concern on both sides of the Irish Sea. In Britain, Ms Joan Whalley, who speaks for the opposition on transport, urged an inquiry by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

They were trying to go to the United  States.    On the morning of 28 January, a group of five who reached  land in the vicinity of Nuevitas explained that they had wrecked  off the north coast.    The rapid mobilization of vessels of the Border Guard Troops  and other institutions permitted us to rescue another five  people, two of whom had to be hospitalized quickly. An infant  just a few months old was also hospitalized, and his life is in  danger.    The individuals who risked their lives and those of innocent  children were attracted by the criminal propaganda from the  United States that encourages them; now, in addition to whatever  legal responsibilities may befall them, they will have on their  consciences the tragic results of their actions.    This is the result of the work of those in the United States  who are doing everything possible to encourage an illegal exodus  and who welcome as heroes those who, risking their lives, take  to the sea -- while the U.S. authorities apply an ever more  restrictive policy in granting visas to people who take steps to  travel legally.    It has also just been reaffirmed in Havana that the United  States has repeatedly failed to comply, by a big margin, with  the agreement signed with Cuba in 1984 under which they were  supposed to authorize the legal immigration of up to 20,000  people each year. Therefore, Washington must shoulder its share  of responsibility for incidents such as this.     "

A survey conducted by the Regional Health Administration  between 1989 and 1993 indicates that 32 percent of ward  admissions are due to malaria infection while the Out-Patient  Department (OPD) admissions account for 52.3 percent.    This was made known by Dr. Sylvester Anemana, acting  Regional  Director of Health Services at the launching of the Regional  Malaria Control Programme at Tamale yesterday.    He said inadequate medical staff is a major constraint in  the  control of malaria.    He explained that the cash and carry system is also making  some districts not to sustain regular drug supply while there is  irrational drug prescription resulting in drug abuse by chemical  sellers.    Dr. Anemana said a regional plan of action to address the  situation would include in-service training for staff towards  proper diagnosis and treatment of malaria, provision of  equipment and raising of the capital base of districts for more  effective drug supply.    Dr. Anemana said public health education is to be  intensified  and under a pilot project, impregnated bed-nets are to be used  as a measure to protect the individual from mosquito bites. If  it proves successful, it would be extended to other districts.    Mr. Gilbert Iddi, Deputy Regional Minister of Agriculture  who  was the guest speaker expressed regret that health care delivery  only reaches about 30 percent of the population in the Northern  Region.    Mr. Baba Ibrahima, Tamale Municipal Secretary, urged the  health staff to devote time and energy in educating the people  to adopt preventive measures against malaria attacks.      "
0,FT934-14234 ,"FT934-14234 _AN-DJRDWADLFT 931018   FT  18 OCT 93 / Deaths threaten rival to Zovirax      By PAUL ABRAHAMS and EMIKO TERAZONO      LONDON, TOKYO   SUPPLIES of Usevir, the only licensed effective competitor in the world to Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes and shingles treatment, have been halted in Japan following three deaths among patients. The development is a severe blow to Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US pharmaceuticals group which in 1989 acquired the global marketing rights for the drug, excluding Japan. Usevir, also known as Bvarau, was only launched on September 3. Industry analysts expect the medicine to be withdrawn completely from the Japanese market. The medicine has reached late-stage clinical trials in the US and is one of the most important compound drugs in Bristol-Myers Squibb's pipeline. The company believed the drug was capable of generating revenues of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) by the late 1990s. The group urgently needs new products because the US patents of the heart-drug Capoten, its top-selling medicine with revenues of Dollars 1.6bn, expire in 1995. The Japanese company with marketing rights to Usevir is Nippon Shoji, the Osaka-based pharmaceuticals wholesaling group. The rights were acquired from Yamasa Shoyu, a small Japanese company which invented Usevir. Nippon Shoji had hoped to gain a significant share of Japan's Y25bn (Pounds 156m) shingles market, currently dominated by Zovirax. The deaths in Japan are understood to have been caused by simultaneous use of Usevir with an anti-cancer agent called fluorouracil. The drug's packaging warns against use with certain anti-cancer agents. The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry has ordered Nippon Shoji to dispatch emergency instructions to medical institutions warning against the use of the drug with fluorouracil, prescribing the drug to patients who have been treated for cancer, and prescribing the drug to patients taking medication which cannot be confirmed. Nippon Shoji has also sent staff to warn of the dangers of the side effects. Wellcome's Zovirax has been used for more than 10 years and has an excellent safety record.

Confirming the outbreak of the disease yesterday, the Elgeyo  Marakwet Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Koech, said three  people died in Kapkosom sub-Location, five in Molol sub-Location  and three at Kocholwa.    Dr. Koech said two people were admitted at Plateau Mission  Hospital in Uasin Gishu District. He appealed for calm among  wananchi because the disease was under control.    Dr. Koech said a team of medical personnel from Iten  District  Hospital had been sent to immunise the people in the area and  urged wananchi to go for immunisation at Kocholwa Trading  Centre. The immunisation exercise will take four days.    The outbreak of meningitis was last reported in Kisii in  early October last year when it killed four people from one  family at Riangoncho village. Several other people including  school children were admitted to hospital for treatment.    Earlier in September, three school children were reported to  have died following an outbreak of meningitis in Soi, Elgeyo  Marakwet District. Six other children were admitted to Plateau  Mission Hospital for treatment.    At the time, Dr. Koech said the children who died from the  disease were aged between three and nine and that he had toured  the area and made sure that public health officers took  preventive measures.    A vaccination campaign was carried out and Dr. Koech said  public health experts would keep the situation under constant  surveillance to curb further spread of the disease.    Earlier last year, a massive yellow fever vaccination drive  was conducted in the area and neighbouring Baringo where more  than 500,000 people were given the jabs.    [Passage omitted]      "

""I fully understand that to heal the wounds is a very  difficult task, but I will do my best,"" Li said while meeting a  group of families whose relatives were killed during the  incident.    It is still unknown how many people were killed in the  incident, which Li said was triggered by a misunderstanding  between native Taiwanese and Chinese who had fled communist rule.    According to an estimate by an ad hoc committee formed by  the  Executive Yuan to deal with fallout from the incident, between  18,000 to 28,000 people -- mostly Taiwanese -- were killed.    Li said the incident was indeed a ""tragedy"" that he  regretted. But he stressed that the government has been active  in recent years in trying to soothe the spirits of the deceased  and compensate their families, pointing to the building of a  monument commemorating the victims and the appointment of a  special task force to handle related affairs.    Li promised to lead a memorial service when the monument is  completed next year.    Prof. Lin Tsung-yi, who represents families of the victims  on  the Executive Yuan's special committee, gave a positive  appraisal of what the government has done to assuage the  families, and thanked Li for the concern he has shown.    Li also guaranteed that he would push for passage of a bill  regarding compensation to the victims' families. The bill had  passed a first reading at the legislature, but was shelved when  the families demanded more money.

The first two fatalities, for which no further data was  provided, were confirmed while the local health authorities are  already on the verge of desperation because the promised  equipment and insecticides have not arrived from La Paz to carry  out a new fumigation campaign against the mosquito that  transmits the virus.    Meanwhile, according to new reports collected by local radio  stations, there are high rates of incidence of malaria in the  communities of Puerto Rico, Nueva Esperanza, and Santa Rosa de  Abuna, with the affected provinces being Manuripi, Abuna,  Federico Roman, and Madre de Dios.    Pando Health Unit Director Juan Cayoja reported that a  commission from the National Health Secretariat is expected to  arrive within the next few days, and will bring a new  insecticide that the rural fumigation brigades will use.    It is precisely the lack of that insecticide--to replace the  old DDT which is no longer used because it damages the  ecosystem--that was blamed in early October as the reason for  the suspension of the fumigation activities, which resulted in  the malaria outbreak.    Now the insecticide INCON will be used, which does not  damage  the environment, Cayoja said.    He added that in addition to the two deaths, approximately  one thousand people throughout the department are infected with  malaria, and more deaths are feared from lack of resources to  assist them in a timely fashion.    Cases of malaria have also appeared in the poorer  neighborhoods of Cobija, inhabited primarily by farmers.    According to Cayoja, the health alert will be in effect  during the entire rainy season, which recently began.     "

AND NOVEMBER IS THE BEST TIME  TO GET THE SHOT.      By DR. T. FRANKLIN WILLIAMS, T. Franklin Williams, a geriatrics physician, is  director of the National Institute on Aging, one of the 13 institutes that  comprise the National Institutes of Health of the Department of Health and  Human Services. This article was distributed by the Associated Press.      BETHESDA, Md.      The old adage ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds true for  the flu.    Each winter millions of Americans suffer the fever, aches and pains of  influenza. Most recover from the effects in a week or so, but for many older  people the flu and its complications are extremely serious.    While the body's immune system is busy fighting the flu, a person is less able  to resist pneumonia, another life-threatening infection. Older people and those  with chronic diseases such as heart disease, emphysema, asthma and diabetes  have the greatest risk of developing pneumonia along with the flu.    And older people are more likely to require hospitalization. Flu and pneumonia  combined are the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and 80% to  90% of the deaths are in people 65 and older.    But flu and its complications need not be deadly, and can be prevented by  vaccinating high-risk individuals six to eight weeks before the season begins.    Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Flu  travels quickly, especially during winter in crowded indoor places like malls,  grocery stores, theaters and hospitals. When someone with the flu coughs or  sneezes, droplets containing particles of the virus spread to others.    After infection, symptoms usually appear in two to four days; the disease  continues to be contagious for another three to four days.    Once the virus enters the body, it multiplies and causes a variety of  well-known complaints, including chills and fever, headache, runny nose, sore  throat and a dry cough. Extreme weakness and muscle aches and pains often last  for several days. If the virus invades the lungs, viral pneumonia can develop.    To prevent the flu, people 65 and older and residents of nursing homes and  other chronic-care facilities should be vaccinated. Also, health professionals,  nursing home workers and family members who live with someone older than 65  should get a flu shot to avoid spreading the disease to those at risk.    Unlike other viruses, the flu virus changes from time to time. Because  different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each season, a new vaccine is  prepared every year. It contains strains of the flu virus recently circulating  worldwide and believed likely to hit during the coming winter. Nicknames such  as the ""Spanish flu"" and ""Hong Kong flu"" refer to places where large outbreaks  of new flu strains have first appeared.    The vaccine is made from highly purified, killed viruses. Because the flu shot  does not contain infectious viruses, it does not cause the flu. The most common  side effect is a sore arm, which occurs in less than one-third of those  vaccinated and usually lasts only a day or so. A few people also may develop a  brief low-grade fever and some minor aches and pains, which begin six to 12  hours after vaccination and can persist for one or two days.    If a person has no special reason not to take aspirin, low doses (such as one  tablet every three to four hours) usually will relieve these symptoms.    Immediate allergic reactions, such as hives, rarely occur after influenza  vaccination. Anyone allergic to eggs, which are used to grow the virus for the  vaccine, should not receive the vaccine, as some egg protein may be present.    Because the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work, the best time to be  vaccinated is in November. A vaccine also is available against the most common  types of bacteria that cause pneumonia. The flu shot can be given at the same  time as the pneumonia vaccine without increasing the side effects. The flu shot  must be given every year, but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once.    In addition to the flu shot, an antiviral drug -- amantadine -- can prevent  infection by certain strains. The drug is useful for people who have not had  the vaccine or as extra protection for those who have been immunized.    When taken soon after the early signs are felt, amantadine reduces the duration  of fever and other symptoms. It also can prevent infection if taken during the  entire four- to six-week course of a flu epidemic.    After people stop taking the drug, they become susceptible to the virus again.  It occasionally causes difficulty sleeping, impaired concentration and  dizziness, and has been associated with falls in older people. As with all  medication, patients should take it only with a doctor's recommendation.

But flu and its complications need not be deadly, and can be prevented by  vaccinating high-risk individuals six to eight weeks before the season begins.    Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Flu  travels quickly, especially during winter in crowded indoor places like malls,  grocery stores, theaters and hospitals. When someone with the flu coughs or  sneezes, droplets containing particles of the virus spread to others.    After infection, symptoms usually appear in two to four days; the disease  continues to be contagious for another three to four days.    Once the virus enters the body, it multiplies and causes a variety of  well-known complaints, including chills and fever, headache, runny nose, sore  throat and a dry cough. Extreme weakness and muscle aches and pains often last  for several days. If the virus invades the lungs, viral pneumonia can develop.    To prevent the flu, people 65 and older and residents of nursing homes and  other chronic-care facilities should be vaccinated. Also, health professionals,  nursing home workers and family members who live with someone older than 65  should get a flu shot to avoid spreading the disease to those at risk.    Unlike other viruses, the flu virus changes from time to time. Because  different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each season, a new vaccine is  prepared every year. It contains strains of the flu virus recently circulating  worldwide and believed likely to hit during the coming winter. Nicknames such  as the ""Spanish flu"" and ""Hong Kong flu"" refer to places where large outbreaks  of new flu strains have first appeared.    The vaccine is made from highly purified, killed viruses. Because the flu shot  does not contain infectious viruses, it does not cause the flu. The most common  side effect is a sore arm, which occurs in less than one-third of those  vaccinated and usually lasts only a day or so. A few people also may develop a  brief low-grade fever and some minor aches and pains, which begin six to 12  hours after vaccination and can persist for one or two days.    If a person has no special reason not to take aspirin, low doses (such as one  tablet every three to four hours) usually will relieve these symptoms.    Immediate allergic reactions, such as hives, rarely occur after influenza  vaccination. Anyone allergic to eggs, which are used to grow the virus for the  vaccine, should not receive the vaccine, as some egg protein may be present.    Because the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work, the best time to be  vaccinated is in November. A vaccine also is available against the most common  types of bacteria that cause pneumonia. The flu shot can be given at the same  time as the pneumonia vaccine without increasing the side effects. The flu shot  must be given every year, but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once.    In addition to the flu shot, an antiviral drug -- amantadine -- can prevent  infection by certain strains. The drug is useful for people who have not had  the vaccine or as extra protection for those who have been immunized.    When taken soon after the early signs are felt, amantadine reduces the duration  of fever and other symptoms. It also can prevent infection if taken during the  entire four- to six-week course of a flu epidemic.    After people stop taking the drug, they become susceptible to the virus again.  It occasionally causes difficulty sleeping, impaired concentration and  dizziness, and has been associated with falls in older people. As with all  medication, patients should take it only with a doctor's recommendation.

The survey includes information on more than 75,000 people  employed between 1946 and 1982 by the UK Atomic Energy  Authority, the Atomic Weapons Establishment, and British Nuclear  Fuels at Sellafield.    Workers fell into two groups -- those likely to be exposed  to  radiation who were monitored, and those who were not. The second  group included office workers and caterers.    Researchers found deaths from all causes in monitored  workers  were 19 per cent lower than average, while overall deaths from  cancer were 18 per cent lower. By 1989 there were 40,761 workers  in the monitored group, of whom 1,884 had died of cancer.    Dr Valerie Beral, of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund,  said:  ""The fact that the number of deaths was lower than average was  not unexpected. This is common in high-skill industries which  tend to employ healthy people.""    The cancers most commonly linked with radiation exposure in  previous studies were those of the prostate, uterus, lung, and  multiple myeloma and leukemia. The new analysis showed that only  leukemia was clearly linked with external radiation.    Dr Lucy Carpenter, of Oxford University, said: ""The 49  leukemia deaths observed in monitored workers were similar to  the number predicted by general rates but the risk of the  disease rose with the radiation dose in these workers.    ""The dose-related risk was confined to those last employed  at  Sellafield, where radiation doses were higher.""    Deaths from thyroid cancer were also higher than average --  for every 100 cases expected, 181 were observed. Dr Beral said:  ""The increase was found in groups but there was some weak  evidence that the increased risk in monitored workers was linked  to radiation dose. This is being investigated further.""      "

Of those cases, 115 have been confirmed, and  31 of the victims have unfortunately died.    In almost half the cases, according to ministry sources,  victims were between ages 10 and 20 and either not vaccinated at  all or not fully vaccinated against the disease. The number of  deaths, rather high at the outset, has declined considerably,  and the situation is now under control, despite constraints  related to the unavailability of large quantities of vaccine and  antidiphtheria medicine.    At this point, with outbreaks confined to isolated cases and  small-scale epidemic flare-ups, health authorities say the  percentage of the populace enjoying vaccinal protection -- now  that vaccination is mandatory -- is easily large enough to  prevent outbreak of a major epidemic.    A recent nationwide assessment of the epidemiological  situation for diphtheria showed that centers of contagion are  still persisting, even increasing, in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou,  and there has been a major new outbreak in Ghardaia. However,  diphtheria has died down at least temporarily in Bouira,  Tamanrasset, El Oued, and Ouargia, the assessment showed.    In Ouargia the situation has been brought almost fully under  control, and the isolation unit has closed down. In Tizi-Ouzou,  all health sectors are affected, with a total of 87 reported  cases, 34 of them bacteriologically confirmed, and six deaths.  In the same wilaya, health officials have treated 46 healthy  carriers identified by analysis of throat cultures.    In Ghardaia, 79 persons have been hospitalized with 49 cases  confirmed, but there have been no deaths. Finally, the Ministry  of Health and Population Affairs reiterates that the large-scale  population movements seen in recent years across our borders,  especially in the south, have contributed to propagation of the  infection and were probably responsible for the virulent form it  assumed when the epidemic first broke out.

Another five deaths were reported yesterday as figures  showed  178 cases of flu-like illness per 100,000 members of the  population, compared with the usual average of 40-50 per  100,000. ""I am willing to call it an epidemic,"" said Douglas  Fleming, director of the Royal College of General Practitioners'  flu monitoring centre in Birmingham.    The five deaths occurred among 23 elderly patients on one  ward in Ladywell hospital, Salford, of whom 14 caught the virus.  Deaths attributed to flu in any winter vary from 1,000 to the  25,000 estimated for the winter of the last epidemic in 1989.  Nine out of ten victims are over 65.    The rate of increase in flu cases is highest in the South,  where they more than doubled between October 31 and November 7,  to 145 per 100,000. But the numbers falling ill are still lower  than the 201 per 100,000 in the North, where the epidemic  started.    ""The rate of increase is not as rapid as in 1989, so I am  optimistic that this will not be as bad an epidemic,"" Dr.  Fleming said. At the peak of the 1989 epidemic, 580 cases per  100,000 were being recorded and, in 1969, the figure rose to  more than 1,000.    However, scientists could not explain why the virus strain  causing this year's illness -- Flu A Beijing -- is proving so  virulent. First identified in China in 1992, it arrived in  Britain last March but caused few problems.    The current wave of illness began in Mississippi in the  United States last August. It was first detected in the UK in  October. Alan Hay, director of the Influenza Research Centre at  the National Institute for Medical Research in north London,  said that this year's virus strain was little different from  that of previous years.

0,FT942-1454 ,"FT942-1454 _AN-EFXC1ABOFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / Death drug share sales investigated      By EMIKO TERAZONO      TOKYO   Japan's securities industry watchdog yesterday raided a drug wholesaler, Nippon Shoji, at the centre of a scandal over alleged share sales by 175 employees and their relatives just before an announcement linking the company's shingles drug to the deaths of 15 patients. The raid was the first by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, which the government established two years ago to clean up the image of the Japanese securities industry after an embarrassing spate of brokers' scandals. Before the raid, which came after several days of press speculation, the allegation that company officials had profited from their knowledge of the patients' misfortune had stirred outrage, even though insider trading is often taken for granted by the public. Deaths caused by side effects of a drug manufactured and distributed by the Osaka-based Nippon Shoji provoked criticism last October, when the company conceded that, for some patients, the drug could be fatal. But the new allegations have deepened the public's mistrust of Japan's health establishment. The shingles drug case comes after the deaths of 20 patients taking an anti-cancer drug. This case late last year had prompted a dispute among officials at the Health Ministry, drug companies and doctors, who blamed each other for the deaths. The ministry has since agreed to disclose its evaluation procedure for new drugs. Yesterday's investigation follows an earlier probe into the case by the Osaka securities exchange. A total 175 company employees and their families are suspected of selling Nippon Shoji shares before last October's announcement by the government. Nippon Shoji, which is listed on the second section of the Osaka securities exchange, started falling a few hours before the Health Ministry's announcement, closing down 7.6 per cent on the day at Y3,150. The stock declined a further 15.5 per cent following the release. Following numerous many allegations of unfair trade practices during the stock market 'bubble' of the late 1980s, the Ministry of Finance tightened Japan's regulations on insider trading and set up its own version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Nippon Shoji case has allowed the watchdog, criticised for its ineffectiveness, to show some teeth. In a related development, officials at Eisai, another leading drug maker which was helping Nippon Shoji with the promotion of Sorivudine, said it had launched its own investigation on possible insider trading among its employees.

At the same time, the Pemex spokesman denied that the  explosion had resulted in several casualties.    Martinez denied reports disclosed on Saturday by Radio Red,  a  Mexico City radio station, on at least 10 persons having died  and 20 others having been wounded as result of the explosion and  fire at a pipeline located in the municipality of Cunduacan,  near Villahermosa, 600 km southeast of Mexico City. ""There were  no fatalities,"" the Pemex spokesman emphasized, and indicated  that only nine persons were injured as a result of burns,  including Pemex workers and residents of the communities of  Gregorio Mendez and Ranch Nuevo, both which are near the area.    Martinez pointed out that the explosion took place at a gas  pipeline connected to the petroleum installation known as Iride.  He added that the cause of the explosion is ""still being  investigated,"" starting first by cleaning up the area and then  examining materials through laboratory analysis. Pemex  technicians and specialists from the Attorney General's Office  [PGR] are investigating the explosion and fire which resulted in  damages to an area measuring approximately 300 meters, mainly to  trees and pastures, he specified.    A Red Cross spokesperson told AFP on Saturday that the  disaster prompted the evacuation of at least 800 persons living  in the nearby communities whom, according to Mario Martinez,  ""have already returned to their homes."" He stipulated that  Pemex is also investigating damages to nearby properties. Pemex  will compensate the owners for any damaged property.    The Pemex spokesman acknowledged that the Iride installation  lacked ""adequate attention to normal maintenance procedures,""  but attributed this to the fact that peasants in the area ""have  blocked entry"" to the site by staging constant ""protests for  alleged damages"" caused by the petroleum plant. ""These  installations have been blocked from the first months of 1993 to  date by persons unjustly demanding compensation for alleged  damages,"" Pemex indicated.    Residents of the region of Cunduacan where Pemex  concentrates  a vast petroleum drilling and production infrastructure have  complained about damage caused by the state-owned company which  they accuse of polluting the area in which they live.

Health ministers claim the incidence is too low to be of  significance, even though it kills one in five carriers and more  than 600 people a year die of it in Britain.    In response to a written question from Dawn Primarolo,  Labour  health spokesman, Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said  last week: ""Immunisation strategy is kept under review.""    But sources at the health department said ministers were  concerned at the cost of such a programme.    The WHO first recommended national immunisation in 1991 and  this was endorsed by the World Health Assembly the following  year.    Experts in Britain have told the health department that an  immunisation programme targeting infants or teenagers -- or both  -- could effectively wipe out the virus. They have also called  for more effective notification of the disease because they fear  it is being vastly under-reported.    The United States, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and  Canada are among countries that have already followed the  recommendations.    Professor Arie Zuckerman, of the Royal Free Hospital, an  adviser on viral diseases to the health department and the WHO,  said last week: ""This is an infection which is preventable. It  is also a very important public health issue.""    Like AIDS, hepatitis B is transmitted sexually or by  infected  blood or contaminated medical instruments. The WHO estimates  that one in 20 people in Europe alone have or have had the  virus. But Prof. Zuckerman said the problem here was the lack of  epidemiological data.    ""The official view is based on the notification rates to the  Public Health Laboratory Service. But I do not buy that, because  in most cases the symptoms are not recognised and not all cases  are reported,"" he said.    It could affect 15 to 20 per cent of the population rather  than the less than one per cent cited by the health department.    ""Eradicating hepatitis B by immunisation is an achievable  target and the UK should participate in the WHO programme,""  Prof. Zuckerman said.    ""If you compare the costs of treatment with prevention, then  there is no question about which is cheaper.""     "

General Sung Sothan was killed Friday while trying to  dispose  of a mine laid by the guerrillas near their major base at Anlung  Veng, in northwest Cambodia, which the government seized early  this month, said Toan Chay, governor of Siem Reap Province and  commander of the 4th Military Region. Khmer Rouge guerrillas  killed General Chean Eam the next day in a firefight north of  Anlung Veng, near the Thai border, as government troops carried  out mopping-up operations, he told AFP by telephone. The Khmer  Rouge had reported the deaths earlier, but Toan Chay dismissed  their claim to have killed an additional four lieutenant  colonels, 12 other officers and 109 soldiers in fighting over  the weekend. [passage omitted]    A Defence Ministry official said the casualty figures for  the  whole Anlung Veng operation so far was 40 government troops dead  and 178 wounded, adding that the Khmer Rouge lost 128 guerrillas  with some 139 others wounded. [passage omitted]    Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh also expressed his  condolences and issued a note of caution. ""I would like to  express my sorrow at the deaths of the generals. This shows that  although we have captured Anlung Veng we must be careful. We  need to clean out the whole area,"" he said.    Government officials meanwhile dismissed a Khmer Rouge claim  to have destroyed four tanks and captured a fifth during recent  fighting around Anlung Veng. An Information Ministry spokesman  said the government had not lost any tanks and claimed a picture  published in a Bangkok newspaper Monday showing a group of Khmer  Rouge guerrillas standing on top of what was supposed to be the  captured tank was several years old. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh said the government was still  prepared to discuss with the Khmer Rouge a peace proposal put  forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. The king suggested that  certain ""acceptable"" members of the Khmer Rouge be given senior  cabinet posts in return for the radical faction ceasing  guerrilla activities, opening up its zones, and merging its  fighters with the government's armed forces. ""But up to now I  have not received any letters or communication from the Khmer  Rouge,"" the prince said. ""The ball is still in the Khmer  Rouge's court.""     "

The TEC, which is  ""supposed to embody the progress reached at the talks, remains  silent, leaving this critical issue suspended in the hot air  generated by the SAP's [South African Police] increasingly  heated allegations against Transkei and [Transkei military  leader] Holomisa's absurd demands for an independent inquiry  conducted solely by foreigners."" The TEC is ""not being asked to  condone another raid on Transkei,"" but ""to deliver the  accountable, flexible and responsive government that the  negotiators kept promising"" as South Africans ""worry about  killers being caught, not what political points are scored by  whom.""    BEELD    Secret Vote a Cornerstone of Democracy -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans of 4 January points out in a page 8  editorial: ""One issue which continues to feature in the  country's political debate is that of a secret ballot. It is a  cornerstone of democracy, because only if voters know that they  can make a free choice at the polling booth can there be any  talk of a truly fair election. Unfortunately our tradition of  violence and intimidation serves as a weapon in the political  arsenal."" ""Add to this a huge new voter corps which is still  politically unsophisticated, and it becomes clear that the ideal  of a free election is threatened by threats, superstition, and  distorted information."" ""Just how important this matter is has  again been underlined by claims that members of the African  National Congress' military wing are joining the National Party  [NP] and the Democratic Party."" BEELD continues: ""The very fact  that the NP is not prepared to say who, and how many, of them  have joined its ranks is another indication that our political  climate is not healthy. The more open the process, the easier  it would be to separate fact from propaganda. No matter how  strong the urge for power, political parties owe it to South  Africa to create a culture of moral competition. It is as  strong a guarantee as a new constitution.""    Police Deaths `Unaffordable' -- ""Last year alone 260 South  African policemen died violently --people who, in the combating  of crime, have become the victims of that crime,"" notes a second  editorial on page 8 of the same issue of BEELD. For a force  working under extremely difficult conditions, this ""slaughter is  unaffordably high. It is a fact that the police have an  unenviable and dangerous task, because it does not always  involve only the combating of crime. More and more they find  themselves in the crossfire of power-hungry political groups to  whom human lives, including those of policemen, have become very  cheap."" ""It is difficult to understand why the communities  refuse to help the police. Their refusal leads to a chain  reaction which eventually boomerangs, because it feeds anarchy  and promotes the climate of violence. In the end it is not only  the police, but the community and the country as a whole who  suffer under the chaos created by these criminals.""    Siting of Parliament Already a Serious Debate -- The  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 5 January says in a page 10  editorial: ""One of the most sensitive political debates in South  Africa is that of the siting of Parliament in a new  dispensation. At the moment it is still a whispered debate, but  it is already being seriously talked about. Chances are that  none of the major parties would like to bring this issue out  into the open. An election campaign is on the go, and with the  important emphasis which regional parlaiments will be given,  parties would certainly not wish to disturb or harm regional  interests."" It is a fact, adds BEELD, ""that the advantages and  disadvantages of two capitals -- Cape Town the legislative and  Pretoria the administrative -- are already being studied in  political, economic, and diplomatic circles. The ANC [African  National Congress] has confirmed that some of its officials are  in favor of moving Parliament, and within the ruling party the  matter has sometimes also been discussed unofficially. We do  not wish to set in motion an emotional debate because we believe  that the election campaign must deal with fundamental issues,""  but ""we do await the eventual debate on this vital issue.""    Right Channels Not Followed with Transkei -- A second  editorial in the 5 Janaury edition argues that: ""In the light of  what has taken place in the past, one would expect the police to  be vary careful when they accuse Transkei's Major General Bantu  Holomisa."" ""For quite some time now efforts have been made to  prove that the general allows his country to be used as a  springboard for terrorist attacks on South Africa."" Until now  all these efforts have boomeranged. The worst instance was the  defense force raid on a so- called base of the Pan-Africanist  Congress' military wing in Umtata. Now it is being alleged that  the police know exactly where the suspects of the Cape Town  tavern attack are, but that they can do nothing because these  people are hiding in Transkei. On the surface it would seem  that this sensitive matter is being mishandled. It looks as  though the correct channels were not followed to remove the  stumbling blocks. Gen. Holomisa has offered his full  cooperation in the investigation. Accept the offer, let justice  take its course, and bring the guilty to book.""    Parties Have Duty to Make TEC Succeed -- A third editorial  on  5 January on page 10 of BEELD warns: ""The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] has not even had its first full session of 1994  and already there is talk of a test of strength between the TEC  and the government over political and security issues in  kwaZulu."" ""No one wants to avoid robust politics. Nevertheless  the role players in the TEC, and in particular their political  masters, must realize that they have a duty to make the TEC  succeed. The political confidence index among the South African  public is not particularly high at present. If the TEC, in whom  considerable hope has been placed, becomes involved in a  tug-of-war at this early stage, the already difficult transition  will be made that much more difficult."" Leaders should ensure,  says BEELD, ""that the TEC is not discredited in the eyes of the  public as just another political wrestling ring. They must  show...an understanding for the realities of this country.""     "

The grim statistics show that not less than 15 prisoners  have  died each month in Zimbabwe's gaols since the beginning of the  year.    The highest number was 43, who died of various ailments in  July.    Of the Aids-related illnesses, the lowest number of deaths  was seven in April, while the highest was 30 for May.    Responding to a question by Chief Edgar Musikavanhu, who  asked what measures were being taken to improve living  conditions in Zimbabwe's prisons, Cde Mnangagwa said most of the  deaths occurred after a short stay in prison.    ""We are made to understand from a medical point of view that  these illnesses, particularly those which are HIV-related, could  not have been contracted in prison on account of the short  period of incarceration.""    ""It is true that there is an increase in the number of  prison  deaths. It should, however, not be forgotten that this is a  phenomenon which is not peculiar to the prison system only.  Hospitals countrywide are reporting increasing numbers of  deaths,"" he said.    The longest period of stay in prison of those who died was  31  months and the shortest was 14 days.    Cde Mnangagwa said there had been an increase in the number  of deaths in prisons over the past five years with a  corresponding increase in HIV-related deaths.    ""On the other hand, it should also be noted that with the  increase in the prison population figure the number of deaths is  likely to increase,"" he said. Zimbabwe's prison population rose  from 15,000 in 1989, to the present figure of 19,600.    In 1992, there were 20,600 people in jails, but the number  came down following a general amnesty earlier this year.    Cde Mnangagwa denied that deaths in prison were due to the  living conditions or to alleged outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases.    A committee had been set up to look into the issues related  to deaths in prisons and a comprehensive report would be  submitted to the ministry in ""due course.""    A report by the Catholic Commission for Justices and Peace,  which described conditions in Zimbabwe's prisons as ""horrible,""  lacked detail and did not give a balanced picture.    The report alleged rampant sexual abuse, food shortages,  poor  health facilities, diseases, overcrowding and assaults by prison  officers.     "

Given that 1 g deferoxamine can bind 93 mg of iron, and that, to   avoid hypotension, infusion is generally recommended at 15   mg/kg/hr, there is a limit to the amount of iron deferoxamine can   bind.

Therefore, if very high levels of iron are absorbed, even   prompt treatment with deferoxamine or another agent may not   prevent a fatal outcome if chelation at the maximum safe rate   cannot reduce the iron burden to levels below those that cause   death.

Dr. S.P. Kohli, Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health  told the first international conference of the Indian  Association of Alliative Care here that cancer is no longer a  problem of developed countries but a matter of concern for  developing countries also.    She said the problem had acquired greater magnitude due to  an  increase in life expectancy resulting in a greater ratio of old  people in the population, increase in population, improved life  style as well as modernisation.    In India, breast, cervix and uterus cancer was most common  in  women while men were more prone to mouth, larynx and lung cancer.    These types of cancer were tobacco-related and could be  prevented by proper education, creating awareness and stopping  tobacco intake.    Lung cancer was nearly nine times more common in smokers  than  in non-smokers, Dr. Kohli said.    Considering this, the Union Government had chalked out a  plan  of action for prevention of cancer at an early stage, prevention  of tobacco intake in any form, early diagnosis of cancer  specially in cervic, breast and mouth.    She said that it was most unfortunate that most of the  cancer  patients in India reported at a very advanced stage in hospitals  and regional cancer centres, rendering the therapy ineffective.    She suggested that since there were more advanced cancer  cases in India, Palliative therapy should be provided to such  patients effectively.    In India, 30 percent of the cancer cases could not be  treated  with active therapy and ""we could provide only palliative  therapy in such cases,"" Dr. Kohli said.    Cancer pain is not an imitable part of cancer, contrary to  common belief. Little is done to alleviate pain simply due to  inadequacy of medical education in cancer pain therapy, she said.    Medical students were taught to treat cancer but not cancer  pain. She suggested introduction of pain relief and palliative  care education at undergraduate and post-graduate teaching level.    The Union Government had started producing oral morphine in  collaboration with the World Health Organisation directly to 10  identified regional cancer centres. There was a proposal to  provide oral morphine to other teaching government medical  institutions, too.    She said that morphine was the cheapest and most effective  pain killer in cancer. Pain could be minimised in 80 to 98  percent of cancer cases if right drug in right dose and at right  time was given, she said.     "

The authorities claimed that  Abdeljalil's death was merely a ""suicide."" Many people lost  their lives, before and after Abdeljalil lost his, while they  were guests of the government in its police stations and its  public and secret detention centers. While the bodies of the  dead were being carried out of the cold prison surroundings and  taken to their graves for burial, questions about these deaths  were relegated to oblivion. Even in official circles complaints  filed by the victims' relatives and by human rights  organizations fell on deaf ears. Officials paid no attention to  these complaints just as they paid no attention to respecting  people's right to life and to the dignity of those citizens who  died in the government's dungeons.    Ever since its establishment in 1988 the Moroccan  Organization for Human Rights has given maximum attention to  those deaths that occur in centers that are subordinate to the  judicial police and local authorities and those that result from  the use of general force. It has demanded an investigation in  each one of the many cases in which the victims' families had  been persuaded to file complaints. The organization filed its  own complaints and demanded civil rights [for the victims] but  to no avail. All inquiries directed to the Ministry of Justice,  in its capacity as the competent government authority that is  responsible for the office of the attorney general, also went  unanswered. Out of 17 cases recorded by the organization in  which death had occurred under suspicious circumstances and the  involvement of public officials was suspected, only two have  been turned over to justice.    The Moroccan Organization for Human Rights issued a report  on  the subject yesterday. The report, which included incidents  related to the deaths, listed those deaths from 1989 to 1993.  The organization demanded that the Ministry of Justice tell the  public what measures were taken by judicial authorities in all  the cases discussed in the report. It also demanded that a fair  investigation of those matters be duly held and that every  official in the judicial police or with security forces be  turned over to the competent courts if evidence is found against  him that he was engaged in torture while a prisoner was in his  custody or that he used unjustified force in the public street.  The organization demanded that the court award the victims'  families the compensation that they are entitled to receive.    The organization protested against all forms of evading  punishment that infringe upon the notion of a state of law and  order. Evading punishment infringes upon Morocco's international  obligations and violates the protection clause for the  fundamental rights of individuals.    Almost five years ago, on 4 February 1989 to be specific, El  Yaagoubi Abdeljalil, a citizen, died just two hours after he was  arrested by the police in Ouarzazate. At first, the death was  considered a suicide.    The Moroccan Organization for Human Rights wrote to the  Ministry of Justice, demanding an ordinary judicial  investigation into the matter, and it filed a complaint  demanding civil justice. The prosecution declared that there  would be an investigation, but that announcement has had no  effect to speak of to date. No security official was turned over  to justice. Unfortunately, that was neither the first such case,  nor was it the last.    Since then the organization has received several complaints  from the families of citizens who died under identical  circumstances in police stations, police centers, or in  locations that are affiliated with local authorities. The press  also featured other similar cases where death had occurred and  local authorities, in most cases, had taken no action to respond  or comment. Those matters that were brought to the  organization's attention most recently have to do with the death  of Mustapha Hamzaoui in Khenifra and Abdallah Bentaouet and  Mounir Azzag in Tangier.    All inquiries sent to the Ministry of Justice, as the  governmental authority that is responsible for the office of the  attorney general, went unanswered, and none of the cases were  turned over to justice, except for the 1989 case of Mr. Ben  Khalifa Abderrahman in Ahwaz Marrakech and the 1991 case of Mr.  Lamaskam El Hachemi in Casablanca. In those two cases death had  occurred as a result of the two victims' being subjected to  violence in the public street by public officials.    The authorities have always claimed that these cases were  suicides and that those who died had hanged themselves. In  making such a claim the authorities were relying on medical  testimony or reports prepared mostly by physicians who are not  forensic physicians and unaccompanied by a sanctioned attendance  roster. And yet, most of the medical documents that were  examined by attorneys or by the organization do not always  categorically rule out that violence or torture was used on the  victims. Also, the physicians who were charged with performing  autopsies were not always independent, nor did they observe the  principles of medical ethics. Furthermore, the suicide story was  often contradicted by identical evidence that pertained to the  material circumstances of the case (the method used to commit  suicide, the characteristics of the building where the detainee  was being held, and the limited period of time during which the  person was detained: between a few hours and two days). The  suicide story was also contradicted by the absence of clear  motives for suicide. That is why we find that families were  always rejecting the official story.    And yet it seems that most of the cases in which death had  occurred under suspicious circumstances while a person was in  custody or was being detained were closed after the office of  the attorney general conducted what was merely an administrative  procedure. No judicial investigation was conducted in those  cases, and even the few that were investigated did not end up in  court.    And yet, Morocco's penal code penalizes acts of violence  committed by individuals, whoever they might be. And 14 years  ago, the Moroccan state ratified the international convention on  civil and political rights that renounces all forms of torture.  In fact, it was recently, on 21 June 1994, that Morocco signed  an agreement against torture and other forms of harsh, inhumane,  or degrading treatment or punishment.    The organization had welcomed a review of the criminal  guidelines that went into effect two years ago. These include  some mechanisms to protect people from torture during the course  of an interrogation. It seems that this measure and the  instructions that accompanied it contributed to a reduction in  the practice of torture, which, according to the testimony of  many, occurred quite frequently until the end of 1990.    It has been noticed, nevertheless, that some public  officials  are still practicing torture. That was established in the courts  in the cases of those citizens who were arrested in Bouznika  during the June 1993 parliamentary elections, and it is also  evident in the cases in which death had occurred in the past two  years.    And yet, security officers do from time to time resort to  the  use of general force and physical violence as a way of  controlling people. This happened in the case of Mr. Lamaskam El  Hachemi in Casablanca and in the case of Nouaimi Mohamed in  Rabat. This issue had previously been raised in the  organization's report that was issued in the wake of the  distressing events of December 1990. The organization calls  attention to the fact that the use of general force is subject  to specific international standards determined by the code of  conduct for officials who are charged with implementing the laws  that were approved by the UN General Assembly on 17 December  1979. This code stipulates specifically that those officials  cannot resort to the use of force unless it becomes absolutely  necessary. If force must be used, it is to be used within the  boundaries that are required for the performance of their duties.    The case of Mr. Benmouh who died in the police station in  Rabat on 30 September 1990 shows that first aid was denied to a  person who had asthma and who had been arbitrarily arrested  during a police raid.    In December the organization's national office decided to  issue a report on this matter after noticing that there had been  no follow-up on 15 of the 17 cases that it had recorded as cases  in which a public official might have been involved. In  addition, all the efforts made by the organization to get  officials to respond to this matter went unanswered.    In the meantime, the minister of justice indicated  specifically in his answer to a question posed by a  representative about one of the last three cases that, ""It is  inconceivable that people who are supposed to protect lives and  property turn around and attack lives and property. When  something like that happens, it behooves the king's deputy to go  to the location where such an incident took place and conduct an  investigation that must be thorough and must reveal everything.    ""Complaints have been filed by the families with the  investigating magistrate, and investigations into those  complaints will run their course. It is inconceivable that a  criminal, regardless of his social status, would go unpunished.""    In putting in the record the content of this statement,  which  differs from the position that was taken by public authorities,  the national office of the Moroccan Organization for Human  Rights is demanding [the following]:  1.     1. That the Ministry of Justice announce to the  public the measures that are being taken by the judicial  authorities, and specifically, by the competent district  attorneys, on all the issues raised in this report;    2. That a fair judicial investigation be conducted in  accordance with the law. Since the facts of this case are not  old, an investigation cannot be impeded by the fact that a  decision to close the case was made by the office of the  attorney general;    3. That every officer in the judicial police or in the  security forces against whom there is evidence that he became  engaged in torturing a prisoner who was in his custody be taken  to a duly qualified court of law where he may be duly tried in  accordance with the requirements of the penal code. The same  would apply to one who used unjustifiable violence in the public  street.    4. That the courts award the victims' families the  compensation to which they are entitled.    The National Office of the Moroccan Organization for Human  Rights protests all forms of evading punishment that run counter  to the notion of a law and order state. Evading punishment also  runs counter to our country's international commitments and  violates the protection clause for individuals' fundamental  rights. Proper application of the law against those who engage  in torture is an unavoidable requirement for the elimination of  a terrible practice that was too often used during preliminary  investigations. Torture was even sometimes practiced outside  those preliminary investigations. The practice of torture is an  unacceptable violation of a person's right to life, his right to  be free from bodily harm, and his right to dignity.

According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, 48 cases were  reported, representing 37 percent more than the 35 cases of the  disease expected for the month. The number of fatalities during  November rose to 12 with the death, on the night before last, of  the child J., aged one year, who was confined in the Salgado  Filho Hospital. According to the Secretariat, the baby's parents  live in the shantytown of Jacarezinho.    Despite the spread of the meningococcal disease in Rio, the  Secretariat denies the existence of an epidemic, because he does  not believe that there has been a significant change in the  number of reports of the disease compared with previous years.  Most of the cases of meningococcal meningitis in Rio have been  caused by the Type B meningococcus, characterized by a slow  spread. It is unlike types A and C, which are capable of causing  very intense epidemics within a short period of time.    Compared with last year's reports, however, the figures on  the meningococcal disease in Rio indicate an abnormal rise in at  least five months: February (increase of 50 percent); March (105  percent); April (43 percent); September (56 percent); and  November (37 percent). Nevertheless, during August and October  the number of cases was nearly 30 percent lower than that  recorded for those months in 1992. The total number of cases  reported to date has already exceeded that of last year's cases:  392 by November, compared with 328 last year.    For this reason, the Municipal Health Secretariat requested  of the Health Ministry authorization to administer the vaccine  against type B meningococcal meninigitis in Rio. The  effectiveness of that vaccine is a controversial topic among the  experts.    Deaths From January to November Total 142    The State Health Secretariat's data indicate that by  November, in the state as a whole, the meningococcal meninigitis  cases exceeded the total reported in 1992. To date, the  Secretariat has recorded 725 cases of the disease, compared with  702 last year. This represents an approximate increase of 3  percent, not counting the figure for the month of December. The  disease, which killed 153 persons in 1992, caused 142 fatalities  among its victims by November of this year.    When added to those of other types of meningitis (such as  the  ones caused by Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and  viruses), the total cases this year number 2,209, versus 2,422  last year. Yesterday, in Rio, the Municipal Health Secretariat  recorded another case of type A meningococcal disease. The  victim, L., aged 11 months, lives in Jacarepagua, and is  confined in a private clinic.     "

According to the survey, during 1992  AIDS killed 524 women in this age group throughout the state.    The number represents 11.87 percent of the total deaths  (4,412) recorded among the female population that year. The  second cause of death after AIDS was tumors (468 fatalities). It  was followed by vehicle accidents (370 cases), homicides (275),  and pneumonia (194).    The problem is serious among men as well. According to the  survey, during 1992 AIDS was the second cause of death among the  male population aged between 20 and 35 years (2,289 fatalities).  Homicides ranked first (4,314 deaths).    The 1993 figures are still being tabulated by the  foundation's researchers. However, based on the records analyzed  to date, AIDS continues to lead in the causes of death among  women.    Demographer Antonio Marangone Camargo claimed: ""There is a  rising trend in the number of deaths due to AIDS among this  population.""    The progression in the numbers of deaths caused by AIDS has  been observed by the Seade technicians for at least three years.  In 1990, the deaths due to the disease among women aged between  20 and 24 years accounted for 7.58 percent of the deaths  recorded in the state. During 1991, the proportion rose to 10.61  percent; and, in 1992, it reached 12.50 percent.    Despite the alarming indexes, the specialists are not  frightened. For example, Caio Rosenthal, a physician  specializing in the study of infections at the Emilio Ribas  Institute of Infection Studies, claimed that the rising trend in  the number of deaths caused by AIDS among young women had  already been anticipated.    Rosenthal explained: ""They comprise a sexually active  population with less sexual stability, using drugs, and with  behavior considered to be risky. It was predictable that this  would ocurr, because we are in a country where there is no care  for health, or family planning, and where the condom is one of  the most expensive in the world.""    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Among Males, Violence Kills More                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Five Principal Causes of Death Among Women Aged 20-35 Years              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cause                                 |Number of Deaths                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |AIDS                                  |524                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tumors                                |468                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle accidents                     |370                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Homicides                             |275                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pneumonia                             |194                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Five Principal Causes of Death Among Men Aged 20-35 Years                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cause                                 |Number of Deaths                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Homicides                             |4,314                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |AIDS                                  |2,289                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle accidents                     |1,992                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pneumonia                             |498                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tumors                                |414                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992 figures                                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Seade                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------       "

But now the  demographic situation in the city is characterized as critical.  Why?[end bold]    The population of Novosibirsk increased by 124,700 over the  decade 1979-1988. The city population increased by 12,500, on  average, each year. But just a few years ago the situation  began to change. In 1989 the number of people in Novosibirsk  increased by only 6,700, and in 1990, by only 3,500. In 1991 a  loss in population was noted for the first time (of 4,400  people). In 1992 the city population had decreased by 11,200,  and in 1993--by 12,500.    Of course there were contributing factors to the exodus of  people from Novosibirsk -- production decline and the reduced  need for outside manpower. The emigration of Novosibirsk  residents was also a factor of no small significance. In 1993,  1,400 inhabitants of Novosibirsk had departed for places abroad.  But on the whole, only 25 percent of the loss of population is  due to migratory outflow.    Last year more people died than were born in all rayons of  the city. As compared with 1992, the number of births decreased  by 2,100 (16 percent), amounting to 10,600. Twenty thousand  people died, 4,100 more than in 1992.    One of the objective factors contributing towards the  reduced  birth rate is the demographic echo of war. The fact of the  matter is that our 20-29 year-old women are those of the sparse  generations born at the end of the 60's-beginning of the 70's  (i.e., the daughters of people born during the war and post-war  years).    Also providing its contribution to the decline in birth  rate,  of course, is the present crisis situation in the country and  factors related to it--the drop in standard of living of the  populace and lack of confidence in what tomorrow will bring.    The number of registered marriages decreased by 119 in 1993,  although the number of divorces also decreased last year.    Unfavorable changes in population mortality are being  observed in the city. The mortality index increased over the  year from 11.0 to 14.1 deaths per thousand population. The main  causes of death in Novosibirsk remain diseases of the  circulatory system (54 percent), tumors (16 percent), accidents,  poisonings, and trauma (16 percent). The incidence of murder  increased 1.5-fold over the past year; suicides increased by 27  percent.    Thus, the demographic situation in Novosibirsk has indeed  reached crisis proportions. Everywhere we see a declining birth  rate and increased mortality rate, resulting in natural losses  of the city population. In addition, the migrational exodus has  reduced the number of inhabitants in all rayons of Novosibirsk.    The demographic situation of the city continues to  deteriorate this year as well. The number of deaths in  January-March was double the number of births.     "

After the Muslim artillery had pounded Novi  Travnik this morning, particularly the suburb of Donji Rastovci,  Muslim artillery attacks spread in the course of the afternoon  to other parts of the Lasva river valley. The centre of Vitez  and all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] positions in that area  are coming under particularly heavy fire. Shortly after 1300  the parish church in Vitez was hit. After the Croatian  artillery had retaliated, the shelling of this area subsided,  although it has not completely stopped. At the same time Muslim  infantry forces launched an attack from Sivrino Selo against the  village of Dubravice east of Vitez and HVO positions east of  Travnik. The HVO command in Vitez has reported that the HVO  forces are firmly holding their positions. [passage omitted]    The political department of the Defense Ministry of the  Croat  Republic of Herceg-Bosna, expressing its regret over the tragic  killing of the three members of an Italian RAI Uno television  team from Trieste yesterday and extending condolences to their  families, has issued an extraordinary communique explaining the  circumstances surrounding the killing of the three journalists.    Shortly before 1600 yesterday Muslim forces fired four  mortar  rounds on a very busy street in the western [Croat-held] part of  Mostar, the communique says. The shells were fired from Muslim  positions situated near the Muslim army fourth corps command  headquarters; three people in the western part of Mostar  sustained injuries. In order to neutralize the attack the HVO  retaliated, firing on the fourth corps command headquarters  whence the shells had been fired against the western part of the  city. That was when the three Italian journalists who were  filming at that time in the vicinity of the command headquarters  were killed.    After the Spanish UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] battalion  interpreter had called and stated that the three journalists had  been killed and one woman wounded, HVO troops immediately  ceased fire, the communique says. The bodies of the journalists  are still in a hospital in the eastern part of Mostar, from  where they are expected to be transported by a UNPROFOR vehicle  to Split to be flown to Trieste this evening.    The Spanish UNPROFOR battalion had warned the journalists to  postpone their visit by a few days, but, having joined the  International Commitee of the Red Cross, they came at their own  risk. At the same time two other teams of journalists, a group  of German journalists, a group of Dutch journalists, and two  Turkish journalists [as received] sought permission to visit  Mostar. They had set off for Mostar, but having been warned by  HVO soldiers at the last checkpoint before entering Mostar that  to visit this town would be risky, they gave up their trip and  waited for UNPROFOR to take them back to Medjugorje, Colonel  Antonio Castro, UNPROFOR spokesman in Medjugorje, said. Col.  Castro added that in his talks with the Italian journalists he  had been asked whether it was risky to visit Mostar, and had  replied that to visit either the eastern or the western part of  Mostar was always risky.

They stumbled upon the crumpled body of Renatha Yvette Simpson not far  from the Figueroa Street corners where she had sold herself, $10 at a time, to  buy cocaine.    A week after Simpson's 24th birthday last November, she became a Los Angeles  homicide statistic, fitting a familiar category of victim -- women involved to  at least some degree in prostitution. An average of more than one prostitute a  month is killed in the city, 69 all told in the four years from 1985 through  1988, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.    ""I think that's the highest-risk occupation there is,"" Cmdr. William Booth  said. ""Mercenaries are way behind prostitutes. . . . There is just nothing that  carries the risk with it, in peacetime, as streetwalking prostitution.""      Death on the Streets    Recent reports that a serial killer has been preying on Southside prostitutes  and last month's arrest of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of  killing three streetwalkers last year are but a part of the story of death on  the city's dingy prostitution strips.    Ready-made victims almost by definition, streetwalkers have become even more  vulnerable since crack cocaine laid claim to the inner city. Crack has  dramatically altered the streetwalking scene as women forsake caution and the  protection of pimps to hustle for the next high, police and people who work  with prostitutes say.    At times they are so drug-dazed that they fail to recognize undercover vice  officers who have repeatedly arrested them, much less the subtle danger signals  of a potential killer. Rather than taking their customers to the relative  security of a motel room, they often drive down the block to park in the dark,  down a dead end street or next to a vacant lot. It's cheaper and quicker.      Anonymous Corpses    When they turn up dead, dumped into an alley or parking lot, their lives on the  streets offer few clues as to who ended them. They arrive at the morgue as Jane  Does, their past frequently an unreliable web of aliases, temporary addresses  and false birth dates.    ""We're all out here doing it for drugs. Cocaine is our pimp,"" said Mary, a  husky-voiced hooker eating a pink Popsicle on Figueroa Street, a bleakly  monotonous strip of commerce, salvation and escape. Motels, liquor stores,  storefront churches and auto salvage yards abound. Day or night, streetwalkers  saunter up and down the dirty sidewalks, alone or in twos and threes, hopefully  scanning passing cars for a ""date.""    Certainly, ""Renee"" Simpson's fall to Figueroa was precipitated by cocaine.    ""The girl was on it very bad,"" said Winnett Price, who shared a crowded South  Broadway apartment with her family and Simpson in the weeks before Simpson's  death. ""I used to sit and talk to her about it and say all this is not  necessary. . . . I tried to tell her to slow down. She'd sit there and listen  and cry for a while.""    Simpson worked with Price's mother and sister on a crew that cleaned office  buildings. When she was finished, she would go home, eat a big meal and wait  until midnight.    ""It's like she had a job. . . . She'd be in and out the door from 12 to 5 in  the morning,"" Price said. Simpson would work the streets, get some cocaine, go  back to her room, and when she needed more crack, return to the dimly lit  street corners to smile at cruising men. In that part of Los Angeles, drug  dealers are never far away.    If Price warned her of the risks she was taking, Simpson would laugh: ""I can  handle it.""    She lived, after all, in a world where 2-year-olds are slaughtered in their  front yards in drive-by gang shootings, where the next customer may have AIDS  (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), where an argument can quickly flare into  a brutal knifing.    To a 37-year-old woman arrested for prostitution one night last week, the  danger of what she was doing isn't much greater ""than waking up every morning  and stepping out the door. You don't know what's going to happen. You walk down  the street and every day somebody's getting killed.""    She was an out-of-work, licensed vocational nurse who has been on cocaine for  nine years. Now and then, she says, she would take a ride with a stranger to a  motel room for a quick $10. It will buy enough rock cocaine to keep her high  for an hour.    She was arrested in the parking lot of a motel, chilled bottle of peach wine  cooler in hand, by a Southeast Division vice detail.    The same detail picked up Simpson last Nov. 11, three weeks before she was  killed. It was around midnight. Simpson stood at the intersection of 99th  Street and Figueroa, surrounded by a weedy vacant lot, a fenced-in auto  transmission shop and two stucco houses.    ""You want a date?"" she asked the undercover vice officer when he pulled up. To  his ""yes"" she replied, ""Take me down the street."" She wanted $10 in exchange  for a quick sex act, according to the police report.      Called a Standout    In the vice office, they remember Simpson. ""She stood out,"" Sgt. Steve Grenier  said. ""She was not the regular prostitute."" She had some class and seemed to  come from a pretty good family. She smiled for her mug shot and thanked the  undercover officers who arrested her. She was going to beat her cocaine habit.  The arrest would help turn her life around.    ""She was living in a dream world where she thought she was going to get out of  this,"" Grenier said.    Every night the sergeant sees women who haven't gotten out, women whose  drug-ravaged faces line the pages of the vice mug book. Antoinette's decline is  documented in color. She's a 22-year-old coke freak who has been arrested 10  times for prostitution. In her first booking photo, taken in 1984, her gaze is  soft and attractive. Four years later, she stares into the camera with  washed-out eyes. Her face is scarred and haggard.    ""A lot of these girls are just like zombies,"" Grenier said. ""The men are able  to pick them up time and time again.""    When they're arrested, ""They normally don't have any ID, or jewelry. They don't  have anything. A lot of them don't have a place to stay that night. . . .  They're just going from rock to rock.""    The greater their appetite for cocaine, the more easily victimized they are.    ""It seems to me, and I have no statistics, like more prostitutes are being  killed now than before,"" said Los Angeles Homicide Detective Pat Marshall, who  works in South-Central Los Angeles, where 41 of the 69 prostitutes slain in the  last four years were killed. ""When cocaine became very, very prevalent . . .  then we started seeing more and more being injured or killed.""      Many Just Happen    While Booth said some of the 69 prostitute slayings are likely related, police  say the killings are often just a product of drugs, temper or a soured business  deal. A customer will demand his money back after he has had sex, a  streetwalker will try to rob the john, an argument will erupt and turn violent.    ""These girls are at the whim of any psycho who wants to do something to them,""  observed Capt. Jim Docherty, commanding officer of the LAPD's administrative  vice section.    There are no official estimates of the number of prostitutes in Los Angeles.  The number of citywide prostitution arrests has more than doubled in the last  decade, from 3,644 in 1978 to 7,975 in 1988, but LAPD officials say that may  simply reflect increased police activity, rather than increased prostitution.    Police sweeps have greatly reduced streetwalking in Hollywood, police say,  leaving the gritty main drags of South-Central the city's streetwalking center.  Elsewhere in Los Angeles, prostitution tends to take more sophisticated,  expensive and less hazardous forms, such as escort services.    The Friday before Simpson was killed, she phoned her mother, Josann Davidson,  and told her, ""Mama, I love you.""    ""She would not let a month go by without being in touch,"" recalled Davidson,  sitting in her Inglewood apartment a few feet from a large color photograph of  Renee, looking sunny and cheerful.    Simpson's mother and stepfather, Joe Davidson, never knew for a fact that she  was using drugs, but they had suspected it ever since she was in her early  teens. ""She never did want me to see that side of her. She always hid that from  me,"" Davidson said. Her daughter left the Davidsons' well-kept home more than  two years ago, when they voiced their suspicions and told her they would not  tolerate drug use. She stayed with relatives, including a favorite aunt, but  they too eventually asked her to leave. Then Price's family took her in.      Kept in the Dark    The Davidsons did not know that Simpson had been arrested for prostitution. ""If  I'd known that (she was streetwalking), I would have stepped in,"" said Joe  Davidson. ""She would have known we knew about it.""    Simpson grew up in a solid working-class household in Compton. Her stepfather,  who had taken care of her since she was a toddler, is a master aircraft  mechanic. Her mother is a beautician. A half-brother attended college.    Simpson's street life, Joe Davidson said, was something ""she chose. She had all  the opportunities of any young lady around.""    She dropped out of high school in the 11th grade, later obtained an equivalency  degree and enrolled in the Job Corps. But she never managed to hold more than a  string of menial jobs. ""She wanted to be better, but I don't think she was  willing to take the step to be better,"" Josann Davidson said.    ""Renee was a very sensitive person. She felt rejected a lot, she felt unloved,  no matter what we did,"" Davidson continued. Her daughter wanted the fast life  and ""I wasn't a fast-life-type person.""    ""Renee always viewed me as a strict, stern mother.""    Detective Marshall started working homicide 13 years ago. Then, he said, a girl  ""had a pimp. She hung out with other girls."" If she was found dead, ""We had  avenues of investigation. . . . You don't have that with a prostitute who's a  strawberry (the street name for a woman who exchanges sex for drugs). They're  not hanging out with anybody.    ""No one knows what they're doing,"" he said. Detectives encounter a litany of ""I  don't knows"" when they question relatives.    Of the 69 prostitute slayings recorded since 1985, police say only 22 have been  solved. ""I would not say we as investigators have a great deal of success in  solving prostitute-related murders,"" said Detective Paul Mize of the LAPD's  South Bureau.    It is not, they insist, that they are not trying. Rather, they say that in many  prostitute killings they are confronted with a dearth of leads and a surplus of  frustrations.    ""The obvious difficulty in working these cases is nobody cares,"" Mize  commented. The woman's family cares, but the street community is hardly  scribbling down the license plate numbers of suspicious looking drivers. ""There  are rarely any eyewitnesses, and if there are, they make themselves invisible.""      Computerized Data    The Police Department did not computerize homicide records until 1985, and  officials say they thus have no way of knowing whether prostitute-related  slayings are on the rise.    Lt. John Zorn, a member of the ""Southside Slayer"" task force formed a number of  years ago, when it appeared that a serial killer was preying on Southside  prostitutes, says he doesn't think there has been an increase in the killing of  street women. But he concedes, ""The situation has not changed a great deal over  the period of time (since the task force was formed). The problem still exists  that there are murders of these women.""    The task force compiled a list of 17 women, most of them prostitutes, strangled  or stabbed on the Southside between 1983 and 1986. Then ""we established there  was not a serial killer, that we were looking for a number of suspects,"" and  they stopped keeping a list.    Arrests were made in four of the 17 cases. There was one conviction, an Alabama  prisoner is accused of killing one woman, and Louis Craine, an unemployed  construction worker, is going on trial this month in the strangulation murders  of five Southside prostitutes between 1984 and 1987, including two on the  Southside Slayer list.      Shooting Deaths    Last month reports surfaced that Los Angeles police were investigating another  possible serial killer who may have shot as many as 12 Southside prostitutes  during the last three years. Police have refused to comment, but they recently  arrested Rickey Ross, a veteran sheriff's deputy, on charges that he fatally  shot three prostitutes late last year and dumped their bodies in South Los  Angeles.    Still, Zorn said, ""I don't have evidence to indicate there are a large number  of serial killers preying on prostitutes.""    Renee Simpson was strangled and left in the dirt at a freeway construction site  that has obliterated part of the graffiti-smeared neighborhood where she last  lived and bought drugs. Toxicological tests revealed there was cocaine in her  blood when she was killed. No arrests have been made in her case.    On the back of the program for her Dec. 5 funeral service is a tribute from her  aunt La Verne: ""Renee, you have gone home to rest and you have no more worries.  . . . Your sweet smile, your dancing eyes, I will miss, and my beloved niece,  Renee, I will always love you.""

They stumbled upon the crumpled body of Renatha Yvette Simpson not far  from the Figueroa Street corners where she had sold herself, $10 at a time, to  buy cocaine.    A week after Simpson's 24th birthday last November, she became a Los Angeles  homicide statistic, fitting a familiar category of victim -- women involved to  at least some degree in prostitution. An average of more than one prostitute a  month is killed in the city, 69 all told in the four years from 1985 through  1988, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.    ""I think that's the highest-risk occupation there is,"" Cmdr. William Booth  said. ""Mercenaries are way behind prostitutes. . . . There is just nothing that  carries the risk with it, in peacetime, as streetwalking prostitution.""      Death on the Streets    Recent reports that a serial killer has been preying on Southside prostitutes  and last month's arrest of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of  killing three streetwalkers last year are but a part of the story of death on  the city's dingy prostitution strips.    Ready-made victims almost by definition, streetwalkers have become even more  vulnerable since crack cocaine laid claim to the inner city. Crack has  dramatically altered the streetwalking scene as women forsake caution and the  protection of pimps to hustle for the next high, police and people who work  with prostitutes say.    At times they are so drug-dazed that they fail to recognize undercover vice  officers who have repeatedly arrested them, much less the subtle danger signals  of a potential killer. Rather than taking their customers to the relative  security of a motel room, they often drive down the block to park in the dark,  down a dead end street or next to a vacant lot. It's cheaper and quicker.      Anonymous Corpses    When they turn up dead, dumped into an alley or parking lot, their lives on the  streets offer few clues as to who ended them. They arrive at the morgue as Jane  Does, their past frequently an unreliable web of aliases, temporary addresses  and false birth dates.    ""We're all out here doing it for drugs. Cocaine is our pimp,"" said Mary, a  husky-voiced hooker eating a pink Popsicle on Figueroa Street, a bleakly  monotonous strip of commerce, salvation and escape.

The atmosphere here in the Southern  Autarky Block, next to the Federal Police headquarters building,  is getting tense because Federal Police personnel are starting  to arrive and are finding that about 1,000 military troops have  been occupying the area since 0100.    Until now the only incident that has been reported occurred  at about 0300, when a car carrying two men tried to break  through one of the barricades and shooting ensued.    Vehicle traffic is under the control of the military police  and traffic department inspectors. This is also the case near  the Federal Police Regional Superintendency in the Southern  Police Sector. Security personnel at the Justice Ministry  building on the Ministries Esplanade have been reinforced by  military personnel.    Federal Police personnel are now starting to arrive at the  Southern Autarky Block. They are driving through, looking  around and going to their respective blocks.    German shepherds and soldiers armed with rifles, machine  guns, and tear gas are strategically located. Those who want to  enter the Federal Police building to work must identify  themselves before entering the building which is completely  surrounded by Army troops.     "

Reports say the heat is being focused on two veterans of the  Force, both trusted members of Special Branch, who have become  crooked cops.    Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga Wednesday appointed a top  brass investigative team headed by Assistant Commissioner Ornell  Brooks. The two others are Senior Superintendent Alvan Rowland  and Superintendent Raymond Thimbrell. Two officers who have not  been identified have been detained, and reports say, one or more  arrests are imminent.    Police Commissioner Zuniga has promised he will hold a press  briefing when the investigations are complete.    Police first knew that something was seriously wrong on  Tuesday when a package of 2.1 kilograms of confiscated cocaine  with special police markings to identify it turned up on the  streets of Belize City.    Last Tuesday night the police busted three guys who were  trying to peddle the stuff in front of the Fort George Radisson.  During some intense questioning police learned the name of at  least one officer working with the Crimes Investigation Bureau.    The investigation has been expanded to include the police  Sergeant in charge of the Police strong room where confiscated  drugs are kept under lock and key.    The Police image has been tarnished time after time by  crooked cops who commit crimes and get off with just a rap on  the wrist. This time however there is every indication that  Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga will press criminal charges  which could lead to extended jail sentences for the guilty  officers.     "

The message said that the  fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still  hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has  shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to  assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same  embassy. ""Major targets are high-level officials of the U.S.  and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and  some other embassies,"" the source said.    The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence  authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the  truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is  believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But  the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near  the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the  Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to  investigate how the briefcase disappeared.    However, police officials at the Metropolitan Police Office  declined to discuss this with reporters. They said they were  not authorized to give information to newsmen, and that  reporters should ask the police director or the metropolitan  police commissioner if they want information.    Meanwhile, Police Colonel Suraphon Thongprasoet of the  Special Branch Police called an urgent meeting of Special Branch  police officials in charge of security for important persons,  especially those from diplomatic missions. The non-stop meeting  on 21 March began at 0900 and ended at 1430. A police inspector  reported that there was an instruction at the meeting that  security be stepped up for 24-hour protection of officials and  important persons at foreign embassies. There will be an  increase in the number of security officials guarding residences  of ambassadors as well as embassies, especially the Israeli and  U.S. Embassies. The Thai police will maintain around-the-clock  coordination with the U.S. intelligence service.    An officer of the Metropolitan Police in charge of security  protection for important persons told newsmen that police  officials had been assigned to guard important premises and  residences of important persons, particularly foreign embassies.  The Metropolitan Police will guard the outside areas of the  compound whereas the Special Branch Police will provide security  at the residences of ambassadors and foreign embassies.     "

Investigative Police detectives arrested Pablo David Contreras  Olivos, aka Jose Luis or Joam, yesterday in the vicinity of the  Plaza Italia. Contreras Olivos, who has been identified as the  current number two Lautaro Group leader, was in charge of the  group's military structure. He was arrested along with Maria  Angelica Medina Soto, aka La Cuca. She led the MAPU-Lautaro  [United Popular Action Movement, Lautaro Group].    Through these arrests the police were able to establish that  Guillermo Ossandon was in Cartagena, where he had been residing  for some time. The police arrested Ossandon in a telephone  booth in Cartagena. He did not offer any resistance. Along  with Ossandon, the police also arrested his companions Sandra  del Carmen Ramirez Barahona, and Flor Ines Alcallaga Cepeda.    [Begin Investigative Police Public Relations Chief Luis  Cariz  recording] All the investigations leading to the arrest of these  people were conducted on the basis of a decree issued by Judge  Dreiser, who has already been duly informed. We also asked  Judge Dreiser to authorize an extension of the detention period  in Investigative Police barracks for up to 10 days.    We are now proceeding to compare the existing evidence with  their testimony, so as to establish their involvement in the  numerous crimes with which they have been charged. [end  recording]    The government praised the Investigative Police for their  work, and commended the successful investigation that led to  breaking up the guerrilla group.    [Begin Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco  recording] During the operations officials seized the following  guns: one pistol, four revolvers, nine sawed-off Tamara  shotguns, and two double barrel shotguns.    We must also praise the Investigative Police intelligence  brigade's professionalism in planning and conducting this  operation. We must also praise them for the fact that no one was  injured.    As is well known, in the last couple of years the police  force has been increasingly coordinating its actions to  effectively comply with their role as established in the  Constitution. [end recording]    Guillermo Enrique Ossandon Canas, alias Diego Carvajal,  established the Lautaro Youth Movement in 1983. With a  dissident MAPU group Ossandon was able to establish an  organization that later developed into the Lautaro Rebel and  Popular Front [FRPL] Forces. Since then homicides, bomb attacks,  bank holdups, and armed propaganda actions increased  considerably in Chile.    FRPL forces first centered their actions in the southern  region of Santiago. Later they expanded their operations to  other regions. A few years ago the police arrested some FRPL  leaders. On one occasion the police almost arrested Ossandon,  but he was able to escape. In view of this the Investigative  Police special corps took action only after the entire operation  had been secured. They decided nevertheless to delay the  operation so as not to allow Ossandon to escape in the dark.    The Lautaro Movement leaders were brought in from the coast  aboard an airplane. They are currently under arrest at a  Santiago Investigative Police barracks.    Fearing extremist reprisals, the Investigative Police have  reinforced the guards throughout its units. Moreover, personnel  from several police precincts will take turns watching the  Lautaro Movement leaders.    The Interior Ministry will submit an injunction against the  five arrested Lautaro Movement members, who have been charged  with terrorist actions. In the next few days they will be  placed at the disposal of Judge Arnoldo Dreiser, who is in  charge of investigating the crimes perpetrated by the Lautaro  Group crimes.     "

All of them young. All of them black. All of them found  in empty lots or gutted buildings.    Almost all were prostitutes. Almost all held traces of cocaine in their  systems. Almost all were discovered naked from the waist down, with their legs  spread apart.    Last week, for the first time, the county's chief medical examiner, Dr. Joseph  Davis, pronounced the deaths probable homicides. ""I suspect we are looking at  the work of one man,"" he said.    And the people of Miami, until now largely unaware of the ghastly sequence,  began facing the possibility that a serial killer was in their midst.    For months, detectives and pathologists have been confounded. None of the dead  bodies shows any signs of trauma. No bruises. No internal injuries. No needle  marks.    Even now, investigators remain unsure whether this is a medical mystery or a  criminal one. If prostitutes are being murdered, why no signs of struggle?  After all this time, why no reports of a near miss?    ""When you talk about mysteries in deaths, these are by far the most mysterious  you'll ever find,"" said Miami Police Sgt. David Rivero, who worked some of the  first cases. ""I mean, usually you have a motive or a witness or at least a good  cause of death. Here, forget it.""    All the corpses have been found in the north half of Dade County, though  prostitutes and cocaine are commodities in the south end too. The first death  dates back to September of 1986 -- or even earlier if, as some investigators  figure, the list includes more than 17 names.    For a long time, the prevailing theory about the deaths was a highly unusual  one -- that the prostitutes died from the toxic effects of cocaine accompanied  by the stimulation of sex. Neural exhaustion, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner  Charles Wetli called it.    If true, that would explain the partially disrobed bodies. Cheap hookers often  exchange sex for crack cocaine. They ply their trade in abandoned buildings or  the tall weeds of vacant lots.      Linked to Deaths    The theory has an impressive advocate. Back in the late 1970s, Wetli was among  the first to show that cocaine, even in modest amounts, could lead to death. He  is the co-author of articles commonly cited in texts and journals, implicating  the drug in a variety of fatal illnesses.    Many of the police think the theory is very plausible. ""We're just finding out  all of what crack does to people,"" said John Farrell, chief of detectives for  the county police, which has jurisdiction in most of the deaths.    ""In men, we're finding that crack -- in amounts 10 times lower than a basic  overdose -- sometimes triggers psychotic episodes where a guy just goes  berserk, starts running a real high fever, then just dies.""    Maybe these women, then, were victims of prolonged binges on crack, living on  the edge until even the relatively low arousal of sex-for-hire was enough to  finally induce a fatal reaction.      Seemed Far-Fetched    To some, however, the theory has always seemed far-fetched. Why were the  prostitutes dying in only one part of the county? Or, for that matter, in one  part of the state or the nation?    ""As you went through any medical theory, you always came back to why not this  and why not that,"" Chief Farrell said. ""Same thing with the question of murder.  You always came back to why weren't there any signs of trauma.""    Last fall, meetings began taking place at the senior level between the county  police and the medical examiner's office, Farrell said. Inquiries were made  around the nation. More tests were done on the bodies. Crack was purchased on  the street, then analyzed for toxins.    A flyer was even distributed to prostitutes -- at once a warning and plea for  information: ""If you should experience a reaction to crack cocaine, please  furnish us a sample so we can analyze it. You may save a life!""      Many Theories    Not much came back that was helpful. The hookers had as many theories as the  cops: The drugs. A killer. A killer and his friends.    Then, last December, Body No. 12 was found. Antoinette Burns, 14, died in a  junk-strewn yard under a Brazilian pepper tree. She was lying on her back. Her  skirt was pulled up. Everything fit the pattern.    Or almost everything. The girl's body tested clean for drugs. There was no  evidence she worked the streets.    And that complicated the riddle. Either the teen-ager did not belong on the  list -- or her case tipped the scales further toward homicide.      'Can't Figure It'    What was going on? ""We just can't figure it,"" Chief Farrell said. ""There may be  the possibility of different causes of death. Is there a serial killer? Is  there a medical explanation? Maybe yes to all possibilities.""    The list has grown by five in 1989. More help has been sought.    The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has been consulted regarding  extensive toxicology tests. The FBI in Quantico, Va., has been asked to help  put together the profile of a serial killer.      Forensic Dentist    Dr. Richard Souverin, a well-known forensic dentist, has been called in to  examine the lips of the dead women. One theory suggests that they died from  ""forced fellatio,"" which cut off their air supply.    In that regard, Souverin is also comparing the women's teeth with any marks  found on suspects -- so far unproductively. ""If the skin is broken and a scar  is left, you can make a match,"" he said.    And Dr. George Hensley, who teaches pathology at the University of Miami  Medical School, has been asked to offer his opinion. He believes someone is  suffocating the women in a way that leaves no signs of trauma.    But how? ""You're talking about little girls on the street, and it's not too  hard to asphyxiate them, especially when you have their backs on the ground and  your weight on their abdomen,"" he said.      Escaped Attention    Oddly, in a city where strange crimes ordinarily enjoy a long run of lurid  retelling, this investigation largely escaped the media's attention until a  local weekly, New Times, ran a lengthy cover story about it.    Since then, the airwaves have filled with the views of several of the  participating investigators. Finally, the chief medical examiner weighed in:  probable homicide.    But if so, by whom? And by how many?    There are other questions as well. Amid the sudden glare of publicity, some  wonder if the cases of 17 dead black women -- mostly prostitutes -- have been  given short shrift. The Miami Times, a newspaper for the black community,  charges that there has been an ""intolerable delay"" in solving the cases.      Women's Families    That feeling is shared by some of the women's families. Thelma Rahming, the  grandmother of Antoinette Burns, said the homicide detectives were uninterested  in what she had to say last year. ""Now they're back telling me they're starting  from scratch,"" she said.    Chief Farrell, however, insists the cases have been vigorously investigated all  along. ""And we've reached out to the group we need to, and that's not the  general public,"" he said. ""These are not women just walking down the street  getting accosted. These are women having sex near crack houses.""    And, yes, a prostitute who identified herself only as Lynette along busy  Biscayne Boulevard, said she has been well aware of the deaths -- in fact knew  a few of the victims.    ""A bad dude is taking out the girls,"" she said. ""Of course, we're just a bunch  of black whores. He'd go do it to a white woman and you'd see the FBI, the CIA  and the Marines down here, for a thing like this.""

""We just can't figure it,"" Chief Farrell said. ""There may be  the possibility of different causes of death. Is there a serial killer? Is  there a medical explanation? Maybe yes to all possibilities.""    The list has grown by five in 1989. More help has been sought.    The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has been consulted regarding  extensive toxicology tests. The FBI in Quantico, Va., has been asked to help  put together the profile of a serial killer.      Forensic Dentist    Dr. Richard Souverin, a well-known forensic dentist, has been called in to  examine the lips of the dead women. One theory suggests that they died from  ""forced fellatio,"" which cut off their air supply.    In that regard, Souverin is also comparing the women's teeth with any marks  found on suspects -- so far unproductively. ""If the skin is broken and a scar  is left, you can make a match,"" he said.    And Dr. George Hensley, who teaches pathology at the University of Miami  Medical School, has been asked to offer his opinion. He believes someone is  suffocating the women in a way that leaves no signs of trauma.    But how? ""You're talking about little girls on the street, and it's not too  hard to asphyxiate them, especially when you have their backs on the ground and  your weight on their abdomen,"" he said.      Escaped Attention    Oddly, in a city where strange crimes ordinarily enjoy a long run of lurid  retelling, this investigation largely escaped the media's attention until a  local weekly, New Times, ran a lengthy cover story about it.    Since then, the airwaves have filled with the views of several of the  participating investigators. Finally, the chief medical examiner weighed in:  probable homicide.    But if so, by whom? And by how many?    There are other questions as well. Amid the sudden glare of publicity, some  wonder if the cases of 17 dead black women -- mostly prostitutes -- have been  given short shrift. The Miami Times, a newspaper for the black community,  charges that there has been an ""intolerable delay"" in solving the cases.      Women's Families    That feeling is shared by some of the women's families. Thelma Rahming, the  grandmother of Antoinette Burns, said the homicide detectives were uninterested  in what she had to say last year. ""Now they're back telling me they're starting  from scratch,"" she said.    Chief Farrell, however, insists the cases have been vigorously investigated all  along. ""And we've reached out to the group we need to, and that's not the  general public,"" he said. ""These are not women just walking down the street  getting accosted. These are women having sex near crack houses.""    And, yes, a prostitute who identified herself only as Lynette along busy  Biscayne Boulevard, said she has been well aware of the deaths -- in fact knew  a few of the victims.    ""A bad dude is taking out the girls,"" she said. ""Of course, we're just a bunch  of black whores. He'd go do it to a white woman and you'd see the FBI, the CIA  and the Marines down here, for a thing like this.""      PROSTITUTION; SERIAL MURDERS -- FLORIDA; DRUG ABUSE; COCAINE; MYSTERIES    "

He said in  Pretoria the arrests were made after more than six weeks of  intensive invstigations into a series of far-rightwing terror  attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    Police on Monday arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    The SA Police over the weekend also arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, at the weekend,  Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were  seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni and near  the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was  under police guard in hospital.    ""These arrests, and many others before them, explode the  myth  cultivated by Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National  Congress [ANC] that the SA Police is soft on rightwing  terrorism. ""Once again the SA police have demonstrated that  they will act without fear or favour,"" said Mr Kriel. ""These  arrests should also serve as a serious warning to both right and  left-wing extremists that the SA Police will not for a moment  hesitate to act against anyone who breaks the law, regardless of  political affiliation.""    Mr Kriel believed it was time Mr Mandela paid constructive  and credible attention to his ""criminal self-defence units,  which are trained by MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, [Spear of the Nation  -- armed wing of the ANC]"". If Mr Mandela was interested in  fair play, he would apologise to State President F W de Klerk  and the SA Police for his recent unfounded insults. ""However,  knowing Mr Mandela, this may be too much to ask, considering  that objectivity is not one of his strong points,"" Mr Kriel said.     "

Present at the ceremony were autonomous  regional leaders Guo Jinlong, Yang Chuantang, and (Jiang Cuo);  leaders from the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Armed Police  Corps; and key leaders from units at or above the regimental  level stationed in Lhasa.    Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomus regional  party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional  government, read a decree on the promotion. The decree was  signed by State Council Premier Li Peng and Central Military  Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin. He also spoke on behalf of the  autonomous regional party committee and government. Comrade  Gyaincain Norbu said: Comrade Zhang Zhu's promotion to major  general is not only his personal honor but also an honor for the  Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Armed Police Corps. He  warmly congratulated Comrade Zhang Zhu on behalf of the  autonomous regional party committee and government.    In his speech, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu spoke highly of  Political Commissar Zhang Zhu and all officers and men of the  Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Armed Police Corps. He said:  As the political commissar of the Tibet Autonomous Regional  People's Armed Police Corps and a leader in army building,  Comrade Zhang Zhu has firmly implemented the party's line,  principles, and policies, as well as various directives and  decrees issued by the People's Armed Police Corps and the  autonomous regional party committee, in his past work. He has  always placed his troops under the party's absolute leadership,  united and led members of the autonomous regional party  committee in carrying out various fields of work in army  building, and splendidly accomplished various tasks assigned by  the party and people. Particularly during the struggle to quell  the riots in Lhasa and stabilize Tibet's situation, Comrade  Zhang Zhu led all officers and men in taking a clear-cut stand  at the forefront of the anti-splittist struggle and in  resolutely battling against splittist forces, thus making  remarkable contributions to safeguarding the motherland's unity  and stabilizing Tibet's situation. The autonomous regional  party committee, the autonomous regional people's government,  and people of all nationalities in Tibet are satisfied with the  work carried out by the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Armed  Police Corps and by Comrade Zhang Zhu. He expressed the hope  that Comrade Zhang Zhu would live up to the high expectations of  the party and people, turn his honor into a driving force, do a  better job of uniting and leading all officers and men of the  Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Armed Police Corps in  thoroughly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, unify the thinking of officers and men with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, guide troop construction by upholding  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new  period, and make new contributions to Tibet's economic  construction, reform, and opening up.    Major General Zhang Zhu, political commissar of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional People's Armed Police Corps, spoke. He  said: Today, I am being honored with the title of major  general. This is the result of the care shown toward me by  higher party organizations and leaders at all levels, of their  efforts to educate and train me, and of the full support and  assistance of officers and men of armed police troops across the  region. It is the greatest encouragement and inspiration both  for me and for the People's Armed Police Corps. I am determined  to live up to the high expectations of the party and people by  uniting and leading armed police officers and men throughout the  region, under the leadership of the autonomous regional party  committee, government, and People's Armed Police Corps, in  seriously studying and implementing the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Fifth  Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional  Party Committee; by fully implementing the party's line,  principles and policies; and by further building up and leading  my troops so that they will truly become faithful defenders of  the party and people, serve as daggers with which to cope with  riots and contingencies, and make new contributions to opposing  splittism, defending the motherland's unity, strengthening  national unity, and safeguarding Tibet's economic construction.

The message said that the  fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still  hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has  shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to  assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same  embassy. ""Major targets are high- level officials of the U.S.  and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and  some other embassies,"" the source said.    The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence  authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the  truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is  believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But  the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near  the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the  Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to  investigate how the briefcase disappeared. [passage omitted]    There will be an increase in the number of security  officials  guarding residences of ambassadors as well as embassies,  especially the Israeli and U.S. Embassies.

The trafficker is still at large,  somewhere in the state, despite the incessant pursuit conducted  by federal agents. During December, the Rio Civil Police sought  fame, attempting to achieve it by capturing Chico Mendes's  killers, the rancher Darli Alves da Silva and his son, Darci  Alves Pereira, who were hiding at a site on the outskirts of  Nova Iguacu. However, the information was ""leaked,"" and the pair  escaped.    For over 10 years, the American trafficker, William Reed  Elswick, aka ""Captain America,"" has been living with impunity in  Brazil (despite the consecutive requests from the U.S.  Government for his extradition), thanks to a fortune estimated  at $20 million.    ""Livinho"" or ""Dom Xereta,"" Darli, Darci, and ""Captain  America"" are the main characters in the stories that the  Federal, Civil, and Military Police prefer not to tell. They are  serial accounts of the secret operations conducted by them that  have not attained the desired success. Lack of good fortune or  resources, ""leaks"" of information, incompetence, the Brazilian  legislation itself, the slowness of the justice system, or  police corruption explain the failures of those searches. In the  Polinter-Rio [Rio Interstate Police] agency alone, there are  over 300,000 arrest warrants against criminals in the state or  in other units of the Federation that the police have failed to  implement.    Currently, in Rio de Janeiro, the three forces' major  concern  is to abort the embryonic drug cartel organized by the Red  Command [CV] traffickers, Orlando da Conceicao, aka ""Orlando  Jogador,"" and Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka ""Garoto."" According to  the Civil Police top echelon, the concept of the most dangerous  outlaws in the state changed after the charges made by X-9 (a  pimp), Ivan Custodio de Lima, the principal witness of the  Vigario Geral massacre. The publicity concerning police  extortion also has been cited as a prime factor in the failures  of operations planned for capturing dangerous outlaws.    Among the three forces' rank and file, however, the view is  that the limits imposed by the Brizola government on the police  are making the criminals' lives easy.    The Federal Police superintendent in Rio, officer Edson  Antonio de Oliveira, now claims that the weakness in the  Brazilian legislation and the lack of an international agreement  that would hasten the issuance of arrest warrants are  obstructing police action. Interpol maintains that the Mafia has  a base of operations in South America, with ramifications in  Brazil, notably in Rio. However, to capture a ""Mafioso,"" the PF  must wait for an arrest warrant from an Italian judge. The  warrant takes up to a year to arrive.    `Captain America' Still At Large    Capturing William Reed Elswick, ""Captain America,"" became  such a great obsession for the PF superintendent in Rio, Edson  Antonio de Oliveira, that it caused him to confuse the  ""mega-trafficker"" with his accomplice, the American businessman  Donald Anthony Kohel. In April of last year, Kohel was arrested  in Sao Conrado with marijuana, weapons, and photos of nude minor  girls. The federal agents rejoiced, thinking that they had  actually captured Elswick. The confusion was dispelled when the  PF received ""Captain America's"" fingerprints from the FBI.    It was a disappointment for Edson Antonio de Oliveira, who  had managed to capture Elswick in Rio during January 1985. The  American trafficker was released 11 days later by virtue of a  habeas corpus signed by the then president of the Federal  Supreme Court [STF], Joao Batista Cordeiro Guerra, now deceased.  Ten days after Elswick's release, the STF unanimously revoked  Cordeiro Guerra's decision. It was too late: ""Captain America""  had already escaped. To Oliveiro's even greater disappointment,  the trafficker's double and accomplice, Donald Kohel, also  obtained a habeas corpus, was released two days after his  arrest, and fled. The Federal Police were left with the  consolation of having arrested another accomplice of ""Captain  America,"" the trafficker Terry Mike Lee, aged 40. [passage  omitted]    `Orlando Jogador' Has Special Protection    If the police have, for six months, been unable to find the  one in charge of the embryonic Rio drug cartel, trafficker  Orlando da Conceicao, aka ""Orlando Jogador,"" it is because there  are policemen implicated with the outlaw. The suspicion on the  part of the new Civil Police secretary, Jorge Mario Gomes, was  confirmed by the arrest of detective Cesar Pereira da Silva in  December. Identified as ""Orlando Jogador's"" security chief, the  policeman was arrested with the trafficker Miguel Silveira de  Miranda and two women in an apartment on Jose Bonifacio Street  in Meier.    The Civil Police Narcotics Repression Division [DRE] has had  the same difficulty in arresting Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, known  as ""Ue"" or ""Garoto,"" who supplies cocaine to ""Orlando Jogador""  and other Rio traffickers. According to the DRE detectives,  ""Ue's"" security force consists of Civil and Military Police  members as well as prison agents. The two outlaws have always  been informed of the operations mounted to capture them long  before they were due to be carried out. The police action  against them is doomed to failure. Like ""Ue"" and ""Jogador,""  nearly 300,000 outlaws sought by the Brazilian justice system  are living peacefully in Rio de Janeiro.    Trafficker Livio Bruni Had Plastic Surgery, Returned to Rio    The target of various Federal Police operations during the  past 12 months, the trafficker Livio Cecchini Bruni Junior,  called ""Livinho,"" and also known as ""Dom Xereta,"" ""Padrinho,"" or  ""Snake,"" is, like the rancher, Darli Alves dos Santos and his  son, Darci, also located in Rio de Janeiro. Even Civil Police  members were involved in the search for Livio Bruni Junior, but  they have been unsuccessful thus far. The agents are hampered by  the lack of a recent photo of the Brazilian ""Mafioso."" According  to the agents, Bruni Junior altered his appearance completely by  undergoing minor plastic surgery on his face.    ""Livinho"" arrived in Rio with three other Italian  traffickers  linked to the Sicilian Mafia, whose identities the Federal  Police prefer to keep secret. It was not until after the four  fugitives from Italian justice (Bruni Junio is a fugitive from  Brazilian justice as well) had entered Brazil and changed their  identities that the Federal Police traced their entry into the  country through Rio International Airport. According to the  police, ""Dom Xereta"" returned to resume an old plan: that of  being the ""Mafia's man"" in Brazil. The PF have already tracked  ""Livinho's"" passage through Buzios and Angra dos Reis, where  they attempted to corner him. Livio Bruni Junior has been  charged in Rio, Niteroi, and Teresopolis with drug trafficking,  murders, and kidnappings.     "

ACTION:     Notice of States subject to the waiting period provision of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and States having alternative systems, and a list of chief law enforcement officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.             SUMMARY:     Beginning on February 28, 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act imposes a 5-day waiting period on the sale, delivery, or transfer of a handgun in States that do not require a background check. ATF is issuing this notice to inform Federal firearms licensees of the States that do not currently require a background check, as well as those States requiring a background check for handgun purchasers. In addition, ATF has compiled a list of chief law enforcement officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     James P. Ficaretta, Revenue Programs Division, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226 (2029278230).          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Background         On November 30, 1993, Public Law 103159 (107 Stat. 1536) was enacted, amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended (18 U.S.C. Chapter 44). Title I of Pub. L. 103159, cited as the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act'' (hereafter ``the Act'') provides, in part, for a national waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual.     The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of the law are effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to apply on November 30, 1998. The statute also provides alternatives to the waiting period provisions.     On February 14, 1994, ATF issued temporary regulations implementing the provisions of Public Law 103159 (T.D. ATF354, 59 FR 7110).     During February, letters were sent to all Federal firearms licensees advising them as to whether their sales or other dispositions were subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period or their State background check system. In addition, licensees in States which are subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period were advised of the designated chief law enforcement officers in their State.    ATF has completed a study of relevant State laws to determine which States are subject to the federal waiting period provisions and which qualify as ``alternative'' States. Information regarding each category is set out below:         States Subject to the Federal Five Day Waiting Period and Their Respective Chief Law Enforcement Officers for Brady Purposes     Alabama         The County Sheriff.         Alaska         The Chief of Police in areas having a police department.     The Alaska State Troopers in areas without a Chief of Police.         Arizona         The Chief of Police in incorporated areas and the County Sheriff in unincorporated areas. In Maricopa County, the Chief of Police, Phoenix Police Department for both the City of Phoenix and all other municipalities in the metropolitan Phoenix area.

ACTION:     Notice of States subject to the waiting period provision of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and States having alternative systems, and a list of chief law enforcement officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.             SUMMARY:     Beginning on February 28, 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act imposes a 5-day waiting period on the sale, delivery, or transfer of a handgun in States that do not require a background check. ATF is issuing this notice to inform Federal firearms licensees of the States that do not currently require a background check, as well as those States requiring a background check for handgun purchasers. In addition, ATF has compiled a list of chief law enforcement officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     James P. Ficaretta, Revenue Programs Division, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226 (2029278230).          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Background         On November 30, 1993, Public Law 103159 (107 Stat. 1536) was enacted, amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended (18 U.S.C. Chapter 44). Title I of Pub. L. 103159, cited as the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act'' (hereafter ``the Act'') provides, in part, for a national waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual.     The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of the law are effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to apply on November 30, 1998. The statute also provides alternatives to the waiting period provisions.     On February 14, 1994, ATF issued temporary regulations implementing the provisions of Public Law 103159 (T.D. ATF354, 59 FR 7110).     During February, letters were sent to all Federal firearms licensees advising them as to whether their sales or other dispositions were subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period or their State background check system. In addition, licensees in States which are subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period were advised of the designated chief law enforcement officers in their State.    ATF has completed a study of relevant State laws to determine which States are subject to the federal waiting period provisions and which qualify as ``alternative'' States. Information regarding each category is set out below:         States Subject to the Federal Five Day Waiting Period and Their Respective Chief Law Enforcement Officers for Brady Purposes     Alabama         The County Sheriff.

Three of the men were shot, one was stabbed and a fifth man -- possibly a  suspect -- was also wounded. Police believe a fifth man was involved because  they saw a trail of blood leading away from the scene. Police followed the  trail but were unable to find him.    Police say the incident began about 9:45 p.m. with a fight inside the La  Iguerita bar, a pool hall and sports bar in the 6300 block of Yucca Street. The  fight apparently spilled out into the street.    It was not immediately clear what led to the fight, but by the time police had  arrived, bodies were strewn along a block-long stretch. None of the men, all  Latino, was immediately identified. Two were said to be in their 30s and two in  their mid-20s. The age of the fifth man was unknown.    LAPD Officer Roy Rogers said that when he arrived at the scene, he found one  man lying on the sidewalk outside of the bar. That man had been shot at least  once.    The fight apparently continued west on Yucca, to the corner of Yucca and  Cahuenga Boulevard, where a second man was found. Police found one more victim  near a 7-Eleven store and the fourth outside the Hollywood 8 Motel in the 1800  block of Cahuenga.    As police moved in with helicopters and dogs, two suspects were at one point  said to be holed up in a nearby hotel shortly before 11 p.m. Friday. That  report proved to be false.    In addition to the man who dripped a trail of blood, police were looking for at  least three other men involved in the incident.    LAPD Lt. Pete Durham said two of the wounded were critically injured. Two were  taken to Cedars Sinai Hospital, where one died, according to a hospital  spokeswoman. One man was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank and one to  Kaiser Foundation Hospital on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Their conditions  were not immediately available.    Police said they did not immediately know the motive for the incident, which  one officer described as a ""good old street fight."" One witness called it a  drug deal gone bad. Police said several narcotics arrests have been made at the  bar in the past.    About the same time as the Hollywood shooting, police were called to the scene  of a homicide at La Tijera Boulevard and Centinela Avenue in Westchester, where  one person had been shot to death.

David Wayne Sconce, 33, was charged with poisoning Timothy R. Waters, 24, a  rival Burbank mortician, in 1985. The motive, according to Los Angeles County  Assistant Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss, was to keep Waters from  exposing activities at the Lamb Funeral Home where Sconce worked.    Sconce is now serving a five-year prison term after pleading guilty last April  to 21 criminal counts involving the mingling of human remains, the theft of  body parts and the removal of gold teeth from cadavers at the funeral home. It  was these activities that Giss alleges Sconce was trying to keep secret by  poisoning Waters.    Sconce's parents, Laurieanne Lamb Sconce and Jerry Sconce, are awaiting trial  on charges of mingling remains and other charges connected with activities at  the funeral home. The allegations amounted to the ""worst scandal I've ever  seen, or that I could ever imagine,"" California Cemetery Board Executive  Officer John W. Gill said in 1988.    Bruce Lamb, an uncle of David Sconce who is now running the family mortuary,  said he believes in his nephew's innocence. He said the murder charges, on top  of the earlier accusations, have ""devastated"" the family.    According to Giss, the case began in the 1970s when Laurieanne Lamb Sconce took  over the operation of the 67-year-old Lamb Funeral Home.    In 1982, according to Giss, David Sconce took control of the Pasadena  Crematorium in Altadena, a part of the family operation. He started a business  called Coastal Cremations Inc., taking in bodies for cremation on behalf of  other mortuaries throughout Southern California for as little as $55 each.    ""They tried to corner the market,"" said Joe Estephan, the funeral director of  the Cremation Society of California.    At the same time, Waters began operating the Alpha Society cremation service in  Burbank, Giss said. In January, 1985, Giss said, Waters told a friend, Richard  Gray, that the Lamb Funeral Home was doing multiple cremations -- packing more  than one body into the ovens, making it impossible to be sure whose remains  were delivered to survivors.    Giss said Gray relayed the information about Waters to Sconce. Giss also said  Waters was intending to turn Sconce in to state funeral regulators.    In February, 1985, Waters was beaten at his office, and Sconce was charged with  assault. He pleaded guilty.    Then in April, 1985, Waters died at his parents' home in Camarillo after  becoming ill while baby-sitting for his sister in Malibu. The cause of death  was originally listed as a heart attack.    But Dr. Fredrick Rieders, a Pennsylvania expert on oleander poisoning brought  in by Los Angeles authorities, later said after an analysis of blood samples  from Waters' body that oleander poisoning was the true cause of death.    While one witness said that he saw Sconce slip an unknown substance into  Waters' drink at a restaurant, prosecutors said they were uncertain how the  alleged poisoning occurred.    Deaths from oleander poisoning are rare, but a number have occurred over the  years. Some cases are accidental, as in a California case several years ago  when a woman died after brewing an oleander tea from what she thought were  harmless leaves.    Giss said he believes that this is the first time anyone has been prosecuted  for using oleander as a murder weapon in the United States, although there had  been at least one prosecution involving the use of oleander as a folk medicine.

In 1982, according to Giss, David Sconce took control of the Pasadena  Crematorium in Altadena, a part of the family operation. He started a business  called Coastal Cremations Inc., taking in bodies for cremation on behalf of  other mortuaries throughout Southern California for as little as $55 each.    ""They tried to corner the market,"" said Joe Estephan, the funeral director of  the Cremation Society of California.    At the same time, Waters began operating the Alpha Society cremation service in  Burbank, Giss said. In January, 1985, Giss said, Waters told a friend, Richard  Gray, that the Lamb Funeral Home was doing multiple cremations -- packing more  than one body into the ovens, making it impossible to be sure whose remains  were delivered to survivors.    Giss said Gray relayed the information about Waters to Sconce. Giss also said  Waters was intending to turn Sconce in to state funeral regulators.    In February, 1985, Waters was beaten at his office, and Sconce was charged with  assault. He pleaded guilty.    Then in April, 1985, Waters died at his parents' home in Camarillo after  becoming ill while baby-sitting for his sister in Malibu. The cause of death  was originally listed as a heart attack.    But Dr. Fredrick Rieders, a Pennsylvania expert on oleander poisoning brought  in by Los Angeles authorities, later said after an analysis of blood samples  from Waters' body that oleander poisoning was the true cause of death.    While one witness said that he saw Sconce slip an unknown substance into  Waters' drink at a restaurant, prosecutors said they were uncertain how the  alleged poisoning occurred.    Deaths from oleander poisoning are rare, but a number have occurred over the  years. Some cases are accidental, as in a California case several years ago  when a woman died after brewing an oleander tea from what she thought were  harmless leaves.    Giss said he believes that this is the first time anyone has been prosecuted  for using oleander as a murder weapon in the United States, although there had  been at least one prosecution involving the use of oleander as a folk medicine.

San Diego's Police Officers Assn. supports the release of statistical  information, but objects to complainants being told of the disposition, because  they know the identity of the officer and might make the information public.    The concern of officers about this is understandable; for most people,  personnel matters are confidential. But police officers are not most people.  They serve the public and are granted the legal right to use lethal force. And,  if a complaint procedure is to be meaningful, the complainant has to be told  the disposition of his complaint.

Although the new unit's establishment orders do not  specifically indicate the civilian population that is to be the  target of the Military Police unit's operations, knowledgeable  defense establishment sources noted that recent developments,  the equipment designated for the unit, and its operational  methods all indicate that the unit will mainly operate against  the violent Jewish sector in the West Bank.    These troops' operational methods and equipment will be  similar to those used by the Israel Police rally dispersing  units.    The decision on the establishment of the unit was made by  the  late Major General Nehemya Tamari, the former Central Command  commander. The unit will be officially announced on 8 May.     "

By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Oxnard police have discovered an innovative way to use the common telephone as  a tool for preventing and solving perplexing crimes. The new crime-busting  tool, which employs a specially programmed personal computer and a long list of  telephone numbers, was used last December to solve a rash of burglaries in a  west Oxnard neighborhood.    Police had arrested three juveniles who admitted to burglarizing dozens of cars  in a neighborhood near Wooley and Victoria roads. The problem was that police  had very few burglary reports in that neighborhood.    Using a common personal computer with an automatic telephone-dialing program,  employees at the Police Department's crime analysis office conducted a  telephone survey of the neighborhood. The computer called 350 residences in two  days and played a recorded message that asked residents to call police if they  had been the victim of theft.    The plan worked. Police received 24 calls from residents who said their cars  had been burglarized, said David Keith, senior crime analyst. The burglary  victims were identified and reunited with their stolen tools and tape decks,  and the culprits were put behind bars, Keith said.    It was not the only case in which the microchip has helped police triumph over  crime.    Keith said the computer has been used in recent months on other duties. It has  helped identify witnesses to a brutal assault, warn banks and stores about a  check-forgery ring and ask employees at 24-hour gas stations and mini-markets  to be on the lookout for a robbery suspect.    Santa Barbara police have used a similar computer to warn specific businesses  and residents about crime trends, Keith said. But, he said, Oxnard is the only  city in the country to use this type of computer technology to solve crimes,  such as the automobile burglary case.    The computer, known in the Police Department as the crime alert bulletin  system, is being used to solve another rash of burglaries in central Oxnard,  near Wooley and Ventura roads.    The Police Department bought the $6,000 computer in October with money seized  from drug offenders, Keith said. ""Some drug dealer who is sitting in jail right  now doesn't know it, but he helped pay for this thing.""    ""I think it's great,"" said Marie Carbone, an employee at One Stop Market on  Wooley Road. Carbone said she received a call via the computer on Thursday that  warned her that someone was trying to cash stolen checks.    The warning was written down and posted in the store for all employees to see,  she said.    Crime Prevention Coordinator Jennifer Quinlan, who operates the computer and  provides the voice for the recordings, said the computer can provide recordings  in English or Spanish. Residents can select the language with the push of a  button.    The computer is programmed to hang up on answering machines or when no one is  at home and then call back later.    When someone answers, that person is greeted with a terse announcement: ""This  is the Oxnard Police Department with a very important message for you . . .

The collaboration of the Los Angeles Police Department with the Immigration and  Naturalization Service in the Latino communities should be halted immediately.  Their joint operations are discriminatory measures that are damaging relations  between Latinos and the Police Department.    For several months Latinos have protested Police Department harassment of day  laborers at sites where immigrants and refugees gather to seek work. The Police  Department maintains that it is enforcing anti-loitering laws and answering  complaints from local residents and business persons that the presence of the  day laborers blights their neighborhood.    The plight of immigrants and refugees in our country is largely an economic  problem. It is not one of crime. The day laborers, for example, are mainly  immigrants, most of whom did not qualify for the amnesty legalization program  and who are trying to eke out survival without resorting to other methods. Our  city government apparently recognized this dilemma and recently allocated funds  to establish a pilot project to create and coordinate job pickup sites for day  laborers. It was a wise and compassionate move. By assisting desperate workers  trying to survive by working, the city discourages people from turning to crime  as an alternative, defuses a divisive social problem and helps to promote  harmony.    However, in a clear contradiction, the Police Department has been participating  in joint raids with the INS at labor pickup sites.    On June 30, the department combined forces in a daylight ""drug"" raid of  MacArthur and Lafayette parks, in the heart of the Salvadoran community.    The collaboration of the Police Department with INS is sowing Latino community  anger and distrust against the department and city government. It is creating  the fear that city-sponsored labor pickup sites may be traps for INS raids. The  raids are inconsistent with the 1986 City Council resolution providing that the  city will not report undocumented persons to the INS unless they have committed  multiple misdemeanors or a serious felony.    The Police Department actions also violate the longstanding department policy  not to use city funds to enforce federal immigration laws. The policy, like the  1986 resolution, was designed precisely to encourage undocumented immigrants  and refugees to cooperate with law enforcement and other government agencies by  reporting crimes and serving as witnesses.    Police officials justify police partici-pation in the raids at labor pickup  siteson the grounds that they are providing backup for the INS. However, their  presence has been pervasive and they have played an active role in the arrests.    As far as the community is concerned, we are witnessing police officers  conducting immigration raids alongside immigration agents and immigration  agents participating in police raids. Unfortunately, this is the direct result  of well-intentioned but ill-conceived efforts of some City Council members to  address the crime problem in the Latino community.    INS raids differ in objective from police drug raids. INS raids in the Latino  communities are general searches made without warrants to ferret out the  undocumented. They are unconstitutional and discriminatory because they target  people on the basis of skin color, language or community in which they live,  work or enjoy recreation, regardless of immigration status.    Police raids, on the other hand, should be based on previously gathered  intelligence and target identified, suspected criminals. But when the INS and  Police Department conduct joint raids, the operations necessarily become  immigration raids. They may apprehend some criminals, but they target and  capture in their net many innocent persons who are then taken prisoner by INS  agents if they are undocumented.    For example, in the MacArthur and Lafayette parks raid, hundreds of persons at  the park were questioned, not only the ""known drug traffickers,"" during four  hours of widespread general panic. Only 78 persons were arrested and more than  half of them were not charged with crimes but were arrested for being  undocumented. Others, including U.S. citizens, documented persons, children,  young people playing soccer and the homeless who just happened to be at the  park were checked by the INS and released.    Latinos are just as concerned as anyone about increasing crime. They are  involved in citywide grass-roots, anti-crime efforts. But the INS has been a  threat to us and our families and the increasing collaboration of the  department with the INS could cause many to withdraw from cooperating with the  police in those efforts.    Criminals come from all class and national origins. The use of the INS at  police anti-crime operations against Latinos is discriminatory, singles out  immigrants and makes them scapegoats for crime rates.    If local law enforcement does not want to erase the progress made in the  efforts to build the trust and support of immigrants for crime-control efforts,  then the police should halt its participation with INS in raids and other  operations.    Police agencies must deal with our community as with any other community.  Target the criminals among us based on their crimes, not their immigration  status.

If local law enforcement does not want to erase the progress made in the  efforts to build the trust and support of immigrants for crime-control efforts,  then the police should halt its participation with INS in raids and other  operations.    Police agencies must deal with our community as with any other community.  Target the criminals among us based on their crimes, not their immigration  status.

In Police Review magazine he accuses Mr Paul Condon, Metropolitan Police commissioner, of raising the spectre of bureaucracy to oppose attempts to link reward with effort. The Police Federation, he says, is displaying a 'special kind of prejudice' in arguing that the recommendations would centralise power.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The PF made a similar seizure on the 23d of last month when  it found $36,000 in the luggage of passenger Eldon Barreira  Castelo Branco, 25. In both cases, the route was the same: the  passengers had boarded a Varig flight bound for Manaus from the  municipality of Tabatinga, Amazonas, across the border from  Leticia, Colombia.    Paula Sobrinho and Nunes de Souza were approached by police  as they were waiting for the connecting flight to Para. Giving  an appearance of calm, they both denied carrying anything  illegal, but upon being searched, they were found to be in  possession of the false banknotes. The dollars had been packed  in bundles, each containing $10,000 in $100 bills. Paula  Sobrinho and Nuno de Souza had covered the packages with plastic  and attached them to their bodies using adhesive tape. Upon  being caught in the act, the passengers told Police Chief  Claudio Rosas that the money had been acquired in Tabatinga. As  had been true with the dollars seized from Castelo Branco on the  23d, the PF discovered that the almost perfect banknotes were  counterfeit only after expert analysis.    Police Chief Rosas said that the two passengers must belong  to the same gang as Castelo Branco. That gang seems to be part  of an international scheme, since there have been other seizures  in various places around the country. According to him, the  dollars are probably being produced in Leticia. The Federal  Police want to conduct a joint investigation with Colombian  police.     "

SUMMARY:     The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing an interpretive regulation addressing the agency's citation policy regarding voluntary employee rescue activities.

Telephone: (202) 2198615.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     In carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA from time to time investigates workplace incidents which involve not only injuries to workers directly exposed to hazards, but injuries and potential injuries to employees who voluntarily attempt to rescue or assist their fellow workers. OSHA is aware of many instances in which employees have voluntarily rescued coworkers or rendered emergency assistance in the aftermath of workplace accidents, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves. Until recently, there has been no written instruction by OSHA to its field offices providing guidance in such situations. Accordingly, the agency has decided to issue an interpretive rule clarifying its citation policy regarding employers whose employees perform or attempt to perform rescues of individuals in life-threatening danger.          It is not OSHA's policy to interfere with or to regulate every decision by a worker to place himself at risk to save another individual. Nor is it OSHA's policy to issue citations to employers whose employees voluntarily undertake acts of heroism to save another individual from imminent harm, where rescue operations are not part of the employee's job responsibilities and the likelihood that a rescue may become necessary is not reasonably foreseeable.    At the same time, employers who have employees working in environments where the possibility of life-threatening accidents is reasonably foreseeable are required by various OSHA standards and the general duty clause to take appropriate precautions to assure that the rescuers themselves do not become victims.     See, e.g., Pride Oil Well Service,     15 BNAOSHC 1808 (Rev. Comm.1992); ARO. Inc., 1 BNAOSHC 1453 (Rev. Com. 1973). Accidents requiring rescue efforts are reasonably foreseeable in certain working environments such as, for example, trenches and excavations, hazardous waste operations and emergency response work, or construction work over water. Confined spaces are another occupational setting where rescuers, without proper equipment and precautions, often are killed or injured. ``Worker Deaths in Confined Spaces: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports'', National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, No. 94103 (1994).    Because the occurrence of accidents which invite rescue attempts is foreseeable in various industrial processes and environments, a variety of OSHA standards include precautions and safeguards for rescue-related operations, including,     e.g.,     the emergency planning and response provisions of the process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(n), and hazardous waste operations standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(1), (p) and (q); and the standards on confined spaces in general industry, 29 CFR 1910.146, and in grain handling, 1910.272(d), (e), and (g).

Police said that tropical fish shop proprietor Yoshitaka  Udagawa, 31, purchased an arowana from another tropical fish  shop owner in Tokyo in June 1992.    The carnivorous fish, for which some tropical fish  enthusiasts in Japan will pay hundreds of thousands of yen each,  is protected under the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the so-called  Washington Convention,    Police said Udagawa failed to fulfill a legal requirement to  register the arowana purchase with the Environment Agency within  30 days.    He subsequently compounded his troubles with the law by  selling the unregistered arowana in July 1993 to a man in  Kushiro, Hokkaido, without informing the agency of the  transaction.    Masato Sasaki, 38, the Arowana's new owner, similarly failed  to comply with legal requirements when he purchased the arowana  from Udagawa and resold it to a tropical fish shop in Obihiro.    Representatives of Traffic Japan, which monitors the illegal  wildlife trade, said two separate cases of illegal trade of  arowana in Japan were exposed in November and a third case in  February.

In his opening address, Major General Zhang Zhu, political  commissar of the Tibet Armed Police Corps, said: The guiding  ideology and main tasks of this meeting are, using Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance and based on a series of General  Secretary Jiang Zemin's important instructions on building up  the armed police force, to diligently study and carry out the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, the expanded meeting of the CPC Committee of the  Armed Police Corps, the Fifth Expanded Plenary Meeting of the  Fourth Tibet Regional CPC Committee, the Tibet Regional Meeting  on Public Security and Judicial Work, and the meeting of  directors of public security departments (bureaus); to sum up  the Tibet Armed Police Corps' work of 1993; to lay down a plan  for its work for 1994; and to mobilize all officers and men to  study the situation and to work in a down-to-earth manner, in  order to accomplish all tasks entrusted by the higher  authorities, to strive to raise the Corps' troop building to a  new level, and to make greater contributions to preserving the  motherland's unification and to maintaining Tibet's stability.    Zhang Zhu pointed out: In the new situation, the  responsibilities of the armed police are even more arduous.  This year is a crucial one in which the country will deepen  reform and develop a socialist market economic system. In this  year, Tibet also will launch some major reform measures. These  measures will inevitably result in the adjustment of interests  and relationships between various sectors, and some new  destabilizing factors will emerge in the course of reform.  Therefore, maintaining stability is very important -- without a  stable social environment, Tibet's economic construction cannot  be carried out smoothly. The developing situation urgently  requires that we quicken the pace of construction, improve our  performance, and raise our work to a new level in the new year.

This is  the first time that our country has extended its police  authority to the South China Sea to reassert our sovereignty  over the South China Sea. The police patrol boats were to link  up at Taiping Island with Yu-hsun No.2 boat and naval warships  which went there by separate routes. Their operations have so  far been kept secret. The patrol boats are on their way home  and will arrive in Kaohsiung today or tomorrow.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its No. 2  and  No. 3 patrol boats, led by Chang Chen-chung, chief secretary of  the police group, set out from the No. 2 harbor at Kaohsiung at  1930 on 16 April with a dozen or so high-ranking police officers  on board, including Hou Chin-tsung, commander of the second  battalion of the Seventh Security Police Group. Besides a dozen  or so crew members, each boat also has on board more than a  dozen policemen from the Fourth Company of the Seventh Security  Police Group, armed with machineguns and Uzi submachineguns.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, our fishing  boats have frequently been detained by the Philippines and  Vietnam and piracy has been a serious threat to the lives and  property of our fishermen operating in the South China Sea in  recent years. Our country's South China Sea policy clearly  calls for strengthened police patrols to protect our fishermen.  For this reason, our first police patrol there serves to signal  to the international community our reassertion of sovereignty  over the South China Sea. Since the high level [of government]  attaches considerable importance to this police patrol, it has  been carried out after six months of prudent planning.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its patrol  boats are performing duties around Taiping Island for the first  time. The main purpose is to test navigational safety between  Taiwan and Taiping Island and to survey the waters around the  island to prepare for stationing a police company on the island  in the future.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, the No. 2  and  No. 3 patrol boats are on their way home, expected to arrive in  Kaohsiung harbor today or tomorrow. Its Fourth Company,  stationed in Kaohsiung, has four patrol boats -- the  800-ton-class No. 1 boat, the 400-ton-class No. 2 and No. 3  boats, and the 200-ton-class No. 5 boat. Some of the boats may  be diverted to perform duties around Taiping Island in the  future.     "

Both have close ties with international  drug rings, according to an officer at the Taipei city police  headquarters.    Police began an investigation of the two late last year  after  discovering they might have ties with a drug trafficking ring  headed by Lin Kwang-cheng. Lin was arrested last December.    Police found that the two men had developed an islandwide  drug distribution network and maintained close relations with  international drug traffickers.    Chang Chi-ching told the police that the drugs seized in  Tuesday's raid were smuggled into Taiwan from Bangkok in early  February.    ""The drugs were smuggled into Taiwan at the Chiching fishing  port near Kaohsiung on the eve of the lunar new year holiday,""  Chang said.    He admitted that his ring used to smuggle heroin into Taiwan  from Thailand's Golden Triangle and re-export the drug to the  United States and Italy. Because of sluggish sales in the  American and European markets in recent years, Chang said his  group began to make inroads into the Southeast Asian market.     "

By JANE FRITSCH and RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      In a series of abrupt moves over the last month, Mayor Tom Bradley has begun  reshaping the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners into an activist body  that will challenge the way the Police Department is run, according to his  aides and several City Council members.    Bradley and a growing number of council members say they want a commission that  will tackle tough policy matters, aggressively investigate police misconduct  and evaluate the performance of Chief Daryl F. Gates.    ""The mayor wants an active, progressive Police Commission,"" said Deputy Mayor  Mark Fabiani, ""and he's determined to appoint commissioners who will take  seriously the responsibility of directing the department.""    An activist commission would be a marked departure from the style of the  current five-member panel that oversees the 8,400-member Police Department.    In a session typical of its weekly meetings, the commission on Tuesday met for  20 minutes, taking up routine matters like granting parade permits and  canceling security alarm licenses -- all at a time when controversies are  swirling around Gates and his department.    While commissioners were silent, Bradley was moving quickly. He demanded an  investigation of possible police impropriety in the so-called ""39th and Dalton""  drug raid, ordered a management audit of the Police Department and, in an  unusual public exchange of insults, he criticized Gates for having made ""dumb""  remarks.    In rapid succession, the mayor replaced one commissioner with a longtime  political ally, attorney-lobbyist Dan Garcia, and then announced that  Commission President Robert M. Talcott would be resigning Dec. 1.    Bradley periodically shakes up the city's numerous commissions, sometimes  because they drift too close to the officials they are supposed to monitor,  sources said.    Two months ago, shortly after Gates was sharply criticized for suggesting that  casual drug users should be shot, the Police Commission, rather than  questioning him in public about his remark, gave him a round of applause to  mark the anniversary of his 41 years of service.    If the commission begins to assert greater authority, sources said, the 1990s  could be a time of turmoil for a city agency long accustomed to enacting its  own agenda with little interference.    For Gates, the changes could be a watershed. A range of critics within and  outside the department have said that after 12 years as chief, Gates sometimes  appears uninterested in the details of his job. Sources said privately that the  commission will expect Gates to become more deeply involved in managing the  department or step aside.    Gates, however, recently expressed confidence in his job at a press conference  at Parker Center, and stressed that he was not going to leave the department  until he was ready to go.    ""This is a well-run department,"" the chief said. ""I manage well. I may not do a  lot of things. I may have a big mouth. But I know how to manage a police  department. I know how to manage an organization like this.""    He also denied allegations that he had ""co-opted"" the current police  commissioners into supporting his policies. ""What's wrong with the fact that  we're getting along?"" he asked. ""What's wrong with the fact that the Board of  Police Commissioners and I are seeing eye-to-eye?""    In the 1970s, the commission forced several changes in the Police Department,  such as a crackdown on police intelligence-gathering activities and a revision  of the department's shooting policy.    However, in the last decade, the panel has been reluctant to buck the  department on a number of controversial issues.    In 1983, after months of negotiations sought by the homosexual community, the  commission recommended changes in department policy to encourage active  recruitment of homosexuals, including advertisements in gay and lesbian  publications. However, Gates objected and the policy was never enforced.    This fall, the commission balked at conducting an inquiry into the propriety of  Gates' public pronouncement that casual drug users ""ought to be taken out and  shot."" Bending to pressure from the City Council, the commission changed course  and promised an inquiry.    And, the commission took a back seat to the department in ongoing  investigations stemming from a drug raid two years ago during which police  officers trashed a number of apartments near 39th Street and Dalton Avenue.    Outgoing president Talcott said in a recent deposition that he had only a  ""general idea"" of the scope of the 39th and Dalton investigations. His lack of  knowledge surprised some critics, who noted that scores of officers have been  disciplined, four face criminal charges and a civil lawsuit against the city  and the Police Department goes to trial in U.S. District Court next month.    If such a police scandal were to surface in the future, the commission would be  expected to investigate what conditions or management failures in the  department might have encouraged such police activity, said one source familiar  with the mayor's hopes for the revamped commission.    Talcott, an attorney who has headed the panel for five years, said in his  deposition that some of his ""important"" duties as a police commissioner were  attending Police Academy graduations and funerals of police officers.    In an interview with The Times earlier this week, he said his commission work  was a part-time job that paid only $50 for each weekly meeting he attended. He  said it is difficult for commissioners to follow every aspect of the daily  operations of the Police Department.    ""We are citizen-soldiers, so to speak,"" he said. ""We are there to assist as  public-minded individuals in the operation of city government. It may not be  the most effective way, but it's better than most cities that have no interplay  or interaction between the public and the bureaucracies.""    Stephen Yagman, a lawyer and longtime police critic who is suing the city and  the Police Department in the 39th and Dalton drug raid, said he was amazed at  how little the commissioners seemed to know about the highly controversial  case.    ""This Board of Police Commissioners is essentially window dressing,"" he said.  ""They sit on their hands and do nothing over there. They are the equal of Nero  who fiddled while Rome burned.""    Even City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who as chairman of the council's Public  Safety Committee has been an advocate for the department, agrees that the  commission needs to change. ""I think it's clear that the mayor is interested in  . . . appointing people who are going to be more aggressive in oversight,"" he  said.    Some critics say the commission knows only what department management wants it  to know, and acts accordingly.    George Aliano, president of the Police Protective League, said the commission  under Talcott ignored the needs of rank-and-file officers. He said the  commission was particularly bad at ruling against officers who filed grievances  against their supervisors.    ""It's almost like we didn't exist,"" he said. ""There was no response from him.  Rarely -- I can't even remember a single time -- when a grievance was ever  approved at the police commission level.    ""He never tried to resolve confrontations,"" Aliano added about Talcott. ""He  turned a deaf ear on everything.""    Looking ahead, the union president said the new commission members should be  more open-minded to the problems of officers.    ""We need somebody who makes decisions and gives us an answer as to why they  make a decision,"" he said.

An  announcement expected on Tuesday [12 April] will increase the  daily payment to police on active duty from R22.50 [rand] to  R61.50 -- equal to the total allowances granted to National  Peacekeeping Force members.    A police general said a top-level decision to back the SA  [South African] Police Union appeal to the TEC for substantial  increases in pay between the ranks of constable and colonel was  made on Friday.    A memo signed by Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe  late  on Friday supporting the daily allowance increase is expected to  be distributed in the force tomorrow.     "

In an interview with Amy Rhodes,  Shahal said the move can be implemented immediately, and he  hopes it will promote understanding between Israelis and the  Palestinians.    [Begin recording] [Shahal] This was needed to give a  feeling of security to the Palestinians living in Hebron after  what happened on 25 February. The major issue, and the most  important one is to have progress in the peace process.    [Rhodes] According to the compromise, there will be some 100  Palestinian policemen in Hebron. How will it work?    [Shahal] Well, first of all, the Palestinian police who are  members of this police force....[pauses] It's going to be a  municipality police force. They are going to be responsible for  the institutions of the Palestinians in Hebron, they are going  to be responsible for the Palestinian inhabitants. They will  have joint patrols together with Israeli security forces,  including Israel Police officers. They will be entitled to have  light arms -- the same that the Israel Police forces have, and  those arms are going to be for self-defense of the police  officers, and only when they are on duty. So, I think that it  is very clearly defined what are the limitations, what is the  jurisdiction. I hope it will promote understanding between the  Israeli security forces and the future Palestinian police force.    [Rhodes] How soon until something like this can be  implemented?    [Shahal] Immediately. [end recording]     "

A blue Datsun sedan, license No  2K-4255 Bangkok, stopped at the checkpoint. The people in the  car looked suspicious and so the officials conducted a search.  They found 38 sticks of dried marijuana wrapped in newspaper and  clear plastic. Each stick weighed 1 kg for a total of 38 kg. The  marijuana had been packed in a sea bag and concealed in the rear  seat. The suspects were identified as Mr. Chanti Songsoem, age  30, who lives at 67/1 Sisaket Road, Warin Chamrap Subdistrict,  Warin Chamrap District, Ubon Ratchathani Province, and Mr. Sanit  Bunchak, age 36, who lives at 43 Thetsaban 58 Road, Warin  Chamrap District, Ubon Ratchathani Province.    During interrogation, the two suspects said that Sergeant  Chatchawan, surname unknown, had hired them to transport  marijuana at 1,000 baht per kg. They had already made four  trips. They had purchased the marijuana in Chong Chiam District  at a cost of 500 baht per kg. The suspects were taken and turned  over to Police 1st Lieutenant Wanchai Ruangsi, the duty officer  at the provincial police station in Sirinthon District, for  further handling of the case.     "

Planners and developers predict that people will be living in  new homes with views of rolling foothills or ocean sunsets, working in new  office towers overlooking freeway junctions, buying in shops in revitalized  downtowns, playing in new regional parks, and getting away from it all with the  help of an expanded airport terminal. In the next 10 years, more than 14,000  more people will have died of AIDS, and twice as much jail space will be  needed. And as they integrate increased stresses and new technology, Orange  County residents might even utter a new word or two. Here's a closer look.      Development    New development and redevelopment -- not to mention a gleaming new home for a  professional sports team or two -- will spring up on Orange County's terrain  during the next decade. Orange County's largest capital improvement project --  John Wayne Airport -- will be completed next year. In addition, five regional  parks are planned to be added to the landscape in the 1990s.    1. ANAHEIM STADIUM: Nearly $4 billion in high-rise development is targeted for  the Platinum Triangle: 200 acres stretching from the stadium to the junction of  Garden Groved, Orange and Santa Ana freeways. A sports arena is planned near  the Big A to attract a pro basketball or hockey team, and the stadium may be  the terminus of a proposed high-speed Las Vegas-Southern California train.    2. HUNTINGTON BEACH: The city's downtown and central pier area, totaling 336  acres, will be transformed into a shopping and tourist center for west county  with a $55-million waterfront hotel, set to open in summer, 1990, and a complex  of theaters, eateries and night clubs. Three more hotels and several hundred  luxury condominiums also are planned.    3. SANTA ANA: Redevelopment and new projects worth more than $1.5 billion will  alter the look of the county seat as business and retail centers replace bean  fields along stretches of Main Street and older buildings on 1st Street. A  privately built sports facility also is planned, in an attempt to lure a pro  basketball or hockey franchise, if the city can beat Anaheim in the arena race.    4. EAST ORANGE: Irvine Co. breaks ground in 1992 on its largest single planned  community ever, a 12,350-unit residential development covering 7,110 acres  along Rancho Santiago Road. It is a phased development with 2,700 acres of open  space and twin business parks expected to create 26,000 jobs by its completion  after the year 2000.    5. GYPSUM CANYON: The ridges and slopes of the pristine canyon south of the  Riverside Freeway will be the site of either a new 6,720-bed jail or a  10,500-unit housing development proposed by the canyon's owners, the Irvine Co.    6. IRVINE SPECTRUM: By 1990 nearly 80,000 people are expected to work in  offices and manufacturing plants spread across 2,600 acres near the junction of  the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways.    7. Irvine Coast: Completion expected by end of decade on 2,600 homes and two  major resort hotels to be built on the last remaining large undeveloped stretch  of Orange County coast. About 75% of the 9,432 acres in the project will remain  open space.    8. ALISO VIEJO: One of South County's biggest planned communities nears  completion by year 2000 with many of the development's 50,000 residents  expected to work in nearby offices and plants built within the project.    9. RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA: As residential building continues, construction  begins by 1994 on Town Center, a mix of retail shops, offices, movie theaters  and medical suites with pedestrian walkways that planners herald as the  ""regional downtown"" for a string of communities from Portola Hills south to  Coto de Caza.      Population    Each figure represents 200,000 people.    1980: 1.9 million    1990: 2.3 million    2000: 2.6 million      Buzzwords    Want to be user-friendly with the 1990s? Looking for something to do while you  zoom down super-streets, on your way to your flex place? Join the Smart crowd  by studying expected buzzwords of the '90s -- compiled from interviews with  planners, futurists and other sources -- and you can speak the language of the  future today.    Hot-housing -- Forcing children to mature too quickly, akin to the way  gardeners force early blooms on plants. Examples would be giving kindergartners  tests before they move on to first grade, taking youngsters to R-rated movies  with their parents, or 8-year-olds putting themselves on diets.    Baby boomerangers -- Adult children of baby boomers who return to their  parents' homes, unable or unwilling to make their own way in the world.    Latchkey seniors -- Ailing elderly parents who live with their grown children  because they need care but who are left unsupervised while their children go to  work.    Sandwich generation -- Adults who are being squeezed in the middle, taking care  of two generations. These are parents who are bringing up young or teen-age  children at home while also caring for their own elderly parents, who are frail  and no longer independent.    Tech head -- an '80s term describing someone who is computer hip. It is  expected to be used less often in the '90s as computers become more user  friendly.    Alternative scenarios -- A term used by futurists to say there will be a  variety of courses that the future could take in a certain situation, such as  what the results of the ""greenhouse effect"" will be.    Ice -- The smokable form of methamphetamine that will be the drug of choice in  the coming decade, according to law enforcement officials.    Flex place -- The variable location where one conducts work, either an office,  home or car.    Telecommuting -- Working at home, connected to the workplace by telephone and  computer.    PATH -- A traffic management system being developed by the state Department of  Transportation that controls vehicles with computers. It is envisioned that  maps and traffic information will be displayed on screens installed in cars.  The system, which stands for Program on Advanced Technology for the Highway,  also could include automatically steered cars, which would ""read"" information  in highway markers.    Super-streets -- Busy streets that are transformed into streamlined  thoroughfares by constructing grade-separated intersections with ramps (akin to  freeway off-ramps), synchronized signals, bus turnouts and other changes to  speed the traffic flow.    Rolling corrections -- An economy that will avoid a nationwide recession by  having mini-recessions in specific industries or regions that are countered by  good times inother sectors.    Virtual reality -- A three-dimensional illusion of being in another place. This  ""virtual reality"" is generated by wearing computerized goggles and a glove,  which can simulate any possible experience. Homeowners, for example, can  explore their new house before it exists and, says VPL Research Inc., a Redwood  City firm marketing virtual reality equipment, the possibilities for home  entertainment are limitless.    Highway advisory radio -- Low- frequency airwaves -- on the low side of the  radio band -- over which traffic information will be broadcast to drivers, like  the instructions now given over the radio to people driving into Los Angeles  International Airport.    Gilded ghettos -- Schools and communities isolated from the nation's changing  demographics, and places where families go to escape racial tension and end up  cutting themselves off from social changes.    Smart House -- A revolutionary gas, plumbing and wiring system that enables  total home automation via one cable and generic outlets in each room. When the  system becomes available in 1991, it will be able to do everything from  automatically brewing the morning coffee to alerting the household when an  appliance is not working.    Smart Card -- A card that looks like a credit card but which is in fact a  hand-held computer with a microprocessor and memory, capable of carrying  information such as medical records, car maintenance records, the password to  your computer and other personal data. For example, by carrying your medical  and insurance records, the Smart Card being marketed by AT&T will  facilitate rapid treatment in an emergency medical situation.    Smart Corridors -- Thoroughfares managed with computers that are fed  information about traffic snags and then determine solutions. For example, the  computer could decide to route cars around an accident by diverting them onto  surface streets and changing the timing of traffic signals to accommodate the  extra cars.

Judge Abby Soven's rulings mean that the case of Rastello vs. the city of  Torrance will become an exhaustive review of the Torrance Police Department and  not simply an examination of the fatal 1984 traffic collision that was the  impetus for the case.    The judge's action was applauded by John Rastello of San Pedro, who filed suit  in 1984 after his son, Kelly, 19, was killed in a traffic collision with  Torrance Police Sgt. Rollo Green, who was off-duty at the time. The suit  charges that Green caused the accident because he was drunk and made an illegal  left turn, and that other Torrance police officers covered up for him. The suit  alleges that such cover-ups are common in the Torrance Police Department.    Lawyers representing Green and the city will begin their opening arguments in  the case this morning. They have denied all the allegations and said that it  was Rastello's excessive speed along Rolling Hills Road in Torrance that caused  the accident.    By the time jury selection began Tuesday, Soven had already established the  outline for the case with nearly 40 rulings on a series of legal questions. The  judge blitzed through the motions in less than five hours, scolding lawyers  when she felt their arguments took too long.    The judge rejected requests by lawyers for Green and the city to limit the  scope of the trial to the events immediately surrounding the night of the  accident, Aug. 30, 1984.      'About a Cover-Up'    ""This case is not about a failure to arrest"" Sgt. Green, Soven told defense  lawyers. ""It is about a cover-up."" When the lawyers persisted in their  arguments, Soven snapped: ""I still believe the defense doesn't know what this  case is about.""    Soven said she will permit testimony about previous incidents in which the  Torrance Police Department allegedly covered up alcohol abuse and crimes  committed by police officers. She said the allegations are important in the  case, not on their own merits, but in order to give Rastello's lawyers an  opportunity to prove their theory that Torrance officers routinely fail to  investigate their peers or file accurate reports on them.    But Soven said she would limit the testimony. ""We're not going to try this case  all year,"" she said.    Brian Panish, one of Rastello's lawyers, had said he wanted to use 50 incidents  to prove that the Torrance Police Department has a ""pattern and practice"" of  failing to investigate its officers, but the judge said she would permit  testimony on just 25 incidents. And the plaintiffs can discuss another 15  incidents in which the department allegedly did not file accurate reports of  citizen complaints against its officers, Soven ruled.      A Case in Three Parts    Lawyers for Green and the city had also argued that the case should be divided  into three parts: one trial to decide who was at fault in the accident, the  second to assess whether Torrance officers covered up for Green and the third  to determine whether cover-ups are routine in the Torrance Police Department.    The lawyers said that testimony on any one of those issues would unfairly cloud  the jury's judgment on the others.    For example, the judge said that in order to assess the city's liability she  would permit testimony about how much other officers knew about Green's alleged  alcoholism and what the department did to treat it. But Soven said the jury  would be instructed not to let such testimony influence its decision about  whether Green was drunk on the night of the accident.    Green's lawyers argued that this was too much to expect of jurors and that the  issues should be tried separately.      A Single Trial    But Soven rejected such arguments, ruling that the jury will hear all the  issues during a single trial.    ""It is going to be devastating to us,"" Will J. Pirkey, Green's attorney, said  of the ruling. ""We think it's extremely prejudicial. We are very concerned.""  Casey Yim, one of the attorneys representing the city, agreed that the ruling  was a setback but said he was pleased that the judge had limited the testimony  that would be permitted alleging cover-ups.    The plaintiffs and defense have been involved in an intense legal struggle for  more than a year over what documents the Police Department should produce for  the case.    The city's lawyers fought during pretrial hearings against releasing much of  the material requested by Rastello. Two judges had to be specially appointed to  hear the legal arguments and one, retired Superior Court Judge John K. Trotter,  twice sanctioned the city -- with penalties totaling $15,000 -- for failing to  produce documents.    In the end, Torrance officials said they turned over more than 500,000 pages,  mostly on Police Department practices and past instances of misconduct.

The NCIS annual drugs survey, issued yesterday, reports that  20 production sites for ""skunk"" were found in Britain last year,  mainly in Wales. Police discovered anything from a hundred to a  thousand plants being grown in basements and garages, using  hydroponics and market gardening techniques such as high  intensity lighting.    The plants grow more quickly than cannabis cultivated out of  doors. Growers can produce cannabis worth 2,500 to  4,000  from a metre of cultivated plants. The conditions give the  plants very high concentrations of THC, the active chemical,  which produces effects similar to LSD.    Stuart Wesley, director of the drugs division at NCIS, said  there was concern at the increasing appearance of skunk. In  Holland, skunk plants supply 20 to 50 per cent of cannabis  consumed in coffee houses and are said to be second only to  tulip cultivation in Dutch agriculture.    Skunk is part of an intensifying drugs scene. Police are  making recorded seizures of amphetamines, and 31 murders or  attempted murders in London last year were linked to crack  cocaine. There are also fears that steroid abuse is growing. The  Home Office is considering whether steroid drugs should be  controlled by misuse of drugs legislation.    Det. Chief Supt Tony White, head of the NCIS drugs policy  unit, said that there was evidence of steroid users starting to  mix with the main drugs underworld. One research project into  needle exchange programmes had shown steroid users accounted for  28 per cent of the clients.    The NCIS figures show that cannabis remains the most popular  drug and last year 58,000 kilograms were seized. Amphetamines  are the second favourite and in 1993 seizures rose by 65 per  cent to 995 kg. Police also found 18 illicit amphetamine  laboratories.    The survey reports that crack cocaine is appearing more  frequently outside London and makes up half of all cocaine  seizures, which last year fell by 70 per cent from 2,250 kg in  1992 to 750: the high 1992 figure was caused by two very large  seizures. Discoveries of heroin rose by 88 per cent to 120 kg.     "

A federal grand jury in Las Vegas has issued subpoenas for six White Pine  County residents, and two rifles suspected of being used in the killings have  been confiscated, as a result of the inquiry by at least four agencies,  according to law enforcement officials in the eastern Nevada town of Ely.    Although an informant reported that as many as 400 horses and 200 deer had been  killed, only 28 carcasses of slain horses and 20 of mule deer have been  recovered, authorities said.      Slow Deaths    ""They shot them in the stomach, so these animals would wander,"" Undersheriff  Harry Collins said Thursday. He explained that the animals take hours to die  and that accordingly their carcasses are widely scattered and the numbers of  killings are difficult to confirm.    The new killings occurred about 200 miles east of where another mass killing of  at least 580 wild horses took place last year in Lander County in the central  part of the state. Five people have been indicted for those killings and will  go on trial this month and next in Reno on ""gross misdemeanor"" charges calling  for up to $2,000 in fines and a year in jail.    The latest incident comes when litigation by the Sacramento-based Animal  Protection Institute has blocked the planned captures of 3,000 Nevada wild  horses by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which has an extensive horse  adoption program in which the animals are sent to other states.    The halt in the captures, imposed almost a year ago, has reportedly intensified  feelings among ranchers that a growing wild animal population is despoiling  rangeland used by more than 500,000 cattle and sheep that are permitted to  graze on the 87% of Nevada's mostly barren land under federal control.    A Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Thursday estimated the number of wild  horses in the state at about 26,000. The horses have been legally protected  under federal law since 1971. They are descendants of a 19th-Century wild horse  population estimated as high as 2 million.    Statements about the latest killings varied in tone between local and federal  officials, with the local officials taking a more dire view.    Local officials said the joint investigation is well along and has established  that the animals were shot. They suggested that indictments will come soon.    But the Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman, Maxine Shane, characterized the  investigation as only preliminary and said the causes of death have not been  firmly established.    Bob Hillman, director of field services for the Animal Protection Institute,  charged in an interview that ""the BLM has a hard time following the 1971 law  because it's always been a cattlemen, stockmen agency. The sheriff and district  attorney, by contrast, find these killings abhorrent and they don't owe their  allegiance to the ranchers.""    White Pine Dist. Atty. Dan Papez, however, cautioned that sheer maliciousness  rather than economic interest could account for some of the killings.    ""Unfortunately, these days we have widespread hooliganism and vandalism,"" Papez  said. ""But there also could be a commercial concern. There's been a  longstanding disagreement on how the BLM manages the wild horses. They do a lot  of damage to the range when their numbers are not controlled. Nonetheless, the  law is the law and it's unlawful to shoot them.""    Papez said the deer do less damage and with them he is convinced that the  slayings were ""just maliciousness.""    White Pine Sheriff Bernie Romemo said a search warrant was obtained May 31,  leading to the seizure of the two rifles. ""We're looking at figures of 400  horses and 200 deer,"" he said.    Shane of the Bureau of Land Management, by contrast, said that only 28 horse  carcasses had been recovered and did not mention the deer. She said more  carcasses may be recovered when snow melts in the mountains.

A federal grand jury in Las Vegas has issued subpoenas for six White Pine  County residents, and two rifles suspected of being used in the killings have  been confiscated, as a result of the inquiry by at least four agencies,  according to law enforcement officials in the eastern Nevada town of Ely.    Although an informant reported that as many as 400 horses and 200 deer had been  killed, only 28 carcasses of slain horses and 20 of mule deer have been  recovered, authorities said.      Slow Deaths    ""They shot them in the stomach, so these animals would wander,"" Undersheriff  Harry Collins said Thursday. He explained that the animals take hours to die  and that accordingly their carcasses are widely scattered and the numbers of  killings are difficult to confirm.

It  is now a conscientious action taken by all members of the Army  and the National Police operating in that part of the Peruvian  jungle.    On 2 April in San Martin, an inhospitable area in the  Tarapoto jungle, a Dinandro [National Antidrug Division] patrol  supported by the Air Police detected a lab for processing  cocaine base and acted by surprise. Not even the torrential rain  or the thunderstorm stopped police, who arrested five people.    After the operation, police seized 128 kg of cocaine base,  many ingredients for making the drug, and a shotgun.    Back at the Tarapoto airport the arrested were taken to the  police station. The police then, without knowing reporters were  present, gave the arrested soft drinks and their own food  rations they used in their operations.    None of the arrested showed signs of violence on their  bodies  when they were put under the jurisdiction of judicial officials.  They also never complained about being mistreated by police.    A police sergeant said: ""We always respect the rights of the  people we arrest, even under the most adverse circumstances  after they use their weapons on us and we capture them.""    This National Police action, without the tempting presence  of  cameras and microphones, shows that human rights are indeed  respected in Peru and that there is no need for ""spokesmen""  abroad to report alleged human rights violations. The real  situation is in that remote region where perhaps one of those  ""spokesmen"" never saw what happened.     "

Mr Kriel said in a statement there had been a ""major  breakthrough"" in the police investigation and the matter should  now be taken up by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) ""as  a matter of urgency"".    ""Investigations have established a direct link between the  perpertrators of the Heidelberg tavern atrocity and the  territory of the Transkei. Furthermore, these investigations  have also established that the Heidelberg tavern and other  attacks could indeed have been planned and executed from the  Transkei,"" Mr Kriel said.    The minister said ballistic tests had confirnmed that the  weapons used in the Heidelberg attack and the weapons used in  the St James Church massacre were identical. Gunmen burst into  the tavern last Thursday night, killing three women and a man.    In the St James Church attack early last year, armed  attackers killed 12 people, including several Russian sailors.    Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa has said he  is  prepared to hand over suspected attackers if the South African  authorities can identify them.    Mr Kriel said on Wednesday: ""Investigations have reached the  stage where a joint investigation between the South African  Police [SAP] and Transkei Police be considered a top priority.  This would include the formation of a joint SAP/Transkei Police  investigation team as rapidly as possible and the SA Police is  ready to implement this.""    South Africa last year sent soldiers into Transkei to pursue  suspects in several attacks in South Africa. The soldiers  attacked a home of a Pan-Africanist Congress member, killing  four youths. The incident sparked a political and diplomatic row  in which South Africa's ambassador to the homeland was expelled.    In his statement on Wednesday, Mr Kriel said: ""Intensive  investigations have resulted in a major breakthrough by the SA  Police which now makes it essential that this matter be taken up  as a matter of urgency by the Transitional Executive Council.  It is a matter of extreme urgency that the TEC...Give advice on  how to deal with the problem of dealing with suspects who take  refuge in independent states. Speedy action is vital if the  perpertrators are to be brought to justice without delay. It  would be obstructive for the Transkei to insist on adhering  strictly to a rigid and formal process of extradition in these  areas.""     "

Senior Metropolitan Police officers and representatives of  the National Security Council and National Intelligence Agency  arrived at the possible World Trade Center link after a two-hour  meeting.    The high-level meeting was called after a team of  Metropolitan Police searched a shophouse in Bang Kapi where they  found another steel water tank, 25 sacks of fertilizer,  electrical wiring and 50 other items believed used in assembling  the bomb.    Police said the investigators were led to the three-story  shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose  address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented  truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday.    The station police had taken the truck from Chitlom Road  near  the Israel Embassy where it was left by a ""Mideast-looking""  driver after it hit a motorcycle on coming out of the Central  Department Store parking lot on March 11.    The bomb was found when the truck owner, turning up to claim  the vehicle, became suspicious of the water tank and a strong  stench and asked the police to investigate. The smell was found  to come from a body inside the tank.    Police found the tank was filled with ammonium nitrate,  diesel fuel, six bars of C-4 plastic explosive wired to a  battery aboard the truck, and the body, found later to be that  of the driver assigned to deliver the vehicle to a  Mideast-looking man at Makro superstore in Bang Kapi on March 10.    Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who  confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban  Road at the order of a foreign buyer.    Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer  had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri.    The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke  Thai about four months ago, police said.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said  investigators have identified of the Mideast-looking man who  drove the truck and rented the shophouse.    He said the man had rented the house since August last year  and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent  from a province in the South.    Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who  might have left the country, he said.    Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the  landlord believed they had now left Thailand.    Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents  and materials used to make the bomb and the items found  yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided  the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb  at the World Trade Center in New York.    The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last  year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S.  Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a ""witches' brew"".    Police on Thursday said the homemade bomb found on the  truck,  using the mixture of fertilizer and diesel fuel to add to its  explosive strength, was big enough to destroy a large building.    Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said investigation teams had been  assigned to watch out for foreigners who look like the person in  the sketch drawn up from witnesses' accounts.    ""The problem is we are not sure if they are still in  Thailand,"" said Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit, who on Thursday said he  was ""50 percent"" sure the terrorists are still in the Kingdom.    The officer said he was confident the terrorists were  foreigners who had chosen the Israel Embassy as their target  because the truck carrying the bomb was heading toward the  embassy on Soi Lang Suan when it was involved in an accident  with a motorcycle.    He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the  water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the  Mideast- looking who rented the truck and bought the water tanks  was the same person.    The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English  and Arabic.    Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more  than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot  and they would have had to have been in the country for some  time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know  Bangkok's roads.    Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed  at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an  international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy.    But the names of the two suspects art still unknown and it  is  not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said.    Pol. Gen. Pratin. said police yesterday searched several  areas of Bang Mot and Ramkhamhaeng in search of the suspects.    He said he had not appointed a special police team to work  on  the case but admitted to working closely with officials from the  Israeli Embassy.    Metropolitan Police Assistant Director-General Bunchop  Phumwichit said plainclothes police had been sent to various  hotels, hangouts of Mideast visitors, Makro superstore in Bang  Kapi, the water tank shop and the Central Department Store  parking lot to gather more information.    Immigration police have been instructed to step up  surveillance at border checkpoints.    The Israeli Embassy has sent a message to thank the police  for the increased security following the discovery of the bomb,  he said.    Extra security has been ordered for foreign embassies,  particularly the Israeli Embassy, since Thursday night.    A Syrian tourist, Mohammad Hazamail, 35, was detained at his  rented room at Phetchaburi Apartment yesterday by Immigration  police and taken immediately to Lumphini police station for  questioning and identification by the motorcyclist.    The man was released later after being cleared.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said earlier  yesterday it was too early to say if the bomb had any connection  with the World Trade Center bombing.    Mr. Banyat said he was waiting for the findings of  government  agencies seeking to establish the identities of the people who  made the bomb.    Earlier this year police distributed photographs of three  Pakistanis, wanted by the U.S. and carrying a reward of $2  million, believed to be responsible for the bombing of the World  Trade Centre and hiding somewhere in Thailand.    The three were identified as Mir Aimal Kansi (or Kasi),  Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef.    Mr. Banyat said he had reported to Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai in Vietnam about the incident.

Next week is not the time to knock over that Oxnard Boulevard  convenience store or that A Street bank you've been eyeing.    Beginning Sunday, about 5,200 police officers from throughout the state will  converge on Oxnard for the annual California Police Olympics.    The six-day event is expected to attract representatives from about 400  departments spanning most levels of law enforcement -- from city police  officers and county sheriff's deputies to members of the U.S. Border Patrol and  federal marshals. Even state lottery investigators are expected to compete.    ""Oxnard is going to be a very safe place,"" said patrol officer patrol officer  Lee Wilco, co-chairman of the Oxnard Police Department's organizing committee.    It also will be crowded. City officials expect 50,000 spectators -- most of  them from out of town -- to gather to watch the long arm of the law flex its  muscle in 45 competitive events, including arm-wrestling, boxing and  bodybuilding.    The throngs attracted by the games are expected to pump $5 million into Oxnard  and four other Ventura County cities where events will be held and contestants  will hang their hats.    One of the few other times the county has seen a convention on this order, city  officials say, was when Oxnard was host for the 1985 Police Olympics, billed as  the second-largest sporting event after the international Olympics.    Hotels were so packed, Wilcox said, that he had to put up two competitors at  his home.    But despite the week's festive atmosphere, competing officers still must go by  the book. They can be disqualified, fined or even put on probation for  roughhousing, cheating or even swearing. Judges can call for a hearing on the  smallest infraction. A judge once yanked a gold medal from a foulmouthed power  lifter on his way out of the ring.    ""John McEnroe wouldn't even get past the judges,"" said Bob Burke, a member of  the board of directors of the California Police Athletic Federation, which  oversees the games.      Incentive to Officers    Unseemly behavior, organizers say, would defeat the purpose of the games, which  were founded in 1967 as an incentive for police officers to keep in shape but  have continued as a means of generating good will.    ""These are mainly people who get in the paper for shooting someone,"" Burke  said. ""We want to show them in a positive light.""    As in the conventional Olympics, the top three competitors in each category win  gold, silver or bronze medals. But in the police version, competitors who place  fourth and fifth also take home medals -- and the thrill of victory.    ""It hurts so good,"" said Jim Struck, an Oxnard police officer who last year won  gold medals in the light-heavyweight boxing and karate divisions. To make sure  he gets to repeat the experience, Struck said he has been working out two hours  daily on a punching bag and in the ring.    Other competitors have been as earnest. Take Sgt. Easie Williams, a Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department detective who coaches the largest boxing team in  the competition. He has been pitting his 10 charges against each other in 12 to  15 rounds a week -- that on top of a running regime of two to three miles  daily, plus weightlifting.    ""These guys aren't fooling around,"" Wilcox said. ""It's fierce competition.""      World-Class Athletes    In fact, some competitors such as George Lopez, who will box in the 156-pound  weight class Wednesday and Friday, are world-class athletes.    A 29-year-old community relations officer for the Los Angeles Police  Department, Lopez fought for Argentina in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, where he  was defeated by Ray Downey, the Canadian boxer who went on to win a bronze  medal.    ""He's got a good, crisp jab,"" said Larry Moore, who coaches Lopez as the Police  Department's athletic director.    Competitors will begin arriving Sunday, although the action does not begin  until 8 a.m. the next day, with the triathlon through Oxnard State Beach behind  the Embassy Suites Hotel, headquarters for the games. Admission to all events  is free.    The competitive roster includes such Olympian staples as tennis, rowing, track  and field, and equestrian events. Many contests, however, are tailored to the  talents of police officers -- arm-wrestling, pistol shooting and contests with  police dogs. Such events as surfing, water-skiing and scuba highlight the  ""California"" in the competition's name.    Organizers expect the boxing matches, which begin at 7 p.m. Monday, Wednesday  and Friday in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, to attract the widest following.      Boxing Fans    On one night alone in 1985, boxing attracted more than 2,000 fans, the  auditorium's capacity. To catch any overflow this year, organizers plan to pipe  fights via cable television into two adjacent conference rooms.    It is that sort of attention to detail that won Oxnard the 1989 bid over two  other cities. Organizers said they were impressed by the welcome they received  in 1985. At the time, Oxnard was the smallest city to have hosted the  California games.    ""Usually you don't get that much community support,"" said Duke Nyhus, the  founder of the games and the executive director of the California Police  Athletics Federation.    In return, Oxnard will go down in history as home to the last California Police  Olympics. In an attempt to avoid a dispute with the International Olympic  Committee, which has sought to enjoin police organizations in other states from  referring to their games as ""Olympics,"" the California Police Athletics  Federation plans to change the name of the event to the California Police  Summer Games beginning in 1990.      Lengthy Planning    But Oxnard's role has not come without sacrifice. The Oxnard Police Department  has already invested three years in planning the games. Since September, Wilcox  and another officer have been relieved of regular duties to devote themselves  full time to organizing the games.    The event is expected to cost the city $350,000, which it hopes to recoup  through entrance fees for participants, although some cities have not been so  successful. Newport Beach, for instance, lost money when it was the host for  the games in 1986, organizers said.    While many existing facilities were suited to particular events, such as the  L.A. Raiders training field where daily soccer games will be held, others had  to be jury-rigged. Organizers, aided by Santa Paula Honda Automobiles, had to  build a race track on the future site of a housing development at Gonzales Road  and Oxnard Boulevard for motocross events Wednesday and Thursday.    Some streets will be closed next Thursday and Friday to make way for a  decathlon and a 50-mile bike ride. What's more, organizers plan to tap the  services of more than 500 volunteers.    ""It's a tremendous undertaking,"" said Mayor Nao Takasugi, ""but it brings  recognition to the city of Oxnard and gives it an economic boost, and builds  police morale.""

""These are mainly people who get in the paper for shooting someone,"" Burke  said. ""We want to show them in a positive light.""    As in the conventional Olympics, the top three competitors in each category win  gold, silver or bronze medals. But in the police version, competitors who place  fourth and fifth also take home medals -- and the thrill of victory.    ""It hurts so good,"" said Jim Struck, an Oxnard police officer who last year won  gold medals in the light-heavyweight boxing and karate divisions. To make sure  he gets to repeat the experience, Struck said he has been working out two hours  daily on a punching bag and in the ring.    Other competitors have been as earnest. Take Sgt. Easie Williams, a Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department detective who coaches the largest boxing team in  the competition. He has been pitting his 10 charges against each other in 12 to  15 rounds a week -- that on top of a running regime of two to three miles  daily, plus weightlifting.    ""These guys aren't fooling around,"" Wilcox said. ""It's fierce competition.""      World-Class Athletes    In fact, some competitors such as George Lopez, who will box in the 156-pound  weight class Wednesday and Friday, are world-class athletes.    A 29-year-old community relations officer for the Los Angeles Police  Department, Lopez fought for Argentina in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, where he  was defeated by Ray Downey, the Canadian boxer who went on to win a bronze  medal.    ""He's got a good, crisp jab,"" said Larry Moore, who coaches Lopez as the Police  Department's athletic director.    Competitors will begin arriving Sunday, although the action does not begin  until 8 a.m. the next day, with the triathlon through Oxnard State Beach behind  the Embassy Suites Hotel, headquarters for the games. Admission to all events  is free.    The competitive roster includes such Olympian staples as tennis, rowing, track  and field, and equestrian events. Many contests, however, are tailored to the  talents of police officers -- arm-wrestling, pistol shooting and contests with  police dogs. Such events as surfing, water-skiing and scuba highlight the  ""California"" in the competition's name.    Organizers expect the boxing matches, which begin at 7 p.m. Monday, Wednesday  and Friday in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, to attract the widest following.      Boxing Fans    On one night alone in 1985, boxing attracted more than 2,000 fans, the  auditorium's capacity. To catch any overflow this year, organizers plan to pipe  fights via cable television into two adjacent conference rooms.    It is that sort of attention to detail that won Oxnard the 1989 bid over two  other cities. Organizers said they were impressed by the welcome they received  in 1985. At the time, Oxnard was the smallest city to have hosted the  California games.    ""Usually you don't get that much community support,"" said Duke Nyhus, the  founder of the games and the executive director of the California Police  Athletics Federation.    In return, Oxnard will go down in history as home to the last California Police  Olympics. In an attempt to avoid a dispute with the International Olympic  Committee, which has sought to enjoin police organizations in other states from  referring to their games as ""Olympics,"" the California Police Athletics  Federation plans to change the name of the event to the California Police  Summer Games beginning in 1990.      Lengthy Planning    But Oxnard's role has not come without sacrifice. The Oxnard Police Department  has already invested three years in planning the games. Since September, Wilcox  and another officer have been relieved of regular duties to devote themselves  full time to organizing the games.    The event is expected to cost the city $350,000, which it hopes to recoup  through entrance fees for participants, although some cities have not been so  successful. Newport Beach, for instance, lost money when it was the host for  the games in 1986, organizers said.    While many existing facilities were suited to particular events, such as the  L.A. Raiders training field where daily soccer games will be held, others had  to be jury-rigged. Organizers, aided by Santa Paula Honda Automobiles, had to  build a race track on the future site of a housing development at Gonzales Road  and Oxnard Boulevard for motocross events Wednesday and Thursday.    Some streets will be closed next Thursday and Friday to make way for a  decathlon and a 50-mile bike ride. What's more, organizers plan to tap the  services of more than 500 volunteers.    ""It's a tremendous undertaking,"" said Mayor Nao Takasugi, ""but it brings  recognition to the city of Oxnard and gives it an economic boost, and builds  police morale.""

""Keeping voters' faith and ensuring  South Africa's first democratic election was not disrupted was  probably the biggest challenge in the history of the SAP.""    Mr Kriel said the professionalism and sheer hardwork of  members of the force, far exceeded the call of duty. The  performance of the police has shown that members of the force  were fully committed to democracy and defending the constitution.    Mr Kriel congratulated the Commissioner of Police Gen Johan  van der Merwe and every man and woman of the force for their  indispensable contribution to democracy. A sincere word of  thanks should also go to the SA National Defence Force for ably  supporting the SAP in its task, Mr Kriel said.     "

It is forbidden to acquire, keep, and carry firearms loaded  with special cartridges (steel-cored, armor-piercing, tracer,  exploding, or expansive bullets), as well as pistols and  revolvers with all types of silencers and optical night-vision  devices.    Issuing of Permits for Acquiring, Keeping, and Carrying  Firearms for Self-Defense and Their Ammunition    5. Permits to acquire, keep, and carry pistols (revolvers)  and their ammunition are not issued to persons:    5.1. Who were convicted for premeditated crimes or crimes  committed with the careless use of firearms or gas arms,  ammunition, or explosives, who are on probation, and who are  undergoing punishments other than imprisonment;    5.2. Who experienced administrative punishments for the  illegal acquisition and possession of drugs, violations of  hunting or fishing rules, violations of rules of acquiring,  keeping, carrying, and using firearms and ammunition,  encroachment of public order and the established government  system, and other planned administrative breaches of law, the  nature of which suggests that firearms or ammunition can be the  instrument or direct object of administrative violations;    5.3. Who are incapable, as well as those who abuse  alcohol, use drugs or toxic substances, are mental patients,  have tried to commit suicide, are physically handicapped, which  prevents the safe keeping and legal use of firearms;    5.4. Who are on the preventive and operative register with  the police;    5.5. Who have not taken a course in keeping and using  firearms and passed a relevant examination (test);    5.6.

The issuing of the aforementioned permits is temporarily  suspended in war time, state of emergency, and other cases  established by the law of the Republic of Lithuania.    7. A person who intends to acquire a permit for a firearm  submits the following documents to the territorial police  station:    -- A motivated application to the interior minister;    -- A form of compulsory medical examination (No. 049/a) from  the territorial outpatient clinic with the conclusion as to  whether the person's health condition allows him or her to  acquire a firearm for self-defense;    -- A bank check with the fee for a permit to acquire  firearms for self-defense.

A permit to acquire a firearm for self-defense is valid  for six months. After the expiration of this period, the permit  and the entire documentation concerning the acquisition of  firearms is annulled.

The revenues are assessed and used as special  nonbudget finances.    Acquisition and Keeping of Firearms and Ammunition    15. Pistols (revolvers) for self-defense and their  ammunition are acquired only at the store of the Lithuanian Arms  Fund licensed to trade in arms.    16.

Every three years, persons possessing firearms for  self-defense must have them tested at zones (Vilnius, Kaunas,  Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys, Alytus, Marijampole, Utena,  Telsiai, Taurage) according to their place of residence.    27. Persons pay for firearm tests to the Interior Ministry  in accordance with its fees. The revenues are assessed and used  as special nonbudget finances.    Extension and Annulment of Permits for Keeping and Carrying  Firearms    28. After the permit for keeping and carrying firearms  expires, the Public Police Administration at the Interior  Ministry Police Department discusses the issue and extends the  permit considering the person's application, a valid form of the  compulsory medical examination, and a certification of a  repeated training test.    29. The Public Police Administration at the Interior  Ministry Police Department can annul or refuse to extend the  permit for keeping and carrying firearms if:    29.1.

A person, who wishes to sell the firearm to another  individual or renounce it, receives a warrant from the Public  Police Administration at the Interior Ministry Police Department  and returns the firearm to the Lithuanian Arms Fund store.    The store must issue an authorized document to the owner of  the firearm on its receipt. After the resale of the firearm,  the store must report the fact to its former owner and the  Public Police Administration at the Interior Ministry Police  Department.    34. Pistols (revolvers) with the caliber of less than 9 mm,  low muzzle velocity, small muzzle energy, and ammunition that  were returned voluntarily, are legalized and returned to persons  who have the right to acquire and keep them for self-defense.  Relevant permits are issued to owners. Persons receive  compensation for other firearms, ammunition, and explosives in  accordance with the procedure set by the Finance Ministry and  the Government of the Republic of Lithuania.    35. By the order of the Interior Ministry, an experts'  commission is set up to assess the technical condition of  voluntarily returned firearms and ammunition, and their  compliance with the category of firearms for self-defense, and  evaluate other firearms, ammunition, and explosives.    36.

According to estimates, if those crops  had been harvested, they would have accounted for the production  of at least 20 tons of drugs.    Based on reports sent to the Federal Judicial Police General  Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Sinaloa  State reported the manual destruction and incineration of 20  cannabis indica plantations detected in the townships of Imala,  Jesus Maria, and Batequis, and in the vicinity of the Sanaluna  Reservoir, all part of the municipality of Culiacan.    Southeast of Imala, the Federal Judicial Police destroyed,  by  reducing to ashes, approximately 31,000 marijuana plants  discovered on an expanse of 7,600 square meters. In the same  township, five more crops were burned, and an average total of  64,000 canamo bushes was detected on 16,000 square meters.    Moreover, near the Sanaluna Reservoir in Culiacan, agents  assigned to the campaign against drug production located 2,000  square meters planted with marijuana, destroying 8,000 of the  drug bushes. In the township of Bateque, an additional 7,200  plants of the same drug were uprooted and incinerated by federal  agents. In Jesus Maria and Imala, the destruction of 484 and  1,120 square meters, respectively, planted with marijuana, was  reported. In the first instance, 1,936 plants were found; and in  the second, 4,840.    The agency in Sonora State, for its part, announced that, 5  km from the settlement of Buenaventura, two more marijuana crops  were destroyed and incinerated on an area of 475 square meters.  Approximately 18,000 drug bushes were detected on that farm.  Furthermore, southeast of the Adolfo Ruiz Cortines Reservoir,  the Federal Judicial Police destroyed nearly 69,000 cannabis  indica bushes, found on an expanse of 16,900 square meters.    In Jalisco, as well, on the farm known as El Agostadero in  the municipality of Cabo Corrientes, 21,600 drug plants were  destroyed and burned, after their discovery on 5,400 square  meters of land. Implements for harvesting marijuana, a  12-caliber shotgun, and over one kg of seed of that drug were  also found there.    Finally, Federal Judicial Police forces assigned to Guerrero  State reported that, in the municipality of Zumpango de Neri, on  a site known as Las Lagunitas, nearly four hectares were found  planted with poppies. They discovered 387,000 plants on the  site, as well as 150 kg of mineral fertilizer, and hose for  irrigation.     "

His admission coincided with a police announcement that a  warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected  international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow.    Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling  the truckbomb.    It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for  foreigners to buy all the components locally.    ""I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The  crackdown must be made at their grassroots,"" Chavalit said.    Citing a police report, the minister said one of the  suspected foreign terrorists is believed to be still hiding in  Bangkok. Police are trying to locate the others.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit  Kanchanakit said police will on Monday issue a warrant for the  arrest of a suspected international terrorist whose identity was  already known.    Chaisit said he met Israeli embassy officials yesterday  morning and they agreed to send anti-terrorism experts to  support the police hunt for the masterminds.    Police discovered by sheer luck on Thursday a tonne of high  explosive in a water tank on the back of a six-wheel truck  earlier abandoned at the busy Ploenchit-Chitlom intersection on  March 11 when the driver fled after hitting a taxi motorcycle.    The chance accident averted what could have been the most  disastrous terrorist attack in Thailand. Police said the truck  driver appeared to be on a suicide-mission to the Israeli  embassy, which is less than one kilometre away.    The truck-bomb was composed of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,  C-4 cxplosive and diesel oil with a detonating switch on the  vehicle's dashboard. The formula is similar to ""witches brew"",  the deadly mixture used to bomb the New York World Trade Centre  last year and police are investigating a possible link between  the two incidents.    A corpse also found in the tank was positively identified as  the Thai driver who delivered the rented truck to the terrorists.    Police on Friday found 25 sacks of ammonium nitrate-based  fertilizer and an empty water tank in an abandoned house in  Bangkok's Bung Kum District. The landlord said she had rented  the house to a group of Arab men.    Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in  the  sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect,  drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by  the truck, had already been sent to all police stations.    Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi  Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle  East, but he would not specify their nationality.    Chawalit yesterday said some foreign embassies have assigned  officials to help the police investigation.    Commissioner Chaisit, meanwhile, said police are waiting for  more information from the Israeli embassy to determine whether  additional arrest warrants should also be issued.    He said police had lifted fingerprints from the Bung Kum  house and they should be useful in identifying the terrorists  and their organization.    The commissioner said he did not know whether any of the  culprits were still in the country.    If the perpetrators were found to be hiding overseas,  investigators could seek cooperation from local police through  Interpol to arrest and extradite them to Bangkok for legal  prosecution, he said.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said on his retum from Vietnam  yesterday that he expected a detailed report on the case  tomorrow.    He defended the government intelligence units against  criticism that the planned terrorist attack almost succeeded  because they lacked efficiency, saying they have been consistent  with their monitoring of possible terrorist activity in Thailand.    ""We should be fair to them. Some kinds of work are not  easy,"" he said.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, a former secretary-general  of the National Security Council, said he acknowledged that  terrorist groups had tried to use Thailand as a base to launch  their attacks.    He said the current efficiency level of Thai intelligence  units is good, but it is impossible for them to know everything.     "

Police said the investigators were led to the three-story  shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose  address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented  truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday.  [passage omitted]    Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who  confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban  Road at the order of a foreign buyer.    Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer  had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri.    The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke  Thai about four months ago, police said.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said  investigators have identified the Mideast-looking man who drove  the truck and rented the shophouse.    He said the man had rented the house since August last year  and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent  from a province in the South.    Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who  might have left the country, he said.    Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the  landlord believed they had now left Thailand.    Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents  and materials used to make the bomb and the items found  yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided  the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb  at the World Trade Center in New York.    The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last  year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S.  Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a ""witches' brew"".  [passage omitted]    Chaiyasit said he was ""50 percent"" sure the terrorists are  still in the Kingdom. [passage omitted]    He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the  water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the  Mideast-looking man who rented the truck and bought the water  tanks was the same person.    The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English  and Arabic.    Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more  than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot  and they would have had to have been in the country for some  time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know  Bangkok's roads.    Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed  at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an  international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy.    But the names of the two suspects are still unknown and it  is  not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said.    Pol. Gen.

In this case, as always, the Cuban rafters were received as  heroes. The media were called to interview them, and they were  asked to condemn the Havana government publicly, which seems to  be an essential requirement to being welcomed warmly and  affectionately.    The U.S. immigration provisions, which Havana deems as  political tools used in a campaign against the revolutionary  process taking place on the Caribbean island, encourage this  type of arrival along the U.S. coast. These policies even  include the right to possible employment.    As if this were not enough, the so-called rafters -- some of  whom fall prey to drug traffickers who charge high fees for the  odyssey and some of whom never reach their destination because  they disappear at sea -- can apply for permanent residence in a  year. This option is repeatedly denied to other applicants.    The daily, weekly, monthly, and annual publication of the  number of Cubans who, according to U.S. statistics, avail  themselves of this possibility after leaving Cuba illegally is  part of the anti-Cuban strategy being implemented by Washington.    Of course, this policy is complemented by repeated  rejections  given to many Cubans who go to the U.S. Cuban Interests Office  in the island's capital to request a visa to visit their  relatives or to opt for residence in the United States.    An immigration agreement signed years ago by the governments  of the two countries states that Washington will authorize up to  20,000 visas for Cubans, but the Cuban Government has repeatedly  accused the other party of violating this agreement by granting  a ridiculous number of travel permits.    This contrasts with Havana's evident easing of its  immigration process, which now allows any citizen over age 20 to  travel freely, as long as he has the required visa to the place  he wants to go.    Because accepting Haitian refugees is not a U.S. political  priority, the conditions established for these people are  completely different.    All boats taking these emigrants to U.S. territory are  intercepted and forced to return to their place of origin, even  though this might mean, according to repeated reports by Haitian  organizations, delivering them back into the repression from  which they escaped.    Tragic events such as this are repeated and, more than once,  have caused international scandals, as was the case of the  confinement of thousands of Haitians at the Guantanamo Naval  Base that is occupied by the United States in eastern Cuba.  These Haitians were detained there for months and lived in dire  conditions.    Nevertheless, on this occasion, the tragedy reached  unsuspected proportions, because the refusal to help the 35  Haitians who were trying to find haven in the United States  simply turned them into food for sharks; indeed, those who could  help them were absolutely unconcerned about this.    An eloquent depiction of the U.S. position was the desperate  attempt made by another Haitian to pass himself off as a Cuban  named Felipe Gonzalez, but the authorities discovered his true  identity and arrested him upon his arrival in U.S. territory.    Haitian protests and the tragic results of the  aforementioned  event could definitely become a powerful topic of discussion at  the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.     "

The five pleasure boats were handed over to Commissioner of  Hong Kong Police Li Kwan-ha at a handling-over ceremony held at  a pier in Shekou, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of  southern China's Guangdong Province and then towed back to Hong  Kong.    The recovered pleasure crafts have a total value of 12.2  million HK dollars (1.56 million U.S. dollars), said Perter Yam,  senior staff officer of the Organized Crime and Triad [word as  received] Bureau (OCTB), at Sai Wan Ho Marine Police  Headquarters, where the five boats towed to and anchored.    A total of nine pleasure boats were stolen from the Causeway  Bay and Pochong Wan Typhoon Shelters in Hong Kong between  January and October last year. Hong Kong Police passed on  relevant information to its counter parts in China and some  southeastern countries.    After a period of investigation, the public security bureau  (PSB) in Guangdong Province recovered five of the nine stolen  crafts and arrested two Hong Kong residents in connection with  the case, Yam said.    Meanwhile, Hong Kong Police also arrested six Hong Kong  residents based on information supplied by the Chinese PSB, he  added.    As for the other four boats, Yam said, ""The Chinese side  tried its best to assist us in locating them, but there was no  evidence that the boats are at the moment in China."" He  believes the other four boats are still somewhere in Southeast  Asia.    Four of the five returned boats will be handed over to the  insurance company and the fifth will go back to the original  owner, Yam said.    In future, local police will tighten patrol on the sea and  keep in closer contacts with China in cracking down on unlawful  activities, he added.     "

JACKSON      Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters on Wednesday introduced a campaign to  recruit more local applicants for some of the toughest jobs on the streets.    Billboards portraying a smiling Officer John Aguilar and a slogan, ""Earn Our  Academy Award,"" will be installed around Santa Ana as part of the city's  $50,000 advertising effort to recruit police applicants.    The first billboard went up Wednesday at 3rd and Bristol streets, just three  blocks from where Aguilar grew up -- a point not lost on Walters, who wants to  attract local Latino applicants.    ""We're hoping that he'll make an influence on the young people in our community  to grow up and become police officers,"" Walters said.    Over the next year, 25 billboards and 25 bus shelter advertisements will be  installed at various places in Santa Ana.    Other Orange County cities are also turning to advertising and other promotions  to recruit applicants. Recruiting Officer Dave Hill of the Orange Police  Department said he has had to flood the advertising market to fill police  positions.    ""We also advertise in newspapers and trade journals -- I was even on a game  show (Classic Concentration) and put in a plug,"" said Hill, adding that Orange  has five police openings. ""We even got a call from Toronto.""    Santa Ana has openings for 17 patrol officers and hopes to add another 10  investigator jobs when the city adopts its new budget, Walters said.    Applicants must pass exhaustive tests and a background check that includes  credit history and driving records, said Lt. Marty Shirey, investigator.    ""We look at the person's total background,"" she said.    Although standards have not been lowered in an effort to find more recruits,  the city has removed some of the obstacles to applying for the jobs, she said.    For example, in three months the department will replace an old test with a  general knowledge test that will require less study to pass. The city now  issues a book concerning laws and police procedure that applicants must study  to pass the test, Shirey said.    ""We get liars and people who have been fired from three or four jobs,"" she  said. ""What we're looking for is sound judgement, maturity and that they show  some responsibility and honesty.""    The problem isn't in finding enough applicants, Walters said, but in finding  people who will survive the screening.    ""Out of every 100 applicants, we only hire one,"" he said. ""We just want to  maintain the highest standards.""    Walters said Aguilar was chosen to be a Police Department spokesman because of  his ties to the community, his cultural background and his career achievements.    ""Growing up in this town, I have a little more sincere feeling about this city  and this community,"" Aguilar said.    He joined the Orange Police Department in 1977 and was named officer of the  year in 1980. He has worked in law enforcement on the federal level and is now  assigned as an investigator of sexual assault crimes in Santa Ana.    The job pool has changed over the last few years, said Lt. Greg Cooper, who  recruits and trains officers for Santa Ana. For example, out of 212 people who  applied for police positions in June, 60% failed to show up for the initial  written test. There's also an agility test, medical examination, oral test,  psychological test and background check.    In the end, Cooper expects to hire two or three potential officers from the 212  applications. These few will attend the police academy for more than three  months, then take 16 weeks of field training.    In Irvine, where there are two unfilled police jobs, Sgt. Jeff Kermode says he  has seen a change in the job force.    ""There is a different work ethic now. People are into 9-to-5,"" he said. ""They  want to do their job, earn their pay, and leave.""

The seizure represented an estimated loss of $2.6 million to the recording  industry, police said.    The bootleg operation seized Wednesday may be connected to similar raids  conducted last month in Los Angeles County, police said Thursday. Also  confiscated were 2,300 original master tapes, labels and other packaging  materials and recording equipment valued at $50,000. Officials said the dubbing  machines were capable of producing 12 tapes every 90 seconds.    The bootleg operation in Fullerton was discovered by two Los Angeles police  detectives who went to Unit J of an industrial complex at 2524 Fender Ave. on  Wednesday to serve a search warrant in an unrelated robbery case. The person  they were looking for had listed CST Environmental as his work address.    Although CST Environmental had moved away, the bootleg operation hadn't  replaced the name on the door when it moved in about six weeks ago, Fullerton  Police Sgt. Glenn Deveney said.    ""They (Los Angeles police) saw employees dubbing cassette tapes and recognized  it as a pirating operation,"" Deveney said, adding that the Fullerton Police  Department was then called in to investigate.    Based on interviews with five employees who were detained briefly,  investigators said the counterfeit tapes were being manufactured day and night,  resulting in the production of about 30,000 cassettes a week. Police said the  employees were paid $150 a week.    ""This is one of the larger piracy warehouses,"" Fullerton Police Detective Joe  Caracci said. ""It's one of the more sophisticated ones.""    About 70% of the tapes confiscated in Fullerton were by Latino artists, such as  Alex Bueno and Los Mier. The other cassettes included recordings by M.C.  Hammer, Milli Vanilli and Willie Nelson.    Such tapes are sold at swap meets at below-market prices, police said.    Police believe that the operation was distributing the tapes nationwide.  Caracci said evidence showed some of the tapes were being shipped to El Paso,  Tex., with other locations listed on business documents. Some were probably  distributed in Los Angeles, Caracci said.    ""We have a lot of Mexican-American and Hispanic people (in the Los Angeles  area). And like everybody else, they go to swap meets; we go to swap meets, and  these tapes are made for the region.""    A recording industry spokeswoman said a raid in Chino on Aug. 28 resulted in  the confiscation of tapes and equipment representing a potential annual loss to  the industry of $45 million. Police searched two more locations in Ontario the  next day, where an additional 20,000 tapes were confiscated. No dollar value  was available.    Eight people were charged with violations in those raids, according to Trish  Heimors, a spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Assn. of America Inc. The  bootleg recordings confiscated were mostly by rap artists, including 2 Live  Crew and Stevie B.    Consultants for the association have joined Fullerton police in the  investigation.    Caracci said all these bootleg operations could be connected, but he declined  to elaborate.    Police said the owner of the Fullerton business operated under three or four  names, but they had narrowed it down to one name by Thursday. They also believe  that a second ""silent partner"" was involved.    ""We will find the man that leased the office. There's no problem with that,""  Caracci said. ""Anybody above and beyond him, I doubt it.""    One nearby business owner said he was surprised by the raid because the suspect  earlier had told him that he sold clothes and tennis shoes at swap meets.    ""I guess I had an underlying feeling that something was wrong because it was  sort of clandestine the way trucks would be coming up and loading little  boxes,"" said Dan Short, the business owner.    John Fahel, whose family business in the same complex sells wholesale tennis  shoes at swap meets, said the suspect telephoned his office Wednesday during  the police raid after calling his own business and suspecting something was  wrong.    Fahel said they met within the last few weeks -- drawn together because they  are both Arab nationals -- but had not worked together at swap meets.    ""We did not know what this guy did,"" Fahel said. ""We do an honest living.""      Photo, Seized dubbing machines can produce 12 tapes every 90 seconds.

Police said the  employees were paid $150 a week.    ""This is one of the larger piracy warehouses,"" Fullerton Police Detective Joe  Caracci said. ""It's one of the more sophisticated ones.""    About 70% of the tapes confiscated in Fullerton were by Latino artists, such as  Alex Bueno and Los Mier. The other cassettes included recordings by M.C.  Hammer, Milli Vanilli and Willie Nelson.    Such tapes are sold at swap meets at below-market prices, police said.    Police believe that the operation was distributing the tapes nationwide.  Caracci said evidence showed some of the tapes were being shipped to El Paso,  Tex., with other locations listed on business documents. Some were probably  distributed in Los Angeles, Caracci said.    ""We have a lot of Mexican-American and Hispanic people (in the Los Angeles  area). And like everybody else, they go to swap meets; we go to swap meets, and  these tapes are made for the region.""    A recording industry spokeswoman said a raid in Chino on Aug. 28 resulted in  the confiscation of tapes and equipment representing a potential annual loss to  the industry of $45 million. Police searched two more locations in Ontario the  next day, where an additional 20,000 tapes were confiscated. No dollar value  was available.    Eight people were charged with violations in those raids, according to Trish  Heimors, a spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Assn. of America Inc. The  bootleg recordings confiscated were mostly by rap artists, including 2 Live  Crew and Stevie B.    Consultants for the association have joined Fullerton police in the  investigation.    Caracci said all these bootleg operations could be connected, but he declined  to elaborate.    Police said the owner of the Fullerton business operated under three or four  names, but they had narrowed it down to one name by Thursday. They also believe  that a second ""silent partner"" was involved.    ""We will find the man that leased the office. There's no problem with that,""  Caracci said. ""Anybody above and beyond him, I doubt it.""    One nearby business owner said he was surprised by the raid because the suspect  earlier had told him that he sold clothes and tennis shoes at swap meets.    ""I guess I had an underlying feeling that something was wrong because it was  sort of clandestine the way trucks would be coming up and loading little  boxes,"" said Dan Short, the business owner.    John Fahel, whose family business in the same complex sells wholesale tennis  shoes at swap meets, said the suspect telephoned his office Wednesday during  the police raid after calling his own business and suspecting something was  wrong.    Fahel said they met within the last few weeks -- drawn together because they  are both Arab nationals -- but had not worked together at swap meets.    ""We did not know what this guy did,"" Fahel said. ""We do an honest living.""      Photo, Seized dubbing machines can produce 12 tapes every 90 seconds.

TO PROBE FUTURE POLICE SHOOTINGS, JAIL DEATHS      By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The Torrance Police Department will call on the district attorney's office to  investigate officer-involved shootings and deaths of prisoners in custody, a  department official said this week.    Police Chief Donald Nash is expected to order this month that Torrance  investigators call the district attorney's ""roll-out"" teams in those  situations, Capt. Jim Weyant said.    The decision to ask for independent investigations follows a difficult year for  the Torrance Police Department. Last February, two officers were charged with  lying about the shooting of an unarmed man, and in September a jury ruled that  the department has routinely condoned misconduct by officers.    About half of the county's 47 police departments call the district attorney's  office to investigate jail deaths and police shootings that result in injuries  or deaths, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb Lapin.    Torrance police officials have vehemently denied charges that they have not  thoroughly investigated fellow officers. However, Weyant noted, participation  in the district attorney's roll-out program will help eliminate even the  appearance of impropriety.    ""Some changes can be made so that the perception is that we do things right,""  Weyant said. ""It adds to the overall thoroughness. Anything we do, there is  another entity doing it too.""    In the district attorney's program, a prosecutor and an investigator ""roll out""  to the scene of police shootings and jail deaths, Lapin said. They interview  witnesses, review evidence and reach conclusions independently of police  investigations.    The district attorney's investigations seldom find improprieties in the police  department reviews, but they bolster public confidence, Lapin said. ""It gives  the police the position of being able to say, 'It is under investigation by the  district attorney's office,' "" Lapin said.    Participation in the roll-out program is the most recent in a series of  procedural changes in the Torrance Police Department after last year's  problems. The department has already imposed a rule that ranking officers must  investigate misconduct allegations. It has also begun to reorganize and  simplify internal affairs files. And it will adopt a computer program that will  allow administrators to track the most common kinds of police misbehavior and  to standardize discipline.    In the past, the Torrance department conducted its own investigations when  officers shot suspects, as it did in the May, 1988, shooting of Patrick J.  Coyle.    Officer Timothy Pappas initially said he shot Coyle when the Torrance  construction worker reached for a shiny object in his belt, police reports say.  Coyle was partially paralyzed as a result of the shooting.    Two fellow officers backed Pappas' account, but one of them later said that the  story was a lie and that the shooting was unprovoked. Armed with the new  information, the Police Department fired Pappas and the two officers who backed  his story.    The department presented the case to the district attorney's office and Pappas  and fellow officer Mark Holden were charged last February with conspiracy to  obstruct justice and conspiracy to falsely charge another with a crime.    Pappas pleaded no contest to lesser charges and last month was fined $2,250 and  placed on one year of probation. Holden is scheduled to go to trial this spring  on the original charges. The third officer, Timothy Thornton, was granted  immunity in exchange for his testimony against the two.    Last September, the Police Department lost a $5.5-million civil judgment to a  San Pedro man whose son was killed in a traffic collision with an off-duty  police sergeant.    A jury found that fellow officers covered up Sgt. Rollo Green's responsibility  for the crash as part of a pattern in which Torrance police have condoned  misconduct by fellow officers.    The city has appealed the verdict, and Police Department officials say the  department did nothing wrong.

Julio Lucero, of the 1400 block of Front Street, is being held at the County  Jail on suspicion of heroin possession, possession of heroin for sale and an  outstanding 1988 warrant for dealing heroin. Augustina Perez Moreno, 21, of the  same Front Street address, is being held on suspicion of possessing of heroin  and possessing heroin for sale.    Police seized $2,285 in cash, some syringes and 103 multicolored balloons each  stuffed with three-tenths of a gram of Mexican brown heroin during their early  morning raid of the Front Street studio apartment, said Detective Bill Graham.    The ballons, which are called quarter balloons because they usually sell for  $25 each, have a street value of about $2,500.    Police ran a chemical test on the heroin at the station.    ""I think we've got some pretty good stuff here,"" said Graham, who was involved  in the arrest.

The Inglewood Police Department asked for the public's  assistance in finding Metoyer, who they believe is still in the Los Angeles  area.    The attack occurred June 3 in the neighborhood south of the Hollywood Park race  track in a home that the 33-year-old mother shared with her daughter, a  19-year-old woman and two younger children.    Metoyer, who has no permanent residence, often visited his grandmother, who  lived on Doty Avenue, said Inglewood police Sgt. Harold Moret.

Police said that once Metoyer was inside the house, he tied the hands of the  two women and a 14-year-old girl, raped all three and then shot each at least  once in the head. The suspect fled with a pillowcase filled with valuables.    The 19-year-old woman died Tuesday morning at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA  Medical Center from a wound behind one ear.

Metoyer is  described as 6-foot-1 to 6-foot-3, 180 pounds with a shaved head.    He has lived in Compton and south Los Angeles.    Police say that Metoyer is also suspected of firing shots in late May at a  15-year-old who was riding a bicycle through the same Inglewood neighborhood.

Police identified the rightists as Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41,  and  Toshikazu Furusawa, 29, both from the Taihikai right-wing group.    The two were arrested at around 7:10 p.m. [1010 GMT]  Uchiyama  was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest and police said  they recovered four sticks of dynamite.    The two men had held Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge  of the company's public relations department, and Mikinori  Yoshida, 51, the head of the secretarial department, in an  executive reception room on the 15th floor, police said.    Before breaking into the building, the two rightists,  carrying a sword, a handgun, and what they said were two sticks  of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun,  police said.    Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass  media  as a ``class a war criminal'' and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to  ``amend the tone of its news coverage.''    The pamphlets also criticized Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa for his failure to retract a statement apologizing for  Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he said were ``a war of  aggression.''    Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30  p.m., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake  and they wanted to meet the company's president.    Police said one of the men fired a shot when another  security  guard approached but no one was injured.    They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used  desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the  executive reception room with the hostages.    Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security  guard they are ``disciples'' of [Taihikhai leader] Nomura.  Furusawa was Nomura's secretary and chauffeur.

The association also charged that Tutich had failed to recruit Asian police  officers, though the city's population is about one-third Asian, and that he  had sought to alter the report on an accident in which his father-in-law was  involved.    Tutich, who has been police chief for 13 years, responded heatedly to the  charges. He said the San Gabriel Police Department had been a model department  that applied for federal block grants and contributed significantly to reducing  crime in the city.

For a few weeks last spring, the allegations against Tutich became a hot  political issue as incumbents on the council accused challengers in the  municipal election of orchestrating the charges. The challengers, running on a  slow-growth slate, denied that they were involved.      Previous Investigation    After three slow-growth challengers ousted three incumbents in the April  election, the council appointed Orange County lawyer R. Zaiden Corrado as city  attorney. Corrado began an investigation of the Police Department but resigned  less than a month later, charging that Mayor John Tapp was impeding the  investigation.    Tapp denied that he had done anything improper, explaining that Corrado's  investigation was not timely. Corrado had ""jumped the gun,"" said Councilman  James Castaneda.    ""I'm glad it's behind us,"" Tapp said. ""Too bad it took a year to come to  conclusion. I hope the community can go forward and work on other issues now.""

For a few weeks last spring, the allegations against Tutich became a hot  political issue as incumbents on the council accused challengers in the  municipal election of orchestrating the charges. The challengers, running on a  slow-growth slate, denied that they were involved.      Previous Investigation    After three slow-growth challengers ousted three incumbents in the April  election, the council appointed Orange County lawyer R. Zaiden Corrado as city  attorney. Corrado began an investigation of the Police Department but resigned  less than a month later, charging that Mayor John Tapp was impeding the  investigation.    Tapp denied that he had done anything improper, explaining that Corrado's  investigation was not timely. Corrado had ""jumped the gun,"" said Councilman  James Castaneda.    ""I'm glad it's behind us,"" Tapp said. ""Too bad it took a year to come to  conclusion. I hope the community can go forward and work on other issues now.""    Councilman Sabino Cici said he heartily approved of the exoneration of Tutich.  ""I just think we should have gone a step further and apologized to the chief  for taking so long,"" Cici said.    Police Capt. David Lawton, the department's No. 2 man, who had issued a  statement in support of Tutich last year, said the committee's findings were no  surprise. ""I never felt there was any substance to the allegations to begin  with,"" he said.    "

The size, color, and  type of printing of these bills are the best ever found in  Brazil. No fake dollars previously found in the country are so  similar to real dollar bills. Federal Police experts are  impressed. The 1,000 bills of $100 seized at Manaus  International Airport even have metal protection bands.    Former mason Astenio Nunes de Souza and businessman Juarez  de  Paula Sobrinho, who live in Manaus, confessed to buying the  counterfeit bills in Colombia to sell them in Belem, Para State;  Rio de Janeiro; and Sao Paulo.    Federal Police already are convinced that the dollar bills  are being printed in Colombia because counterfeiting is only  considered a crime in that country when counterfeit Colombian  money is printed. To print any other counterfeit currency is  only a misdemeanor and the counterfeiter can, at most, be fined  for doing it.    For that reason, Federal Police today sent Colombian  authorities an official letter calling for an urgent  investigation, particularly in Leticia, which is a town  separated from Brazil by nothing but a street.    At Tabatinga, on the Brazilian side, Federal Police have  reinforced border controls. On this side of the border, buying  or selling counterfeit dollars can result in five years in jail.     "

Take one seaworthy snowmobile with a gas-powered engine that will make it go up  to 40 m.p.h., and you have the latest rage -- or annoyance, some say -- on the  nation's recreational waters.    Known by brand names such as Jet Ski or Wet Jet, these marine motorcycles are  generating huge sales for their manufacturers and rising concern among boaters  and officials in several states.    Manufacturers like to describe these highly maneuverable aquatic hot rods as  ""personal watercraft."" But marine police have an unprintable term for them.  Last year, 20 people were killed in personal watercraft accidents nationwide --  a fourfold increase from 1987 -- and 254 were injured, according to the U.S.  Coast Guard. Several serious accidents, but no deaths, were reported in  Maryland waters.    ""Let me tell you about these darn things,"" said angry Annapolis area boater  Yvonne Gilder, who, like many other pleasure-craft owners, already has a  collection of horror stories. Gilder tells of being harassed by aggressive  personal watercraft drivers, some of whom get their thrills by jumping over the  wakes of other boats or racing in tight circles in congested waterways.      Inherently Safe    But even critics agree on one thing when personal watercraft are compared with  the ""all terrain vehicle,"" the three-wheeled, off-road motorcycle banned after  design problems were linked to hundreds of deaths. By most accounts, personal  watercraft are inherently safe and manage to withstand the worst abuse. It's  just that they are driven too often by joy riders who don't give a lick for  safety or common boating courtesies, officials said.    ""The problem we're facing is not the equipment. It's the people who are  operating them that's the problem,"" said Al Simon, chairman of Maryland's Boat  Act Advisory Committee.    Some personal watercraft owners think they're getting a bum rap because of a  few bad apples. Simon and other officials, trying to quell the open warfare  that has sprung up between the personal watercraft crowd and owners of bigger  craft, this month will consider imposing several restrictions because of the  growing number of accidents and complaints.    Maryland Department of Natural Resources police said they receive up to a dozen  complaints about mischievous PWs each weekend. ""They come out like a swarm of  bees,"" said department police Maj. Frank Wood. ""They're out riding them like a  toy in a real boating environment.""    Most drivers, many of them teen-agers, don't wear helmets.

Take one seaworthy snowmobile with a gas-powered engine that will make it go up  to 40 m.p.h., and you have the latest rage -- or annoyance, some say -- on the  nation's recreational waters.    Known by brand names such as Jet Ski or Wet Jet, these marine motorcycles are  generating huge sales for their manufacturers and rising concern among boaters  and officials in several states.    Manufacturers like to describe these highly maneuverable aquatic hot rods as  ""personal watercraft."" But marine police have an unprintable term for them.  Last year, 20 people were killed in personal watercraft accidents nationwide --  a fourfold increase from 1987 -- and 254 were injured, according to the U.S.  Coast Guard. Several serious accidents, but no deaths, were reported in  Maryland waters.    ""Let me tell you about these darn things,"" said angry Annapolis area boater  Yvonne Gilder, who, like many other pleasure-craft owners, already has a  collection of horror stories. Gilder tells of being harassed by aggressive  personal watercraft drivers, some of whom get their thrills by jumping over the  wakes of other boats or racing in tight circles in congested waterways.      Inherently Safe    But even critics agree on one thing when personal watercraft are compared with  the ""all terrain vehicle,"" the three-wheeled, off-road motorcycle banned after  design problems were linked to hundreds of deaths. By most accounts, personal  watercraft are inherently safe and manage to withstand the worst abuse. It's  just that they are driven too often by joy riders who don't give a lick for  safety or common boating courtesies, officials said.    ""The problem we're facing is not the equipment. It's the people who are  operating them that's the problem,"" said Al Simon, chairman of Maryland's Boat  Act Advisory Committee.    Some personal watercraft owners think they're getting a bum rap because of a  few bad apples. Simon and other officials, trying to quell the open warfare  that has sprung up between the personal watercraft crowd and owners of bigger  craft, this month will consider imposing several restrictions because of the  growing number of accidents and complaints.    Maryland Department of Natural Resources police said they receive up to a dozen  complaints about mischievous PWs each weekend. ""They come out like a swarm of  bees,"" said department police Maj. Frank Wood. ""They're out riding them like a  toy in a real boating environment.""    Most drivers, many of them teen-agers, don't wear helmets.

Neighbors chased down the suspect, Felipe Patricio of Fullerton, and held him  for police. He was being held without bail at Orange County Jail on suspicion  of murder in connection with the death of Abel Enrique Luna, 24.    Police said Luna was trying to protect an unidentified woman from Patricio  after she told the suspect to stop pulling a 10-year-old girl by the hair.  Patricio slapped the woman and Luna intervened, triggering a string of  arguments and fights that ended with Luna's death late Sunday night, police  said.    Several neighbors, including Maria Becerra, who described herself as Patricio's  girlfriend, said the suspect had been drinking heavily that day.    According to neighbors, Patricio and Luna began to argue about 3 p.m. after  Patricio scolded the 10-year-old for the way she was taking care of an infant.  After he pulled the girl's hair, her mother demanded to know why. Patricio then  slapped her, neighbors said.    Becerra said that Luna then walked over to the couple's open window and  demanded to see Patricio. As soon as her boyfriend stepped outside of their  apartment, Becerra said, the two men started fighting in the small courtyard of  their East Wilshire Avenue apartment complex.    ""I yelled at them to calm down,"" Becerra said in Spanish, adding that she  called police when the men continued to fight.    However, Fullerton Police Detective Sgt. Danny Becerra said officers first  answered a call at the apartment complex about 8 p.m. Danny Becerra and Maria  Becerra are not related.    Maria Becerra said that Luna won the fistfight, leaving Patricio bleeding from  the nose, eye and mouth.    Police said Patricio left the area, walked down to a Lucky Food Center about a  block a way, purchased a small steak knife and returned. Police said that about  10:45 p.m., Luna approached Patricio, made several hostile remarks and the two  began fighting again.    Police said that this time, Patricio stabbed Luna. Luna was taken to St. Jude  Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton with three stab wounds in the  upper chest and one in the right thigh. He died about 11:45 p.m.    Victor Martinez, 11, said he came out of his home just as that fight ended. He  said he saw Luna on the ground and Patricio running away. He said that he and  about six men, including some of Luna's friends, chased Patricio, catching him  about a block away.    Police said that they expect the Orange County district attorney's office to  file formal murder charges against Patricio today.

According to the police briefing, the Saab-9000 driven by  Mosolygo, en route from Miskolc to Budapest, crossed the  bisecting line of the road and hit an IFA-type lorry, which was  parked in the opposite lane because of a defect in the trailer's  right rear tyre. The accident occurred on May 5 at 8.45 P.M.  [1845 GMT] on highway No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod.  Mosolygo, Horn, and his escort, retired police-major Jeno  Zsidey, sustained serious injuries in the accident. According  to investigations so far, neither Mosolygo nor the lorry-driver  were intoxicated.    The police survey of the scene of the accident showed that  the lorry stood on the left side of the road, 0.7-1.2 meters  from the bisecting line. The passengers in the Saab observed no  oncoming traffic, nor did they see any pedestrians, cyclists, or  animals nearby, and only Zsidey claimed to have seen a sudden  flash of light. Mosolygo cannot remember what happened before  or during the crash.    There was no witness to raise suspicion that the crash had  been caused deliberately, the National Police Command told  reporters at the press conference called in Budapest on Friday  after investigations into the accident came to an end.    In response to questions from reporters, the National Police  Commissioner, Brigadier-General Sandor Pinter, said that on  March 25 the ORFK had offered personal escorts to all eight  parliamentary parties, but none availed themselves of the  opportunity. He made it a point to stress that the car carrying  the person under police escort never goes ahead, as was the case  with the convoy of three cars accompanying Horn on his return  from Miskolc.    Prior to the accident, Horn received several threatening  telephone calls, and police patrols had been assigned to  regularly check the vicinity of the MSZP chairman's residence,  Pinter said.     "

As is  customary, large quantities of drugs confiscated are set to the  torch, hoping that this and the fines and imprisonment terms can  act as a deterrent for both perpetrators and would-be felons.  Last month, members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force,  accompanied by prison inmates, took a large quantity of  confiscated drugs to the dump site and set it alight. The  stash, comprising marijuana, cocaine, and crack, was estimated  at over ECU250,000.     "

In the first case, the drug had been cleverly camouflaged  inside 100 meters of electrical cable which Colombian Cesar  Augusto Andrade Gomez was trying to export to Rome. According  to a police spokesman, Aldo J. Come, whose nationality has not  been established, was to receive the package in Rome. Andrade  was arrested at a post office branch in Quito where an Interpol  agent inspected the package and discovered that the cocaine had  been cleverly wrapped with protective plastic inside the cable.    Police also reported the arrest of a Colombian couple,  Libardo Santander Benavides and his wife Berta Vargas Reina, who  were keeping several packages of cocaine hydrochlorate in their  home in Yaruqui, approximately 20 km northeast of Quito. The  drug was brought into the country through Putumayo on the  Colombian-Ecuadoran border.    Recently, the authorities also seized more than half a ton  of  cocaine in Guayaquil hidden in several Colombian products such  as coffee, cookies, and candies, that were to be sent in a ship  to the United States and Canada.    Police sources indicated that operations continue to  dismantle what seems to be an international drug trafficking  organization that is using Ecuador as a ""bridge"" as a result of  the persecution against the Colombian cartels.

By CAROL WATSON and MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Sixty law enforcement officers, including two SWAT teams, converged on a Santa  Paula neighborhood before dawn Wednesday to arrest four alleged members of a  local gang suspected of involvement in a drive-by shooting in Ventura.    Larry Renteria, 23, Arthur Banuelos, 22, Michael Banuelos, 38, and Steven  Bracamontes, 23, were arrested without incident after a 5 a.m. search of four  houses on Mill Street. The four, accused of belonging to the Crimies gang, are  suspected of attacking a car driven by a member of the rival Party Boyz gang on  May 18.    Renteria and Arthur Banuelos, being held on $250,000 bail each, were booked in  Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder. Bracamontes was arrested  on suspicion of illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun and violating  probation. He was jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail. Michael Banuelos, 38, was  being held in County Jail without bail for violating state prison parole.    ""Communities within Ventura County have just about had it as far as gangs and  their potential for growth go,"" said Lt. Pat Rooney of the Ventura Police  Department, which organized the investigation. ""We don't ever want to be in the  same position as some of our sister counties.""    Police said the four men are suspected of chasing a car driven by alleged Party  Boyz member Mario (Dino) Castro on May 18, about 8:20 p.m. At least three shots  were fired at the car in the 1100 block of Citrus Drive at the eastern edge of  Ventura, police said.    Neither Castro nor his passenger were injured, and both vehicles sped away to  Santa Paula, police said.    Witnesses reported the shooting and with the help of the Santa Paula Police  Department, Ventura police officers identified Castro.    Santa Paula police Cmdr. Bob Gonzales said Castro was known to police as a  Party Boyz gang member with a history of gang affiliation. Based on his  association with gangs, authorities were able to identify his attackers,  Gonzalez said. During the search Wednesday, officers found 14 guns -- an AK-47,  three handguns, two sawed-off shotguns and seven rifles and shotguns, police  said.    SWAT teams from the Ventura Police Department and the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department were on hand, Rooney said.    Participating in the arrests were officers from the Ventura Police Department,  the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the Santa Paula Police Department, the  Ventura County district attorney's office and the State Department of  Corrections.    The police raid Wednesday morning followed a fatal shooting in Santa Paula  Monday in which a Santa Paula man is accused of killing his next-door neighbor  -- a shooting that police have linked to a quarrel about alleged gang activity  involving their children.    Santa Paula police arrested Delfino Lopez, 43, on a murder charge Monday in the  shooting of Samuel Ruiz. He was rearrested Wednesday, police said, allowing  them to hold Lopez for another 48 hours while they finish reports on the  slaying.    Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison said Lopez will be arraigned today or Friday  in Ventura County Municipal Court.    Lopez's wife and son, speaking outside a courtroom before his arraignment was  delayed Wednesday, said Ruiz and Lopez were the best of friends until a week  before the shooting, when they began arguing about a fight among their sons.    The wife and son, Martha and Freddy Joe Lopez, vehemently denied police reports  that the shooting was gang-related, although the son, Freddy Joe Lopez, said he  belonged to a Santa Paula gang 2 1/2 years ago.    Martha Lopez said she looked out her window on Monday afternoon and saw Ruiz  next door, drunk and yelling threats at her family. She said she saw Ruiz pull  a gun from under his shirt, cock it and point it at her husband, Delfino Lopez,  while the two continued arguing.    She said she called 911 and while she was on the phone, Ruiz began shooting.  She said her husband shot back at Ruiz, although she couldn't see him around  the window frame. Moments later, Delfino Lopez walked into the house, without a  gun, Martha Lopez said.    ""And he goes, 'You better get an ambulance' "" she said.    Police have not found the weapon used to kill Ruiz. Ventura County Coroner Dr.  F. Warren Lovell ruled that Ruiz died of a gunshot wound to the chest.

Bracamontes was arrested  on suspicion of illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun and violating  probation. He was jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail. Michael Banuelos, 38, was  being held in County Jail without bail for violating state prison parole.    ""Communities within Ventura County have just about had it as far as gangs and  their potential for growth go,"" said Lt. Pat Rooney of the Ventura Police  Department, which organized the investigation. ""We don't ever want to be in the  same position as some of our sister counties.""    Police said the four men are suspected of chasing a car driven by alleged Party  Boyz member Mario (Dino) Castro on May 18, about 8:20 p.m. At least three shots  were fired at the car in the 1100 block of Citrus Drive at the eastern edge of  Ventura, police said.    Neither Castro nor his passenger were injured, and both vehicles sped away to  Santa Paula, police said.    Witnesses reported the shooting and with the help of the Santa Paula Police  Department, Ventura police officers identified Castro.    Santa Paula police Cmdr. Bob Gonzales said Castro was known to police as a  Party Boyz gang member with a history of gang affiliation. Based on his  association with gangs, authorities were able to identify his attackers,  Gonzalez said. During the search Wednesday, officers found 14 guns -- an AK-47,  three handguns, two sawed-off shotguns and seven rifles and shotguns, police  said.    SWAT teams from the Ventura Police Department and the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department were on hand, Rooney said.    Participating in the arrests were officers from the Ventura Police Department,  the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the Santa Paula Police Department, the  Ventura County district attorney's office and the State Department of  Corrections.    The police raid Wednesday morning followed a fatal shooting in Santa Paula  Monday in which a Santa Paula man is accused of killing his next-door neighbor  -- a shooting that police have linked to a quarrel about alleged gang activity  involving their children.    Santa Paula police arrested Delfino Lopez, 43, on a murder charge Monday in the  shooting of Samuel Ruiz. He was rearrested Wednesday, police said, allowing  them to hold Lopez for another 48 hours while they finish reports on the  slaying.    Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison said Lopez will be arraigned today or Friday  in Ventura County Municipal Court.    Lopez's wife and son, speaking outside a courtroom before his arraignment was  delayed Wednesday, said Ruiz and Lopez were the best of friends until a week  before the shooting, when they began arguing about a fight among their sons.    The wife and son, Martha and Freddy Joe Lopez, vehemently denied police reports  that the shooting was gang-related, although the son, Freddy Joe Lopez, said he  belonged to a Santa Paula gang 2 1/2 years ago.    Martha Lopez said she looked out her window on Monday afternoon and saw Ruiz  next door, drunk and yelling threats at her family. She said she saw Ruiz pull  a gun from under his shirt, cock it and point it at her husband, Delfino Lopez,  while the two continued arguing.    She said she called 911 and while she was on the phone, Ruiz began shooting.  She said her husband shot back at Ruiz, although she couldn't see him around  the window frame. Moments later, Delfino Lopez walked into the house, without a  gun, Martha Lopez said.    ""And he goes, 'You better get an ambulance' "" she said.    Police have not found the weapon used to kill Ruiz. Ventura County Coroner Dr.  F. Warren Lovell ruled that Ruiz died of a gunshot wound to the chest.    Times staff writer Psyche Pascual contributed to this story.      June 1, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition      FOR THE RECORD    Misidentified -- In an article Thursday on a police gang raid in Santa Paula,  The Times incorrectly identified Michael Banuelos, 38, and Steven Bracamontes,  23, as suspects in a May 18 drive-by shooting. Police said the two men are not  suspects in the shooting but were arrested for parole and probation violations.  Banuelos was also incorrectly identified as a suspected gang member.    "

Gates said Wednesday that he has reprimanded  his second-in-command, Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon, for using a Police  Department computer to research the backround of a political candidate in  Pasadena.    Vernon, Gates said, intended to give to his Pasadena neighbors a computerized  printout of newspaper stories and other publicly available documents relating  to Michael Zinzun, a former Black Panther who is running for Pasadena's Board  of City Directors.    At Vernon's request, the Police Department's Anti-Terrorist Division last week  printed out 50 documents -- 156 pages in all -- and gave them to Vernon.  However, LAPD officials alerted Gates, who intervened before Vernon could pass  on the data, according to the chief.      'Judgment Was Poor'    ""While his motives were pure, his judgment was poor,"" Gates said of Vernon, a  34-year department veteran who has been considered a leading candidate to  eventually become chief.    The rebuke comes at a time when Gates' interest in politics has stirred  speculation on who might succeed him as chief, and department sources said the  Zinzun matter would not help Vernon's chances.    Gates said he intends to ask that Vernon, 55, repay the Police Department for  having printed out the articles on Zinzun. The bill is expected to be more than  $300.    Zinzun played a central role in the dismantling of the LAPD's Public Disorder  Intelligence Division (PDID), the forerunner of the Anti-Terrorist Division.  The PDID came under fire for illegally spying on lawful citizens, and Zinzun  was a plaintiff in a civil action against the unit.    On Wednesday, Zinzun condemned Vernon's action as ""obvious misuse of taxpayer  funds.""    Gates said he intends to discuss the matter with the Los Angeles Police  Commission, the civilian board that oversees the department.    ""The system worked in this case,"" Gates said. ""I verbally reprimanded Bob  (Vernon) and we'll look at whether we'll formalize that. We have returned the  stuff that was printed out to the files.""    Gates said he did not know why Vernon's neighbors wanted the information on  Zinzun.    Vernon did not respond Wednesday to telephone messages left by The Times.    A devout Christian and a lay minister in a fundamentalist church, Vernon in  1987 was accused by some in the Police Department of giving promotional  preference to fellow Christians. He strongly denied those allegations.      Police Regulations    Los Angeles police regulations expressly forbid department personnel from using  police resources for other than official purposes.    The department's manual states: ""All official files, documents, records and  information held by the department . . . shall be regarded as confidential.  Employees shall not disclose or permit the disclosure of . . . information  except as required in the performance of their official duties.""    Zinzun's Los Angeles-based organization, the Coalition Against Police Abuse,  was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties  Union. The suit alleged that the PDID unit had spied illegally and kept files  on hundreds of citizens. Some of those files had been removed by a PDID  detective who was channeling the data to an ultra-right-wing organization.    In 1983, the city settled the ACLU lawsuit for $1.8 million and PDID was  disbanded. In its place, the 45-member Anti-Terrorist Division was formed.  Strict guidelines limiting access to the division's files were established at  that time.    The unit, according to its desciption in the department manual, is responsible  for collecting and analyzing information on ""individuals and organizations  which plan, perform, threaten, or attempt unlawful acts which can reasonably be  expected to result in death, serious bodily injury, significant disruption to  the public order, or significant property damage. . . . ""      Called 'Outrageous'    On Wednesday, Paul Hoffman, an ACLU attorney who helped prepare those  guidelines, called Vernon's use of department resources for personal reasons an  ""outrageous"" violation of accceptable police conduct.    ""One of the concerns I have is if he would so something that stupid just for  his neighbors, what kind of information would he dig up for somebody with some  real political clout,"" Hoffman said.    Zinzun, 40, is one of three candidates for a seat on the seven-member Pasadena  Board of City Directors. His opponents are grocery store manager Gretchen  Sterling and real estate broker Chris Holden, the son of Los Angeles City  Councilman Nate Holden.    The elder Holden, a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles and a strong ally of the  Police Department, said Wednesday that he had no knowledge of Vernon's attempt  to secure information about Zinzun.    The younger Holden did not return telephone calls from The Times.      Demands Apology    ""This is how the PDID affair began,"" Zinzun said, ""first one little thing, then  another."" He demanded a public apology from the LAPD, and called for expansion  of the unit's guidelines ""to make sure this doesn't happen again.""    Zinzun also called on the Police Commission to investigate whether Vernon or  any other LAPD officers have used police records for similiar purposes.    The response from Commission Chariman Robert M. Talcott was noncommittal:    ""We will be receiving a full and complete briefing on the subject matter (in  closed session) at next Tuesday's meeting and review the materials at issue,""  Talcott said. ""At that point, we will make a decision as to how the commission  might proceed.""      Agrees to Settlement    Zinzun, who has been defeated soundly twice before in seeking election to  Pasadena's board, was in the news a year ago when he agreed to a $1.2-million  out-of-court settlement with Pasadena police.    Zinzun had alleged that he was beaten and falsely arrested in a June, 1986,  fracas at the Community Arms low-income housing complex in northwestern  Pasadena. During the scuffle, Zinzun was struck in the face, allegedly by a  police flashlight, and lost the sight in his left eye.    He is seeking to represent a district that is adjacent to the one in which  Vernon lives.

Jiri Novotny has become commander of the UNPROFOR Sector  South Operational Staff, where the Czech soldiers are active.  One of the Czech officers is likely to become the commander of  the entire sector as of April, and another the commander of the  Military Police in that part of the former Yugoslavia.    Apart from Colonel Cech, who will be in charge of soldiers  from 20 countries, 22 additional Czech military police members  will be active in the former Yugoslavia.

Police identified one of the men as Kuniyasu Uchiyama,  41, the group's deputy chairman.    Police said one of the men had fired a shot from a gun but  no  one was reported injured.    It was the second incident in five months at the  mass-circulation ASAHI SHIMBUN headquarters involving the  Taihikai. On 20 October, Shusuke Nomura, 58, the leader of the  group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a  meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of  a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated  with the company.    Police were negotiating with the rightists by telephone.  They said the two Taihikai members later released eight  hostages, but were still holding an executive in charge of the  company's public relations department, Kei Aragaki, and the head  of the secretarial department, Mikinori Yoshida.    They said the rightists were using potted plants to  barricade  the door to the room.    They identified the other rightist as Toshikazu Furusawa,  29.    On 12 November 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set  off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of  former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru.  Uchiyama was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest.     "

By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      All Todd Gardner ever wanted was to wear the uniform of a Los Angeles police  officer. And, after working as a cop in Aurora, Colo., and San Diego, his dream  came true in March when he was accepted into the Los Angeles Police Academy.    The only other thing close to his heart was his wife, Lisa, but that  passion-turned-obsession cost him his future as a Los Angeles police officer,  left him wounded by three bullets fired by a Denver-area police officer and  landed him in a Denver jail in lieu of $1-million bail.    Although the Los Angeles Police Department had accepted Gardner, 28, as a  recruit, he was shot after a bizarre rampage this summer in which he allegedly  assaulted and kidnaped his estranged wife. The incident followed other domestic  troubles, and Colorado police said that Gardner, who had repeatedly threatened  to commit suicide, tricked the police officer into shooting him by pretending  to have a gun.    These events have raised questions about the accuracy of psychological  evaluations and background investigations of Los Angeles Police Department  recruits, especially since Gardner appeared in a Denver courtroom Monday and  pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.    ""This is the first such occurrence that I'm aware of where someone who was  accepted into the academy had what appears to be such an emotional breakdown,""  said Sheldon Kay, chief police psychologist for the city, who has interviewed  thousands of recruits in the last decade.    But what deeply troubles Kay and Police Department officials is that Gardner  had begun displaying a dark side as early as last September, when he threatened  to kill himself and police officers in Colorado -- all long before he was sworn  in at the Los Angeles Police Academy.    ""I'm going to look into this situation and into his file and see what, if  anything, we might have overlooked that could have been an indicator to the  difficulties he was going through,"" Kay said Wednesday. ""In fact, it certainly  is worth evaluating and investigating whether there is something in the process  itself that resulted in this individual getting through us.""    Gardner was shot on June 23, five days after he quit the Los Angeles Police  Academy. In that incident, he allegedly kidnaped his wife, led police on a  chase through two Denver suburbs and then pretended to pull a handgun in what  authorities describe as a twisted suicide attempt.    ""There's probably a couple of police departments with egg on their face over  this,"" said Matt Rippy, a detective in the Denver suburb of Westminster.    ""If he's insane, there's good reason to think he should have been washed out of  the Los Angeles recruitment program, because anybody capable of doing what he  did could have been identified by police testing,"" Rippy added. ""I mean, I  can't imagine what L.A. must be thinking. Like, 'How did he get past us?'  Pretty wild, huh?""    Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman,  acknowledged that Gardner turned into an embarrassment.    ""Sometimes we fail miserably,"" Booth said of the officer selection process.  ""But we do our darndest to get the perfect candidate. We have a lot of other  systems in place, especially our disciplinary system, to catch this sort of  thing. But this time we failed.""    Gardner could not be reached for an interview. His attorney, Bob Ransome, said  he wants to obtain copies of Gardner's psychological test results to see how  the department could have passed his client.    Gardner was described by his Police Academy superiors as an overachiever. He  began his police work as an officer in Aurora, Colo., another Denver suburb,  where he worked from 1984 to 1986. He later left for a yearlong stint with the  San Diego Police Department, then returned to Aurora for a second tour of duty  as a member of its elite police gang unit.    ""He was a very nice, young, professional officer,"" recalled Mary Schumacher, an  Aurora police spokeswoman.    After his marriage began to unravel, Gardner left his wife and two young  children -- a boy and a girl -- and moved to Los Angeles. He was accepted into  the Los Angeles Police Academy on March 26, one of 90 recruits.    In Los Angeles, Gardner underwent a series of complicated, detailed  examinations, tests of his physical agility and mental stability. The final  phase of testing involves an extensive psychological evaluation designed to  reveal any hidden mental problems.    Kay, the police psychologist, said that the tests should flag personality  faults, such as impatience or anger, as well as more serious problems, such as  depression, paranoia and schizophrenia. He said that Gardner also was  interviewed by a police psychologist.    Of approximately 3,000 candidates who take the psychological tests each year,  15% to 20% ""wash out,"" he said. Gardner passed.    ""He was a good recruit,"" said Gardner's academy drill instructor, Jerry Stokes.  ""He made good grades. He was one of the people who was in contention for a  leadership spot, maybe a squad leader.""    Added Sgt. Jim McNair, the academy officer in charge of recruiting: ""He blended  in. He fit in. Normally, they come to my attention when they're in the screw-up  category, and he wasn't one of those.""    But what the police and psychologists in Los Angeles had already missed was an  incident that occurred last year.    Westminster Police Detective John Marx said that on Sept. 16 officers were  called to the Gardner home when Lisa reported that her husband had left the  house with several guns and threatened to commit suicide.    ""At that time,"" Marx said, ""he also allegedly threatened to violently confront  any police officers if she ever called them."" No charges were filed.    The incidents continued, officials said, even as Gardner entered the academy  and was given a graduation date of Sept. 7.    Twice in early June, Westminster police were summoned back to the Gardner home,  where Lisa had changed the locks to keep out her husband. Authorities said that  Gardner was arrested on suspicion of various offenses, including burglary,  theft, criminal trespassing, carrying a concealed weapon and resisting arrest.    In one episode, police said, Gardner waved a .38-caliber revolver in the air  and fought with police who were trying to subdue him at the home.    ""We arrested him on the spot during one of the burglaries,"" Detective Rippy  said. ""He kicked in a front door and then he wouldn't let our officers inside.""    On June 18, Gardner walked up to his academy supervisors and resigned. ""He just  indicated he had some personal problems he had to tend to back in Colorado,""  Sgt. McNair said.    Five days later, Westminster police answered a report that Lisa was being  abducted from her front yard. Officer Keith Henry said he arrived to see  Gardner driving off with his wife, and began pursuit. The chase ended in nearby  Arvada when Gardner bolted from the car, turned and faced Henry.    Arvada Police Sgt. Merle Westling said that Gardner ""challenged the officer and  told him he had a gun and was going to use it."" He said that Gardner reached  toward the back of his waistband, as if grabbing for a gun, then began to  slowly bring his hand back around. Henry fired three times, wounding Gardner in  the stomach, hip and wrist.    Gardner, it turned out, was unarmed. The local grand jury ruled that the  shooting was justified because Henry could not have known that Gardner was  unarmed, said Brian Terrett, spokesman for the Jefferson County district  attorney.    Some police officials believe that Gardner was acting out a death wish.    ""He knew all the buttons to push, and he pushed all those buttons,"" Rippy said.    ""All he ever said he wanted to be was a Los Angeles cop, a big-city Los Angeles  cop,"" added Rippy, who interviewed Gardner at the hospital. ""And I felt like I  was talking with a cop, not an ex-cop, even though he was in a hospital all  shot up.    ""He just seemed to me like another cop with a lot of problems.""

By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      All Todd Gardner ever wanted was to wear the uniform of a Los Angeles police  officer.

Nunez, who was on leave for 60 days to facilitate the  investigations conducted by a presidential committee, has  reiterated that he is innocent but admitted that the scandal is  harming the police institution and for this reason he should  leave his post.    In announcing his resignation to reporters, Nunez said the  institution's image has been seriously damaged and this has  increased the agressiveness of criminals. In a noticeably  shaken voice, Nunez said: Because of this basic consideration  which is of an institutional and social-safety nature, I find  that I must withdraw from the General Command by submitting my  resignation.    The cabinet today discussed the resignation of the police  chief. A government spokesman has told REUTER that Nunez'  departure is a fact and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen will  appoint a new commander general before Monday.    Nunez, who is well known for his diligent struggle against  the underworld, has been accused of illegal acquisition of  wealth and abuse of power. The charges, which initially were  filed in mid-May against Nunez only, gradually were applied to  the entire police staff by Police Colonel Hector Estrella, who  exposed the scandal.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2331 GMT on 9 June in a similar  report adds: ""Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has  appointed General Miguel Rosero as the new police commander.""]     "

Vernon's  use of a police computer to gather intelligence for use against political  activist Michael Zinzun in a Pasadena city election.    The council asked the Police Commission to ""assure that such action will not be  repeated"" and also said an official apology to Zinzun is appropriate.    Vernon was reprimanded by Chief Daryl F. Gates after he used a police computer  to gather data on Zinzun, a former Black Panther now running for the Pasadena  Board of Directors. According to Gates, Vernon had used the computer to do  research on Zinzun and had 156 pages of data printed with the intent of  providing them to Zinzun's rivals.    After being alerted to Vernon's actions by other department personnel, Gates  said he intervened before Vernon could deliver the information. Gates has asked  Vernon to repay the printing costs.    Zinzun, a member of the Coalition Against Police Abuse, was a key figure in the  1983 dismantling of the department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division  (PDID), which had illegally spied on lawful citizens.    Vernon's activities were especially troubling in light of the PDID case, said  Councilman Robert Farrell, author of the motion calling for an investigation.

BRADLEY ORDERS EXAMINATION THAT COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR AND COST MORE THAN $1  MILLION.      By RICHARD A. SERRANO and FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Friday that he welcomed a thorough  audit of the Police Department, as long as it is done by an independent  consultant outside City Hall, and dismissed speculation that the mayor and City  Council are seeking the audit as a prelude to removing him.    ""This chief is not going to be manipulated out of here,"" Gates said when asked  at a crowded Parker Center press conference if he interpreted the audit as the  first step in a political process to seek his ouster.    ""I will pick the time when I leave this department,"" Gates said. ""I may have a  big mouth, but I know how to run a major police department. And I'll leave when  I choose to leave.""    A management audit of the Police Department, ordered by Mayor Tom Bradley on  Friday, would be one of the most sweeping examinations of its kind, taking up  to a year to complete at a cost that could exceed $1 million, city officials  said.    Bradley said he wants the audit to determine ""from top to bottom how the  department is deploying its 1,500 new officers and what results the public has  received for its huge investment."" The Police Department has a $1-billion  annual budget.    ""I welcome an audit,"" the chief said. ""I think the Los Angeles Police  Department is the most effective, most efficient police department in the  country. Not because of me, but because of a management team, because of a  spirit, because of the fine police officers in this organization. And because  of the public that supports us over and over and over again.    ""Any kind of review of this organization would be helpful, particularly if it's  done by an outside consulting group.""    Gates stopped short of criticizing the mayor, however, for ordering the review.  ""Tom has had his troubles,"" the chief said. ""I've had a lot of people ask me to  step forward and criticize the mayor. But I refuse.""    But Gates declined to detail a conversation he had Friday morning with the  mayor, in which Bradley advised the chief that he was calling for the audit.    ""It was a conversation between the mayor and myself,"" Gates said. ""It was a  very agreeable conversation, and I told him if he chooses to have an audit, he  has my full support.""    But Gates did blast Bradley's inner circle of advisers at City Hall, calling  them ""a young staff over there that has let him down.""    He took particular aim at Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. ""He's a slick-haired fella  that sits over there as a young kid,"" Gates said. ""I have no idea what he's  trying to do, or if he does anything.""    And he criticized Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's comments about an increase in  the crime rate. ""He doesn't know what he's talking about,"" Gates said. ""But  that's not new.""    The chief saved most of his venom for The Times, and repeatedly blamed the  newspaper for a series of recent articles that he said were ""badly reported.""    He expressed his disgust for articles about his remark that casual drug users  ought to be ""taken out and shot,"" problems with the internal police  disciplinary system, and recent allegations of police misconduct in the  so-called ""39th and Dalton"" drug raid.    He accused ""new management"" at the newspaper of using those articles to prod  the City Council and Bradley to remove him from office.    ""I don't know of anybody who's trying to orchestrate my departure except the  Los Angeles Times,"" he said. ""This has been orchestrated very cleverly by one  newspaper.""    He said The Times did not appreciate his comments before Congress about casual  drug users. ""I don't know why they're lobbying for the casual drug users, but  obviously they are,"" Gates said of the newspaper. ""That might say something  about that organization.""    Craig Turner, metropolitan editor of The Times, responded: ""It is our  responsibility to report thoroughly and accurately on the public agencies that  serve Southern California, including the Los Angeles Police Department. We have  done so for the last 108 years and will continue to do so.    ""Any suggestion that The Times is somehow trying to ignite a feud between the  mayor and the chief, to orchestrate the chief's departure, or to lobby for  casual drug users is ludicrous.""    Fabiani also dismissed Gates' criticisms. ""Mayor Bradley makes the decisions  around here and if Chief Gates thinks otherwise, he's kidding himself,"" Fabiani  said.    Yaroslavsky responded to Gates' comments by saying: ""As far as I'm concerned,  this isn't about personalities, but about getting the best use of taxpayer  dollars.""    In another development Friday, Police Commissioner Stephen D. Yslas resigned  after more than 10 years on the five-member panel. But he maintained that his  resignation is not related to the recent department controversies.    ""My decision to resign was completely personal,"" Yslas said.    Sources at City Hall said the resignation may be the first in a series of  changes on the commission in the coming months as Bradley attempts to gain  tighter control over the Police Department.    Gates said there was no secret about how the 1,500 new officers are being  deployed. He said that except for a few detectives and narcotics investigators,  and 400 recruits in the academy, the vast majority are out on beat patrols.    City officials said they had requested an accounting two months ago from the  department and have yet to receive a response. But Gates said the report was  sent over last week.    At the City Council on Friday, Yaroslavsky introduced a motion calling for the  formation of a Police Department Audit Review Committee to ensure a ""thorough  and objective process.""    ""It is absolutely critical that the city identify what the audit must  encompass, how and who will be selected to perform the audit and who will  supervise the project,"" Yaroslavsky said.    Keith Comrie, the city's chief administrative officer, said the scope and depth  of the review could exceed the six-month, $1.2-million examination of the  Department of Water and Power that produced a 585-page report earlier this  year. That report found that the DWP failed to adequately plan for the city's  future water needs and concluded that planning for new sources of water ""should  receive immediate attention.""    The Police Department, with 8,400 sworn officers, is one of the largest and  most complex city departments. The management audit would be the first of its  scope in a decade, officials said.    Gates, in welcoming the audit, said he hopes the evaluation is exhaustive and  confirms his opinion that ""a lot of things"" need improvement.    He said narcotics detectives work in cramped quarters, that 400 officers are  crowded into the Rampart Station, and that some police helicopters have a  dangerously high number of flight hours.    But at the same time, he said, police are making inroads in fighting crime. He  said burglaries have decreased by 40% over the last decade, that ""homicides are  coming down"" in some areas, and that police officer response times have dropped  from 9.2 minutes in 1986 to 6.8 minutes today.

Adulteration  increases the weight of the drug and, consequently, its value.  The seizure took place on the ranch owned by trafficker Antonio  Alde Paiva (""Chimarrao""), who got away. The ranch is located  near the municipality of Santo Antonio do Descoberto in Goias.  Three traffickers were arrested.    Investigation of the trafficker intensified when Federal  Police agents obtained information that Antonio Alves--a  trafficker well known to the DPF--would be receiving a large  shipment of cocaine from Bolivia. The Federal Police discovered  that ""Chimarrao"" owned some rural property in the municipality  of Santo Antonio do Descoberto on the banks of the Areias River  and that the drugs would probably be hidden there. By  maintaining surveillance on the trafficker, police were able to  dismantle part of that drug connection by arresting three  members of the gang.    During their investigation, the Federal Police learned that  ""Chimarrao"" had frequent contacts in Goiania, Cuiaba, and  Abadiania in Goias. It was discovered that Edison de Abreu Gama,  Agenor Jose Alves, and Jose Lima Rodrigues had arrived in  Abadiania with some large casks, and that was when the Federal  Police Superintendency in the Federal District decided to start  its operation.    Arrest--The DPF agents arrested Edison de Abreu Gama, Agenor  Jose Alves, and Jose Lima Rodrigues at Kilometer 13 on Highway  BR-060. They were in a white Niva automobile with Sao Paulo  license number SZ-4772. Found in the vehicle were a radio  communications set and a .38 caliber revolver. The three men  confessed that they had left the drugs on the side of Highway  BR-060 near Abadiania, the place where they had been the night  before.    Carrying a search and arrest warrant and aided by  drug-sniffing dogs, the federal agents were able to seize not  only the drugs but also three shotguns, eight cartridges, and a  number of blank documents--dummies for printing--belonging to  the Federal District Traffic Department. The seizure occurred at  the home of ""Chimarrao,"" who owns the ranch alongside Highway  BR-060.    After the drugs were seized, Agenor confessed that his job  in  the gang was to accompany a truck driver named Mauro to the town  of Abadiania and that the drugs were taken from a false bottom  in the fuel tank of a truck--the license number of which is  being kept secret by the Federal Police so as not to jeopardize  the rest of the investigation that is now under way. Agenor also  said that seven days earlier, he had brought 35 kg of coca base  to ""Chimarrao,"" who is a now a fugitive.    Edison de Abreu Gama was the escort while the drug was being  transported--that is, he drove ahead of the truck in the car  with the radio set so as to warn truck driver Mauro of possible  problems. The gang members were arrested and are being held at  the DPF jail in the Federal District, where they have been  charged with the commission of a crime under Article 12 of Law  No. 6368.     "

In Pretoria, he said the  arrests were made after more than six weeks of intensive  investigations into a series of far-rightwing terror attacks in  the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    On Monday, police arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    Over the weekend, the SA Police arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, Mr Kriel said.  Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were seized when the  arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni, and near the scene of  the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest, but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was  under police guard in hospital. [passage omitted]     "

Lt-Colonel Supachai Sirisap, deputy head of the Foreign  Affairs Division of the Royal Thai Police said:    ""It is our intention to arrest him when we see him. He  appears to have crossed the Burmese border illegally from  Thailand.""    The statement came after a spokesman for the United States  embassy said that Peter Bourne, former adviser on narcotics to  the Carter administration, was indeed the man photographed and  identified in the Bangkok Post on Sunday as ""Peter Bond"".    A United States embassy spokesman said:    ""He is not in Burma on any official business of the United  States Government.""    ""As far as we are concerned Khun Sa is the single biggest  heroin dealer in Burma and we have warrants out for his arrest,""  the U.S. embassy spokesman said.    Khun Sa has offered to sell the United States his annual  opium crop numerous times in the past as part of his own plan to  help eradicate the world of heroin.    The United States has refused to deal with him despite  previous visits by Congressman Lester Wolf.    Bourne was relieved of his job as presidential adviser on  narcotics after allegedly abusing his position.    Peter Bourne, aged 60, however was rumoured to have  re-entered Thailand and departed on a U.S.-bound flight on  Sunday night.     "

Police also arrested six more Chinese for allegedly trying  to  sneak in Japan. All were arrested for suspected violations of  the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law.    Tokyo immigrations authorities are holding a total of 14  Chinese suspected of being involved in the large-scale illegal  entry attempt earlier this year.    Meanwhile in Tokushima Prefecture on Shikoku, the smallest  of  Japan's four main islands, police arrested three Thai workers  for overstaying their original 90-day visas issued in June 1991.  According to investigators, the three continued to work at a  woodworking firm in Tokushima even though their visas had  expired.    In the Chinese case, the five suspected contacts for the  Chinese attempting to enter Japan allegedly met about 60 Chinese  coming ashore near a Wakayama fishing village and then took them  by rented car to Nagoya where they boarded a Shinkansen bullet  train to Tokyo. The five are suspected of sheltering the  illegal entrants in an apartment in Tokyo's Toshima ward.    According to one of the Chinese sneaking into Japan, they  were told that they could make money in Japan, but needed 2.7  million yen to pay for the sea transportation. The would-be  worker testified that a portion of the fee had already been paid.    Police said they are pursuing the strong likelihood that the  smuggling of Chinese workers into Japan is an organized effort.     "

The clashes left three injured and more than  30 others arrested. On 11 May, a long day of protest started in  the early morning hours, specifically at the Francisco Fajardo  School located in U.V. Siete de Caricuoa. The day of protest  left three students injured, as well as 30 arrested by  metropolitan police agents.    At the Francisco Fajardo School on Caricuoa, three students  were wounded. One of these students--Marvin Uzcategui--was shot  in the stomach; Juan Carlos Vivas, a 15-year-old student, was  shot in the ribs; and Guillermo Useche got a shot in the arm.  According to witnesses, the shots were fired by Metropolitan  Police deployed along the main streets of the area known as U.V.  Siete de Caricuoa, who opened fire on the protesters.    Nevertheless, General Orlando Henandez Villega, the  commander  of the Metropolitan Police, categorically denied these reports.    [Begin Hernandez recording] I want to reiterate what I said  previously. The Metropolitan Police are not using firearms to  quell the demonstrations. Clear proof of this is that, if  firearms had been used at Francisco Fajardo School, there would  have been wounded students. Instead, the wounded included a  five-year-old who was not demonstrating, as well as a  15-year-old from a neighborhood next to the school. Apparently,  there were clashes with criminals or shots were fired in the  area, resulting in these people being wounded. [end recording]    Despite General Orlando Hernandez Guillen's version of what  happened, it was unofficially learned that, according to  officers of the Technical Judicial Police's Homicide Division,  police officers opened fire with .38 caliber weapons on students  protesting the hike in student bus fares.    Violent demonstrations also were reported at other schools,  such as Fermin Toro in El Silencio; Luis Espelozin; Miguel  Antonio Carela on Sucre Ave.; and Luis Blanco in Propatria,  where two police officers were wounded. Also, in the wake of  disturbances at the Jose Felix Ribas School, which is located on  the main road in Dos Caminos, a store was looted. There also  were disturbances reported at the Luis Caballero Mejia  Politechnical Institute in La Yaguara, at the Central University  of Venezuela, the Instituto Pedagogico of Paraiso, and the Campo  Rico Technical School in El Marquez.    Officers from the Metropolitan Police and the National  Guard's Urban Security Brigade continue to be deployed  throughout the city in an attempt to control all of these  outbreaks of violence.     "

By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Parents and police in two beach cities were on alert and Hermosa Beach school  officials prepared Wednesday to close a campus to outsiders after apparent  kidnaping attempts against four schoolchildren in the last week.    Police said they are uncertain if the same man is responsible for the four  separate incidents in Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach because the  descriptions of the suspect differed slightly in each case.    All four children, ranging in age from 7 to 14, escaped unharmed when a man  approached them and asked them to take a ride in his pickup truck.    Hermosa Beach police released three composite drawings after the three children  who were approached in that city described the man. Police said they came up  with different likenesses because more than one man could be responsible for  the abduction attempts, the children might have given inaccurate descriptions  or the man could have altered his appearance.    The three Hermosa Beach children and an 8-year-old girl from Manhattan Beach  said the man who approached them was in his 20s or early 30s, about 6 feet tall  and thin. His hair was variously described as red, blond and brown. Three of  the children said the man had a mustache, while one said he was clean-shaven.  Two children said the man drove a red pickup, while two said the truck was  white.    ""I don't know if we are dealing with one person or more than one,"" said Hermosa  Beach Police Cmdr. John Mebius.    On March 7, the 8-year-old Manhattan Beach girl was walking to Pacific  Elementary School when a man called to her from his white pickup truck, police  said. As she walked by, the man opened his door and appeared to be masturbating  inside, Sgt. Jack Zea said.    Last Thursday, a man driving a red pickup pulled alongside and tried to speak  to a 10-year-old boy walking home from Hermosa Valley School, said Hermosa  Beach Police Sgt. Spike Kelly.    On Friday, a man walked onto the playground at the same school and told a  7-year-old girl that her mother wanted her to ride home with him.    And on Tuesday, a 14-year-old boy told police that he was walking home from  Mira Costa High School when a red pickup truck pulled up and the driver told  him to get in.    In all four cases, the children ran off and reported the incidents to their  parents or school officials.    More parents have been escorting their children to school this week, school  officials said. Police said they plan to have plainclothes officers patrol  around schools in both cities. At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Hermosa Beach  Mayor Roger Creighton called on citizens to be extra vigilant.

OFFICERS      By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A violent clash between 13 members of the Nation of Islam and 24 police  officers in Southwest Los Angeles this week stemmed from the Muslims' refusal  to lie face down in a parking lot, an order they felt to be demeaning and  unnecessary, a community activist close to the Nation of Islam said Friday.    Blows were exchanged between the Muslims and the officers only after one police  officer attempted to put a chokehold on one of the Muslims in an apparent  attempt to force him to the ground, said Chilton Alphonse, a non-Muslim  anti-gang activist. Alphonse did not witness the incident but, after learning  of it, he arranged a meeting between top officials of both the Nation of Islam  and the Los Angeles Police Department.    Once they were subdued, said Alphonse, the 13 Muslims, including two  teen-agers, were ""handcuffed and beaten with night sticks because they refused  to fall to the ground like animals."" One of the 13 was booked on suspicion of  assaulting a police officer. The rest were booked on suspicion of ""lynching,""  or trying to take a prisoner from a police officer.    Police officials have denied most elements of Alphonse's version of the  incident.    Alphonse gave the Muslims' version of what happened at a news conference Friday  afternoon, called by Nation of Islam officials to give their account of the  clash. The incident occurred about 5 a.m. Wednesday in a store parking lot at  Crenshaw Boulevard and Vernon Avenue.    Alphonse gave this account of the incident, based on his discussions with the  people involved:    The Muslims, traveling in a caravan of three cars, had been followed for nearly  four miles by police after they left a nearby home on their way to a gym on  Crenshaw just south of Vernon. Alphonse did not offer an explanation of why the  men thought police were following them. At one point, officers pulled alongside  their vehicles and flashed lights in their faces, Alphonse said.    Lt. Rich Molony, a supervisor at the Police Department's Southwest Division,  said he doubted that the Muslims had been ordered to lie down.    ""The only time we use the felony prone position is when we feel we're in a  situation where our life is in danger,"" Molony said. ""The officers had only  asked the driver of the car they stopped to step over to the side with his  hands up so we could see them.""    Police have maintained that the clash was precipitated by one of the Muslims  who repeatedly interfered as officers tried to write a ticket during a routine  traffic stop. When police attempted to arrest the man they say was interfering,  he tried to hit one of the officers, Molony said, and ""his friends joined in  and the fray was on.""    At Friday's news conference, a representative of Nation of Islam leader Louis  Farrakhan had been scheduled to make a statement about the incident, along with  some of the men involved in the clash, but those portions of the program were  abruptly canceled.    Minister Wazir Muhammad, western regional representative for the Nation of  Islam and head of the group's Los Angeles mosque, said the cancellation was  made because Farrakhan's representative, Khallid Muhammad, had uncovered new  information about alleged brutality and cover-up by the Police Department. He  declined to elaborate.    During the news conference outside a restaurant half a block from the site of  the incident, about 250 members of the Nation of Islam and their supporters  listened as officials of the group and others decried what they described as  widespread disrespect for black men by los Angeles police.    Actor and former football star Jim Brown, who said he has had a ""30-year  friendship with the Nation of Islam,"" told the crowd: ""We are people. We are  human beings. We demand equal respect.""    Alphonse said black men, sometimes in groups, are forced by Los Angeles police  to lie down in the street and submit to questioning ""on a daily basis.""    Those at the news conference described the practice as intentionally  humiliating and called for police to end it.

By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN DIEGO      Police have received 2,200 leads in connection with the serial stabbing deaths  of five women but are no closer to catching the killer, officials said Monday.    ""A piece is still missing,"" said Police Capt. Dick Toneck. ""If I had something  to bring forth in the way of an arrest, I would relish that. But as it stands,  we're sifting through all the clues and all the tips people have phoned in.  We're just hoping one will lead to an arrest.""    The case has received widespread attention in San Diego, where Police Chief Bob  Burgreen labeled it the largest manhunt in the city's history and the  department's first priority. Toneck said the 33 investigators working the case  full time have called back virtually everyone who has phoned with information.    Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 have been killed inside  their homes in the middle of the day after their assailant apparently entered  through an unlocked or open door.    The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail Clark, was the mother of one of the  victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were stabbed inside their home in  University City on Sept. 13. The three other women lived within two blocks of  one another in a row of apartment houses in the nearby community of Clairemont.    The manhunt and subsequent publicity led to a run on locks and security devices  at local stores.    On Monday, Toneck, one of seven ranking officers assigned to the case full  time, acknowledged that investigators are uncertain whether the killer is still  in the San Diego area or has fled.    ""We don't have anything to indicate (the suspect) is still here,"" the captain  said. ""We don't have any leads to tell us where he may be.""    Toneck said the leads had given police a range of possible suspects ""who fit  the (suspect's) description; and yet, those are not the people. Their  backgrounds, their whereabouts, just don't fit.""    The San Diego Police Department made a controversial arrest shortly after the  third killing in early April when a Puerto Rican-born man -- a decorated  ex-Marine -- was followed for weeks and finally detained because he closely  resembled a composite drawing of the suspect.    He was cleared shortly after his arrest.    Last week, San Diego police ruled out any link between the serial slayings and  a man arrested on suspicion of rape in Escondido.    The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned black  male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with medium build and short, dark, curly hair. He  was briefly seen by a painter as he ran from the Clairemont apartment where  18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed on April 3.    It is that one sighting upon which the widely distributed composite of the  suspect is based.    Toneck said a psychological profile prepared for the San Diego Police  Department by the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., indicates the killer is a loner  and ""disorganized"" in his methods of operation.    Police believe the weapon used in each of the killings was obtained at the  scene. In every case but the first, investigators later found knives believed  to have been the killer's weapon.    Although he appears to be a loner, ""there's no doubt that somebody -- a loved  one, a neighbor, a close friend -- knows this guy,"" Toneck said. ""We just don't  know why this person hasn't called in and said, 'I know this guy.' We're hoping  that will happen.""    Toneck said the number of investigators working the case was recently scaled  back, from 34 to 33, and that $145,000 has been spent investigating the  slayings. He said the number of detectives working the case ""may be scaled back  further at the point where the leads start to diminish.""    Police are concerned, Toneck said, that residents may grow complacent and stop  taking precautions.    ""This person is still around, still out and about, so please lock your doors in  the daytime, be aware of your surroundings, get to know your neighbors and have  your neighbors know you. Know the routines of one another at all times,"" Toneck  advised.

By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      An arsenal of knives, grenades and machine guns was described by law  enforcement authorities Monday as the largest collection of weaponry ever  seized during a drug raid in Ventura County.    Police said they found 125 firearms and 100 bladed weapons -- along with  $750,000 worth of cocaine -- in an upstairs bedroom when they stormed a Simi  Valley house on Sunday and arrested Gardner Ernest Flockhart, 31, a suspected  high-level cocaine dealer.

""I haven't found any policeman who's seen this  many guns in one place at one time.""    Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said it was the most extensive collection found  during a drug raid in the county.    The seizure culminated a six-month investigation by local law-enforcement  agencies into a ring suspected of distributing cocaine to residents of Ventura  and Los Angeles counties.    An investigation of Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, an alleged drug courier from  Ventura, led to Flockhart, who is believed to be his supplier, Bowman said.    On Sunday, Lloyd allegedly delivered one kilogram of cocaine to an undercover  officer in a parking lot in Simi Valley and was immediately arrested on  suspicion of sale of a controlled substance and possession for sale of a  controlled substance.    Police then served search warrants on Lloyd's Ventura auto-repair business and  his house on El Medio Street, where they found half an ounce of cocaine  packaged for sale and arrested his wife Sharon Lloyd, 32, on suspicion of  possession of a controlled substance for sale.    Police also raided Flockhart's house, where they found $50,000 worth of guns,  12 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $750,000 and more than  $500,000 in cash -- including Krugerrands, silver ingots and antique coins,  authorities said.    ""One room was a veritable arsenal and supermarket for cocaine dealing,"" Bowman  said.    When officers entered the residence, they found Flockhart in the upstairs  arsenal standing next to a hand grenade, Bowman said. Flockhart was arrested  without incident on suspicion of sale of a controlled substance, possession of  a controlled substance for sale and federal firearms violations.    Flockhart's girlfriend, Christine Lynn Helenick, 28, was arrested on suspicion  of possession of a controlled substance for sale. Brian Howard Mudge, 27, who  also lived in the house, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a  controlled substance for sale.    Robert Lloyd was being held in lieu of $20,000 bail in the Ventura County Jail,  a jail spokesman said. Sharon Lloyd, Helenick and Mudge have been released on  bail, police said. Flockhart remains in custody without bail.    Flockhart, who describes himself as an unemployed actor, was convicted of  possession of narcotics for sale in Los Angeles County in 1986.    As a convicted felon, it is illegal for Flockhart to possess any firearms,  Bowman said. If convicted in federal court, Flockhart could receive a 40-year  prison sentence, Bowman said.    Police believe that Flockhart, a gun enthusiast, traded drugs for the weapons.  Bowman said it appears Flockhart used the guns primarily for target shooting.    Among the 125 firearms were 12 illegal weapons. They included four  semiautomatic Uzi-type weapons, which had been converted to fully automatic  machine guns. Some guns had been outfitted with silencers, and five rifles were  fitted with illegally short barrels, Bowman said.    Flockhart also had Teflon-coated and armor-piercing bullets, which can  penetrate the bulletproof vests used by police officers.    Collectors' items such as two $5,000 miniature replicas of machine guns also  were found. The rest of the guns included pistols, semiautomatic assault  rifles, shotguns and hunting rifles, Bowman said.    Twenty-three of the 100 bladed weapons also were illegal, Bowman said. They  included six Shurikens, four-bladed weapons that are thrown like a Frisbee and  designed to stick in the target. Five brass knuckles and 12 gravity knives, in  which blades can be exposed with a flick of the wrist, also were found.    One of Flockhart's neighbors, who asked not to be identified, said others  suspected drug activity at the house but had no idea of the number of weapons  there.    ""It was a big surprise, everything they found,"" the woman said. ""None of us  thought all that was over there.""    She said Flockhart, who had lived there about four years, enjoyed jogging and  was an avid sportsman, going deer hunting and bringing home venison.    All the guns seized in the raid Sunday will be forfeited to the state through  asset-forfeiture laws if Flockhart is convicted, Bowman said. The knives will  be ground up, he said.    The departments involved in the investigation stand to gain $700,000 to $1  million through state asset-forfeiture laws from the house, guns, six vehicles  and other belongings.    About 30 officers from five agencies were involved in the investigation -- the  Ventura Police Department, Oxnard Police Department, Simi Valley Police  Department, Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's  office. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was called in to  examine the firearms.    Bowman said he is sure that there are others above Flockhart, but added that  there is nothing to indicate that Colombian drug cartels are involved. He said  he does not expect more arrests.

Following the protests ""an order was sent down for  strict rectification of all religious groups in Qinghai"", said  Father Li Zhixin, a 38-year-old Catholic priest in the  provincial capital of Xining. ""Their prime target has been  Muslims, then Catholics, because most of them belong to the  underground church.""    Father Li said that in addition to being watched by police,  he had recently come under surveillance by the State Security  Bureau, which handles cases thought to threaten national  interests. They have branded him a counter-revolutionary.  Police have warned him several times to stop celebrating Mass,  and have told him he would be arrested if caught doing so. The  latest threat came last week. They have also demanded that he  turn over all money collected from followers. ""I told them,  it's my responsibility, I have to do my missionary work,"" he  said.    Father Li has been a priest since 1982 and has celebrated  Mass daily in homes of followers. But in the past year, it has  become increasingly dangerous. Father Li, who works as a deputy  manager at a factory, said police last November raided a convent  where he had just celebrated Mass. Thanks to a tip-off, he  managed to leave before the police arrived. Another priest was  arrested and held for a day, and five nuns were taken away in  handcuffs and sent back to their homes.    The state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association has one  priest and at most about 200 followers in Xining, while the  underground church, which in defiance of government regulations  pledges allegiance to the Vatican has three priests and about  10,000 followers, according to Father Li. Last spring he was  detained while celebrating Mass in Jiangsu province. Police  handcuffed, beat and interrogated him in an attempt to get him  to admit he was acting illegally and selling out China.    Sometimes they made him sit on the floor and hold out his  arms straight in front of him for two hours at a time. They hit  him when his hands began to drop. The interrogations took place  up to five times a week. He also was forced to break rocks.  Police threatened him with up to seven years in jail for his  missionary work, but to his surprise, he was released and sent  back to Qinghai after two months.     "

The charter's launch was overshadowed by allegations of police corruption broadcast by BBC TV's Panorama programme on Monday. Three police officers have been arrested and an inquiry is under way into the allegations. Among the targets in the charter is a promise that the police will arrive at urgent incidents within 12 minutes. The performance of each police station against the targets will be published every three months. Mr Condon said the charter reflected what Londoners had told the service they wanted.

How do you respond to this  assessment.    Our country has long been plagued with conflicts, political  and otherwise. When I became interior minister, I tried to  solve these conflicts peacefully. I tried to improve the  efficiency of the agencies in charge of administration and  security. Conflicts occurred when I tried to reform the Police  Department. The reforms were implemented, however. As a  result, the police are working harder and more efficiently in  serving the public. Gambling dens have been suppressed and road  check-points set up in an improved effort to keep law and order.    So how do you feel about continued criticism in spite  of all your hard work.    It's normal and healthy for MPs to criticize me. I would do  the same thing if I were in their place. I appreciate the fact  that people were very angry at me following a few violent  incidents, like bomb attacks in certain provinces, and so on.  They wondered why I resisted taking action, like transferring  police chiefs of those provinces, etc. I say to them that  before taking any drastic action we need more evidence and more  time to study the facts of the case.    What do you see as hampering the running of your  ministry.    Bureaucracy in the agencies under my ministry. For example,  the Police Department. Its structure really only allows it to  deal with internal law and order problems, and not with  international terrorism.    You mean the Police Department's structure has kept its  role limited, or are you saying that the police should not be  doing the job in the first place.    Neither the Interior Ministry nor the Police Department can  be expected to perform a task which is beyond their capabilities  or which will require measures which exceed those we have  already prepared in order to cope with any forseeable crisis.  If a major crisis breaks out and we deem it to be beyond our  capability, we should be able to say that it is now time for the  military to step in.    What will you do now that international terrorists have  apparently penetrated our borders.    The situation is certainly not out of hand yet. We have  several devices we can employ to help us spy on the terrorists,  such as an electronic device which can be placed on any concrete  wall less than one-foot thick. That device will enable us to  hear the conversations of the people behind the wall. However,  terrorists could also monitor our electronic eavesdropping tools  or communications equipment.    So, terrorists will know more about the movement of  police from the department's equipment than the police will  learn about the criminals. Is that right.    That's it.    What more will you do to improve the performance of the  Interior Ministry.    We need to improve our intelligence work. We should also  improve the coordination between interior agencies, especially  those concerned with security affairs. The agencies' structure  should also be streamlined to increase efficiency.    Recent incidents have prompted many to think that the  Interior Ministry's performance in protecting people's live's  and property has been poor.    Problems occur in every government. Whenever you have a  situation where there are a lot of conflicts in a country,  incidents like these will happen.    What parties have been in conflict recently.    Last May, we had a political conflict. That conflict arose  because two major groups had different approaches to solving the  country's problems. One side wanted to solve the problems  peacefully while the other wanted to use force.    I myself has been trying to solve problems by reforming the  structure of certain interior agencies, including the Police  Department. But my attempts to reform the Police Department  have led to conflicts in the agency.    So, someone dislikes you.    Of course. There is always trouble inside the Police  Department. This department is one of several government  agencies under political influence.    But why are there so many who disagree with you.    When the department was reformed, illegal businesses like  gambling and prostitution were affected. The revamp has caused  billions of baht in damages to certain groups of people and this  has caused conflict.     "

Raymond Gayle Wagoner, 38, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at  4:35 p.m. Wednesday after he was located in Glendora, said Sgt. Bob Velez of  the Ventura Police Department.    Police said the landlady, Arlys Quinn, 47, evicted Wagoner on Monday from his  rental in the 9600 block of Coosa Street in Ventura.

On Wednesday, Wagoner stopped Quinn in a shopping center parking lot and  pleaded with her to let him into his former residence so he could retrieve some  medicine he had left behind, Velez said.    Wagoner told Quinn that the medicine was essential to his baby, who was ill,  and Quinn let him in, Velez said.    Once inside the residence, Wagoner became enraged with Quinn because of the  eviction and told her that he was going to kill her, Velez said.

Before being discovered by the intruders -- who police described as part of a  growing number of Vietnamese preying upon others of Vietnamese descent -- the  girl had used a portable phone to call the 911 emergency number.    The case, Monterey Park police said, draws attention to Asian immigrants  victimizing others of Asian ancestry who, for cultural reasons, sometimes  mistrust police and fear calling authorities for help.    The victims and suspects all are Vietnamese who had arrived in the United  States within the past few years, police said, as was the dead man, a  19-year-old from Chatsworth.    Police Capt. Joseph Santoro termed the case a victory in the department's  continuing campaign to encourage Monterey Park residents, many of them new  immigrants from Asia, to call police for help.    ""One of our biggest challenges is to get (new Asian immigrants) to understand  that police are here to protect them,"" Santoro said.    ""When (Asian) people come to this country, they bring a whole mystique about  crime in their native country,"" Santoro said. ""They fear the criminal element.  And they have an equal suspicion of police. . . . Police are perceived as  corrupt.""    On Wednesday, within three minutes of getting the 911 call at 10:59 p.m.,  patrol cars arrived at the house on Keller Street. One suspect dived through a  window to escape and three others followed. The brother and sister ran to  safety out the front door.    Police chased three of the suspects for several blocks. A Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department helicopter, using a special infrared detection device,  tracked them to a brushy hillside above the back yards of a residential  neighborhood.    An officer killed one suspect with two shotgun blasts, police said, after the  man disobeyed orders to freeze, moving abruptly as if to fire a gun. Nearby,  police found a revolver that the suspects allegedly had used.    Police captured a 14-year-old boy and a 19-year-old Los Angeles man, Ly De Nhi,  and booked them on suspicion of murder and robbery, police said. A fourth  suspect was still at large.    No one else was injured. Police withheld the dead man's identity pending  notification of relatives. Police also would not release the name of the  officer who shot the man, saying that the investigation of the killing is  continuing. Santoro called the death unfortunate but said the shooting was  justified.    The two arrested suspects, police said, both are ethnic Chinese originally from  Vietnam.    ""Vietnamese criminals tend to victimize their own people. This is a clear  example,"" Santoro said. ""They think they can intimidate Vietnamese easier than  non-Vietnamese.""    Social service agencies, as well as police in the San Gabriel Valley, Santoro  said, often encounter new Asian immigrants who express hesitancy to report  crimes.

Mervin Feinstein rebutted allegations by a San Pedro family in a civil trial in  Los Angeles Superior Court that Torrance police condone and cover up  misconduct, particularly incidents linked to excessive drinking.    ""It just isn't there,"" Feinstein said of the plaintiffs' case against the  Torrance police. ""There is no widespread cover-up or ratification of employees  . . . who might not properly record their investigation or report what is going  on. . . . They don't sweep it under the carpet.""      Called to Testify    Feinstein retired from the Riverside department last year and is now a private  consultant and administrator with the California Peace Officers Assn.    He was called to testify on behalf of the Torrance Police Department and nine  officers named in a lawsuit filed in 1984 by John and Geraldine Rastello of San  Pedro. The Rastellos claim that off-duty Torrance police Sgt. Rollo Green was  driving drunk and caused the traffic collision that killed their 19-year-old  son, Kelly. Their lawsuit also alleges that fellow officers covered up for  Green as part of a pattern of concealing misdeeds by police.    Feinstein told the jury that his opinions were based on an impartial review of  more than 500 internal affairs files from the Torrance Police Department. But,  during cross-examination, one of the Rastellos' lawyers, Brian Panish,  attempted to paint Feinstein as a friend of the Torrance police who would never  take a stand against a fellow officer.    Earlier in the week, Torrance's own internal affairs investigators defended  their work under Panish's harsh cross-examination.    The defense is expected to rest its case today, five years and one day after  Kelly Rastello died in the collision with Green. Final arguments in the  5-week-old trial are scheduled for Tuesday.    Feinstein opened his testimony by criticizing a former Los Angeles Police  Department deputy chief who was called by the plaintiffs two weeks ago. Lou  Reiter, the former LAPD official, told the jury that Torrance police received  little or no punishment for alcohol-related misconduct, creating an atmosphere  in which excessive drinking was condoned.    Reiter focused on 11 alcohol-related cases in which he said Torrance police  only once sought criminal charges and only once took a blood-alcohol reading.  But Feinstein called that information misleading, saying that in most cases the  Torrance officers were not subject to chemical blood testing because they had  not been driving. And in many of the cases, criminal charges were not filed  because the victims did not want to go to court or because the incidents took  place outside the city's jurisdiction, Feinstein told the jury.      Rehabilitation Favored    The Torrance Police Department has a wise policy of trying to salvage officers  involved with alcohol by offering them rehabilitation programs instead of  suspensions, Feinstein said.    The policy was designed to prevent relapses, Feinstein told the jury.    But Panish countered that incidents involving Officer Donald Mason show that  departmental policy is ineffective.    While questioning Feinstein, Panish said Mason was told that he could enter an  alcohol treatment program after he brandished a gun in a bar in 1982. Two years  later, Mason was reportedly drinking when he crashed into three parked cars as  he was driving home, Panish said, recounting previous testimony.    Panish also asked Feinstein if he had been told that the Torrance Police  Department did not adopt a program to assist alcoholics until 1986, a decade  after most other police departments. Feinstein said he did not know that.      Crackdown on Drinking    The former Riverside official testified that he did not find an excessive  number of alcohol-related complaints against Torrance police officers. After  one 1979 incident, he said, the department cracked down on officers drinking in  public after hours.    Torrance Sgt. Greg Fahnestockand five officers gathered in a parking lot after  work to drink beer, a custom known in police circles as ""choir practice,""  Feinstein testified. He told the jury that the officers continued their  drinking in the stairway of a public building. ""They had an attack of dumb, as  we say in the business,"" Feinstein said.    Feinstein said that when Fahnestock received a three-day suspension, it ""sent a  very strong message to younger officers, saying that tenure or rank is not  going to get you off the hook."" The other officers received written reprimands.    After the incident, the department approved a regulation outlawing choir  practice, Feinstein said.      Showed Toughness    A thorough investigation in another case involving a ranking officer also  showed the department's toughness, Feinstein said. An internal report showed  that Lt. Henry Pupkoff took an accident report himself, in violation of  department policy, after he was involved in a minor collision in 1979.    Follow-up investigation by another officer showed that Pupkoff had not  accurately recorded statements by witnesses to the crash, Feinstein told the  jury.    The accident was minor enough that it could have been brushed aside, but the  department chose to perform a full internal investigation, which led to Pupkoff  being counseled against taking reports in incidents in which he had personal  involvement, Feinstein said.    On cross-examination by Panish, Feinstein conceded that he cannot recall ever  testifying against a police officer in a civil case.    Feinstein made another concession to the plaintiffs: He said he sees no  objection to police departments that order officers to take blood-alcohol tests  when they have been accused of misconduct while drinking. Torrance police  officials have testified that a policy would violate officers' rights and  produce test results that would not be admissible in criminal cases.      Continued Testimony    Earlier, Torrance Deputy Police Chief Jim Popp resumed the stand Monday to  continue testimony that began last Friday.    Popp said last week that the supervisor of a Police Department program for  troubled teen-agers had been forced to resign after one of his former clients  accused him of using drugs and keeping child pornography in his apartment.    Popp added Monday that the former client also accused Juvenile Deversion  Program Coordinator Tom Heitmann of sexually molesting him.    When officers searched Heitmann's apartment, they found three or four ounces of  marijuana and a film of the teen-age boy masturbating, Popp told the jury.    Although Heitmann resigned immediately, Popp testified that criminal charges  could not be filed on the alleged molestation because the three-year statute of  limitations had expired. In an interview after his testimony, Popp said he does  not know why criminal drug charges were not filed against Heitmann.    Heitmann did not return several telephone calls.      111 Complaints    On Monday, John Rastello's lawyers produced a Police Department report that  showed discipline was imposed only once as a result of 111 complaints made by  the public in 1984 and 1985.    Popp conceded that claims against police officers are sustained much more often  when they are made by fellow officers rather than by private citizens.    But Popp testified that the 1984-85 report is deceiving because it does not  account for officers who were disciplined even before the public filed  complaints against them.

Before breaking into the building, the two rightists,  carrying a sword, a handgun and what they said were two sticks  of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun,  police said.    Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass  media  as a ""Class A war criminal"" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to  ""amend the tone of its news coverage."" The pamphlets also  criticized Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for his failure to  retract a statement apologizing for Japan's wartime activities  in Asia which he said were ""a war of aggression.""    Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30  P.M., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake  and they wanted to meet the company's president. Police said  one of the men fired a shot when another security guard  approached but no one was injured.    They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used  desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the  executive reception room with the hostages.    Friday's hostage situation was the second violent incident  in  five months at the headquarters of the mass-circulation ASAHI  SHIMBUN involving the Taihikai. On October 20, Shusuke Nomura,  58, the leader of the group, entered the building and committed  suicide during a meeting with the company's executives in  protest over the use of a cartoon parodying his group in a  weekly magazine affiliated with the company.    Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security  guard they are ""disciples"" of Nomura. Furusawa was Nomura's  secretary and chauffeur. He was present in the same room with  Nomura and other ASAHI SHIMBUN executives when Nomura shot  himself, police said.    On November 12, 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set  off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of  former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru.     "

In early spring the Police Institute in Espoo  already had a few Estonian policemen for a brief course. At the  Police School in Tampere a crime investigation course, in which  Estonian investigators participate for the first time, is under  way right now.    The police department of Finland's Ministry of the Interior  and the head of Estonia's police have agreed on intensified  cooperation in training. This year about 30 Estonian policemen  will take courses in Finland.    Chief Inspector Matti Launiainen of the Interior Ministry's  police department says that the training of Estonian policemen  also gets the Finnish policemen used to international relations.  Finland also benefits from the Estonian policemen by acquiring  current information about crime in the east.    The first experience from the training cooperation is good.  The language represents the biggest problem, but it is not  insurmountable. The training language is Finnish.    Criminal investigator Ain Balder from Tartu says that  economic criminals in Estonia have a five-year lead over the  police. This lead is what one is now trying to shorten with the  training in Finland.    The strong moral self-esteem of the Finnish police appeals  to  the Estonian policemen, says Balder. In Estonia there are  problems of suspicion about receiving bribes. This is ballast  from the Soviet era that one should get rid of, he says.    Balder believes that personal contacts across the Bay of  Finland will make criminal investigation in both countries more  efficient. It is surely better to get help through direct  contacts than via Interpol or other official international  channels, he says.     "

A detective had a conversation with Rozhok in the latter's  apartment.    The head of the Estonian security police, Juri Pihl, has  earlier said his department had no reasons to implement any  measures against Rozhok, as the man had committed no concrete  action against the Estonian State.    Rozhok says he received a formal order to appear in the  office of the Estonian Defense Police in Tallinn on Jan. 24. He  said he had refused to go because his appearing before Estonian  investigators had not been agreed upon with the Russian embassy  in Tallinn.    The representative of Zhirinovsky's party says he received  another call from a defense police official on Jan. 25. The  official, who had identified himself as detective Sergei Melnik,  had used expressions of ""threat and blackmail"" while speaking to  Rozhok on the phone, Rozhok said.    Rozhok also said he had delivered all publications in the  Estonian press concerning his activity in the country to the  Liberal Democratic Party faction in the Russian parliament.    Rozhok said Estonian security police officials had later  appeared in the place where he works. He claims the country's  security police had ""worked out a number of schemes"" for his  arrest.    ""As long as violation of the rights of Russians and  exploitation of the Russians' labor continues in Estonia, also  my political activity toward the protection of their rights will  continue,"" he said. He also claimed that ninety-nine percent of  the reports published on him in the Estonian press were ""a lie,  intertwined with threat and blackmail.""     "

Having played cat and mouse with the police for several  hours, the demonstrators ended their attempts to get to the  superhighway via industrial roads and slopes with a protest  demonstration in front of the headquarters of the police task  force in the evening.

TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY AGAINST 3 IN DRIVE-BY SLAYINGS      By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Times Staff Writer      The Orange County district attorney's office will seek the death penalty  against three alleged members of Santa Ana's 5th Street gang who are charged  with murdering two people in one of the worst drive-by shootings in Orange  County history, the prosecutor said Thursday.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef said he will file an amended complaint today  adding the special circumstance of multiple murder against Louis Palomino  Valadez, Robert Phillip Figueroa and Roman Gabriel Menchaca, all of Santa Ana.  The multiple-murder allegation means that the men could be sentenced to death  if they are convicted.    A fourth suspect, a 14-year-old Santa Ana boy who police have said was one of  two alleged triggermen in the Sept. 16 murders in Garden Grove, cannot legally  be sentenced to death or tried as an adult, Avdeef said.    Fearing that Thursday's arrests of 5th Street gang members may trigger  retribution by their comrades against rival 17th Street gang members, Garden  Grove and Santa Ana police stepped up their patrols of the two turfs, but they  have picked up no hint of impending violence, said Garden Grove Police Sgt.  Phil Mason, who is directing the murder investigation.    ""Our gang detail is keeping its ear to the ground,"" Mason said Thursday. ""But  it's like trying to read smoke signals in the mountains.""    Police have been interviewing the four defendants, but they show no willingness  to cooperate, Mason said.    Valadez, 28; Figueroa, 20; Menchaca, 19, and the 14-year-old boy gang member  are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit murder, two counts of  first-degree murder, 11 counts of attempted murder and one count of street  terrorism. The three adults were scheduled to be arraigned today in West  Municipal Court in Westminster. The 14-year-old boy, whose name was withheld  because of his age, faces a detention hearing in Juvenile Court on Tuesday.    Police said they believe that Menchaca and the 14-year-old crouched in the back  of a moving red pickup truck and sprayed semiautomatic gunfire into a cluster  of 13 people gathered outside a Garden Grove home on Sept 16. Police believe  that Valadez owned and drove the truck and that Figueroa was a passenger.    Even though there appear to have been only two triggermen, Mason said the  conspiracy and murder charges are warranted against all four because police  believe that they plotted the attack.    The bullets killed Miguel (Smokey) Navarro, 17, a member of the rival 17th  Street gang, and 4-year-old Frank Fernandez Jr. At least six others were  wounded, including the toddler's mother, aunt, and 2-year-old brother, as well  as a 26-year-old man who lost his leg due to bullet wounds.    Randall Albert Martinez, 20, a fifth purported gang member who was arrested  during Thursday's raids when police found several guns in his Santa Ana home,  is not a suspect in the homicides, Mason said.    Martinez was being held on suspicion of possessing a gun without a serial  number and child endangerment for keeping loaded weapons within reach of his 2  1/2-year-old daughter, Mason said. He was to be arraigned today along with the  three others in Westminster.    Police have ordered ballistics tests on the gun to determine if it was one of  two murder weapons, but they did not expect to have the results for at least  two weeks.    Martinez, who is Valadez's nephew, was shot in the chest during a drive-by  shooting in Santa Ana a week before the Garden Grove murders. Police have  speculated that the Sept. 16 attack might have been retribution for Martinez's  wounding.

Police Commissioner Colonel Trevor MacMillan confirmed  yesterday that the investigation is to be done by an ""internal  affairs division.""    He could not confirm, however, reports of a plot to  undermine  his administration of the Force through links between renegade  members of the Force and a leading cocaine dealer in the  Corporate Area.    The recent spate of gangland murders (110 killings in the  first 62 days of the year) is linked by police sources with the  plot.    The plot is said to involve the cocaine dealer, who has  powerful overseas connections and is assisted by some  disgruntled policemen, as well as deportees who are allowed  immediate membership in the gang as long as they bring their own  guns.    Asked about the plot, Colonel MacMillan said, ""I have no  evidence of it but I would not be surprised because there are  people in the force who are actively involved in the drug trade.  We are developing strategies to deal with it but I am not  prepared to comment further at this time, other than to say I  have the Minister's total support.""    MacMillan, determined to break the link between the police  force and drug traffickers, is striving for hard evidence to  establish that there is a link.    Fear    Citizens are reportedly reluctant to come forward and give  evidence for fear of reprisal from renegade cops.    Colonel MacMillan said yesterday, ""recently a doctor brought  a patient and the patient's mother to give us information about  where the patient got hooked on cocaine, and police involvement  with that location. Neither the patient nor mother was prepared  to give a signed statement, attend an I.D. parade, or go to  court.""    He said this is the kind of thing that happens, making it  difficult for the police to move from intelligence information  to evidence. ""For obvious reasons,"" he said, ""people are  reluctant to come forward. They fear for their personal safety.""    In the meantime, those renegade officers are fighting back  through the cocaine boss, whose men are reportedly behind many  of the recent murders. Sources tell The Gleaner that  60 to 70 police officers are involved in an islandwide cocaine  network providing protection for crack houses, and escort  services for the transportation of ganja, cocaine and crack.    ""As a result of stated government policy,"" said the Police  Commissioner ""an internal affairs division has been set up to  investigate the corruption of policemen.""     "

Police this morning confiscated this material as  it was taken from the Cobacabana district to another southern  Rio de Janeiro district.    Federal Police learned how the illegal lottery money  laundering scheme works. It is done through the Acaray Casino in  Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. One of the casino owners is illegal  lottery banker Waldomiro Garcia, known as Miro, who uses the  casino to justify a good portion of the illegal lottery money  that is registered as profits from the casino.    The illegal lottery bankers also use the Uruguayan financial  market to launder the money produced by other illegal  businesses. This money circulates through Montevideo banks as if  it were money from Uruguayan companies that make large  investments in Punta del Este's real estate market. These are  fictitious businesses that always render fantastic profits.    The money leaves Rio de Janeiro, goes to Paraguay, and then  to Uruguay. From there, already converted into clean money, it  is sent to fiscal paradises like Bahamas, Cayman, and Virgin  Islands. In the end, the money circulates normally in the  international financial market.    The illegal lottery bankers charge from 10 to 15 percent to  facilitate the laundering of money both in Uruguay and Paraguay.  After the money is laundered abroad through several financial  method, the money returns to Brazil as foreign investments. It  is as if I lend my money to myself through a foreign company,  apply it in the Brazilian financial market, then repay the money  to myself with interest, and then once again send it all abroad.

""I don't know what  the guy could have been thinking about.""    Goudarzi was one of the original nine investigators assigned to the  Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is composed of members of the San Diego  Police Department, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and the district  attorney's office.    The task force, created in August, 1988, is investigating the deaths of  prostitutes and transients killed since 1985, when prostitute and police  informant Donna Gentile was found murdered, her mouth stuffed with gravel.  Since then, 42 more prostitutes or transients have been killed.    In September, the task force expanded from 10 to 21 members and split into  three groups: one in charge of the Gentile murder, one in charge of the other  murders and one in charge of possible police misconduct in connection with  prostitutes because of the way Gentile was found murdered. The gravel in  Gentile's mouth was taken as a sign that she might have been killed for  testifying against police officers.    Goudarzi worked with the group investigating the 42 murders. Before joining the  task force, he worked in the Police Department's robbery and homicide  divisions. He also had worked in the Eastern Division, where officers dealt  with prostitutes who worked along El Cajon Boulevard. Some of the prostitutes  found murdered had also worked that street.    Goudarzi could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Police spokesman Bill  Robinson confirmed that Goudarzi is now assigned to the missing-persons  division.

Gary Schons, who is leading  the branch of the investigation dealing with police corruption, also refused to  comment.    Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper, who spent several months personally  reviewing the investigation at the request of Police Chief Bob Burgreen, said  he had no comment on Goudarzi.    ""We just cannot discuss personnel matters, as a matter of law,"" Stamper said.  ""And I will not discuss anything that would impede the progress of the task  force. It's worked so far.""    It was not immediately clear what effect Goudarzi's reassignment might have on  the credibility of the task force, which had been criticized for having police  officers investigate members of their own department.    Some members of the state attorney general's office had protested the agency's  move to join the task force because the department was also involved in the  probe.    At least five police officers and one former officer are under scrutiny for  their possible connections to Gentile and missing prostitute Cynthia Maine, who  disappeared in February, 1986, after detailing for internal-affairs  investigators which officers were involved with prostitutes.    The source close to the task force said the investigation was in no way  jeopardized by Goudarzi's removal.    The task force ""is still doing business as usual,"" the source said.

There is a high probability that the police will surpass  the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and Defense  Security Command [DSC] in intelligence capability and that an  era will come when police information is treated as the ""highest  class"" intelligence.    This talk is not circulating because the police's  intelligence capability, that is its collection, analytical and  interpretation capabilities, is better than other agencies. It  is because, confronted by an era of civilian government, the  activities of the NSP and DSC, long exercising tremendous  influence, have been relatively reduced.    ""Can police intelligence continue like this?"" -- words  casually dropped by Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u after his  appointment as minister. The words of Minister Choe became  widely known in political circles and there are many people who  interpret them as instructions to strengthen police intelligence  capability. Those in police intelligence were also greatly  encouraged by this one statement.    In connection with this statement, there are those who  ponder  the fact that last year the National Police Administration  created a new position in its Intelligence Bureau: Intelligence  Analyst. Some look at this and speculate, ""The police have gone  into full-scale research to strengthen their intelligence  capabilities."" Although the duties of the intelligence analyst  are not yet known in detail, attention has focused on the fact  that at a delicate point in time, a senior superintendent, with  the rank of police-station chief, was put in the position.    One thing to be considered carefully in connection with the  reduction of the activity of the NSP, considered the highest  intelligence agency, is the activation of the Telecommunications  Secrecy Protection Law. Actually, it is no secret that a  considerable portion of the NSP's intelligence collection  depended on wire tapping.    In an inspection of Korean Telecommunications by the  National  Assembly's Transportation and Communications Committee held  October 22 of last year, Democratic Party lawmaker Yi Yun-su  divulged, ""The NSP has exclusive use of 9,000 telephone  circuits. Of these, over 5,000 are used for eavesdropping.""    Rep. Yi demanded that they ""reveal precise details,"" but  Korean Telecommunications representatives equivocated, saying,  ""We don't yet have a grasp of it."" ""Considering that the police  have only 885 dedicated circuits and the DSC has only 383,  although both have similar intelligence duties, this supports  the view that the NSP depends for a considerable portion of its  intelligence on wiretapping,"" insisted Rep. Yi.    The intelligence activities of the NSP were dealt a fatal  blow last year when the Telecommunications Secrecy Protection  Law passed the National Assembly. The decoration of the pages of  daily newspapers by articles entitled, ""NSP Employees Stop  Work,"" is not unrelated to this. ""It's not that we have stopped  work altogether, as they are saying on the outside, but it is  true that morale has dropped considerably,"" said one NSP source,  indirectly conveying the mood within the NSP.    The DSC, which stirred up a controversy because of its  surveillance of civilians, already cut off its arms and legs  last year. Beginning with a sudden change of the DSC commander,  the DSC reorganization led into the abolition of its  intelligence office (Office II), which was responsible for  intelligence collection against civilians, together with the  movement of municipal and provincial-level security units to  within military bases. Also, over 400 veteran intelligence  agents who had been working in rear areas were moved to forward  areas. The DSC is now powerless in any arena other than  national-defense-related intelligence.    Such variables external to the police thus encourage the  idea  that, as far as intelligence goes, this is the ""era of the  police.""    In the vicinity of Seoul's Sogang University and in front of  Ehwa University, there are several offices with signs reading,  ""Council"" [as published]. In their names, these offices do not  fit in with the mood of a university neighborhood.    These offices are actually intelligence offices subordinate  to the Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau: they collect  various kinds of information tied in with politics, economics,  and the college area. The Police Administration has three such  offices within Seoul. The entrance to the National Assembly  building and political party buildings are also the  responsibility of police officers belonging to these  intelligence offices. The police's intelligence organization is  this broad.    Police intelligence activities tie the nation together as  with a spider's web. Those active in the front lines of  intelligence collection are the intelligence-section detectives  of each police station. Also, taking responsibility for one  police box each within their respective jurisdictions, they  gather information on important figures living in their areas  and public opinion within their jurisdictions. Thus, they in  fact have every quarter of the entire country covered.    The police station intelligence department is divided into  Intelligence Sections I and II. Pure intelligence-collection  activities are the responsibility of Intelligence Section II.  Although there are places with less than ten police officers,  20-30 detectives are active for police stations in areas of  Seoul with concentrations of major organizations and in areas  near universities.    Information collected at each police station is sent to the  municipal or provincial police intelligence-management  department. This once again goes up to the National Police  Administration, where the administration's intelligence analyst  interprets information based on this.    Even apart from this intelligence system with its vertical  organization, the National Police Administration, municipal and  provincial police also have separate, horizontal organizations.  The Seoul Municipal Police have an Intelligence-Management  Department with Intelligence Sections I and II. Other municipal  and provincial police also have similar structures. The  Intelligence Bureau within the Police Administration has  Intelligence Sections I through IV. This is the place that  epitomizes nationwide police intelligence.    Intelligence Section I is responsible for general affairs;  Section II, for collecting information on politics; Section III,  on economics and society; and Section IV, on academia and  religion. Intelligence Sections II, III, and IV manage  Intelligence offices 1, 2, and 3 respectively. It would not be  far off the mark to say that the entire public is confined  within the police intelligence network.    Besides this, the police even have officers dispatched to  the  Blue House, NSP, DSC, the courts, and public prosecutor's  offices. Of all government departments, the police have the  greatest number of government workers dispatched to other  places. Although not attached to duty, there is even a  designated person responsible for the media.    However, this does not mean that police intelligence has  tremendous influence. Although its collection capability is  outstanding, it has been considered to be relatively behind in  its analysis and interpretation capabilities. ""Police  intelligence is rock-bottom intelligence: a collection of all of  the most detailed but trivial information,"" said one  intelligence police officer, ""Accessing high-class information  is not an easy thing.""    Let us look at an example. There was a police officer in his  fifties working at the Namdaemun police station in Seoul. He has  now moved to a different police station within Seoul, but many  people remember his activity when he was in charge of the  Samsung Group as a member of the intelligence section. As an  intelligence-section ""detective,"" his rank was not that high,  but there was not a Samsung Group director who did not know his  name. This was because concerning internal information on the  Samsung Group, and particularly information about the movements  of the group's head, he was the quickest and most knowledgeable.    Among the intelligence he collected was information unknown  to even the NSP, the leader of intelligence agencies. Long  ""frequenting"" the Samsung Group headquarters, it was possible  for him to collect even trivial information on things such as  the exchange of the air purifier in the C.E.O.'s office.  However, his activities never got him much credit. The  information he collected was, in a word, fragmentary. Police  analytical capabilities were unable to thread this voluminous  information together to make a product. Even if they could have  been said to have made a ""product,"" it was always behind that of  the NSP and DSC. This is because the police intelligence of the  Fifth and Sixth Republics had no influence.    The main reason the police were unlikely to access  high-class  information and so could not help but fall behind the NSP, was  ""money,"" say sources associated with police intelligence. ""The  NSP pours out bundles of money. Naturally, high-class  information follows,"" said one police-intelligence source.    Concerning the question, ""Will a time come when the police  surpass the NSP and DSC in intelligence capability?"" present  theories are unlikely to give a clear answer. This is because,  although there are clear signs of this, there is still no  movement in that direction.    ""I have not heard a concrete commitment from Minister Choe  concerning the strengthening of police intelligence  capabilities,"" said Senior Superintendent General Yi Su-il, the  National Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau Chief. ""It  is only speculation based on various circumstances. There have  been no concrete efforts taken within the Police Administration  to improve its intelligence organization and it is technically  impossible to change an intelligence organization in a day.""    ""The establishment of the position of Intelligence Analyst  was only a separation of the existing intelligence-analysis  personnel,"" said Yi. ""It is unrelated to movements to  strengthen intelligence capability.""    However, one source associated with the police said, ""The  attempt by President Kim Yong-sam and Minister Choe Hyong-u,  representative victims of the past abnormal intelligence  activities of the NSP and DSC, to strengthen the legal  intelligence activities of the police in conjunction with an era  of civilian government is only natural."" The source also said,  ""Internally, the police will be deliberating on proposals now.""    ""The quality of intelligence has a deep correlation with  money,"" said one National Police Administration source, ""even if  there are efforts at improvement, because if there is no budget  support the results will not be remarkable."" ""Even if it  changes, it won't change much in a short time,"" he forecasted.    Always crowded out by the NSP and DSC, even while having the  most massive organization and number of personnel of the three  intelligence agencies, the police now appear to be gradually  gaining strength. One police officer said, ""Within the limits of  what is not damaging to the public, intelligence collection must  proceed, appearing to be and not to be at the same time.""     "
0,FT942-12155 ,"FT942-12155 _AN-EEAAIAENFT 940430   FT  30 APR 94 / Sport: Expensive horses for the big courses - Eventing      By KEITH WHEATLEY   Ginny Elliot (formerly Leng) was pessimistic about Badminton even before minor injuries to her two entries, Welton Houdini and Romance, forced her to pull out of next weekend's competition. Since the withdrawal of her sponsor, Citibank, Elliot's chances of a fourth Badminton win were already tinged with financial worries. 'I'm very close to having to sell one of my top horses,' she said. She has always managed to avoid this crisis, but other top riders such as Mark Todd and Ian Stark have already found it the only way to meet their competition overheads. Mary Thomson, winner of the 1992 Badminton horse trials on King William, is another international eventer with money worries. Gill Robinson, her personal patron is pulling out for business reasons. One of Thomson's seven eventers, probably King Basil, may soon be on the market. 'There are very few riders this season with major sponsors,' said Thomson. 'A couple of years ago companies were willing to underwrite a string of horses.' Recession, said Thomson, made them withdraw. However, since it may take four or five years to bring on a top horse, the competitors are committed to the quality animals they took on in better times. Vicki Latta, the New Zealand lawyer who uses her legal work to fund herself as an amateur at the top of the European tree, has also reached the end of the financial road. 'Most of my assets, except the horses, have been sold,' said Latta. Her magnificent gelding, Chief, won a record Pounds 13,000 in eventing prize money during the 1992 season, which probably just about paid his running costs. In contrast, the renowned showjumper Milton has several times won more than Pounds 250,000 in a season. Sentiment is not the principal barrier to a rider selling a top horse. Cross country courses are dangerous places. Deaths (human and equine) at the big fences have increased. Horse and rider need years to build the mutual confidence needed to tackle tracks such as Burleigh and Badminton. One can sell the horse but not that relationship. Hence the small market in outstanding eventers. When they are sold for serious money it is usually to countries such as Italy and Spain, where prestige is a considerable factor in any purchase. Yet horse trials have never been more popular with both competitors and the public. A British stately home is hardly worth the label these days without a three-day-event in the park. Upwards of 250,000 spectators are expected for the four days of Badminton. While the bulk of the audience will line the 4.25 miles and 29 fences of Saturday's cross-country course, dressage is proving increasingly popular and attracting large, enthusiastic crowds on Thursday and Friday. Although the total prize fund of Pounds 20,000, put up by Mitsubishi, sponsors of Badminton, is the biggest in the sport, it seems tiny in relation to the size of the event and the cost of participation. 'People are more turned on by sport when there is really big prize money involved,' said Elliot. 'It creates hype and media interest, which in turn pulls in the backers we need to keep going.' At one-day events, the grass roots of the sport, stars such as Thomson and Elliot win their personal spurs and train their novice horses. Entry lists which used to be a dozen or so are closer to a hundred. But much of the commercial infrastructure remains in the past. 'I went to an event in Buckinghamshire last week,' said Thomson. 'I paid two entry fees of Pounds 27 and Pounds 5 and then won quite a big section with a prize of Pounds 32.' If Thomson had not had her massive horsebox sponsored, then just the trip to the competition would have left her hugely out of pocket. These are not isolated problems suffered by a few stars. In the bars and stable yards at Badminton, this will be the main topic of conversation among the competitors. The final stage of any three-day event is the showjumping section. In private, few event-riders have much time for the Hollywood world of indoor jumping, yet financially it goes from strength to strength, bolstered by interest in continental Europe. It may be that with its background of cavalry training and foxhunting, the world of horse trials is too idiosyncratic to fit into the modern corporate milieu.

SIX SHERIFF'S  DEPUTIES ALREADY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED.      By VICTOR MERINA and JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      At least one Los Angeles Police Department narcotics officer will be indicted  and as many as three others may also face criminal charges in a federal probe  of alleged drug-money skimming, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Thursday.    Gates told a City Hall news conference that one officer will be indicted ""for  sure"" by the grand jury and ""four at the most"" may eventually be charged in a  corruption investigation that has already led to the conviction of six Los  Angeles County sheriff's deputies for stealing drug money confiscated in raids.    The money-skimming investigation of the sheriff's deputies, which began two  years ago, spawned a similar federal inquiry into the activities of narcotics  officers in the Police Department.    Gates said his department has conducted a probe into the allegations against  the four officers.    ""There's only one (officer) that we think is involved in the same way as the  sheriffs. . . . The other three have other problems and whether or not they'll  be indicted, I don't know,"" Gates said.    The police chief did not identify the officers but said that the one who faces  certain indictment had worked with sheriff's deputies on a special anti-drugs  task force.    That task force, known as the Southwest Region Distribution Crew, was formed by  the Sheriff's Department in September, 1986, to investigate mid-level drug  traffickers in Southwest Los Angeles. After Police Department officers joined  the crew four months later, the nine-member task force stepped up their pursuit  of major rock-cocaine dealers, including a suspect named Ricky Donnell Ross.    During the seven-week trial of the deputies, former Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R.  Sobel -- who once supervised the Southwest crew and is cooperating with federal  prosecutors -- testified that the deputies and police officers under his  command routinely beat drug suspects, stole money from them, planted narcotics  on Ross and others and lied in reports to cover up their activities.    Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Emmick, who has been overseeing the federal probe,  refused comment on Gates' statements or the grand jury investigation.    But the police chief indicated that his department's Internal Affairs Division  has cooperated with federal prosecutors.    ""We pretty much completed our investigation some time ago and we have been  supplying that information to the U.S. attorney and he, in turn, has been  supplying it to the federal grand jury,"" Gates said.    If the grand jury does not indict some of the police officers, Gates said the  department may still seek charges against the officers under state law.    ""We are certainly looking at that possibility,"" he said. ""There may be a  statute (of limitations) problem here or there. . . . If the federal grand jury  does not do anything, we will certainly follow up with the district attorney.""    A district attorney's spokesman said that office is not conducting any current  investigation into any of the police officers or sheriff's deputies. But he  said local prosecutors would review any case brought by the Police Department.    ""If we feel it warrants prosecution then we will proceed vigorously,"" spokesman  Mike Botula said.    Prosecutors have already sent letters to defense attorneys in an undetermined  number of pending and closed drug cases involving the Southwest crew.    But Curtis A. Hazell, chief of the district attorney's major narcotics and  forfeiture division, said the federal investigation involves ""a very limited  number of people who were believed to be part of a joint task force that worked  with Sobel's mid-level crew.""    Unlike the sheriff's deputies who have been relieved of duty, the police  officers under investigation remain on the job, although they have been  transferred from narcotics assignments to other tasks.    Asked about Gates' comments, a lawyer for the police union said none of the  officers would respond.    ""We'll have to wait until the outcome of the investigation,"" said Enrique  Hernandez, associate general counsel for the Los Angeles Police Protective  League.    According to sources close to the Police Department, the internal investigation  has branched out from its initial focus on the task force officers to include  other officers who have been involved in narcotics cases.    ""They've turned the place upside down,"" said one source, ""but the other things  they have found do not involve ripping off any money, or anything as serious as  that -- at least, so far.""

That task force, known as the Southwest Region Distribution Crew, was formed by  the Sheriff's Department in September, 1986, to investigate mid-level drug  traffickers in Southwest Los Angeles. After Police Department officers joined  the crew four months later, the nine-member task force stepped up their pursuit  of major rock-cocaine dealers, including a suspect named Ricky Donnell Ross.    During the seven-week trial of the deputies, former Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R.  Sobel -- who once supervised the Southwest crew and is cooperating with federal  prosecutors -- testified that the deputies and police officers under his  command routinely beat drug suspects, stole money from them, planted narcotics  on Ross and others and lied in reports to cover up their activities.    Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Emmick, who has been overseeing the federal probe,  refused comment on Gates' statements or the grand jury investigation.    But the police chief indicated that his department's Internal Affairs Division  has cooperated with federal prosecutors.    ""We pretty much completed our investigation some time ago and we have been  supplying that information to the U.S. attorney and he, in turn, has been  supplying it to the federal grand jury,"" Gates said.    If the grand jury does not indict some of the police officers, Gates said the  department may still seek charges against the officers under state law.    ""We are certainly looking at that possibility,"" he said. ""There may be a  statute (of limitations) problem here or there. . . . If the federal grand jury  does not do anything, we will certainly follow up with the district attorney.""    A district attorney's spokesman said that office is not conducting any current  investigation into any of the police officers or sheriff's deputies. But he  said local prosecutors would review any case brought by the Police Department.    ""If we feel it warrants prosecution then we will proceed vigorously,"" spokesman  Mike Botula said.    Prosecutors have already sent letters to defense attorneys in an undetermined  number of pending and closed drug cases involving the Southwest crew.    But Curtis A. Hazell, chief of the district attorney's major narcotics and  forfeiture division, said the federal investigation involves ""a very limited  number of people who were believed to be part of a joint task force that worked  with Sobel's mid-level crew.""    Unlike the sheriff's deputies who have been relieved of duty, the police  officers under investigation remain on the job, although they have been  transferred from narcotics assignments to other tasks.    Asked about Gates' comments, a lawyer for the police union said none of the  officers would respond.    ""We'll have to wait until the outcome of the investigation,"" said Enrique  Hernandez, associate general counsel for the Los Angeles Police Protective  League.    According to sources close to the Police Department, the internal investigation  has branched out from its initial focus on the task force officers to include  other officers who have been involved in narcotics cases.    ""They've turned the place upside down,"" said one source, ""but the other things  they have found do not involve ripping off any money, or anything as serious as  that -- at least, so far.""

After a heated discussion behind closed doors, the authority rejected as 'totally unacceptable' Chief Constable Robert Lawrence's closure plans. Instead, it ordered a review of its finances in an attempt to find other ways of offsetting a deficit of nearly Pounds 2m before the next financial year - just six weeks away. A budget review team will meet on Friday to examine possibilities such as switching some functions, such as the traffic warden service, to the control of county councils. More than 3,000 police officers, represented by the Police Federation, passed a vote of no confidence in the authority. The local government union Unison, representing 800 of the 1,300 civilian staff, supported the move, claiming south Wales had been made to look 'a laughing stock' and warned that the force was in danger of losing its official certificate of efficiency. After the meeting in Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, Mr Roy Jones, authority chairman and county councillor, said the budget review group would attempt to draw up an alter-native to police station closures. As well as closing police stations, the chief constable's report included the option of selling police cars and cutting spending on uniforms.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0," FR940128-1-00012   FR940128-1-00006        C. The Principal Hazards         The most notable seafood-related hazards involve the   following:         1. Bacteria         Because bacteria either naturally live in, or can survive   in, aquatic habitats, there are a large number of pathogenic   bacteria that can be found in seafood, particularly molluscan   shellfish. Many of these bacteria are far more harmful to   specific human subpopulations, such as the elderly,   immunocompromised, or persons with specific underlying diseases,   than to the population as a whole. The size of these   subpopulations is increasing, however. Therefore, concerns about   bacterial contamination of seafood, particularly molluscan   shellfish, are increasing.     In the United States, 4.4 percent of botulism outbreaks have   been attributed to seafood. The predominant type of botulism   organism in aquatic environments is the kind most readily   destroyed by heat. Thus, many types of processing, if done   properly, can negate the risk of botulism from seafood.   Nonetheless, with the trend toward greater use of modified   atmosphere and vacuum packaging (i.e., packaging that excludes   oxygen) to enhance the shelf life and the desirability of   refrigerated foods, traditional controls need to be enhanced   because     Clostridium botulinum     can grow in the absence of oxygen.     Other bacteria of concern include     Listeria monocytogenes,     a   hazardous foodborne microorganism that is ubiquitous in nature   and is commonly found in food processing environments;       Salmonella,     which is not a marine organism but can contaminate   seafood through improper handling and sanitation practices; and       Staphylococcus aureus,     another pathogen associated with   sanitation and handling (Ref. 8, pp. 14 and 15).         2. Viruses         Several viruses that are infectious to humans enter aquatic   habitats through sewage. These viruses can concentrate in   shellfish and be present and infective even when bacterial   indicators of fecal pollution are absent. Viruses probably cause   the bulk of seafood-associated disease, particularly the Norwalk   and Norwalk-like agents, which are linked to the consumption of   contaminated raw or undercooked molluscan shellfish (Ref. 7, p.   30).         3. Natural Toxins         Problems associated with naturally occurring toxins in fish   have been recognized for centuries. Ciguatera poisoning is   perhaps the most significant problem associated with a natural   toxin. The toxin is produced by microscopic organisms and can be   transmitted to humans through the consumption of finfish that   have eaten these organisms through the food chain (Ref. 7, p.   89). The larger, more predacious fish (groupers, snappers,   barracuda, amberjack) and reef fish belonging to the crevally or   ulua (Carangidae) family are generally more likely to contain   ciguatoxin than other types of fish (Ref. 7, p. 89). Because the   toxin is heat stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat   (Ref. 9, p. 1).     On average, 70 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported   annually in the United States and its possessions and territories   (Ref. 7, p. 89). Deaths are rare, and the acute symptoms of the   disease are usually of short duration; however, neurological   symptoms can persist for extended periods. Ciguatera is   geographically localized, with the majority of illnesses reported   from tropical or subtropical areas.     Other toxins of public health concern include domoic acid,   which was detected in seafood from the U.S. Pacific coast for the   first time in the fall and winter of 19911992 (Ref. 10,   p. 1,113); and saxitoxin, or paralytic shellfish poison, which   has periodically made molluscan bivalves toxic and has recently   affected Pacific Northwest crab harvests (Ref. 11).         4. Parasites         Parasites, such as anasakid nematodes (round worms),   naturally infect certain fish and ocean mammals (Ref. 12, p.   724). Human parasitic infections almost always occur from the   consumption of raw (sushi, sashimi) or undercooked fish.   Historically, probably no more than five cases are reported on   average in the United States each year and the likelihood of   occurrence is estimated to be very low (Ref. 5, p. 25). Problems   with parasites are avoidable through commercial freezing of the   raw fish before consumption.         5. Chemical Contaminants         The presence of toxic chemicals in the aquatic environment   creates the potential for contamination of seafood products.   These chemicals include pesticides; other industrial chemicals,   such as polychlorinated biphenyls; heavy metals, such as lead,   cadmium, and mercury; and petroleum hydrocarbons.

A total of 160 agents from  the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], the  State Judicial Police, and the Army participated in the rescue.    Tonight, in a communique, the representative of the Office  of  the Attorney General of the Republic, Marco Antonio Baez  Cardoso, announced that seven other individuals escaped during  the confrontation. They include an adult female and two minors,  probably the wife and children of one of the criminals.    The Federal and State Judicial Police from Veracruz, backed  by the Army, are advancing in the area and intensifying their  efforts to capture these individuals.    The report explained that, as a result of the operation, in  which there were no casualties among the Amry forces or police  personnel, three of the presumed drug traffickers, including the  so-called ""Commander Rojo,"" were killed, and four others  arrested. One of the latter sustained serious wounds. Two  Federal Judicial Police agents, Miguel Barajas and Oscar Ortiz,  who had been kidnapped, were rescued, and three vehicles were  confiscated.    Tonight, the PGR announced that, on 6 December, Veracruz  State Judicial Police personnel began the operations aimed at  capturing 14 very well-armed persons, apparently under the  influence of some drug. Wearing uniforms similar to those of the  Army, they were staying at the El Pueblito Hotel, located in the  municipality of Fortin de las Flores.    On the previous Saturday, those 14 subjects had put out of  commission a small plane with Venezuelan registration, on which  they may have been carrying drugs. The plane landed  clandestinely in the vicinity of the El Palmar Experimental  Center in the municipality of Tezonapa on 16 August of this  year, and was subsequently confiscated.    Since those individuals had registered at the hotel as  members of the Armed Forces of Mexico, ""on a high-level military  intelligence mission,"" an operation was mounted with the aid of  the Veracruz State Judicial Police.    When the building was surrounded, in order to prevent injury  to the guests occupying it, the police had to allow the alleged  members of the military to escape, because they threatened to  explode several grenades that they were carrying in a ""poncho.""    The office reported that four Federal Judicial Police agents  were forced to accompany them, as virtual hostages. Later, using  force and threatening to blow up everything around them, the  criminals also abducted four other members of that corps.    After both the Army and Navy had been queried, a report was  received indicating that no group had been commissioned, as  those individuals claimed. The latter included Jorge Alberto  Vazquez Gallardo, better known as ""Comandante Rojo,"" and wanted  for nearly 12 years because of his known connections with  individuals engaged in drug dealing.    The operation was intensified on the afternoon of 6 December  when, after pursuing those who pretended to belong to the  military, the agents spotted them in the border zone between  Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca States: specifically, in the  vicinity of the Tonto River. On the same night, six of the eight  members of both corps who had been taken hostage were released.    The PGR noted that, owing to the conditions prevailing in  the  area, and the fact that these subjects are extremely dangerous,  it was decided to postpone their action and to reinforce the  operation. Hence, this morning, with the aid of a helicopter, 30  Federal Judicial Police agents, reinforced by 60 Army troops and  70 members of the Veracruz State Judicial Police, tightened the  cordon and prepared for the attack.

He said that the DEA  informed him of the impending arrest just two or three days  before the arrest. The first arrests were made in Eugene,  Oregon. Then, Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested in Hong Kong. The  two arrests were connected to each other. American officials  have confirmed that they have evidence. DEA officials asked for  our cooperation in arresting a Chinese Burmese named Mr. Lee.  Thai police officials arrested him on 9 December and extradited  him on 11 December. Most recently, DEA officials arrested the  sixth member of this gang in Oregon. None of those arrested  there were Thais.    The reporter asked if the DEA had identified any Thais as  being involved with this narcotics trafficking gang. Police Lt.  Gen. Kowit said that no such information has been provided. He  said that he had met with the head of the DEA in Thailand  earlier in the day and that they had talked about the Associated  Press report that a Thai police official was involved in this.  But the DEA official told him that they have no evidence to that  effect, unless the suspects implicate others.    The reporter asked if this arrest will tarnish Thailand's  image. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that this will have a good  effect, because it will show the world that Thailand is  cooperating and that we are sincere about wanting to suppress  narcotics. The United States has praised Thailand for this.    The reporter asked is the DEA had confirmed that no Thai  police officials or soldiers were involved. Police Lt. Gen.  Kowit said that none were involved. But that may not be so in  other cases, because nothing has happened yet. As far as this  case is concerned, Maj. Gen. Thanat has personal ties to Thais  living in Oregon. It's unlikely that others were involved. He  confirmed that there is strong evidence against Maj. Gen.  Thanat. He was not arrested as a scapegoat as some fear.    As the person responsible for overseeing the work of the  Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Mr. Amnuai  Wirawan, the deputy prime minister, said that the ONCB is doing  a good job. The arrest of a Thai general abroad has nothing to  do with the ONCB.    Mr. Amnuai said that with respect to statements by U.S.  officials that senior Thai military officers, police officials,  and civil servants are involved in narcotics trafficking  activities, the ONCB has frequently contacted international  organizations concerning suppression activities. It must be  admitted that there are some senior Thai officials who are  involved. But there are only a few such people. There are a few  bad people in every large organization. Steps must be taken to  get rid of the ""rotten fish."" ""I don't think that this news will  tarnish the image of Thai officials, because there are many good  people in the Thai bureaucracy. The Thai Government has  constantly helped other countries suppress narcotics. If  Thailand had not made those arrests, the damage would have been  much greater. The military has never tried to pull strings to  help one of its men.""    The reporter asked if the ONCB will coordinate things with  the United States and ask for the names of those senior [Thai]  officials said to be involved in narcotics trafficking  activities so that action can be taken against them. Mr. Amnuai  said that we have always cooperated with them. Thailand has  compiled a list of names, too, and some of the names appear on  both lists. Some of the names do not appear in the directory of  Thai officials but appear abroad. There is nothing unusual about  this.    Police General Prathin Santipraphop, the acting director  general of the Police Department, discussed the statement made  by General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of interior, who said  that information provided by the DEA indicates that police  officers are involved in narcotics trafficking activities.  Police Gen. Prathin said that the Ministry of Interior has not  issued any instructions. If information is provided, the matter  must be investigated. The United States has not said who is on  the list. The only names that have been released are the names  of those who were arrested.    Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, the 2d Army Region  commander, said that the news that a major general has been  charged with trafficking in heroin is very disturbing. The Army  is a very large organization and so there are both good people  and bad people in it. But high-ranking officials should not be  involved in such things. Being involved in narcotics-trafficking  activities is a very serious matter. But what happened is a  personal matter. This has nothing to do with the military.    Second Lieutenant Phairot Suwannachawi, a National  Development Party member of Parliament from Nakhon Ratchasima  Province and an activist in Group 16, said that the units  concerned, that is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ONCB,  and the Police Department, must provide clear and detailed  information to show if there are real grounds for charging a  general with being involved in heroin trafficking. Otherwise,  when senior Thai officials travel abroad, they may not be  treated with respect. He said that he once traveled abroad  together with a provincial governor and they were both stripped  and searched. This is a terrible matter. But this is a personal  matter that does not involve the military. He said that he hopes  that politicians and the mass media will think carefully before  saying anything or criticizing something.     "

Thirteen people involved in the production and distribution  of the hard drugs seized--mainly pervitin and efedrin  [ephedrine]--have been detained as a result of ""Operation Wind""  in which the drug squad of the Criminal Police Central Office  (UKP) was joined by the Prague Investigations Office.    The drug haul was previously reported as having a street  value of one million korunas ($34,000).    The operation, which took place on February 1-2, was the  biggest and most successful conducted in recent years against  drug production in Prague, the spokesman said.    The suspects have also been charged with illegal possession  of weapons.    According to chief of the drug squad Miroslav Bornik, the  squad launched 625 operations last year and detained a total of  109 suspects.    Bornik said the raid was particularly successful because the  police did not only find ""the normal boilers"" where the drugs  are produced but also a layer of people who were concerned only  with dealing. He added that the drug squad returned to a  laboratory they had destroyed only a few hours earlier to find  it completely re-equipped and operational again.    During the raid police also discovered a considerable sum of  money, communications technology, and two stolen cars, he said.    Czech anti-drug legislation is in contradiction with the  NATO  agreement of 1988, Bornik said. In his view, if possession of  drugs for personal use is legal and no quantity is specified, it  is extremely difficult to take action against producers and  manufacturers. Prosecution would be possible only if a dealer  was caught in the very moment he passed drugs onto someone else,  he said.     "

The PF made a similar seizure on the 23d of last month when  it found $36,000 in the luggage of passenger Eldon Barreira  Castelo Branco, 25. In both cases, the route was the same: the  passengers had boarded a Varig flight bound for Manaus from the  municipality of Tabatinga, Amazonas, across the border from  Leticia, Colombia.    Paula Sobrinho and Nunes de Souza were approached by police  as they were waiting for the connecting flight to Para. Giving  an appearance of calm, they both denied carrying anything  illegal, but upon being searched, they were found to be in  possession of the false banknotes. The dollars had been packed  in bundles, each containing $10,000 in $100 bills. Paula  Sobrinho and Nuno de Souza had covered the packages with plastic  and attached them to their bodies using adhesive tape. Upon  being caught in the act, the passengers told Police Chief  Claudio Rosas that the money had been acquired in Tabatinga. As  had been true with the dollars seized from Castelo Branco on the  23d, the PF discovered that the almost perfect banknotes were  counterfeit only after expert analysis.    Police Chief Rosas said that the two passengers must belong  to the same gang as Castelo Branco. That gang seems to be part  of an international scheme, since there have been other seizures  in various places around the country. According to him, the  dollars are probably being produced in Leticia. The Federal  Police want to conduct a joint investigation with Colombian  police.     "

Police this morning confiscated this material as  it was taken from the Copacabana district to another southern  Rio de Janeiro district.    Federal Police learned how the illegal lottery money  laundering scheme works. It is done through the Acaray Casino in  Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. One of the casino owners is illegal  lottery banker Waldomiro Garcia, aka Miro, who uses the casino  to justify a good portion of the illegal lottery money that is  registered as profits from the casino.    The illegal lottery bankers also use the Uruguayan financial  market to launder the money produced by other illegal  businesses. This money circulates through Montevideo banks as if  it were money from Uruguayan companies that make large  investments in Punta del Este's real estate market. These are  fictitious businesses that always render fantastic profits.    The money leaves Rio de Janeiro, goes to Paraguay, and then  to Uruguay. From there, already converted into clean money, it  is sent to fiscal paradises like Bahamas, Cayman, and Virgin  Islands. In the end, the money circulates normally in the  international financial market.    The illegal lottery bankers charge from 10 to 15 percent to  facilitate the laundering of money both in Uruguay and Paraguay.  After the money is laundered abroad through several financial  method, the money returns to Brazil as foreign investments. It  is as if I lend my money to myself through a foreign company,  apply it in the Brazilian financial market, then repay the money  to myself with interest, and then once again send it all abroad.

Three other Iranians are being held for  questioning in the same case.    The arrest was made more than 10 weeks after police found a  metric ton of deadly explosive mixture made from C4 plastic  explosive and ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer in a water tank  on the back of a six-wheel truck abandoned less than a kilometer  from the Israeli Embassy after the driver hit a taxi motorcycle.

Thousands of riot troopers in combat fatigues and black helmets flooded central  Seoul, conducting street checks for radical supporters and guarding key  government buildings.    Police charged hundreds of protesters who tried to block streets and chant  anti-government slogans in the city center. Struggling protesters were taken  away on buses. Police said more than 1,000 people were arrested.    ""Punish Roh Tae Woo!"" and ""Drive out the Yankees!"" protesters yelled.    About 120 students courted arrest by lying down in one main street with their  arms and legs interlocked. Police hauled the students away as other protesters  screamed abuse, but there were no clashes.    Riot police also blocked protests in the cities of Chonju, Sungnam and Taegu.  Small protest marches were allowed in eight other cities after organizers  obtained police permission.    The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main dissident alliance,  had called for a major protest in Seoul to push for President Roh's downfall  and to mark the anniversary of a May, 1980, uprising in the southern city of  Kwangju.    Police banned the Seoul rally on grounds that it was a threat to public order.    In other protests, about 500 people marched in Kwangju to call for Roh's fall.  The march was blocked by about 2,000 riot police in the city's main square, and  the protesters hurled eggs and rocks at troopers.    The Kwangju protest was the smallest since daily protests began May 11 to mark  the anniversary's uprising. Crowds estimated at up to 100,000 took part in  protests there last week.

Police charged hundreds of protesters who tried to block streets and chant  anti-government slogans in the city center. Struggling protesters were taken  away on buses. Police said more than 1,000 people were arrested.    ""Punish Roh Tae Woo!"" and ""Drive out the Yankees!"" protesters yelled.    About 120 students courted arrest by lying down in one main street with their  arms and legs interlocked. Police hauled the students away as other protesters  screamed abuse, but there were no clashes.    Riot police also blocked protests in the cities of Chonju, Sungnam and Taegu.  Small protest marches were allowed in eight other cities after organizers  obtained police permission.    The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main dissident alliance,  had called for a major protest in Seoul to push for President Roh's downfall  and to mark the anniversary of a May, 1980, uprising in the southern city of  Kwangju.    Police banned the Seoul rally on grounds that it was a threat to public order.    In other protests, about 500 people marched in Kwangju to call for Roh's fall.  The march was blocked by about 2,000 riot police in the city's main square, and  the protesters hurled eggs and rocks at troopers.    The Kwangju protest was the smallest since daily protests began May 11 to mark  the anniversary's uprising. Crowds estimated at up to 100,000 took part in  protests there last week.

This was announced by Police Commissioner Johan van der  Merwe  at a special press conference held at Caeser's Palace,  Braamfontein, where exhibits and a special video tape was made  available to the media. He said teams of SAP [South African  Police] members had worked around the clock for the past few  days to hunt down those responsible for the blasts and to  prevent further blasts.    ""The result was a remarkable breakthrough resulting in 31  arrests,"" he said.    The arrests were carried out in Rustenberg, Ventersdorp and  Pretoria and involved the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's [AWB,  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard].    Gen van der Merwe said some had given themselves up and that  those arrested included a police reservist. Those arrested were  the brains of the group and it could not be excluded that others  were involved, including leaders, but this was currently under  further investigation.    The first suspect was arrested and held under Section 29 of  the Internal Security Act on Sunday, but the rest were regular  arrests, gen van der merwe said. He said the suspects were being  held at various locations which were being kept secret.    The successful results were primarily the product of good  intelligence work, he said.    Those arrests were all allegedly connected to the bombs  which were detonated in central Johannesburg on Sunday, at the  Germiston taxi rank on Monday, the Pretoria restaurant on Monday  night and Wednesday's Jan Smuts Airport blast. The three  explosions claimed 21 lives and injured 173 people.    Other blasts where only material damage was caused were also  being linked to the group. These occurred at taxi ranks in  Randfontein and Westonaria on Monday morning.     "

Gates and the Command Officers Assn. announced Friday. The testing  program is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation.    Under the $250,000 program outlined at a news conference at Parker Center,  command officers will be selected randomly by a police computer and undergo  urine tests for several illicit narcotics -- including cocaine, marijuana and  PCP. Gates said he, too, will be tested.    Those who test positive for illegal drugs face being fired, Gates said.    ""Our policy is that they have no place in the Police Department,"" the chief  said. ""We would do our very best to fire them.""    The Police Department began similar testing of cadets in August, 1988. Since  then, Gates said, only two cadets have been dropped from the force for testing  positive for drug use.    The department fires about 10 police officers a year for drug abuse, said Cmdr.  William Booth. The department has roughly 8,000 officers and supervisors.    Spokesmen for the Command Officers Assn. maintained that none of their members  use drugs, but they have consented to be tested without advance notice to set  examples for both rank-and-file officers and the city.    ""We want to demonstrate to the community that they have the right to feel some  confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department,"" said Cmdr. Larry Kramer, one  of the directors of the Command Officers Assn.    Gates said he hopes the drug-testing program will encourage the Los Angeles  Police Protective League, the police officers' union, to support his plan to  begin random testing of all of the department's officers by June 1.    In an attempt to block his plan, the 7,800-member union filed a complaint with  the city Employee Relations Board in February charging the chief with unfair  labor practices.    ""We are trying hard to discuss this with the union,"" Gates said. ""Somehow, we  have not been able to reach an agreement. . . . I'm hopeful this example shown  by the leadership here will start the ball rolling.""    A union spokesman said the Police Protective League does not oppose drug  testing, but fears Gates is trying to use the issue to reopen contract  negotiations prematurely.    ""That's exactly what he's trying to do,"" said George Aliano, the president of  the union. ""Drug testing is not the issue. The contract is the issue. But I can  tell you that, confidentially, less than 80% of the officers support mandatory  random drug testing.""    Gates said the latest program will test every command officer at least once a  year, but there will be no limit on the number of times an officer can be  tested.    During the test, Gates said, two urine samples will be taken. The police lab  will examine one sample for traces of illegal drugs. If that sample tests  positive, the second sample will be taken to an independent lab and tested.    If the two test results conflict, a third analysis at a private lab will be  conducted to resolve the discrepancy.    ""I don't know of any program like this in the country,"" the chief said,  referring to the testing of top brass. ""I have heard that other places are  contemplating this, but we're the only police department that I know of to  actually do it.""    During the news conference, Gates also addressed reports that scores of  misdemeanor drug cases were not prosecuted by the city attorney's office in  1988 because an LAPD policy permitted officers to bypass preliminary testing of  suspected narcotics.    In September, 1988, officers were told they could skip the preliminary test  because the police crime lab would fully analyze seized substances. But the lab  results did not come back in time for prosecution.    Because there were no available tests to show that many of the confiscated  substances were illicit drugs, many drug arrests were never prosecuted,  officials said.    ""I'm extremely unhappy over this whole issue,"" said Gates, who last September  rescinded the order permitting preliminary tests to be bypassed. ""The fault is  both on our side and the city attorney's side. We retested those cases, took  them back to the city attorney's office and were assured that they would be  filed. They have not been.""    But officials at the city attorney's office said about 50 cases were affected  by the order, and that all eventually were filed.

The unusual die-off of the large migratory birds is no threat to the water  supply, they stressed. But tests are being conducted to see if something in the  water could be causing the deaths.    Although the white pelicans -- cousins of the brown pelicans found on the  California coast -- nest over a wide area of the West, the trouble seems  confined to the eastern Sierra.    ""We don't know the cause of the mortality,"" said Vern Bleich, wildlife  biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game.      Most Found at Crowley    Most of the pelicans have been found during the last three weeks at Crowley  Lake, a reservoir and popular fishing lake run by the Los Angeles Department of  Water and Power north of Bishop. Carcasses and stricken birds also have been  found farther south along the Owens River and at Tinemaha and Haiwee  reservoirs, part of the city's vast Owens Valley waterworks.    Preliminary tests have found an unusually high number of parasitic worms in the  walls of the stomachs of nearly all the birds, said David Jessup, a state  veterinarian and pathologist in Sacramento. There were signs of malnutrition  that could be explained by the worms, but the birds did not appear to have  starved, he said.    Jessup said, however, that many other causes cannot yet be ruled out. No  significant pesticide residue has been found, but more detailed tests will be  made to see if the pelicans had ingested high levels of toxic metals, he said.    Certain metals and chemicals have been held responsible for large-scale bird  deaths elsewhere in California. Selenium-tainted water that ran off  agricultural fields is blamed for killing waterfowl at the Kesterson Wildlife  Refuge in the San Joaquin Valley. Jessup said that selenium tests had not yet  been completed on the pelicans.    State officials are sufficiently alarmed to have requested this week that more  carcasses be sent to Sacramento for study in a Fish and Game Department  laboratory.    High levels of iron and zinc were found in the first Owens Valley pelicans  tested, but those metals are not ordinarily considered toxic, Jessup said. ""We  don't know quite what to make of it,"" he said Wednesday.    White pelicans do not usually breed beside Crowley and the Owens Valley  waterways, preferring instead lakes and wetlands farther north.    A large breeding population is found at the Klamath Basin wildlife refuge near  the California-Oregon border, and a smaller group nests on Anaho Island in  Nevada's Pyramid Lake northeast of Reno.    The Pyramid Lake colony suffered a very low nesting rate last spring, perhaps  because of a third winter of low snowmelt into the Truckee River. But the  Klamath Basin pelicans, the only breeding colony in California, seem to be  thriving.      No Problem at Refuge    ""We haven't seen anything out of the ordinary up here at all,"" said Jim  Hainline, wildlife biologist at the Klamath Basin refuge.    No identifying bands have been found that would allow the carcasses to be  traced, state biologists said. Most white pelicans migrate to Mexico in the  fall. The birds found at Crowley Lake and in the Owens Valley may have been on  their annual migration, biologists said.    Crowley's water level is exceptionally low this fall, in part because of a  dearth of rain and snowfall and in part because of a court order requiring that  water normally diverted into the lake be released instead into Mono Lake.    As the water level at Crowley falls, concern has grown among anglers and some  officials that pelicans are eating too many trout trying to spawn upstream in  the lake. The pelicans have been blamed by some people in the area for  depleting the trout. However, biologists said there are no indications that the  pelicans were deliberately poisoned.

Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police  Administration, said that from 1990 through 1993, police here  seized a total of 1,092 kilograms of heroin and 3,566 kilograms  of amphetamines worth a combined street value of billions of US  dollars. ""Without the police crackdown, those drugs would have  been circulated either in Taiwan or re-exported to other  countries,"" he said.    The US State Department submitted the 1993 International  Narcotics Control Strategy Report to Congress earlier in the  month, accusing Taiwan of allowing the production of illicit  amphetamines and of increasingly playing a role in the  laundering of drug money.    According to the report, Taiwan has become an important  Southeast Asian transit center for heroin. It said movement of  the drugs is difficult to detect because of Taiwan's heavy  merchant marine traffic.    Wang Chun, director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation,  admitted that more efforts need to be taken in the fight against  drug smuggling and more money budgeted for the purpose. Only  NT$2.8 million [new Taiwan dollars] (US$106,060) is used by  Taiwan police to combat drug trafficking each year, as compared  with US$12 billion appropriated by the United States.    He also said Taiwan needs to change the law that treats drug  addicts as criminals rather than as patients so that they can  get help to kick their habits.    Local police seized an average of three or four kilograms of  drugs each year before 1989. But the figure rose to 154  kilograms in 1991 and a stunning 810 kilograms in 1993.    Police in the central Taiwan County of Chiayi in a raid on  May 11 [date as received] seized 336 kilograms of high-grade  heroin, prompting Premier Lien Chan to announce a nationwide  campaign against drug smuggling.

In a suit filed Wednesday in Ventura Superior Court, Officer Florence Trapani  says she became the target of a biased internal investigation, was improperly  removed from her post as a drug abuse resistance education (DARE) officer and  was warned she would receive no help from other officers in an emergency after  she was reassigned to patrol duties.    Trapani alleges that she was blamed for the personnel problems of her  ex-husband, Michael Bender, a popular detective.    Trapani's suit asks for an unspecified amount of money for loss of income and  suffering.    ""We're mainly looking to get her reputation back,"" said her attorney, William  Rehwald of Woodland Hills. He said Trapani, 32, has been on stress leave from  the department since her reassignment in August. Bender, 34, also is on leave.    Simi Valley City Atty. John Torrance, City Manager Lynn Koester and Police  Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller declined comment. Officials have said privately  that the Police Department became ensnared in the divorce and ensuing child  custody fight between the two officers.    Bender and Trapani were divorced in 1985. Trapani had been widely recognized  for her work in the DARE program. Bender was named the department's officer of  the year in 1983 and has repeatedly earned the title ""Toughest Cop Alive"" in  the biennial World Police and Fire Games.    Rehwald said the couple's divorce became a smoke screen for gender  discrimination in the Police Department.    Eight of the department's 105 officers are women.    According to Rehwald, Trapani's problems began last winter when she accused  Bender of attempting to fondle her in the police gym. During the department's  ensuing investigation, evidence surfaced that Bender had secretly taped  conversations with his ex-wife and others, a violation of state law. The  district attorney's office declined to prosecute.    The department's charges of sexual harassment and making illegal tapes were  eventually sustained against Bender. He has appealed to the city Personnel  Department. Bender faces a possible 10-day suspension and pay cut of $115 per  month for a year.    Harassment of Trapani by other officers became so intense that Miller decided  to transfer her to the Ventura County Police Academy as a training officer  until the controversy died down, Rehwald said. The suit says Trapani was told  in writing that her reassignment was temporary and that she would be returned  to the DARE program in six months.    According to the suit, she was removed from the DARE program instead and  assigned to patrol duty, only to be told by a supervisor that fellow officers  would not back her on the street or respond to her radio calls for help.    Named as defendants were the city of Simi Valley; Miller; Bender, and Officers  Michael Brewer, Rex Jones, Gary Collins, Ron Lompart, John St. Laurent and Glen  Peterson.

The program's objectives  include combating conflicts with Indians, land conflicts, the  drug traffic, smuggling, and illegal mining. Since repression of  those crimes is the exclusive duty of the Federal Police, that  force's leadership is seeking external funds.    The Amazon Region is currently a genuine open border,  according to Superintendent Mauro Sposito, because the PF's  activity in the region is totally impaired by the lack of a  surveillance, inspection, and monitoring system. For that  reason, the superintendent points out, agents are being trained  to work with experts from the Ministry of Communications in  operating mobile radio stations that can trace conversations  taking place in the region's isolated locations between the  Colombian and Bolivian drug cartels.    The Federal Police are aware that the Amazon Region is  currently the gateway through which drugs enter Brazil. The fact  is that since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1990, Brazil has  become the preferred route for traffickers who once used the  ""Caribbean route."" The lack of suitable equipment puts the PF at  a disadvantage, and seizures do not exceed 5 percent of the  total volume moving through the country. Sposito points out that  in a survey by Interpol, it is estimated that the drug  traffickers have annual revenues of $500 billion just from the  sale of cocaine all over the world.    Because of the high prices generated by cocaine, the product  has created a real chain of crime all around it, the  superintendent explains. It is money from drug trafficking that  finances kidnappings, auto thefts, smuggling, and even bank  holdups. On that subject, the Federal Police draw a parallel by  emphasizing that when an operation to repress key points in the  drug traffic is intensified, the response by the gangs is almost  immediate in the form of an increased number of bank holdups.  ""All one need do is remember that case in Rio de Janeiro where a  joint operation was mounted by the PF and the Army. News of  those operations and two raids by the Army in one of the  shantytowns harmed the drug traffic, and two banks were held up  right after that.""    Federal Police officials say that the PF now has a wealth of  information and maps concerning the activity of drug traffickers  in the Amazon Region and even of illegal gold mines and other  mines.    Tracking Crime    Mapping work has made it possible to identify operators of  illegal mines who join with drug traffickers to invade Indian  lands. Once the Indians are evicted, both sides profit from the  mining of minerals and the construction of clandestine landing  strips. Approximately 90 percent of the gold produced in Brazil  is smuggled out.    Pro-Amazon Region: By implementing the project scheduled for  the start of 1994, Federal Police hope to reduce those crime  levels considerably. The project calls for opening 54 police  stations in the region over the next four years, hiring new  agents, and providing the units with suitable equipment, as well  as cooperating with international scientific communities in the  fields of chemistry, biochemistry, botany, and animal husbandry.  Beginning in January, the Advanced Training, Study, and Research  Center in Manaus will receive 160 agents for training.    To speed up and debureaucratize its activities, the PF is  going to divide the Amazon Region into three sections. One of  the operational centers--in Manaus--will cover the states of  Amazonas and Roraima.

Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police  Administration, said that from 1990 through 1993, police here  seized a total of 1,092 kilograms of heroin and 3,566 kilograms  of amphetamines worth a combined street value of billions of  U.S. dollars. ``Without the police crackdown, those drugs would  have been circulated either in Taiwan or re-exported to other  countries,'' he said.    The U.S. State Department submitted the 1993 [as received]  International Narcotics Control Strategy Report to Congress  earlier in the month, accusing Taiwan of allowing the production  of illicit amphetamines and of increasingly playing a role in  the laundering of drug money.    According to the report, Taiwan has become an important  Southeast Asian transit center for heroin. It said movement of  the drugs is difficult to detect because of Taiwan's heavy  merchant marine traffic.    Wang Chun, director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation,  admitted that more efforts need to be taken in the fight against  drug smuggling and more money budgeted for the purpose. Only  NT$2.8 million [new Taiwan dollars] (US$106,060) is used by  Taiwan police to combat drug trafficking each year, as compared  with US$12 billion appropriated by the United States.    He also said Taiwan needs to change the law that treats drug  addicts as criminals rather than as patients so that they can  get help to kick their habits.    Local police seized an average of three or four kilograms of  drugs each year before 1989. But the figure rose to 154  kilograms in 1991 and a stunning 810 kilograms in 1993.    Police in the central Taiwan County of Chiayi in a raid on  May 11 [date as received] seized 336 kilograms of high-grade  heroin, prompting Premier Lien Chan to announce a nationwide  campaign against drug smuggling.

By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      An off-duty Los Angeles police officer was seriously wounded and one of her  four alleged assailants was killed in a shoot-out early Saturday outside the  officer's Santa Clarita home, authorities said.    Officer Stacy Lim, 27, was in guarded condition at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial  Hospital hours after she underwent emergency surgery for a bullet that tore  through her chest and back, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Joaquin  Herran.    Police said the two-year Police Department veteran was accosted by two young  men and two teen-age girls when she arrived home at 1:40 a.m. Authorities  speculated that the four wanted to take Lim's blue late-model Ford Bronco and  purse, but didn't realize she was a police officer.    Arvin Mani, 20, and the two teen-age girls were arrested on suspicion of  attempted murder.    Details of what happened after Lim arrived in front of her neatly landscaped,  modest stucco house remained sketchy. But at some point, Lim and Joel Garcia  Valenzuela, 16, started shooting at each other at a distance of three feet,  said Deputy George Ducoulombier. Awakened from their sleep, neighbors on Nadal  Street in Canyon Country said they heard numerous shots being fired rapidly.    When deputies arrived, Valenzuela -- whose last known address is in Los Angeles  -- was dead, sprawled on the street behind Lim's Bronco. A .357 magnum handgun  lay next to his body. Neighbors gawked at the shirtless body, which was not  covered until several hours later.    Lim was found lying in her driveway, next to the front of the Bronco. An  ambulance escorted by three squad cars took her to the hospital.    After the shooting, two suspects -- Mani and a 14-year-old girl -- fled in a  car, authorities said. Mani and the teen-ager were arrested about 6 a.m. in the  Highland Park area.    The third suspect, a 13-year-old girl, ran down the street after the shooting  and hid behind some bushes. She was found by deputies, who were searching  nearby yards.    ""She seemed calm. She wasn't even crying,"" said a teen-age boy who lives on  Nadal Street. ""It was as if nothing had happened.""    Police believe Lim's attackers followed her home, but police said they do not  know when they began trailing her. Lim, a patrol officer at the Police  Department's Northeast Division, had not worked Friday, but stopped off at the  station that night after a softball game before heading home.    ""It's very unusual to have people from Los Angeles, especially at this age, out  here in this area,"" Sgt. Herran said. ""Why did they pick her? We don't have any  answers yet.    ""There is nothing to indicate they knew she was a police officer,"" Herran said.  ""I think they were surprised she had a gun.""    After the shooting, dozens of sheriff's officials, detectives and officers  descended upon the crime scene, which was cordoned off with yellow tape. Los  Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, three deputy chiefs, various commanders  and at least one police commissioner surveyed the scene and went to the  hospital.    Lim originally was listed in critical condition on Saturday. Her condition was  later upgraded to guarded.    An officer at the Northeast Division, who declined to give his name, said the  watch commander could not talk to the press.

""It's very unusual to have people from Los Angeles, especially at this age, out  here in this area,"" Sgt. Herran said. ""Why did they pick her? We don't have any  answers yet.    ""There is nothing to indicate they knew she was a police officer,"" Herran said.  ""I think they were surprised she had a gun.""    After the shooting, dozens of sheriff's officials, detectives and officers  descended upon the crime scene, which was cordoned off with yellow tape. Los  Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, three deputy chiefs, various commanders  and at least one police commissioner surveyed the scene and went to the  hospital.    Lim originally was listed in critical condition on Saturday. Her condition was  later upgraded to guarded.    An officer at the Northeast Division, who declined to give his name, said the  watch commander could not talk to the press.    ""He has tears in his eyes,"" the officer said. ""He is so emotional.""

Police caught the Chinese group in a sweep after they landed  in Susami aboard several small boats early Thursday and tried to  make their way to Osaka and Nagoya in 13 cars rented by the  others, they said. The 16 Chinese accomplices had their  passports, police said.    The 91 illegal immigrants, including 12 women, reportedly  told police that some of them had come from China while others  came from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.    Police suspect that a syndicate organization is behind the  massive human smuggling scheme. Police had been tipped off by  local residents who reported seeing the cars with Osaka and  Nagoya plates.    There were two similar incidents of illegal entry by Chinese  reported in the same vicinity in late 1993. Nearly 100 Chinese  attempted to enter the country in November through a tiny port  some 10 kilometers northwest of Susami but were detained by  police.    Meanwhile, police in Nagoya arrested Karmann Tang, 26, from  Hong Kong, on suspicion of preparing to help the illegal  immigrants. Tang had 24 Shinkansen bullet trains tickets from  Nagoya to Tokyo, police said.    He was quoted as saying that he was to meet the Chinese in  Nagoya and send them to Tokyo and that his company had gone to  ""a remote beach"" to pick up the immigrants.    Two men who appeared to be Chinese rented two trucks at a  shop in Nagoya on Monday and police are investigating their  connection with the case, they said.    Of the 91 Chinese who tried to enter Japan, the oldest is a  39-year-old man and the youngest a 16-year-old girl, they said.  The other 16 people arrested in Wakayama are between 22 and 36  years old, and had passports from Singapore or Hong Kong, they  said.     "

A responsible security source in the Interior Ministry said  today that while the Criminal Investigation Police in the Asyut  security directorate were setting up ambushes in the 'Arab  Mutayr in the al-Badari district of the Asyut Governorate early  this morning, fugitive terrorist 'Ali 'Abd-al-Rahman Salamah  opened fire at the police and attempted to escape.

IT'S ALL PART OF THE 1990 POLICE SUMMER GAMES.      By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN CLEMENTE      Police officer Vern McGarry was in hot pursuit.    Scanning the surf with an expert eye trained from years on the beach, the  15-year veteran of the San Clemente Police Department knew that he had one last  chance to make some points.    So with a series of quick kicks and thrusts, McGarry turned toward the rising  wall of water, spun swiftly around and dug in for an exhilarating ride aboard  his surfboard to the shore.    ""I had a few good runs,"" McGarry, 36, said as he dropped his red, white and  blue surfboard into the sand on Tuesday morning. ""I felt really good. This is  my home break.""    In fact, that last-minute ride -- and a definite home break advantage -- helped  McGarry take first place in his preliminary heat to go on to a second day of  surfing competition today at Cotton's Point, just north of the San Onofre  Nuclear Power Station.    McGarry was one of 84 sworn law enforcement representatives who came from all  over the state to compete in the surfing contest, part of a 44-event  Olympic-style athletic competition sponsored by the California Police Athletic  Federation.    The 43 other events range from track and field, gymnastics and softball to  target shooting, K-9 training and archery, and will be held next week in  Sacramento, the host city for the 1990 Police Summer Games.    The games, which are expected to draw more than 6,000 contestants this year,  are considered by organizers to be one of the largest amateur athletic  competitions in the world.    The 24-year-old athletic competition was established to give officers from  various departments -- including state park rangers, city cops, state  university patrol officers and corrections officers -- a chance to test their  skills against one another.    ""It gives these guys impetus to stay in shape,"" said Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department Lt. Ed Hitchcock, an organizer of the annual Summer Games.  ""That is really the reason why we do this.""    The San Clemente Police Department hosted the surfing event because -- as one  organizer put it -- ""the surf is not really rolling in Sacramento this time of  year.""    Many of the wave-riding officers said they look forward to trading their  holsters for surfboard leashes once a year so that they can keep up with the  sport many have pursued feverishly since they were teen-agers.    Although some came from as far away as Santa Cruz and Capitola to try their  luck on the South County waves, most competitors hailed from Southern  California.    The largest teams were from the Orange and Los Angeles County Sheriff's  departments and the Los Angeles Police Department.    Many surfer cops said they once considered a career in surfing. Some have even  been successful in competition outside the law enforcement event.    Take Orange County Sheriff's Deputy James Moore, a 23-year-old former member of  World Surfing Assn., for instance. He said he started competing in surfing  contests when he was 8 years old.    But Moore quit full-time surfing two years ago and traded his wet suit for a  uniform last year, lured by the steady income.    ""I had to get my priorities straight,"" he said. ""Competitive surfing is a long  and hard road. It takes everything you got.""    Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Russell said he gave up his job representing  surfboard and wet suit companies seven years ago to join law enforcement. He  has not regretted that decision, although he said he doesn't get out into the  water as much as he likes.    His strategy in the police competition, he said, was to find only the big waves  and pass on the small waves.    ""You move better when you have a lot of face to work with,"" he said, referring  to the section of the wave that has yet to become white water. ""Here, every  point counts.""    The surfers received points for their choice of waves, the ability to stand up,  and the moves they made once riding the swell toward shore, said Sam Conroy,  San Clemente High School surf team coach, who headed the judging team.    The surfers who finished in the top three of their preliminary rounds moved on  to tougher competition today. Surfers will earn gold, silver and bronze medals  in six categories.    Conroy said he was impressed by the level of expertise of the surfers,  considering that many of them were between 30 and 40.    ""This is a sport where you're king at 18 and you're ancient at 30,"" Conroy  said. ""For their age group, they are doing really well.""    Not every successful surfer counted on his intimate knowledge of the way the  waves break at Cotton's Point (shown on maps as San Mateo Point).    Wearing a white jersey over his wet suit, West Covina Detective Dave Long, 32,  expertly zigzagged across the face of the waves, executing sharp turns that  seemed to defy gravity.    Still, he added quickly, the event wasn't so much a time for him to show off  his surfing prowess as it was an opportunity to spend a day at the beach with  other police officers.    ""We come out and have a blast,"" said Long, who won a gold medal last year, when  the event was held in Oxnard. ""I drag the wife and the kids out, and they hoot  and holler.

Police on Wednesday identified the shooting victim as Augustine Mejia Lucero,  25, of Santa Ana. He died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head,  apparently by a handgun fired at close range, Santa Ana Police spokeswoman  Maureen Haacker said.

Officers from the South East Regional Crime Squad raided a property in Islington, north London, yesterday morning and discovered 'three people in the process of producing between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m in sterling notes'. Police said the find would probably prove to be the largest counterfeiting operation discovered in the UK. Searches of the property, said to contain 'a complete printing works' and of the home addresses of four men arrested on the scene had revealed notes worth 'tens of millions of pounds'. Plates and negatives for Pounds 50, Pounds 20 and Pounds 10 notes were seized and the police also found sheets of Romanian, Spanish, Irish and Nigerian currency as well as plates and negatives for Dollars 50 bills.

SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The San Diego police union sharply criticized the district attorney's office  Thursday for bringing kidnaping and robbery charges against two downtown  patrolmen and accused the prosecutor's office of abandoning ""logic, reason and  fairness"" in evaluating allegations of officer misconduct.    In a strongly worded statement, the board of directors of the Police Officers  Assn., which represents 1,800 officers on the San Diego Police Department,  contended that the recent trial of officers Lloyd J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P.  Schaaf shows that the district attorney is holding police officers to an  unreasonable standard.    Hoff and Schaaf, with a combined 13 years of police service, were acquitted  Wednesday on felony charges of kidnaping and robbing illegal aliens in the  downtown district.    ""Those close to the investigation concerning Officers Schaaf and Hoff believe  the not-guilty verdict was the just one,"" the POA said. ""It is another in a  long line of cases where the jury system has exonerated police officers who  were prosecuted on flimsy or non-existent evidence by our San Diego district  attorney.""    The police union also noted that the district attorney declines to prosecute  about 1,000 cases against accused felons each year. At the same time, the POA  said, the district attorney imposes a higher standard when deciding whether to  prosecute police officers.    ""It is the prevailing belief of the police officers of the city of San Diego  that our district attorney has abandoned logic, reason and fairness in  evaluating allegations against police officers,"" the POA said.    Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller called the POA's allegations ""irresponsible.""    ""They know very well that that case was investigated by the Internal Affairs  unit of the San Diego Police Department and then submitted to us with a  recommendation for prosecution,"" he said of the Hoff and Schaaf matter.    ""We realized it was a tough case. But we had sufficient evidence, and that's  demonstrated by the fact the jury was out for two days.

""We don't want dirty cops around here,"" he said. ""If that's  happening, let's get rid of them.""    But he said the district attorney seems to be bending to political and media  pressures in aggressively pursuing criminal charges against police officers,  more so than in cases against others.    ""Our contention is that they should look at these cases the way they do all of  them,"" he said.    He added that the POA will closely monitor how the Police Department completes  its administrative review of Hoff and Schaaf. Even though the officers were  found not guilty in Superior Court, the Police Department is still initiating  its own investigation to determine whether Hoff and Schaaf should be  disciplined or fired. The officers are now on voluntary, unpaid leave.    Hoff, a four-year police veteran, hopes to return to duty, and, if he is  blocked, McMillan said, the POA will defend him in an effort to be reinstated.

Schaaf, meanwhile, has said he is so disappointed in the way the Police  Department treated him and Hoff that he has no plans to continue his career in  law enforcement after nine years as a police officer.

In contradiction to an earlier  testimony by head of Central Command Dani Yatom regarding the  stationing of a policeman at the Cave of Patriarchs, commander  of the Judaea District Police Moshe Mizrahi testified there was  no standing order for a police officer to be present at the  site.

""Eli Moyal, the Border Police duty officer the night before  the massacre, answered questions on why three Border Police  failed to reach their posts.

He intends to meet  with the Central Command general to draft an order that would be  acceptable to both the Army and police, but until then, the  present orders would remain in force. Peled complained that a  small force of police operating in the territories, and said  that, in fact, police work boiled down to giving an appearance  of law, instead of law enforcement. For instance, in Hebron  there was one patrol of eight policemen -- the bare minimum for  doing the work -- but this was better than in Yattah, where  there were no policemen at all, and law was not enforced.""

By URSULA WILJANEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      An explosion of gang violence in northeast Los Angeles during August has  boosted the area's death total to 10 for the month, a record, police said.    The unprecedented number of violent deaths has so taxed the Northeast  Division's six-detective homicide squad that Detective Ron Whitt, who heads the  unit, turned over the investigation of the most recent killing to detectives in  the Police Department's downtown Robbery Homicide Division.    ""We've been very strapped,"" Lt. Rob Watters said. The August slaying count --  higher than any previous month in the division's history -- brought the total  for the year to 32 as of Aug. 28. Last year at this time, 24 people had been  slain.    The rash of violence has left the detectives spread so thin that they have had  to put some investigations on hold to look into more recent killings.    Suspects have been arrested in three of the month's slayings, and police have  solid leads in two others, Whitt said. All five of those cases were  gang-related, police said. A sixth case, a murder-suicide, is closed.    Gang-related killings are up 150% from this time last year, Watters said, from  6 to 15.    Four of this month's slayings involved confrontations between rival gang  members, police said. Another involved a 15-year-old gang member accused of  stabbing a woman to death in her residence, Whitt said. Two others involved  non-gang members who were attacked by men who might have been gang members,  police said.    In July there were two killings in the northeast area, and both were  gang-related, Whitt said.    Last weekend, two people were stabbed to death in separate incidents, police  said. Two juveniles have been charged in Saturday's stabbing of a 48-year-old  Eagle Rock woman in her house, Deputy Dist. Atty. Teresa Farrell said.    Early Saturday, a 15-year-old youth allegedly entered Doneice Taylor's house  through an unlocked side door, took a butcher knife from the kitchen and  stabbed her several times, Whitt said.    Then the youth called his 12-year-old friend into the house and the two took  Taylor's car keys from her purse and drove away in her car, Whitt said.    Police officers on patrol saw the car, a gray Nissan 280Z, without its lights  on, Whitt said. He said the car ran a stop sign at Avenue 45 and Ellenwood  Drive at about 1:30 a.m. and police chased it about three miles eastbound on  the Ventura Freeway.    The Nissan broke down near Figueroa Street. The officers arrested the youths  for evading police, checked the car's registration and sent other officers to  the owner's house to see if the car had been stolen, Whitt said.    Police arrived at Taylor's house in the 4000 block of West Avenue 43 to find  her dead on the couch, Whitt said.    The two youths, who told police they were gang members, were charged with  first-degree murder, grand theft of an auto, conspiracy to commit grand theft  of an auto and conspiracy to commit robbery, Farrell said. Because police say  conspiracy was involved in the killing, both youths were held responsible, she  said.    The youths confessed to killing Taylor and stealing her car, Whitt said. They  are being held in Eastlake Juvenile Hall.    In the other stabbing death, police found the body of a Latino man in his early  30s lying face down in dirt and brush between Sycamore Park and the Pasadena  Freeway, said Detective William Gailey of the Police Department's Robbery  Homicide Division.    Police have not identified the body, which was found by a passerby about 1 p.m.  Monday, Gailey said. The victim, who had been stabbed several times in the  upper torso, was about 5 feet, 5 inches tall, weighed about 135 pounds, had a  mustache and was missing an upper front tooth, Gailey said.    The victim was wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt bearing the name of the  Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., Gailey said.    Police have no suspects in the case, which Whitt turned over to Gailey because  Whitt's homicide team was busy with other investigations, Whitt said.    Watters said that if the murder rate does not go down, the unit will ask the  division's head of detectives to add another two-person team.    ""We're going to need another team,"" Watters said. ""If this keeps up, we  obviously cannot do it.""    The division has three detectives assigned to the Community Resources Against  Street Hoodlums (CRASH) unit, which deals with gangs, Whitt said.    Court appearances also take detectives' time away from murder investigations,  he said. Homicide and CRASH detectives frequently are tied up with murder cases  going through the courts, he said.    ""You spend weeks in court on a murder because it's so involved,"" Whitt said. He  said that most of the Police Department's bureaus were short-staffed, so the  chances of getting more homicide detectives for the Northeast Division --  usually one of the city's less violent police bureaus -- are slim.    But because this month's level of violence is not typical for the Northeast  Division, Whitt said he is optimistic that things will return to normal soon.

THEY ARE EAGERLY  SOUGHT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.      By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HUNTINGTON BEACH      Michael Kim and Leonard Avila are part of an evolving dream at Golden West  College.    The two young rookies graduated, with 29 others, from the college's latest  Police Academy class last week. They now are on the threshold of becoming  full-time police officers.    ""This is something I've wanted since I was a kid growing up in South Korea,""  said Kim, 25.    ""Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps,"" added Avila, 23, ""I've wanted to be  a police officer. This project really helped me.""    Avila was referring to Project AERO, an 18-month-old program at the community  college aimed at helping minorities qualify for, and then actually graduate  from, the academy.    AERO stands for Advanced Ethnic Representation and Opportunities. The project  helps young minority students who want to be officers fulfill that dream. And  AERO itself is somewhat of a dream come true, college officials said.    Golden West College President Judith Valles said AERO spun off from the hopes  and dreams of police chiefs she spoke with shortly after she took over at the  community college two years ago.    What she found, she said, is that most police departments are in great need of  minority officers. The chiefs, as well as people in the minority communities,  asked Valles for help, which is how AERO started.    ""As the ethnic fabric of our community changes, it is critical to reflect this  multiculturalism in our police departments,"" Valles said. ""Project AERO, which  has received state and national recognition for its aggressive and innovative  program, has already made a major difference in bridging cultural  understanding.""    Art Delgado, a heavyset, cheerful, booming-voiced former Costa Mesa police  officer, is the project's director. In explaining what the program is, he  starts by telling what the program is not:    ""It's not a quota-hire thing. And it's not a lowering of standards of the  Police Academy. What we do is get these candidates prepared so that they can  qualify for the academy and then complete the courses.""    Delgado said many minority candidates for the academy have academic problems,  including difficulties in mastering English.    ""I tell these kids: 'I want to help you realize your dream. But in order to  help you, you've got to be prepared.' I tell them that we have this program  that will enable them to meet the standards of all the police departments,"" he  said.    Delgado said the college's Assessment Center gives participants academic tests  that indicate whether remedial education is needed.    ""So then these kids take courses,"" he said, ""here at the college, until they're  ready, until they're prepared, and then they apply for Police Academy.""    He added that many of the college courses taken by the students count toward an  associate of arts degree.    It is not necessary to get an AA degree to graduate from the academy, but  Delgado said he urges all students to aim for a college degree.    ""The more education you have, the more you can advance as a police officer,"" he  noted.    In addition to helping minorities with academic problems, AERO helps students  financially. ""It costs a total of about $2,500 for a kid to get through Police  Academy,"" Delgado said. ""That includes the fees and the cost of such things as  uniforms, batons and books. So what we do is try to get scholarships for some  of these kids. We also get students who have already graduated to donate their  uniforms.""    Kim and Avila, both products of the current graduating class, said in recent  interviews that the biggest help they got from Project AERO was financial  support.    ""I needed financial help, and this project helped me with that,"" said Avila,  who lives in Walnut Grove. ""Project AERO most definitely made the difference. .  . . It's kind of like they set my whole career up. Because without AERO, I  never would have gone through the academy.""    Kim added that ""without AERO, I never would have been able to start this  (Police Academy) program.""    Kim received AERO financial aid and a scholarship funded by the Korean  community in Orange County.    Delgado said various ethnic groups also help by providing scholarships.    ""The Korean community is so supportive of this program that it gives Project  AERO a check for $2,500 for every Korean who qualifies for admission to this  academy,"" he said. ""The Hispanic community also is giving us good financial  support for Hispanics who qualify for the Police Academy.""    Graduates of the 18-week academy course usually are quickly hired by police  departments all over Southern California. Kim and Avila are on the verge of  being hired by the police department of the Los Angeles Rapid Transit District,  Delgado said.    Overall career opportunities are good, he added, and police pay is better than  ever: ""Starting salary for these new police officers ranges from $28,000 to  $32,000 a year, and that's good pay for a young man.""    College officials said Project AERO has so far placed about 40 of its academy  graduates with California police departments.    ""The communities are the big winner in this,"" Delgado said. ""You just can't  imagine how much it helps a police department to have these officers working  with people from their own ethnic community.    ""I'll give you an example,"" he said. ""Last January, one of our Project AERO  Korean graduates was hired by the Garden Grove Police Department. When he was  hired, the big Korean community in that city wanted to have a banquet for this  new officer. . . .    ""This kid, in his new police uniform, came into that room and started talking  to all those people in Korean. And they went wild. They started bowing to each  other and smiling and showing an appreciation you can't imagine. It really  meant a lot to the people of this community to see one of their own in a police  uniform.    ""Believe me,"" Delgado said, ""it also means a lot to police work. Police get  better cooperation from the various (ethnic) communities when the communities  see one of their own working with the police. They have more confidence and  more trust, because the officer can communicate in their language and in their  culture.""

0," LA030389-0143   26013    March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 2; Column 1; Metro Desk      246 words      REX, NON-SEXIST POLICE DOG, SNIFFS OUT HIS MAN      By GEORGE FRANK      Santa Ana police dog Rex got his man Thursday. Or was it a woman?    The incident began about 9 a.m. when a patrolman spotted a suspect from a Feb.  1 robbery driving outside a check-cashing store. The suspect slowly pulled over  and stopped. Suddenly, he jumped from the car and ran, disappearing in the back  yards of homes along the 2300 block of South Olive Street.    Maureen Thomas, a Santa Ana Police Department spokesperson, said the suspect  ran to his home at 2306 S. Olive St.    Officers called for police dogs, but the suspect slipped out the back of his  house and made his way through yards until he reached 2302 S. Olive. There he  broke a window and went in, where he was spotted by officers and their dogs.    Shortly afterwards, police spotted a person dressed in a blouse, skirt and  panty hose leave through the back door.    Officers might had been fooled for a second, but not Rex, who cornered the  suspect in a nearby back yard.    Police arrested Jaime R. Perez, 18. He was treated at UCI Medical Center in  Orange for bites on both arms.    Police booked Perez on suspicion of strong-arm robbery in the Feb. 1 incident.

Or was it a woman?    The incident began about 9 a.m. when a patrolman spotted a suspect from a Feb.  1 robbery driving outside a check-cashing store. The suspect slowly pulled over  and stopped. Suddenly, he jumped from the car and ran, disappearing in the back  yards of homes along the 2300 block of South Olive Street.    Maureen Thomas, a Santa Ana Police Department spokesperson, said the suspect  ran to his home at 2306 S. Olive St.    Officers called for police dogs, but the suspect slipped out the back of his  house and made his way through yards until he reached 2302 S. Olive. There he  broke a window and went in, where he was spotted by officers and their dogs.    Shortly afterwards, police spotted a person dressed in a blouse, skirt and  panty hose leave through the back door.    Officers might had been fooled for a second, but not Rex, who cornered the  suspect in a nearby back yard.    Police arrested Jaime R. Perez, 18.

The police have  so far seized a little over 500 grams of heroin. The National  Criminal Police got on the trail of the gang upon being  contacted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S.  Customs.    Nigerian heroin has been smuggled via Finland to at least  the  United States and Germany, but additional Central European  countries were also mentioned in the preliminary hearing. The  activity has probably been continuing for at least a full year.    According to Criminal Commissioner Jaakko Sonck, it appears  that the heroin has not been sold in Finland.    Police have seized very pure white and brown heroin. Heroin  of this quality can still be cut before being sold to abusers.  In Finland the price for heroin on the street is from 2,000 to  5,000 markkas per gram.    Seven Nigerians residing in Finland have been arrested, and  four of these have been charged on suspicion of aggravated  narcotics violations.     "

Selin Valenzuela  Galdamez, 49, has been at large since 1992, when he was indicted  by the Swedish courts on charges of having financed many drug  shipments, including 40 kg of cocaine hidden in packages of  dried grapes.    Two other Chileans were sentenced in Sweden for the same  crime. The Chilean police reported that Valenzuela has been  involved in drug trafficking since the 1970's, but that his  arrest had not been possible because he was using a false name.    An Investigative Police officer said that Valenzuela is  undoubtedly the most wanted drug trafficker in the country  because of his link with international rings.    Valenzuela was arrested in the city of Villa Alemana on  charges of fraud against many companies for over 70 million  pesos, and not because of drug trafficking. [passage omitted]    The police also arrested two of Valenzuela's partners,  identified as Ruben Calderon and Raul Oyarsun. The police  reported that they were using their money to build a luxury inn  in the Fifth Region.     "

Detectives in Glendale and Los Angeles received information five months ago  that a Glendale gang was attempting to add bombs to their arsenal, authorities  said.

In a house  in the 1000 block of Harvard Road in Burbank, bomb squad officers found two  complete explosive devices, chemicals and materials that could have made  ""several other bombs,"" Meredith said.

Police moved into position outside the home of Chen  Zihua, sister of released political prisoner Chen Ziming, early  on Friday [27 May ] morning, hours after US President Bill  Clinton announced that he was severing the link between human  rights and MFN renewal. A police car and six uniformed officers  remained in position until 2 am, closely monitoring the family's  activities.    It was the first time Chen's family had been put under  surveillance since the National Peoples' Congress met in Beijing  in March. Chen was released two weeks ago on medical parole  after serving nearly five years of a 13-year sentence, in a move  seen as concession to the Clinton administration in order to win  MFN renewal. However, Chen was not allowed to return home and  was forced instead to leave Beijing with his wife and parents.  He is not expected to return until after the fifth anniversary  of the June 4 crackdown. [passage omitted]     "

Van der Merwe said the SAP's [South African Police]  assessment was that the levels would suffice only for about  7,000 stations -- 2,000 fewer than the Independent Electoral  Commission (IEC) is planning to set up.    Police are responsible for security at polling stations and  will be able to draw on members of the homeland security forces,  the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the National  Peacekeeping Force. But Van der Merwe said even the combined  forces would be able to handle only 7,000 polling stations.    All the necessary security arrangements had been made for  the  stations already identified by the IEC, although the commission  still had to identify where many of these would be situated.    ""We can attend to these problems, if we can agree on a  reasonable number,"" Van der Merwe said.    The number of security force members at each station would  vary depending on the security needs, but on average only five  security force members could be stationed permanently at each  station during voting.    Van der Merwe said outbreaks of violence could affect the  manpower requirements of the SAP. All available security force  members, numbering about 93,000, would be used for the election,  Van der Merwe said, though not all would be deployed at polling  stations.    Of concern was the morale of the security forces in TBVC  [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and some  homelands, where he said normal policing had all but collapsed,  placing additional strain on the SAP. ""We have taken care of  our commitments, but there are some problems on matters which we  are not responsible for.""    IEC members met police yesterday to review security  arrangements -- their first meeting since the failure of  negotiations with the Inkatha Freedom Party. IEC members have  also expressed concern about security requirements, despite the  additional call-up of citizen force members. Members were due  to report for duty on Friday and will be active until next  month, but it is understood that only a small proportion has  reported.     "

In all, eight people were injured and four vehicles were involved in the  chaotic event, which occurred near 1st and St. Louis streets and less than a  block from the the city's Hollenbeck Police Station.    Four men from the pickup, all of whom suffered moderate injuries, attempted to  run away from the final crash, police said, but they were quickly apprehended  by Hollenbeck officers who had heard the collision, rushed outside to  investigate and saw them fleeing.    The pickup's driver, Francisco Fonseca, 20, of Highland Park, was taken to  County-USC Medical Center with chest injuries.    He was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and felony hit and run  driving, according to Lars Oakander, a Los Angeles Police Department traffic  detective.    Police said the chain-reaction accident occurred about 2 p.m., moments after  the pickup collided with a car on St. Louis Street.    According to Oakander, the driver of the pickup sped away from the first  accident, in which there were no injuries. He headed south on St. Louis Street  and sped through a stop sign at the intersection of 1st Street.    In the intersection, the pickup slammed into a Ford Falcon, which struck a  middle-aged male pedestrian and crashed into a telephone pole. The pickup,  meanwhile, hit a Boyle Heights man and his 3-year-old daughter as they crossed  1st Street in a crosswalk. The pickup also struck a 1979 Ford Mustang before  coming to a stop.    Police said the man and his daughter, whose identities also were not available,  were both rushed to County-USC with serious injuries. The two were initially  trapped under the pickup, and were pulled out by bystanders.    The third pedestrian also was seriously injured and taken to County-USC,  authorities said.    The three other suspects in the pickup, and the driver of the Falcon, all  suffered moderate injuries, officials said.    The driver of the Mustang, Angelina Rodriguez, 25, was not hurt.    ""I just saw the truck come head up with me,"" Rodriguez recalled later. ""I heard  people screaming, it was coming pretty fast.""

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit  Kanchanakit did not identify their nationalities.    A one-ton bomb made from ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer  and C-4 explosive was found in mid-March in a six-wheel truck  that had been seized by police and parked in front of the  Lumphini police station since it was involved in a minor traffic  accident near the Israeli Embassy on March 11.

The suspect was  being held at Tanyong police station pending further  questioning, which would be jointly conducted by police and  military officers, he said.

But just hours after Operation Hammer ended its sweeps early Sunday, two young  men were killed -- suspected victims of gang violence.    Task force officers patrolled the central and eastern parts of the city and the  San Fernando Valley between about 6 p.m. and 3:30 a.m. on both weekend nights.    Of the 1,092 people arrested, 629 were gang members, police said. Saturday  night yielded 624 arrests, and 345 of the people belonged to gangs. On Friday,  officers arrested 468 people, 288 of them gang members.    Most of the suspects were arrested for investigation of misdemeanors, ranging  from drunk driving to possession of narcotics to curfew violations.    In addition, police seized 18 guns, 16 of them owned by gang members.    Gang-related violence later erupted in other parts of the city.    Nelson R. Alas, 15, was shot and killed in Hollywood on Sunday morning after he  exchanged words with several known gang members, Los Angeles Police Detective  Bill Humphry said. Alas, an admitted street gang member, was dead at the scene.    Another young man, who also associated with known gang members, was killed at  about the same time in the 25500 block of Marigold Avenue near Harbor City, Los  Angeles Police Sgt. Tony Rosa said.

But just hours after Operation Hammer ended its sweeps early Sunday, two young  men were killed -- suspected victims of gang violence.    Task force officers patrolled the central and eastern parts of the city and the  San Fernando Valley between about 6 p.m. and 3:30 a.m. on both weekend nights.    Of the 1,092 people arrested, 629 were gang members, police said. Saturday  night yielded 624 arrests, and 345 of the people belonged to gangs. On Friday,  officers arrested 468 people, 288 of them gang members.    Most of the suspects were arrested for investigation of misdemeanors, ranging  from drunk driving to possession of narcotics to curfew violations.    In addition, police seized 18 guns, 16 of them owned by gang members.    Gang-related violence later erupted in other parts of the city.    Nelson R. Alas, 15, was shot and killed in Hollywood on Sunday morning after he  exchanged words with several known gang members, Los Angeles Police Detective  Bill Humphry said. Alas, an admitted street gang member, was dead at the scene.    Another young man, who also associated with known gang members, was killed at  about the same time in the 25500 block of Marigold Avenue near Harbor City, Los  Angeles Police Sgt. Tony Rosa said. The victim's name was withheld.    No arrests have been made in either shooting.

Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi,  Guo Jinlong, Zi Cheng, Puqung, Zheng Ying, Gyamco, Baima Duoji,  Zhou Qishun -- leaders of the regional party committee, regional  people's congress, regional people's government, and regional  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference; TRPAPC Political Commissar Zhang Zhu and Commander  Tan Huasheng; as well as responsible comrades from the regional  party committee propaganda department, the regional cultural  department, and judicial, procuratorial, and public security  organs, took time off their busy schedule to watch the  performance. Other TRPAPC leaders and more than 1,000 armed  police officers and men stationed in Lhasa also watched the show.    The brilliant performance featured dances entitled: Emotions  of Parting, Ode to the Snow Lotus, On the Tea Delivery Path, and  Footsteps to the Police Camp, and other programs reflecting the  highland-based armed police officers and men's sensational  fighting spirit in taking a foothold on the borderland and  safeguarding Tibet's stability; their heroism in fearlessly  taking on dangers when fighting enemies; and harmonious  relations between the police and the people. In addition,  traditional folk cultural and art programs such as Sausage or  Shoe, Lovers Under the Moon, (Arxie), and A True Man of Flesh  and Blood, expressing the Tibetan nation's spiritual aspects,  natural conditions and social customs, and working life were  performed. Revolutionary songs such as Chairman Mao Zedong  Sends People Here and popular army songs such as Telling You My  Innermost Thoughts and Feelings, Devote My Deep Love to the  Great Party, Song of Praise for the Heroes, and The Long Great  Wall, added a passionate atmosphere to the performance. These  cultural and art programs were put together by the TRPAPC  political department's song and dance ensemble after two months  of rehearsal which formally began on 21 April.    After the show, Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, Guo Jinlong, and other  regional leaders walked onto the stage and cordially shook hands  with all performers and stage workers, and extended their  congratulations.

The three are among the 26 Chinese minors who fled the  bureau  en masse, of whom a total of 22 have been recaptured, police  said. The 26, including two girls, were taken into custody on  may 18 after they were found hiding in a warehouse in Fukuoka,  western Japan, with more than 100 adult Chinese, who were all  arrested on suspicion of illegally entering Japan.    The immigration officials also found 22,000 yen in cash  hidden in a cigarette box left on a shelf in one of the  detention center rooms. The officials suspect the money is what  is left of the 30,000 yen which one of the Chinese took when  fleeing the center.    A senior immigration official earlier said the escape began  Sunday evening when one of the Chinese asked for hot water.  When a bureau official opened the door, 10 Chinese minors  jumped on him and two other immigration officials, handcuffed  them and stole about 30,000 yen from a drawer before escaping,  the official said.

Police reported 46 murders in Inglewood last year, compared to the record 55  reported in 1980.    At the same time, the number of shootings involving Inglewood police officers  more than tripled, rising from three in 1988 to 11 in 1989 and pushing the city  into third place in Los Angeles County in the number of officer-involved  shootings. In part, police attributed that increase to gangs and drugs.    ""We are aggressively attacking gangs and drugs on our streets,"" Sgt. Harold  Moret said. ""We are going to have police officer-criminal conflicts.""

Four of the 11 officer-involved shootings in Inglewood resulted in deaths.    With the increase, Inglewood ranks behind only the much-larger Los Angeles  Police Department and county Sheriff's Department in officer-involved  shootings.

Other South Bay law-enforcement agencies with officer-involved shootings in  1989 were Gardena, Hawthorne, Los Angeles Airport and Redondo Beach, which had  one each.    Of the 46 murders in Inglewood in 1989, 22 were connected to gang or drug  activity, six to domestic disputes or child abuse, five to robberies, four to  fights that escalated to murder, and one to a sex crime. Murders in all  categories rose from 1988, with those in the gang and drug activity category  showing the largest increase. The remaining eight were classified as ""other"" or  ""unknown.""    The first murder of the year occurred when an Israeli cab driver who picked up  a fare at Los Angeles International Airport was shot by a passenger while  driving through Inglewood to Los Angeles. The final murder victim was a  19-year-old Los Angeles gang member whose car broke down in Inglewood, where he  was shot in the chest by rival gang members.    After Inglewood's record of 55 murders was set in 1980, the rest of the decade  fluctuated between 21 and 32 murders per year.

Department officials referred the case Feb. 1 to the FBI's Los Angeles field  office, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, the spokeswoman in Washington.    ""It's an open matter, which means we are looking at the case,"" she said.

Decision Will Be Made    The FBI's findings will be forwarded to the criminal section of the Justice  Department's Civil Rights Division, where a decision will be made whether to  forward the matter to a grand jury for possible indictments, she said.    Such violations, although rarely proven in court, are punishable by fines of as  much as $5,000 and prison terms of one year or longer.    A Police Department spokesman said Tuesday that the department welcomed the  FBI's probe and expressed confidence that the officers will be exonerated.    ""The officers were there with proper reason,"" Cmdr. William Booth said. ""They  had a search warrant, they were investigating a murder and they were attacked  by that family.""    The investigation stems from a raid in June, 1986, at the Larez home by members  of the Police Department's anti-gang unit, Community Resources Against Street  Hoodlums.    The raid occurred after CRASH officers said they had been tipped that one of  Larez's sons, Edward, was harboring a murder weapon. No gun was found, but  during the search, which was preceded at 7:01 a.m. with officers breaking  windows of the house as a diversion, Jessie Larez's nose was broken, his  daughter, Diane, was yanked to the floor by her hair and numerous household  items were smashed.      Dismissed Complaint    The family formally complained to the Police Department that excessive force  had been used, but the officers' supervisors concluded that the operation was  conducted within department policy and dismissed the complaint.    In October, 1988, after the Larezes had sued the Police Department, a federal  court jury in Los Angeles awarded the family $90,503 in punitive and actual  damages against the officers. Two months later, the same jury held Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates accountable for the officers' actions and ordered the chief to  personally pay more than $170,000 in punitive damages.    City officials have appealed the case.    The Larezes' attorney, Stephen Yagman, expressed confidence Tuesday that the  Justice Department would seek to prosecute the officers.

Flournoy and Beatty had been friends for 30 years, since college.    ""We are leaving no stone unturned,"" Mohrmann said. She refused to comment on  reports that the Brooklyn apartment of Flournoy's girlfriend has been searched.    Authorities said Flournoy wanted to decrease his child support payments to his  former wife, and hired attorney Harry Pollak for that purpose on the advice of  Beatty.    Pollak told police he appeared in state Supreme Court on Thursday morning with  Flournoy to move for reducing aid to his two teen-age children. The judge  denied the motion and an angry Flournoy assaulted Pollak in the elevator, then  walked away, the lawyer said.    Beatty was shot about 45 minutes later, police said.    Barbara Flournoy told authorities she had not heard from her ex-husband since  he disappeared. Police were said to have searched Flournoy's home and that of a  girlfriend.    Police have yet to find the murder weapon, Mohrmann said.    ""He seemed a strange person,"" Pollak reportedly said of Flournoy. ""His attitude  was not good. He punched me. Before yesterday's (Thursday's) thing, I told him  I was going to withdraw from the case.""    Beatty was running for a political committee chairmanship and authorities said  Flournoy appeared at his campaign headquarters several times.    Once an outspoken advocate for the black community and a political powerbroker,  Beatty left the Senate in 1982 for an unsuccessful congressional campaign that  included a scam to create the appearance of voter registration fraud by Major  R. Owens, his successful opponent.    Beatty was released from prison five years ago after serving a 31-month  sentence on tax-evasion, racketeering and election-fraud charges.

Vander Beatty, apparently in a rage  over losing a child support dispute.

Police in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat were ordered to try  to  stop people gathering in either Chana District or Hat Yai town.  A checkpoint will be set up at Don Yang intersection in  Pattani's Nong Chik District and at an adjoining area in  Narathiwat and Pattani Provinces.    Police fear Muslims will come to Hat Yai in their thousands  today to see off relatives leaving for Mecca on the annual  pilgrimage and take the opportunity to stage a protest. This  will make it difficult for police to differentiate between  protesters and relatives.    The four suspects, all Islamic teachers in Chana District,  were arrested in Chana District on Wednesday. They are Sa-ali or  Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or Mut Loman, Suroma or  Daman Leduwi, and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya Hamanapden. The four  have been charged with premeditated murder, rebellion and  possessing ammunition illegally in addition to the bombing  charges.    Region 9 Police chief Lt. Gen. [Lieutenant General] Michai  Nukunkit said police had acquired sufficient evidence to believe  the four and 20 others still at large took part in eight  different bomb attacks as follows:    -- An explosion at a bridge in Bacho District of  Narathiwat Province on May 13, 1991;    -- A bomb attack on a train in Chana District of Songkhla  Province on May 25, 1992;    -- A bomb explosion at Hat Yai Railway Station in Songkhla  Province on August 13, 1992, killing three people and wounding  75 others    -- A bomb attack on a marine police boat in Pattani  Province on December 6, 1993;    -- An explosion at Dechanuchit Bridge in Pattani on  December 25, 1993;    -- A bomb attack on a train in Songkhla's Chana District  on March 8, 1994;    -- An explosion in front of a bookstore in Hat Yai on  March 20, 1994, and    -- An explosion on the rail track in Na Mom Sub-district  in Songkhla Province on March 30, 1994.    Pol Lt. Gen. Michai claimed the four and their colleagues  were part of an organization with links to a foreign country.  The evidence against them was strong enough for police to be  certain they are not scapegoats, he said. He alleged the group  had also worked together with the Pattani United Liberation  Organization (PULO) with the objective of overthrowing the  Government.    Pol Lt. Gen. Michai does not believe the group is  responsible  for torching 36 southern schools on August 1 last year. Police  will continue to gather more evidence to nail the suspects, he  added.    Police Director General Prathn Santipraphop said in Bangkok  the four were certainly not ""scapegoats"" as police had acquired  hard evidence against them. Arrests of ""scapegoats"" might have  been widespread in the past, but not this time, he said.    Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wuthimathi said the strong evidence  meant the four suspects would face legal action despite being  Islamic teachers. The four, who studied religion abroad, will  be held for further legal processing in Songkhla. They will not  be granted bail until questioning is finalised. said Mr. Yuwat.    Asit Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of  Songkhla, said the people of Chana District did not believe the  four suspects were guilty as charged. They said it was not  possible for the four to have conducted such serious crimes, he  said.    Fourth Army Region Commander Lt. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya  said  he did not believe there would be an uprising over the arrest of  the four Islamic teachers because all wrongdoers must face legal  action. He said he had not received a detailed report of the  arrest but believed the police must have sufficient evidence to  take such action.    Rewat Ratchamukda, chairman of the Islamic Committee of  Narathiwat, said the arrest had sparked unrest among Muslim  people. Never before have Islamic teachers been suspected of  involvement in sabotage and there are doubts surrounding the  arrest of the four, he said. Mr. Rewat said he hoped  authorities would provide the suspects with due justice. He  asked fellow Muslims to cooperate with authorities to prevent  possible interference by a ""third hand"" in causing further  divisiveness in the country.     "

For four hours, the system was only partly functioning as Pacific Bell  engineers worked to repair computers at the Police Department's central  dispatch center in the basement of City Hall East, said Sgt. John Emerson of  the department's Communications Division. Officials reported that the problems  were fixed by 5:15 p.m.    Police said they were not aware of any emergency that went unanswered, but some  of the Police Department's stations reported an increase in calls as people  unable to get through to 911 operators called them directly.      Crashed a Second Time    Operators first discovered the phone lines out about 1 p.m., Emerson said.  Pacific Bell engineers restored parts of the system five minutes later, he  said, but at 3 p.m the system crashed again. A backup system also failed,  stopping all emergency calls for 45 minutes.    ""Our computer has gone belly-up all over the place,"" Emerson said. ""This has  never happened to us in the 911 system.""    Pacific Bell officials said that four out of five callers who were unable to  get through to 911 operators were getting a recorded message. They said the  shutdown was caused by a power failure in the computer's signaling mechanism.    A similar but shorter blackout occurred Feb. 16, 1987; that one-hour outage was  also blamed on a power failure.    Engineers once again succeeded in restoring the system's phone lines at 3:45,  Emerson said. But the system's computers were still not working by late  afternoon and the 25 operators at the dispatch center were forced to process  calls manually, Emerson said.    Computers normally display the address and phone number of the person making  the emergency call. With the computers down, the operators had to transfer  calls by hand. ""It's been so long since we've used this old (manual) system,""  Emerson said. ""We've just stepped back 15 years.""    Operators at the center receive about 200 calls per hour and relay them to  police and fire stations. Even after the phone lines were restored, operators  were having difficulty transfering the calls to Fire Department dispatchers,  Emerson said.    Emerson said that although people making calls to the emergency number might be  placed on hold for a few seconds longer, all calls were being answered by late  Saturday. ""If people aren't calling in too much, we'll be OK,"" he said.    At some Police Department stations, officers noticed an increase in emergency  calls.    ""To tell you the truth, no one officially told us why we were getting them,""  said Officer Tony Rivera of the Wilshire Station. ""A few people told us that  they called 911 and were put on hold for . . . (an) unbelievable time.""    Calls made to police at the Hollenbeck Station were relayed by radio to  dispatchers at City Hall, said Officer William Malin. ""Everything was screwed  up, but it worked all right,"" he said.    Police in the field monitored the radio transmissions so that units that were  close to the site of the emergency could let dispatchers know that they were  available, Malin said.    Twice during the afternoon, Police and Fire Department officials released the  numbers of nine police and fire stations to call instead of 911 in emergencies.    Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Fire Deparment, explained that  although by late afternoon calls were getting through to 911 dispatchers, the  alternative numbers were provided as a ""precautionary measure"" in case the  system broke down again.    Lt. Ron Young of the Northeast Station said it was fortunate that the breakdown  occurred Saturday afternoon, during a quiet part of the weekend.    ""Things really haven't gotten rolling yet. This is the calm before the storm on  the weekends,"" he said.    The computerized 911 system was installed in Los Angeles in 1983. Located four  floors below ground level, it is designed to withstand a major earthquake.    ""It's a very good system,"" said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lisa Zanville.    The majority of calls received by the system operators are not emergencies and  are transferred to radio dispatchers who assign patrol cars according to  priority and availability. In life-threatening situations, however, operators  immediately dispatch the caller's location to patrol cars.

Police forces in Schwyz Canton conducted a search  of a printing shop and arrested an individual in this case,  suspected of engaging in counterfeiting activities.    The cooperation between the Schwyz police and the judicial  authorities of Baden-Wurtemberg led to the search of a printing  shop in Schwyz on Friday [27 May]. This is where the  counterfeited dollars were manufactured. The value of the  seizure amounts to approximately 2.1 million Swiss francs.  Folco Galli, spokesperson of the Federal Department of Justice  and Police (FDJP), confirmed on Tuesday that the police of the  canton also arrested the alleged counterfeiter.    The Counterfeiter Resides in Switzerland    The counterfeiter, a foreign national living in Switzerland,  has been remanded in custody in the canton of Schwyz. Interpol  Germany and Switzerland worked together on this case. The FDJP  has not provided additional details.    Following a long investigation, German police seized $1.5  million in counterfeit notes in a Sindelfingen hotel last  Friday. The police also arrested seven persons: One Swiss  national, four Germans, and two Croats. Two persons, including  the Swiss national, were released on Tuesday, the Tubingen  police announced.    This case follows another counterfeit case of 1,000 Swiss  francs [SFr] banknotes seized on Friday in Aschaffenburg, in  Southern Germany. The value of the seized notes amounted to  SFr5 million. Dieter Schinzel, German member of the European  Parliament, was arrested at the time with six accomplices.    Two Genuine Banknotes Per Bundle    A small part of the seized banknotes, the first and last of  each bundle, was genuine, Mr. Galli disclosed on Tuesday.  However, Swiss authorities have not yet been officially  assigned this case, although there have been contacts between  the Munich police and the anticounterfeiting services in Bern.    Mr. Schinzel and the seven persons arrested on Friday have  been remanded in custody. Mr. Schinzel, a member of the  European Parliament since 1979, has been requested by his party  to temporarily renounce all his functions or elective mandates.  He is the president of the Social Democratic Party in Aachen.  He was not a candidate in the 12 June European elections.     "

""He was very surprised,"" Officer Stella Lara of the Los Angeles Police  Department's Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network said of the suspect's reaction  when told he was the first person to be arrested with the aid of the new  device. ""He thought of himself as a celebrity, because he was the first guy  that we caught that way.""    Lara said the suspect, Tom Sinanian, 21, of Lawndale, allegedly stole the red  1990 BMW 325i convertible from a car rental lot in the Hollywood area about  4:30 p.m. Saturday.    As soon as its owner reported it stolen, police activated the LoJack  transmitter that had recently been installed in the vehicle, the officer said,  and within minutes, a police patrol car picked up the unique signal on its  special LoJack receiver.    It took three patrol cars only 80 minutes to converge on the stolen car, which  officers pulled over at Arbor Vitae Street and La Cienega Boulevard near Los  Angeles International Airport, Lara said.    ""I picked up the signal southbound on (the) 405 (Freeway) at Century,"" the  officer said. ""At that time, I coordinated with two additional units and set up  a perimeter.""    Lara said the device allows officers to determine a stolen car's direction. She  said Officer Randy Fudala made the arrest.    Lara said the BMW's ignition had been punched out, but was otherwise undamaged.    Sinanian was booked at the Van Nuys jail on suspicion of grand theft auto. He  was taken to Van Nuys because that jail has an infirmary. Police said the  suspect apparently had a minor arm injury unrelated to his arrest or the auto  theft.    The $595 device, manufactured by Massachussetts-based LoJack Corp., is about  the size of a blackboard eraser, small enough to be hidden in any of 35 places  in a car.

THERE IS TALK OF A  VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN D. CLAYTON MAYES' ADMINISTRATION.      By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DOWNEY      These are exciting and trying times for rookie Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes.    The chief is overseeing the largest police buildup in the history of Downey.    But Mayes is also trying to put down a potential mutiny. A recent police union  survey indicates officer morale has dropped in the year he has been in charge.  And there has been talk of a vote of no confidence.    Mayes shrugs off the criticism as that of a few disgruntled employees who are  resisting his mission to enlarge and modernize the Police Department. There is  little time for foot-dragging because crime is increasing in this city of  91,000, Mayes said.    Through last September, aggravated assaults in Downey were up nearly 30% over  the same period last year, while car thefts increased 17.5%, according to  police statistics. The city has also been the scene of some high-profile crimes  of late, including a foiled robbery of a PACE store that left two officers  wounded last October.    ""I want to provide the most professional and highest level of police service to  the citizens of Downey,"" said Mayes, who had been a Los Angeles Police  Department captain for 10 years when he was hired by the Downey City Council  last December.    Proponents describe Mayes as a dedicated disciplinarian who is giving more  structure to the department. He is an energetic administrator who is known to  work 12-hour days.    ""He's done very well, especially when you consider he's bringing in a new style  of management,"" said longtime Councilman Robert G. Cormack.    But detractors say Mayes is an arrogant administrator who is poisoning the  department. He is the type of chief, for example, who is not shy about berating  a captain in front of subordinates, according to responses in the union survey.  Mayes has also drawn criticism for promoting the friends of a former councilman  who voted to appoint him chief.    ""The man is a 24-hour politician,"" said Sgt. Mike Hadley, president of the  Downey Police Officers Assn. ""He comes across as being insincere.""    The chief has enjoyed some successes during his brief tenure.    He has expanded the department's anti-gang unit from two to four field officers  to keep Downey's relatively minor gang problem in check. He has overhauled the  department's communications center at a cost of $360,000. He has tightened  security and accountability in the department's evidence room, where  confiscated drugs and other items are kept until trial.    Mayes has reactivated a police officer ""agent program,"" in which outstanding  officers receive 5.5% bonus pay annually. And he issued an order last week  enabling his officers to carry city-issued, 9-millimeter pistols. The pistols  are favored by some policemen because the weapons hold about twice as many  bullets as the automatics and revolvers that were standard in Downey.    But he also has suffered highly visible setbacks.    Mayes has been reprimanded by City Manager Gerald M. Caton for using police  officers and vans last summer to transport local high school students. The  students were classmates of Mayes' son, Brian.    Then last October, Caton and the City Council turned their backs on Mayes'  proposal for a police helicopter. Just two weeks later, Caton came back with a  $2.1-million proposal to add 27 officers to the city's 116-officer force. The  City Council unanimously approved the buildup, and 27 officers are being  recruited.    Mayes ended up playing a supporting role in what was the council's most  important law enforcement decision in years.    The chief said he doesn't take offense at rejection of his helicopter proposal.  And he says he always advocated hiring more officers as proposed by Caton. But  Mayes said he wanted to employ a helicopter and then use remaining funds for  officers.    ""I wanted the helicopter and additional officers,"" Mayes said. ""I still believe  in the helicopter.""    Dewey Clayton Mayes, 48, realized a dream when he was appointed police chief  last December. He applied for the position in 1987 but was passed over for  now-retired Police Chief Pete Stone, who had been with the Downey Police  Department for 29 years before becoming chief.    The Mayes family is well known in Downey, where they have lived for 20 years.  Mayes, who holds a master's degree in public administration from Pepperdine  University, was a member of the Board of Education of the Downey Unified School  District for 13 years and has been active in other civic affairs. His wife,  Carolyn, is a kindergarten teacher at a local school. They have two sons.    The chief is an unimposing, talkative man who enjoys operating in his hometown.  A local clothing store owner and his wife stopped by Mayes' table during a  recent lunch at a local restaurant. It was the perfect opportunity for Mayes to  offer one of his favorite compliments: ""Is this your daughter?"" he asked the  store owner.    But it is Mayes' community standing that made his appointment controversial  from the start.    Mayes is a friend of former Councilman Randall R. Barb, who was on the council  and was one of chief's biggest boosters at the time of his appointment. Some  critics said that friendship gave Mayes an unfair advantage.    Others thought it was not a good idea for a local politician with political  opponents to become police chief. Mayes was a school board member from 1974  until 1987, when he lost a reelection bid.    Some Downey police officers had grumbled privately about Mayes' appointment  from the start, but the honeymoon was definitely over last July.    It was a Sunday morning, and a group of students from Downey High were about to  set off for a leadership conference in Santa Barbara when a billing dispute  arose with the limousine company they hired.    Brian Mayes called his dad to work out a solution. Mayes placed two officers on  overtime and had them drive the students in two police vans to the conference.  Mayes said he loaned his son his personal car to avoid any appearance of a  conflict of interest.    Caton later reprimanded Mayes for exposing the city to unnecessary liability  and cost. The school district later reimbursed the Police Department $429 to  cover the overtime pay for the two officers and gasoline costs.    ""I was extremely unhappy with that incident,"" Caton said in a recent interview.  ""We, in fact, helped out the school district when the school district should  have helped themselves out.""    But Mayes said he saw it as a way to improve relations between the Police  Department and the city's youth. He saw it as an extension of the Drug Abuse  Resistance Education program, in which Downey officers lecture in local  classrooms to prevent future drug use. As a former board member, Mayes said he  feels committed to the district's goals.    But would Mayes have provided the service if his son were not involved?    ""I'm not sure,"" Mayes said. ""The relationship between the Downey Police  Department and the Downey school district is very unique. The school district  is a very integral part of our operation.""    That incident and the changing conditions in the Police Department set the  stage for the poll of the Downey Police Officers Assn. The decision to conduct  the survey was made after a member brought up the possibility of a vote of no  confidence against the chief at an association meeting, said Hadley, the police  association president.    ""We felt a vote of no confidence was too severe at the time,"" Hadley said last  week.    Sixty-four of the association's 103 members responded to the survey.    Overall, the officers rated department morale below average -- 2.7 on a scale  of 10. Fifty-one respondents blamed the chief. Seven supported him, and some  blamed the union for the morale problems.    They rated management credibility below average -- 3.4 on a scale of 10.    A handful of officers agreed to be interviewed about the school transportation  incident and other matters on the condition that they not be identified.    They said patrol officers have been working too much overtime, and they  resented the fact that the chief had kept two officers on duty for the  school-related activity.    They also said the new chief has created an atmosphere of distrust among the  rank and file as he builds his administration.    The officers faulted the chief for quickly promoting two friends of former  Councilman Barb. William J. McCulloch had been a sergeant for less than two  years when Mayes appointed him lieutenant last April. Charles S. Baptista had  been a sergeant for a little more than two years when he made lieutenant.    Mayes said his appointments had nothing to do with Barb. He said McCulloch and  Baptista were both rated ""well qualified"" in written and oral exams and  deserved to hold the positions.    The disgruntled officers also railed against what Mayes describes as his  hands-on style.    Mayes is the only Downey police chief to wear a uniform in recent years. He  wears a beeper and listens to a police scanner. He often responds to the scene  of a crime, even on weekends and sometimes with a council member or his wife or  son along for the ride.    The officers said he interferes with their work, which could be dangerous.    ""The guys in the department don't like to have a chief who's been sitting  behind a desk backing them up on a pursuit,"" said one officer.    But the chief, who became a policeman in 1964, bristles at the suggestion that  he would get in the way. Mayes said he maintains his shooting and other police  skills and could lend a helping hand in a bind. And he said he can manage the  department better if he sees how his officers work.    ""I'd put my field tactics up against any sergeant in this department,"" Mayes  said.    Mayes said the officers are just griping because he is running a tighter  operation than his predecessors.    Some officers resented the implication behind the chief's decision to spend  about $6,000 to install an alarm system and take other measures to improve  security of the department's evidence room. Mayes cut back the number of people  with access to keys from 18 to four and performed an audit of the money, drugs,  guns and other property stored there. Mayes said he is not one of the four.    The review turned up some missing property: About two grams of cocaine,  slightly over $100, a small amount of marijuana and one gun, Mayes said.    The chief attributes the missing property to poor accounting. He said it is his  job to tighten security in the shadow of recent skimming allegations that have  rocked the Sheriff's Department and other police agencies.    ""I don't think anybody stole anything,"" Mayes said. ""I think the integrity of  this department is outstanding."" A routine audit of the department's narcotics  unit is under way.    In addition to increasing security of the evidence room, sergeants are now  required to wear gun belts in the station. Mayes said another change, while  minor, also has rankled officers: his administrators are now enforcing a  long-dormant rule that prohibited more than two officers at a doughnut shop at  the same time.    ""Our resources are more stretched today than they were two years ago,"" Mayes  said. ""We need to be more mature. There's not as much available time.""    Mayes and Caton plan to meet with police association officials about the  concerns identified in the survey.    But Mayes appears to have the solid support of the City Council.    Even Councilwoman Diane P. Boggs, the only council member to vote against  Mayes' appointment, is standing behind the chief. ""I don't see anything that  can't be resolved,"" Boggs said. ""I think there is evidence of some morale  problems that need to be addressed. I expect they'll get with it and take care  of it in-house.""      Photo, Police Chief D.

THERE IS TALK OF A  VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN D. CLAYTON MAYES' ADMINISTRATION.      By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DOWNEY      These are exciting and trying times for rookie Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes.    The chief is overseeing the largest police buildup in the history of Downey.    But Mayes is also trying to put down a potential mutiny. A recent police union  survey indicates officer morale has dropped in the year he has been in charge.  And there has been talk of a vote of no confidence.    Mayes shrugs off the criticism as that of a few disgruntled employees who are  resisting his mission to enlarge and modernize the Police Department. There is  little time for foot-dragging because crime is increasing in this city of  91,000, Mayes said.    Through last September, aggravated assaults in Downey were up nearly 30% over  the same period last year, while car thefts increased 17.5%, according to  police statistics. The city has also been the scene of some high-profile crimes  of late, including a foiled robbery of a PACE store that left two officers  wounded last October.    ""I want to provide the most professional and highest level of police service to  the citizens of Downey,"" said Mayes, who had been a Los Angeles Police  Department captain for 10 years when he was hired by the Downey City Council  last December.    Proponents describe Mayes as a dedicated disciplinarian who is giving more  structure to the department. He is an energetic administrator who is known to  work 12-hour days.    ""He's done very well, especially when you consider he's bringing in a new style  of management,"" said longtime Councilman Robert G. Cormack.    But detractors say Mayes is an arrogant administrator who is poisoning the  department. He is the type of chief, for example, who is not shy about berating  a captain in front of subordinates, according to responses in the union survey.  Mayes has also drawn criticism for promoting the friends of a former councilman  who voted to appoint him chief.    ""The man is a 24-hour politician,"" said Sgt. Mike Hadley, president of the  Downey Police Officers Assn. ""He comes across as being insincere.""    The chief has enjoyed some successes during his brief tenure.    He has expanded the department's anti-gang unit from two to four field officers  to keep Downey's relatively minor gang problem in check. He has overhauled the  department's communications center at a cost of $360,000. He has tightened  security and accountability in the department's evidence room, where  confiscated drugs and other items are kept until trial.    Mayes has reactivated a police officer ""agent program,"" in which outstanding  officers receive 5.5% bonus pay annually. And he issued an order last week  enabling his officers to carry city-issued, 9-millimeter pistols. The pistols  are favored by some policemen because the weapons hold about twice as many  bullets as the automatics and revolvers that were standard in Downey.    But he also has suffered highly visible setbacks.    Mayes has been reprimanded by City Manager Gerald M. Caton for using police  officers and vans last summer to transport local high school students. The  students were classmates of Mayes' son, Brian.    Then last October, Caton and the City Council turned their backs on Mayes'  proposal for a police helicopter. Just two weeks later, Caton came back with a  $2.1-million proposal to add 27 officers to the city's 116-officer force. The  City Council unanimously approved the buildup, and 27 officers are being  recruited.    Mayes ended up playing a supporting role in what was the council's most  important law enforcement decision in years.    The chief said he doesn't take offense at rejection of his helicopter proposal.  And he says he always advocated hiring more officers as proposed by Caton. But  Mayes said he wanted to employ a helicopter and then use remaining funds for  officers.    ""I wanted the helicopter and additional officers,"" Mayes said. ""I still believe  in the helicopter.""    Dewey Clayton Mayes, 48, realized a dream when he was appointed police chief  last December. He applied for the position in 1987 but was passed over for  now-retired Police Chief Pete Stone, who had been with the Downey Police  Department for 29 years before becoming chief.    The Mayes family is well known in Downey, where they have lived for 20 years.  Mayes, who holds a master's degree in public administration from Pepperdine  University, was a member of the Board of Education of the Downey Unified School  District for 13 years and has been active in other civic affairs. His wife,  Carolyn, is a kindergarten teacher at a local school. They have two sons.    The chief is an unimposing, talkative man who enjoys operating in his hometown.  A local clothing store owner and his wife stopped by Mayes' table during a  recent lunch at a local restaurant. It was the perfect opportunity for Mayes to  offer one of his favorite compliments: ""Is this your daughter?"" he asked the  store owner.    But it is Mayes' community standing that made his appointment controversial  from the start.    Mayes is a friend of former Councilman Randall R. Barb, who was on the council  and was one of chief's biggest boosters at the time of his appointment. Some  critics said that friendship gave Mayes an unfair advantage.    Others thought it was not a good idea for a local politician with political  opponents to become police chief. Mayes was a school board member from 1974  until 1987, when he lost a reelection bid.    Some Downey police officers had grumbled privately about Mayes' appointment  from the start, but the honeymoon was definitely over last July.    It was a Sunday morning, and a group of students from Downey High were about to  set off for a leadership conference in Santa Barbara when a billing dispute  arose with the limousine company they hired.    Brian Mayes called his dad to work out a solution. Mayes placed two officers on  overtime and had them drive the students in two police vans to the conference.  Mayes said he loaned his son his personal car to avoid any appearance of a  conflict of interest.    Caton later reprimanded Mayes for exposing the city to unnecessary liability  and cost. The school district later reimbursed the Police Department $429 to  cover the overtime pay for the two officers and gasoline costs.    ""I was extremely unhappy with that incident,"" Caton said in a recent interview.  ""We, in fact, helped out the school district when the school district should  have helped themselves out.""    But Mayes said he saw it as a way to improve relations between the Police  Department and the city's youth. He saw it as an extension of the Drug Abuse  Resistance Education program, in which Downey officers lecture in local  classrooms to prevent future drug use. As a former board member, Mayes said he  feels committed to the district's goals.    But would Mayes have provided the service if his son were not involved?    ""I'm not sure,"" Mayes said. ""The relationship between the Downey Police  Department and the Downey school district is very unique. The school district  is a very integral part of our operation.""

It was one of the biggest single death tolls in the two-year  war between fundamentalists and the security forces.    The militants opened fire as police moved in to arrest them  late Tuesday at an apartment which had been under surveillance  in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' district, the ministry said.    Police fired back, killing seven of them, and discovered a  large amount of arms, explosives and remote control devices in  the apartment. None of the policemen was hurt.    The men were regarded as ""amongst the most dangerous  terrorists"" and belonged to militant groups based in the  southern province of Asyut, a fundamentalist hotbed, the  ministry said.    Four of them, named as Yasir 'Abd-al-Hakim, Yasir Zaki,  'Abd-al- Nabi Tayih and Tariq al-Qurashi, were suspected of  setting up these gangs.    Interior Minister General Hasan al-Alfi told Wednesday's  Al-Ahram newspaper that militants were ""preparing attacks in  different regions of the country.""    Tuesday's operation had been ""one of the most important  confrontations with the terrorists,"" he said.    The latest clash raised the death toll in the battle between  Islamic militants and the government to 291, including 105  policemen and 95 fundamentalists.     "

Police arrested  Norimichi Sugiyama, president of Traders Co. in Chiba  Prefecture, and Katsuhisa Iida, president of Tokyo-based  Hightech Co., on suspicion of violating the Foreign Exchange and  Foreign Trade Control Law by exporting image intensifier tubes  to Beijing.    The technology can be used for military satellites. Exports  are restricted by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls (Cocom), a Cold War-era watchdog set up by the  western allies to control exports of sensitive technology to the  East bloc.    The Cocom controls are to be abolished at the end of March.    The case was uncovered during a police probe of Traders Co.  and other trading houses which are suspected of being involved  in similar exports to North Korea, police sources said.    Police also arrested three executives of Yokohama Machinery  Trading Co., which was raided by police in January.

At approximately 1000 hours on 17 November, officials took  two helicopters to this area. But when they arrived, the  helicopters couldn't land and had to land about 10 km from the  area planted in poppies. The officials and reporters spent about  2 hours climbing the mountain to reach the poppy field located  along the side of the mountain. The poppies were in full bloom.    The Hmong tribesmen had interplanted the poppies with  bananas  and corn in order to conceal the poppies from officials  searching the area by helicopter. They had planted a short  variety of poppy that reaches a height of only 50 centimeters.  The officials all helped cut down the poppy plants. By 1600  hours, they had destroyed only about 30 rai of plants, valued  about 720,000 baht. That left at least 100 rai of poppies. But  the officials were all very tired and so they stopped for the  moment.    The commander of the Region 2 BPP said that he had received  good cooperation from all sides. Those Hmong tribesmen had  planted a large number of poppy plants. That area could be  called the ``Golden Triangle of the Northeast.'' When the  poppies mature, the opium sap is removed and sold to dealers who  then refine it into heroin. One rai of poppies can produce about  two kg of raw opium. It takes seven kg of raw opium to produce 1  kg of heroin. Or one kg of opium can produce enough heroin to  supply at least 20,000 heroin addicts.    Police Major General Pramot said that even though officials  managed to destroy a large number of poppy plants, he ordered  Police Colonel Suraphong Khemasingkhi, the superintendent of BPP  Unit 24, to mobilize a team of BPP officials and asked for the  cooperation of the units concerned to destroy the rest. No one  will be arrested this time, because that could damage relations  with these people. Officials will try to explain things to the  hill tribes and encourage them to plant other crops.     "

The documents were picked up by the PM-2  (Military Police Secret Service) squad five days before the raid  of Andrade's main accounting office in Bangu on 30 March. The  documents will be submitted today by the 34th Precinct to the  Civilian Police Internal Affairs Department.    All of the 183 ammunition requisition forms found at the  bodyguard's house are in the name of Castor de Andrade, his  bodyguards, numbers game kingpin Ailton Guimaraes -- who is also  known as Captain Guimaraes -- and even in the name of police  officer Idovan Ferreira, who is the head of the 4th Civilian  Police Regional Division in Araruama. Through the documents  seized, the police reached the conclusion that the arms smuggled  by Andrade's gang were coming by ship through Sepetiba,  Itacuruca, and Angra dos Reis.    Ironically, Captain Guimaraes' name has in the past already  been linked to arms smuggling. Early in the 1970's, Guimaraes  had to answer charges at a military police inquest on charges of  withholding smuggled goods. As a result of the inquest,  Guimaraes had to retire, and thus his life of crime began.    The chief of the 34th Police Precinct (Bangu), Carlos  Alberto  Campagnac, said the smuggled goods are not entering the city  through the international airport or through the port of Rio de  Janeiro. Castor de Andrade may be using remote beaches outside  the area of influence of the Federal Police. Campagnac, who is  also listed as having received bribes from Andrade, said:  ""Andrade's ships can navigate on the ocean. We are thus  looking into his fleet of ships.""    According to police, because the bribes demanded by federal  agents for the release of the arms ""are high,"" Andrade has been  using his own ships to transport ammunition and arms imported  from the United States and Israel. According to a Federal  Revenue Secretariat [SRF] source, ""there is no way to stop  smuggling in the port of Sepetiba and the surrounding area.""  The SRF source added that there is not even enough manpower to  discharge its 60 tasks. The Federal Police reported that its  function at the port of Sepetiba is just to check passengers.    In addition to the documents found at Maganinho's house,  which is located at 771 of Doze de Fevereiro St., the police  also seized a sizable amount of ammunition and imported weapons  -- such as a Smith and Wesson revolver -- plates for  identification cards, licenses and CPF's [Individual Tax Payers  Registers], and even Point Blank bulletproof vests manufactured  in the United States.    Judge Marcos Antonio Bakker of the Second Bangu District has  already issued an arrest warrant against Maganinho, who remains  at large. Campagnac reported that the items seized at  Maganinho's house will be examined by experts, along with the  weapons confiscated at Andrade's headquarters -- where his  bodyguards used to stay -- 18 days ago, which included an Uzi  submachine gun. The writing on the requisition forms will be  compared with that of the accounting books seized at the  Andrade's accounting office.     "

Absent  from the debate were: Armando Calderon Sol, presidential  candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, and  Jorge Martinez Menendez, presidential candidate for the Unity  Movement. This is the second of three scheduled presidential  debates organized by Canal Doce Television in the 1994  Salvadoran presidential campaign and moderated by Mauricio Funes.    Based on a drawing, Chavez is the first to speak. When asked  what he would do to solve the problem of crime and provide  public security in El Salvador, Chavez says he has a five-point  plan to fight this problem. ""We would first take security  measures to protect citizens, and secondly, we would take  judicial, corrective, and preventive measures. Finally, we  would take measures to compensate victims. As for the police  measures or measures to ensure the protection of citizens, a  very important aspect is the rescheduling of the peace  agreements in this area, which is so important for the peace  agreements. I would not like to list the other measures for  reasons of time and because I do not want to tire the television  viewer,"" he says. Chavez adds: ""We have to increase the number  of policemen as a deterrent. Police presence is important  especially if it is strategically distributed among the  population. We have been pointing out since 1991, that there is  a need to deploy 10,000 policemen at this time. We currently  have nearly 6,000 civilian policemen, who graduated from the  Public Security Academy."" Chavez ends by saying: ""We have the  problem of private services to deal with, we have to fight  impunity and corruption, and we need resources to satisfy our  financial needs.""    The next candidate to answer the same question is Rodriguez.  He says: ""We believe the National Civilian Police, PNC, in  view of the urgent need to implement the peace agreement, has  been poorly trained. We believe the length of training was too  short. A good policeman needs approximately two years to be  well trained and he needs to be in a constant retraining stage  to have a better awareness of the laws, procedures,  investigative techniques, and human rights. We also believe  that since the deadline is rapidly approaching, the National  Police must hand over to the PNC all its equipment, weapons,  transportation and communications equipment, and all other  logistics supplies so as to immediately strengthen the PNC with  the resources already in the country without the need to incur  greater debts.""    Presidential candidate Zamora, when explaining the steps he  would take to fight crime, says: ""We must end the impunity  given to organized crime by the government in our country and we  must also draft judicial reforms."" ""We must support the  deployment and development of the PNC. Those are the three  major points of our public security policy."" Zamora says that  during the first six months of his government, the following  measures would be taken: ""We are going to completely review all  the irregularities in the fulfillment of the peace agreements  regarding the PNC. The UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal]  sent a letter to the UN secretary general pointing out all the  ways in which this government has failed to comply with the real  purpose of the PNC. Secondly, we also have to deploy the PNC  before September. The Police Academy says it should be ready by  September. We also have to completely reorganize the Interior  and Public Security Ministry because starting in July, the PNC  will be under the control of the Interior Ministry.""    Zamora also lists his three great national campaigns. ""Our  first campaign is against organized crime. Starting on 1 June  and running through 31 December we have to take exemplary  measures so that organized crime understands that if it violates  the law, it will pay for it in our government. Our second  campaign is the national disarmament campaign to collect all  weapons of war in private hands and to register weapons.  Remember that a law was passed in January to register all  weapons in private hands within a 90-day period. This government  has done nothing. An office to receive permit requests has not  even been set up. We will have to extend the 90- day grace  period and do it right so that our Armed Forces can really  conduct this campaign promptly. The third campaign is the  national campaign to clean up public administration. We are  going to fight government corruption and contraband beginning on  our first day in office.""    Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, the only woman  candidate running for the Salvadoran Presidency, says she  disagrees with the dissolution of the security corps and that  ""the logical thing would have been a gradual purge of the  Treasury Police and the National Guard."" She adds that if she  wins the election she will review the peace agreements and  propose to the United Nations that ""as long as we do not have a  well-equipped PNC with enough members, the present National  Police should continue to operate, forgetting about this year's  October deadline."" She adds that ""with an efficient police  force and good cooperation from citizens, we should be able to  improve justice administration to provide better guarantees to  witnesses and accelerate the proceedings to prevent bureaucracy  from discouraging citizens wishing to cooperate.""    Finally, Roberto Escobar Garcia agrees with Rey Prendes and  says that ""the sudden dissolution of the public security corps,  the National Guard, and the Treasury Police left a terrible void  in the country that has not been filled."" He says that the PNC  should be trained to prevent crime rather than repress it and  that it must be turned into an auxiliary body within the  administration of justice.    Moderator Mauricio Funes then asks if the candidates think  the National Police can operate without the security corps and  if the current system should be kept. Chavez answers by saying  that despite the flaws the peace agreements should be observed.  ""In this regard, the Armed Forces can help by conducting air  patrols. We must evidently extend the disarmament law,"" Chavez  says.    As for transferring resources from the National Police to  the  PNC, Rodriguez Eigenhart says: ""Foreign assistance to strengthen  the PNC could be sought, but a greater budget for the PNC can be  allocated in the national budget. Every time we talk about  problems we only think about asking for foreign aid. Why not  think about curtailing public expenditures so that we do not  have to depend on what may or may not come from abroad?""    When asked about the lack of security in the streets because  of the absence of the security corps, presidential candidate  Escobar Garcia says: ""We have to create a strong link between  the PNC and the Attorney General's Office. The former can  prevent crimes from being committed, and the latter can conduct  technical investigations after crimes have been committed."" The  National Police has to be strengthened as much as possible even  though the foreign assistance that has been promised has not  arrived yet, Escobar Garcia says.    Chavez Mena talks about the importance of making deep  judicial, constitutional, and criminal code reforms. ""We have  to classify the different types of criminals. We have to  implement new punishment alternatives and insist on solving the  impunity problem."" He insists that the fundamental  responsibility for any of the mistakes that may have been  committed in the peace agreements lies with Arena's lack of  responsibility.    Finally, the candidates discuss problems of contraband,  corruption, and the breakdown of moral values in the country.     "

National Police (PN) Director Oswaldo Fernandez declared  that  the incident in which U.S. Sergeant Maurice Neal was wounded in  the shoulder by a Panamanian policeman does not have ""any effect  on U.S. relations."" In this regard, Fernandez added U.S.  Southern Command authorities and Panamanian PN exchanged reports  on the case, adding it is ""indeed true"" Neal evaded and ran  through a Panamanian police checkpoint.    Regarding whether the reaction of the police to fire on Neal  is justified, Fernandez said that ""it is too early to tell,  because we must first verify the situation and hear the account  of events from the PN Office of Professional Responsibility,""  which is investigating the case.    The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command maintains  approximately 10,000 soldiers in installations along the length  of the 80-km interoceanic Canal. U.S. troops must abandon these  installations totally by 31 December 1999, as stipulated by the  Canal Treaties signed by the two countries in 1977.     "

The pursuit wound its way over 12 miles of surface streets in North Hollywood,  Van Nuys and Studio City before the driver jumped out on Coldwater Canyon  Avenue about 3:25 p.m. and hid in thick brush north of Mulholland Drive, said  Los Angeles Police Sgt. Joe Brazas. About 10 minutes later, a Los Angeles  police helicopter saw him in a ravine, where he was arrested, Brazas said.    William Epperly, 34, of Whittier was being held on suspicion of grand theft at  the Police Department's Van Nuys station jail, Brazas said.    Three Los Angeles police patrol cars and a Highway Patrol car pursued the truck  for about 35 minutes, at speeds that never reached more than 35 m.p.h., Brazas  said. The truck did not hit other vehicles, despite running several red lights  at major intersections, and there were no injuries, Brazas said.    Police followed the truck, lights flashing and sirens wailing, but did not try  to force it to halt. Under department policy, officers do not try to block a  fleeing vehicle's path or run it off the road ""unless there's an immediate,  clear and present threat to someone's life,"" Sgt. John Rygh said.    ""Especially if he's driving a heavy rig loaded with thousands of pounds of  merchandise,"" Rygh said.    Police were guided to the truck by Robert H. Sharpless, a salesman for  Panel-Tex, a City of Industry firm that manufactures and sells plywood  paneling. Sharpless said thieves broke into the company's yard Tuesday night  and loaded the $18,000 worth of plywood onto the truck with a forklift that  they had hot-wired.    ""I had just gotten onto the I-5 northbound from the Harbor and looked over to  the right, and there's our company truck with a load of plywood on it,""  Sharpless said.    ""It blew me away. I couldn't believe it.    ""I called my boss on the car phone and asked him if he hired a driver with a  beard today and shipped any more plywood out today, and he said, 'Hell, no!'  and said 'Get off the phone right now and call 911.' ""    Sharpless said he followed the truck as it continued north on the Golden State,  Ventura and Hollywood freeways before getting off at Sherman Way. He said he  stayed on the phone with a Highway Patrol dispatcher, giving the location of  the truck and arranging to alert waiting patrol cars by turning on his  emergency flashers when he passed them.    ""I turned on my emergency flashers when I saw the CHP on Sherman Way, the  officer pulled up beside me and I pointed out to him that was the truck,""  Sharpless said.    Sharpless said he lost sight of the truck when he had to stop for a red light  at Woodman Avenue, but the Highway Patrol continued the pursuit and was joined  by Los Angeles police cars.    The abandoned truck blocked both lanes of Coldwater Canyon for more than half  an hour before it could be moved out of traffic.

The pursuit wound its way over 12 miles of surface streets in North Hollywood,  Van Nuys and Studio City before the driver jumped out on Coldwater Canyon  Avenue about 3:25 p.m. and hid in thick brush north of Mulholland Drive, said  Los Angeles Police Sgt. Joe Brazas. About 10 minutes later, a Los Angeles  police helicopter saw him in a ravine, where he was arrested, Brazas said.    William Epperly, 34, of Whittier was being held on suspicion of grand theft at  the Police Department's Van Nuys station jail, Brazas said.    Three Los Angeles police patrol cars and a Highway Patrol car pursued the truck  for about 35 minutes, at speeds that never reached more than 35 m.p.h., Brazas  said. The truck did not hit other vehicles, despite running several red lights  at major intersections, and there were no injuries, Brazas said.    Police followed the truck, lights flashing and sirens wailing, but did not try  to force it to halt. Under department policy, officers do not try to block a  fleeing vehicle's path or run it off the road ""unless there's an immediate,  clear and present threat to someone's life,"" Sgt. John Rygh said.    ""Especially if he's driving a heavy rig loaded with thousands of pounds of  merchandise,"" Rygh said.    Police were guided to the truck by Robert H. Sharpless, a salesman for  Panel-Tex, a City of Industry firm that manufactures and sells plywood  paneling. Sharpless said thieves broke into the company's yard Tuesday night  and loaded the $18,000 worth of plywood onto the truck with a forklift that  they had hot-wired.    ""I had just gotten onto the I-5 northbound from the Harbor and looked over to  the right, and there's our company truck with a load of plywood on it,""  Sharpless said.    ""It blew me away. I couldn't believe it.    ""I called my boss on the car phone and asked him if he hired a driver with a  beard today and shipped any more plywood out today, and he said, 'Hell, no!'  and said 'Get off the phone right now and call 911.' ""    Sharpless said he followed the truck as it continued north on the Golden State,  Ventura and Hollywood freeways before getting off at Sherman Way. He said he  stayed on the phone with a Highway Patrol dispatcher, giving the location of  the truck and arranging to alert waiting patrol cars by turning on his  emergency flashers when he passed them.    ""I turned on my emergency flashers when I saw the CHP on Sherman Way, the  officer pulled up beside me and I pointed out to him that was the truck,""  Sharpless said.    Sharpless said he lost sight of the truck when he had to stop for a red light  at Woodman Avenue, but the Highway Patrol continued the pursuit and was joined  by Los Angeles police cars.    The abandoned truck blocked both lanes of Coldwater Canyon for more than half  an hour before it could be moved out of traffic. It backed up southbound  traffic to Ventura Boulevard and brought northbound traffic to a halt at  Mulholland Drive, Brazas said.      Photo, Truck was abandoned on Coldwater Canyon Avenue.

Tom Holloway has the story:    The South African Police investigations concern flocks of  ostriches from South Africa which (?smugglers) are swopping with  ostrich flocks in Namibia, but illegally exporting to Swaziland  and then reexporting to lucrative markets overseas.    Mr. Reilly explained that as South Africa has the largest  population of the most productive ostriches left in Africa, it  has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted  overseas, in order to conserve and build up South Africa's  ostrich population. The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has  been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting  and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the  birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for  ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and  racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry.    Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be  used  in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well  as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa.  He said he had therefore agreed to assist the South African  Police in their investigations concerning ostrich flocks in  Namibia and a certain ostrich farm in Swaziland, currently  engaged in exporting ostriches to overseas markets.

In a statement on  Monday, it said the latest flashpoint in the region was  Buchanana near Ntambanana, about 30km east of Empangeni. The  statement said renewed violence started on January 9 when ANC  member Bheki Ndlovu was killed in an ambush. ""Despite the fact  that the kwaZulu Police [KZP] were patrolling the area during  the same evening, attacks continued."" Several homes had been  gutted by fire in a series of attacks since then, the ANC  claimed.    Two supporters were killed during Mr Ndlovu's funeral on  Saturday. They were identified by the ANC as Wiseman Cele and  Phakaniseni Hlela.    On Monday morning Thokozani Patrick Mlondo and Joshua  Mofokeng were shot dead by a group which opened fire before  burning several houses, the statement said.    The ANC demanded the South African Police and the defence  force immediately take over policing in the Ntambanana area. It  also called on the Goldstone Commission to investigate the  latest violence.    The KZP confirmed weekend incidents in the area but was  unable to supply details on Monday. Senior policemen in Ulundi  were unavailable late on Monday to comment on the ANC's claims.     "
0,FT933-15843 ,"FT933-15843 _AN-DGGB8ACAFT 930707   FT  07 JUL 93 / 'Failure' over miscarriages      By ROBERT RICE and ALAN PIKE   LAWYERS and law reform groups yesterday attacked the royal commission for being more concerned with efficiency than justice. The proposal to abolish the defendant's right to jury trial was condemned by the Bar and the Law Society and by groups such as the Legal Action Group and Liberty. While welcoming the measures to investigate and correct wrongful convictions, Mr John Rowe QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'The central failure of the commission's report is that it has not analysed why these miscarriages occurred or made sufficient recommendations to prevent future miscarriages.' The Law Society accused the commission of a 'short-term approach' and of having 'chosen to steer a middle course rather than undertake a strategic review'. The society was pleased that the commission had maintained the right to silence in the police station. Mr Roger Smith, Legal Action Group's director, said the report had been too influenced by the commission's perception that there was a need for greater balance between defence and prosecution. More attention should have been given to preventing miscarriages of justice of the kind that led to the report. 'The commission's package of measures reflects a desire to improve the efficiency of the administration of justice rather than its effectiveness,' Mr Smith said. Liberty, the civil liberties group, attacked the commission's failure to insist on independent evidence to corroborate confessions. Mr John Wadham, Liberty's legal officer, said: 'Uncorroborated confession evidence remains one of the biggest single causes of innocent people going to prison.' Police representatives gave a general welcome to the report, but warned that the service should not be expected to implement its recommendations from existing budgets. Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said it had been estimated that it might cost Pounds 9m to Pounds 10m to meet the single recommendation of putting video cameras in police station custody suites. If proposals with resource implications had to be met from existing police budgets they would 'seriously reduce improvements in other areas of criminal investigation, and take officers away from the fight against crime'. The report makes recommendations on police disciplinary procedures, an issue now under review by the Home Office. In a change of policy yesterday the Police Federation, which represents all ranks up to chief inspector, announced that it would accept a recommendation for a lower level of proof in disciplinary hearings. At present the police service's internal disciplinary hearings require the same level of proof as a criminal court. Mr Kenneth Clarke, before he left the Home Office, was shouted down when he argued for dropping the criminal standard of proof at the Police Federation conference in May. But Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman, said yesterday that the federation's council had agreed to accept a lower level of proof. Mr Burrow said he saw some advantages to the proposed restrictions on jury trial. But the decision was ultimately a political one, which should be taken after an informed public debate.

Mr. Meir Shumer, 48, an Israeli citizen, is in police  custody  after appearing in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on  Tuesday.    Police say this is the fourth time in 18 months they have  seized diamonds or gold smuggled on El Al flights from  Johannesburg to Tel Aviv.    Immigration records show that Mr. Shumer's arrest came on  his  thirteenth trip to South Africa since 1990.    On most of his visits, police said, he stayed for between  one  and three days before returning to Israel -- almost always  choosing to fly El Al.    Police say El Al's Saturday-night flight appears to have  become a hot favourite with professional smugglers and dishonest  emigrants in spite of El Al's reputation for having the  strictest security in the world.    The possibility that airline staff may be colluding with  smugglers has not been ruled out.    Last year Reserve Bank investigators working on a  R179-million fraud case were told by an informant in a sworn  statement that the airline's staff were helping wealthy South  Africans get their riches out of the country.    Within weeks of this, Germiston diamond and gold unit  detectives arrested El Al security officer Derek Joel Niss, 35,  for trying to smuggle a suitcase filled with more than 670  Krugerrands into a plane cargo hold.    Niss said after his conviction that he suspected a cartel of  emigrating South Africans had paid him the R5,000 cash bribe he  received for each coin-filled suitcase he slipped on the plane.    He said he had handled about 20 consignments before his  arrest.    Niss's arrest was the second time police had seized gold  coins destined for Israel on an El Al flight. Last February  they found a suitcase containing 1,100 Krugerrands which had  been checked in for transport to Tel Aviv. The owner has still  not been traced.    And in another diamond-smuggling case, police arrested  Israeli courier Moshe Landman when he tried to board an El Al  flight 18 months ago with R55,000 in diamonds hidden in one of  his boots. Landman had travelled to South Africa 15 times --  mostly with El Al -- before being caught.    Last Saturday police swooped on passengers travelling  overseas on various airlines at Jan Smuts.    Diamonds and gold unit detectives Colonel Clement Jackson  and  Captain Henk van Rensburg picked out Mr. Shumer from the line of  passengers moving through passport control.    Mr. Shumer, who claims to be a diamond consultant, was taken  to a cubicle and asked to strip down to his underwear, said  police. He was then arrested.    Police said Mr. Shumer arrived in South Africa with his wife  -- it was her first trip -- two weeks ago and the two apparently  took time off to holiday in George and Cape Town.    Mrs. Shumer, who was also searched, went on to Tel Aviv. Mr.  Shumer was not asked to plead when he appeared in the Kempton  Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. A bail hearing has been set  for February 23.    If convicted, Mr. Shumer faces a maximum sentence of 10  years' imprisonment and R250,000 fine.    Police says they are now obliged to carry out more frequent  and more thorough searches of passengers using El Al.    Explaining how smugglers were slipping past his security  officers, an El Al security spokesman said the airline was  mainly concerned with apprehending potential hijackers and  terrorists.     "

All five robberies have occurred at West Valley chain stores with easy freeway  access. There were no injuries in any of the incidents.    In each case, between two and five men entered each of the stores near closing  time, drew guns and herded together employees and any customers still inside,  police said. The thieves then emptied cash registers and forced managers at  gunpoint to open safes. They escaped with up to $10,000 in each robbery. Police  said no suspects have been identified.    Police said robberies in which businesses are taken over by gunmen are  extremely dangerous because of the number of weapons and victims involved.    ""We hadn't had any take-over robberies for a long time,"" said Detective Robert  Johansen of the West Valley Division. ""Now all of a sudden we have all of these  in two weeks. That is our concern. Why the West Valley?""    Police said the five businesses that have been robbed are located close to the  Ventura or San Diego freeways, and the West Valley is home to numerous retail  outlets that seem to fit a sketchy pattern favored by the robbers: They are  open at night, have multiple cash register stations and deal largely in cash  transactions.    The first two robberies occurred Aug. 20 on Fallbrook Avenue in Canoga Park.  Police said two gunmen entered a Liquor Barn in the Fallbrook Square shopping  center about 8:30 p.m. and held a handful of employees and customers at  gunpoint while taking an undetermined amount of cash, believed to be several  hundred dollars, from the registers.    About 20 minutes later and only a block away, two gunmen went into a Ralphs  supermarket and robbed cashiers of about $2,500.    Two nights later, three armed men held up employees and customers at a Target  store in the 20800 block of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills. Employees and  customers were forced to lie on the floor while the robbers roamed the store.  The cash registers were cleared out, and a manager was forced to open a safe in  the rear of the store. About $10,000 was taken, police said.    One customer said later that he did not realize a robbery was taking place  until he walked from the rear to the front of the store to find an open  register. When he found no cashiers at their stations and asked a manager for  assistance, the manager whispered that there was a robbery in progress and  advised the customer to return to the rear of the store.    On Aug. 27, three robbers struck at the Builders Emporium in the 17600 block of  Sherman Way in Reseda, taking at gunpoint $10,000 from cash registers and a  safe.    Manager Dave Beeman said the trio had entered the store about 15 minutes before  closing and appeared to be customers, though one cashier said afterward that  she thought they behaved suspiciously. One of the men even bought a portable  phone but later took back the cash he used in the purchase when he rifled the  register.    ""Just as we were locking the doors to close, they pulled out the guns,"" Beeman  said. ""They gathered everybody together and seemed to know how many were in the  store. They took a head count. One customer tried to run out, but they stopped  him.""    The fifth robbery occurred two nights later at Home Depot on Roscoe Boulevard  near the Van Nuys Airport. This time, five robbers entered the store, held 10  employees and customers at gunpoint, and took about $6,000, police said.    Police said evidence and descriptions of the suspects and getaway cars link the  first two robberies. The last three incidents also appear to be linked.  Detectives assigned to the cases said their hunch is that all five might be the  work of one group.    The robberies have occurred in roughly the same area that in recent years has  been plagued by dozens of follow-home holdups and numerous Rolex bandits. In  the earlier sprees, robbers cruised areas of Ventura Boulevard in the West  Valley and demanded that owners of Rolex watches give them up, or followed  luxury cars home and confronted their owners when they stopped. Police  eventually made arrests that broke up the rings.    Police see no connection between those crime trends and the recent take-over  robberies. Though no one has been injured, police last week expressed concern  over the latest series of robberies.    ""In any armed robbery, the potential for killing someone is always there,"" said  Detective Bud Mehringer, who with Johansen is investigating the first four  robberies. ""But I think that the more bandits and more guns and more victims  you have, the greater chance there is of bodily harm.""    Detective Dan Riehl, who is assigned to investigate the fifth robbery, said he  found the crimes ""amazing"" because the robbers didn't disguise themselves, took  numerous people captive and chose stores with numerous aisles and storage  rooms, increasing the possibility that an uncounted employee or customer might  stumble into the holdup and be harmed.    ""This is not your normal stop and rob,"" Riehl said. ""It's very dangerous. There  are so many witnesses. You have a lot of people running around"" in large  stores.    Police said the fact that there are so many businesses in the West Valley  similar to those that have been hit hampers their efforts to track the robbers  or thwart their next move.    ""There are hundreds and hundreds of stores that have multiple cash registers  and safes and are near major on-ramps,"" Mehringer said. ""Where do we start? We  can't narrow it down to one chain or one kind of store.""    Mehringer said police have begun to contact the security offices of the chain  stores to alert them to the robberies. He said the police detectives don't tell  the private companies how to provide security at their outlets but can suggest  visible measures such as adding guards.    For the most part, spokesmen for the store chains declined to discuss the  security of their stores. However, Beeman said guards have been added at the  Builders Emporium that was robbed last week, and Tom Stone, a security  supervisor for the store chain, said the rash of robberies has gotten the  attention of large retailers in the Valley.

This exchange is allegedly  being negotiated by Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers and African  guerrilla elements who, since the 1970's, have received weapons  manufactured in the former USSR. This week the Rio de Janeiro  PF (Federal Police) started to investigate the relationship  between Brazilian drug traffickers and African guerrilla  elements.    Rio de Janeiro PF Superintendent Edson Antonio de Oliveira,  42, said the suspicion regarding the exchange of drugs for  weapons surfaced with the confiscation in Rio de Janeiro  shantytowns of ammunition made in the former USSR member  countries.    The occupation of the Mangueira shantytown (in northern Rio  de Janeiro) by agents of the Civil and Military Police early  this week interrupted the ""war"" between drug rings that has  already resulted in 14 deaths, and the seizing of Russian-made  AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle shells. This rifle can fire up to 800  shots per minute.    Oliveira said that the foreign weapons acquired by the Rio  de  Janeiro drug traffickers usually come via Miami (United States)  and Paraguay. The superintendent asserted: ""Russian weapons do  not come through these two routes because this type of weapon or  ammunition do not exist in Miami or Paraguay.""    The PF investigations have shown that the Russian weapons  may  be coming from Africa through the Middle East and Asian  countries such as Afghanistan, that have overcome difficult  phases of regional wars and battles.    Oliveira commented: ""Russian weapons are cheaper because  there are great quantities of them in African countries in  conflict and in Lebanon. We are greatly concerned. As soon as  these conflicts are over, the excess weapons are put up for  sale.""    The contacts between Rio de Janeiro underground  organizations  and terrorists of countries such as Angola, Namibia, and Zaire  may be being made by Africans who enter Brazil as tourists.    A new route for the international trafficking of weapons may  be being established the same way as Africans acted as middlemen  for the shipment of cocaine from Brazil to Europe -- the  Nigerian connection.    Since the 1980's Rio de Janeiro represents a sort of  supermarket for the population of poor African countries.  Thousands of Angolans, Nigerians, Zairians, and Ghanaians come  to Rio de Janeiro every year as tourists and return loaded with  all sorts of merchandise (from sandals to electrical appliances).    The PF is investigating whether these tourists are not  representatives of guerrilla organizations, in charge of  maintaining contact with Rio de Janeiro criminal organizations  such as the CV (Red Commando) and the TC (Third Commando).    Groups of policemen specialize in supplying drugs and  foreign  weapons to drug traffickers linked to the CV and TC. Parallel  investigations carried out by the Civil and Federal Police came  to the same conclusion.    The DRE (Drug Control Precinct) of the Civil Police has  identified groups of suppliers made up of civil, military, and  federal agents. These groups sell sophisticated weapons that  usually arrive in Rio de Janeiro through the international  airport (northern zone), on their way to the drug traffickers.    One of the groups of suppliers is allegedly headed by Civil  Police Detective Cesar Pereira da Silva. DRE Director Walter  Alves de Oliveira, 54, said the group sold weapons and drugs to  Orlando da Conceicao, or Orlando Jogador, who is regarded by the  police as one of the biggest drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro.  Jogador has cocaine and marijuana ""sale spots"" in the  Bonsucesso, Penha, and Ramos shantytowns in northern Rio de  Janeiro. Pereira da Silva was arrested last December.     "

AND IT'S EXPECTING MUCH MORE.      By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The Simi Valley Police Department, which last year was credited with the  largest seizure of cocaine ever by law enforcement officers from Ventura  County, has collected more than $1.7 million over the last five years as its  share in the federal drug forfeiture program.    Sometime in the future -- the police hope sooner rather than later -- the  department will more than double that amount in one lump sum when it receives  another $1.8 million already promised to it as the city's share of money seized  from Colombian drug dealers and money launderers last summer.    In addition, the department has claims to another $4.1 million in alleged drug  money seized during various raids in Simi Valley that is still tied up in the  courts because of lawsuits from alleged drug dealers who claim the money  legally belongs to them and not to the police.    The upshot is that the Simi Valley Police Department, which is confronted by  one of the biggest Colombian drug networks now operating in Ventura County, has  amassed some of the most sophisticated police technology in the county for use  in its continuing skirmishes with Simi Valley drug dealers.    Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the city's share of drug  forfeiture funds received so far has been used for the purchase of 9mm Baretta  pistols and holsters for all of his department's 105 officers.    In addition, the money has been spent on computers, cars and a van specially  outfitted with sophisticated evidence-gathering equipment, including a  fingerprint laser. He said the money is also used to pay the salaries of three  narcotics officers and two DARE officers, who teach anti-drug classes at the  elementary school level.    The federal drug forfeiture program, established in 1984, allows local law  enforcement agencies who work with federal agents to claim money and property  seized in drug arrests.    Police departments can receive up to 80% of the money or property they helped  seize in narcotics raids involving federal investigations or prosecution, Lt.  Robert Klamser said. The program requires that the money be used for law  enforcement purposes and stipulates that it cannot be used to replace current  city funding, Klamser said.    Simi Valley, West Covina and Los Angeles police departments were among the  first law enforcement agencies to receive money through the forfeiture program  after a 1984 joint investigation of a cocaine ring, Klamser said.    The Los Angeles Police Department received $1.4 million and Simi Valley and  West Covina each received about $360,000 from that operation, according to  police records.    Seized assets are divided among participating agencies based on their  participation in an investigation, Klamser said.    For example, the Port Hueneme Police Department provided a narcotics-sniffing  dog in a Simi Valley police investigation last August that led to the largest  seizure of cocaine ever by authorities from Ventura County -- 2,068 pounds --  as well as $2.4 million in suspected drug profits.    The dog's efforts are expected to yield a substantial amount of money -- the  exact amount is yet to be determined -- for the 21-officer department.    Port Hueneme Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald said a year ago that his department  received about $16,000 in federal forfeiture funds when it sniffed out more  than $500,000 in suspected drug profits and several kilos of cocaine as part of  a joint investigation with the Burbank Police Department.    The department is also expected to receive one of two small planes seized last  year as part of a U.S. Customs Service investigation.    ""The dogs have done a real good job,"" Fitzgerald said, adding that his  department recently sold one of its two German shepherds to the Ventura County  district attorney's office. ""They're definitely worth their weight.""    Klamser agreed, saying his department has plans to purchase its own trained  police dog because of the potential revenue it could generate.    The federal forfeiture program is not without its drawbacks. The amount of time  it takes for a local agency to receive a disbursement of federal forfeiture  funds could take anywhere from a couple of months to a couple of years, Klamser  said.    ""Generally, the larger the amount, the longer the wait,"" he said, noting that  the department's claim of $4.1 million is still pending in court.    In cases where the amounts of drug assets seized are less than $100,000, the  federal agency involved, usually the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, is  allowed to decide how much to return to local authorities.    The state has a similar forfeiture program, but until recently it was easier  for local law enforcement agencies to recoup a larger share of drug monies  under the federal law, Klamser said.    The main reason was that the state law made it more difficult to seize property  and required that the majority of drug money go to mental health and anti-drug  education programs, he said.    However, the state law was amended in January, 1989, making it easier for law  enforcement agencies to seize cash and other property believed to be the  proceeds of drug dealing, said Ronald Janes, major crimes and narcotics  supervisor with the Ventura County district attorney's office. The statute also  no longer requires prosecutors to obtain criminal convictions before  confiscating these items, Janes said.    The new state law allocates about 85% of suspected drug profits to the police  agency participating in the narcotics investigation, with the remainder going  to the prosecuting agency and the state.    Since the law was amended, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of  local law enforcement agencies using it, Janes said.    ""We now have two attorneys who do nothing but forfeiture cases,"" he said.      Photo, Detective Butch Hale displays equipment bought with funds from assets  seized during drug raids. LAWRENCE K.

In addition, the department has claims to another $4.1 million in alleged drug  money seized during various raids in Simi Valley that is still tied up in the  courts because of lawsuits from alleged drug dealers who claim the money  legally belongs to them and not to the police.    The upshot is that the Simi Valley Police Department, which is confronted by  one of the biggest Colombian drug networks now operating in Ventura County, has  amassed some of the most sophisticated police technology in the county for use  in its continuing skirmishes with Simi Valley drug dealers.    Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the city's share of drug  forfeiture funds received so far has been used for the purchase of 9mm Baretta  pistols and holsters for all of his department's 105 officers.    In addition, the money has been spent on computers, cars and a van specially  outfitted with sophisticated evidence-gathering equipment, including a  fingerprint laser. He said the money is also used to pay the salaries of three  narcotics officers and two DARE officers, who teach anti-drug classes at the  elementary school level.    The federal drug forfeiture program, established in 1984, allows local law  enforcement agencies who work with federal agents to claim money and property  seized in drug arrests.    Police departments can receive up to 80% of the money or property they helped  seize in narcotics raids involving federal investigations or prosecution, Lt.  Robert Klamser said. The program requires that the money be used for law  enforcement purposes and stipulates that it cannot be used to replace current  city funding, Klamser said.    Simi Valley, West Covina and Los Angeles police departments were among the  first law enforcement agencies to receive money through the forfeiture program  after a 1984 joint investigation of a cocaine ring, Klamser said.    The Los Angeles Police Department received $1.4 million and Simi Valley and  West Covina each received about $360,000 from that operation, according to  police records.    Seized assets are divided among participating agencies based on their  participation in an investigation, Klamser said.    For example, the Port Hueneme Police Department provided a narcotics-sniffing  dog in a Simi Valley police investigation last August that led to the largest  seizure of cocaine ever by authorities from Ventura County -- 2,068 pounds --  as well as $2.4 million in suspected drug profits.    The dog's efforts are expected to yield a substantial amount of money -- the  exact amount is yet to be determined -- for the 21-officer department.    Port Hueneme Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald said a year ago that his department  received about $16,000 in federal forfeiture funds when it sniffed out more  than $500,000 in suspected drug profits and several kilos of cocaine as part of  a joint investigation with the Burbank Police Department.    The department is also expected to receive one of two small planes seized last  year as part of a U.S. Customs Service investigation.    ""The dogs have done a real good job,"" Fitzgerald said, adding that his  department recently sold one of its two German shepherds to the Ventura County  district attorney's office. ""They're definitely worth their weight.""    Klamser agreed, saying his department has plans to purchase its own trained  police dog because of the potential revenue it could generate.    The federal forfeiture program is not without its drawbacks. The amount of time  it takes for a local agency to receive a disbursement of federal forfeiture  funds could take anywhere from a couple of months to a couple of years, Klamser  said.    ""Generally, the larger the amount, the longer the wait,"" he said, noting that  the department's claim of $4.1 million is still pending in court.    In cases where the amounts of drug assets seized are less than $100,000, the  federal agency involved, usually the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, is  allowed to decide how much to return to local authorities.    The state has a similar forfeiture program, but until recently it was easier  for local law enforcement agencies to recoup a larger share of drug monies  under the federal law, Klamser said.    The main reason was that the state law made it more difficult to seize property  and required that the majority of drug money go to mental health and anti-drug  education programs, he said.    However, the state law was amended in January, 1989, making it easier for law  enforcement agencies to seize cash and other property believed to be the  proceeds of drug dealing, said Ronald Janes, major crimes and narcotics  supervisor with the Ventura County district attorney's office. The statute also  no longer requires prosecutors to obtain criminal convictions before  confiscating these items, Janes said.    The new state law allocates about 85% of suspected drug profits to the police  agency participating in the narcotics investigation, with the remainder going  to the prosecuting agency and the state.    Since the law was amended, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of  local law enforcement agencies using it, Janes said.    ""We now have two attorneys who do nothing but forfeiture cases,"" he said.      Photo, Detective Butch Hale displays equipment bought with funds from assets  seized during drug raids. LAWRENCE K.

This exchange is allegedly  being negotiated by Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers and African  guerrilla elements who, since the 1970's, have received weapons  manufactured in the former USSR. This week the Rio de Janeiro  PF (Federal Police) started to investigate the relationship  between Brazilian drug traffickers and African guerrilla  elements.    Rio de Janeiro PF Superintendent Edson Antonio de Oliveira,  42, said the suspicion regarding the exchange of drugs for  weapons surfaced with the confiscation in Rio de Janeiro  shantytowns of ammunition made in the former USSR member  countries.    The occupation of the Mangueira shantytown (in northern Rio  de Janeiro) by agents of the Civil and Military Police early  this week interrupted the ""war"" between drug rings that has  already resulted in 14 deaths, and the seizing of Russian-made  AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle shells. This rifle can fire up to 800  shots per minute.    Oliveira said that foreign weapons acquired by the Rio de  Janeiro drug traffickers usually come via Miami (United States)  and Paraguay. The superintendent asserted: ""Russian weapons do  not come through these two routes because this type of weapon or  ammunition do not exist in Miami or Paraguay.""    The PF investigations have shown that the Russian weapons  may  be coming from Africa through the Middle East and Asian  countries such as Afghanistan, that have overcome difficult  phases of regional wars and battles.    Oliveira commented: ""Russian weapons are cheaper because  there are great quantities of them in African countries in  conflict and in Lebanon. We are greatly concerned. As soon as  these conflicts are over, the excess weapons are put up for  sale.""    The contacts between Rio de Janeiro underground  organizations  and terrorists of countries such as Angola, Namibia, and Zaire  may be being made by Africans who enter Brazil as tourists.    A new route for the international trafficking of weapons may  be being established the same way as Africans acted as middlemen  for the shipment of cocaine from Brazil to Europe -- the  Nigerian connection.    Since the 1980's Rio de Janeiro represents a sort of  supermarket for the population of poor African countries.  Thousands of Angolans, Nigerians, Zairians, and Ghanaians come  to Rio de Janeiro every year as tourists and return loaded with  all sorts of merchandise (from sandals to electrical appliances).    The PF is investigating whether these tourists are not  representatives of guerrilla organizations, in charge of  maintaining contact with Rio de Janeiro criminal organizations  such as the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command).    Groups of policemen specialize in supplying drugs and  foreign  weapons to drug traffickers linked to the CV and TC. Parallel  investigations carried out by the Civil and Federal Police came  to the same conclusion.    The DRE (Drug Control Precinct) of the Civil Police has  identified groups of suppliers made up of civil, military, and  federal agents. These groups sell sophisticated weapons that  usually arrive in Rio de Janeiro through the International  airport (northern zone), on their way to the drug traffickers.    One of the groups of suppliers is allegedly headed by Civil  Police Detective Cesar Pereira da Silva. DRE Director Walter  Alves de Oliveira, 54, said the group sold weapons and drugs to  Orlando da Conceicao, or Orlando Jogador, who is regarded by the  police as one of the biggest drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro.  Jogador has cocaine and marijuana ""sale spots"" in the  Bonsucesso, Penha, and Ramos shantytowns in northern Rio de  Janeiro. Pereira da Silva was arrested last December.     "

However,  the police have not yet sounded the all-clear.    In the afternoon, the traditional Newroz celebration of the  Kurds began -- accompanied by several hundred policemen -- in  Frankfurt/Main with much noise but peacefully. ""The situation  is characterized by unpredictability, fanaticism, and controlled  leadership,"" a police spokesman said. The authorities are also  prepared for activities in other places. The Frankfurt Newroz  celebrations had been permitted under strict conditions.    On Sunday police expect thousands of Kurds to come to  Mannheim, to follow a call for a mourning demonstration for two  Kurdish women from Turkey. The women had burned themselves in  Mannheim in protest against the situation of their people in  Anatolia. Police consider it possible that more than 20,000  Kurds will come to the rally, which was banned by the city on  Friday. Units of the Federal Border Police (BGS) have been  ordered to Mannheim.    In Hannover about 200 people, who mainly belonged to the  autonomous scene, demonstrated on Saturday against the  oppression of Kurds in Turkey. In Cologne the Kurds have  obviously respected the ban on demonstrations issued by the  Cologne police president. Apart from a small group of Kurds  carrying banners, there were no protests. Police and BGS had  gathered more than 3,000 of their men in the city as a  precaution. [passage omitted]     "

Curtis Lee Toney, 18, died of a gunshot fired by a Torrance officer late  Wednesday in the Willowbrook section of South Los Angeles.    Less than an hour before, at 8:20 p.m., Toney had approached Harry Staalberg,  62, of Torrance in the parking lot of the Pavilions supermarket at Torrance  Boulevard and Anza Avenue. Toney shot Staalberg once in the stomach in what  investigators believe was a bungled robbery attempt, police said. Toney then  drove off with an accomplice.    Staalberg was in critical but stable condition Thursday evening at county  Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.    The incident is the second violent crime in central Torrance in a week. On Nov.  8, Pomona pharmacist Stanley Hoe was mortally wounded in a beating and robbery  at a service station two miles east on Torrance Boulevard. Hoe died Tuesday  evening at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance.    Police said the two crimes are not connected and that there is no cause for  residents to be alarmed, but they noted such violent attacks are unusual in the  city.    Capt. Bruce Randall, head of the Police Department's Patrol Division, called  the crimes disturbing, but added, ""I don't see there is any alarming trend  occurring. I don't see it meaning anything dark or gloomy for the city of  Torrance.""    The rate of violent crime is virtually unchanged from recent years, Randall  said.    Staalberg had driven the two blocks from his home on Victor Street to shop when  he was confronted by Toney, police said. The two had a ""brief conversation,""  although police said they have not yet interviewed Staalberg, an apartment  building manager, to find out what his attacker said.    After the shooting, Toney and an accomplice sped east on Torrance Boulevard,  while witnesses called police. The car was spotted by police near the city's  Old Downtown.    The suspects drove on the wrong side of the road as the chase continued at  speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h. The getaway car evaded its pursuers by speeding  through red lights, but it was spotted again in Willowbrook by a Sheriff's  Department helicopter, said Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber.    The suspects ran, and officers found Toney hiding atop a shed in a horse  stable. Ignoring commands to give up, Toney ran along the top of a wall before  spinning and crouching as if he was about to fire a gun, Traber said.    Officers reported that they fired six shots at Toney, striking him once in the  chest. No weapon was found. Toney died several hours later at Martin Luther  King Jr.-Drew Medical Center.    Police and deputies cordoned off the neighborhood and searched for several  hours, but they could not find the accomplice.    Traber said detectives had determined that Toney, not his accomplice, was the  gunman, but added that he did not know how that was done.    Police linked the pair to crimes on Monday in Los Angeles and Tuesday in Pomona  because the car used in the Torrance shooting was a Ford Thunderbird stolen at  gunpoint the day before in Pomona, police said. The suspects approached a  58-year-old salesman Tuesday morning in Pomona and one held a gun to the man's  head, Pomona police said.    The two had attempted to steal a car from a 26-year-old woman just eight  minutes earlier, but they failed when the woman sped off, police said.

Address books and computer diskettes the aforementioned drug  traffickers had in their possession were instrumental in  establishing that the drug money route started in the United  States (New York) and Colombia and joined up in Ciudad del Este  in bank accounts at a branch of the Bank of The Netherlands. The  holder of these accounts is Nasrat Mohamad Jamil Rassoul, a  well-known ""border manager"" of Lebanese extraction who owns real  estate and businesses in Ciudad del Este--the capital of Alto  Parana Department--and Foz do Iguacu. From Ciudad del Este, the  dollars were transferred through several operations to another  account that Rassoul himself had at the Bamerindus Bank in Foz  do Iguacu. From there the money was once again transferred to  Bank of Brazil agencies located in different Brazilian cities to  several account holders, many of whom were fictitious.    Brazilian and U.S. investigators asserted that all the  financial resources used by the gang busted in Tocantins to  purchase the aforementioned ranch, several aircraft, motor  boats, cars, and even to set up at least three companies that  would act as a front for their activities came to Brazil via  Ciudad del Este. This means that movements in Rassoul's accounts  amounted to more than $1 million in approximately 10 months.  Rassoul was seconded in his dealings by fellow countryman David  Haddad (both are currently held in custody in Brasilia). The  amount of money movement has led the DEA to suspect that some  Paraguayan regional or national ""high-ranking authority"" might  have facilitated the establishment and operations of the Cali  Cartel in Ciudad del Este.    Another detail that has caught the attention of DEA and  Brazilian drug enforcement agents is the involvement of Samia  Haddock Lobo, a Brazilian businesswoman (at present a fugitive  from justice) in the dismantled drug gang. Haddock Lobo is a  member of a very respectable Rio de Janeiro family that  allegedly has properties and investments in Paraguay. Antonio  Mota Graca, the entrepreneur's husband, escaped from a Sao Paulo  prison approximately two years ago. He was in prison on drug  trafficking charges. Brazilian Federal Police sources think Mota  Graca is hiding somewhere in Paraguay.    If all this was not enough, Brazilian journalists following  the Tocantins case told NOTICIAS that one of the passports used  by arrested Colombian citizen Vicente Rivera Ramos, son of one  of the Medellin Cartel's big shots, was stamped several times by  our country's immigration authorities, indicating that his trips  between Colombia, Brazil, and Paraguay were frequent. It is not  too credible to maintain that the international drug trafficking  ""big shot"" visited our country frequently simply because he was  attracted by the beauty of our women or the sweetness of our  polkas and guaranias [national folk music].    Central Bank, Federal Revenue Office (the central tax  collection organization), and Federal Police authorities in the  neighboring country are concerned with the volume of drug  trafficking operations in Brazil, and in the next few days will  start a large joint operation to exchange information, trying to  detect any money laundering scheme used in the country. No one  doubts that the U.S. DEA will follow the Brazilian antinarcotics  operation very closely and that one of the study's main targets  will be precisely the Ciudad del Este-Foz do Iguacu axis.

OFFERED FREE EQUIPMENT FOR TRACKING STOLEN CARS      By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer      An innovative stolen car tracking system that state legislators refused to  approve for Los Angeles last year could be in place by the end of the year  under a plan approved by city police commissioners.    The Los Angeles Police Commission recommended Tuesday that the City Council  agree to a proposed contract under which LoJack Corp. would lease patented,  high-tech equipment to the city for five years at no charge and then transfer  ownership to the city, officials said. The agreement would amount to a gift of  the $1.4-million system to the city.    If approved by the council, any Los Angeles driver could buy and install a $600  transmitter that could be tracked by police computers if the vehicle were  stolen. Police helicopters and about 300 patrol cars would be equipped with the  small tracking computers.    The system, which police officials said could be expanded statewide, is modeled  after one begun in Massachusetts in 1986. That system has led to recovery of  98% of LoJack-equipped cars in an average of 90 minutes, Massachusetts state  police said.      Promise to Buyers    LoJack sells transmitters to Massachusetts drivers with a promise that the cost  will be refunded if the car is stolen and not recovered within 24 hours. As of  August, 12,000 cars were participating in that statewide system.    A California bill last year that would have allocated $1 million to establish a  Stolen Car Recovery Network pilot program in Los Angeles County was dropped  amid criticism that it was tailor-made to give LoJack, of Braintree, Mass., a  monopoly.    The proposal, by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), was dropped after an intense  lobbying effort by other car security companies. None of those companies has  similar technology but they say they could develop similar equipment in less  than a year.    The Police Commission's 5-0 vote prompted at least one of those competitors to  cry foul Wednesday.    ""It looks like they are trying to go through the back door with what they  couldn't go through the front door with,"" said Carolyn Drori, an attorney  representing Clifford Electronics, a Chatsworth firm that was one of several  auto security companies that opposed the LoJack proposal.    Drori said the opponents fear that establishing the LoJack system will lock  them out. ""We don't want to stop the LAPD if they think this is an important  tool,"" Drori said. ""But let's make sure it is the best system and an open  system.""    LoJack officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.    The proposed LoJack contract is non-exclusive, meaning the Police Department  could use any equipment developed by competing firms that works better or could  support LoJack equipment, said Sgt. Jeff Hulet, the department's technical  coordinator of the tracking system.    While much of the LoJack equipment is patented, the radio frequency used in the  system is a public frequency. This might allow LoJack competitors to develop  equipment for the system.    Under the proposal, Hulet said, LoJack would enter into the contract with the  city, which would then be empowered to share the equipment with the Sheriff's  Department. Computer bases for the system would likely be located at both  departments and at the state Department of Justice, he said.    Hulet said there are no regulations preventing the city from accepting the free  equipment if the council decides it is in the city's best interest. Because it  is free, there is no need to put the contract out for competitive bidding, he  added.    ""It's a moot point,"" Hulet said. ""How do you propose getting it for better than  free?""

Address books and computer diskettes the aforementioned drug  traffickers had in their possession were instrumental in  establishing that the drug money route started in the United  States (New York) and Colombia and joined up in Ciudad del Este  in bank accounts at a branch of The Bank of the Netherlands.  The holder of these accounts is Nasrat Mohamad Jamil Rassoul, a  well-known ""border manager"" of Lebanese extraction who owns real  estate and businesses in Ciudad del Este--the capital of Alto  Parana Department--and Foz do Iguacu. From Ciudad del Este,  the dollars were transferred through several operations to  another account that Rassoul himself had at the Bamerindus Bank  in Foz do Iguacu. From there the money was once again  transferred to the Bank of Brazil agencies located in different  Brazilian cities to several account holders, many of whom were  fictitious.    Brazilian and U.S. investigators asserted that all the  financial resources used by the gang busted in Tocantins to  purchase the aforementioned ranch, several aircraft, motor  boats, cars, and even to set up at least three companies that  would act as a front for their activities came to Brazil via  Ciudad del Este. This means that movements in Rassoul's  accounts amounted to more than $1 million in approximately 10  months. Rassoul was seconded in his dealings by fellow  countryman David Haddad (both are currently held in custody in  Brasilia). The amount of money in those movements has led the  DEA to suspect that some Paraguayan regional or national  ""high-ranking authority"" might have facilitated the  establishment and operations of the Cali cartel in Ciudad del  Este.    Another detail that has caught the attention of DEA and  Brazilian drug enforcement agents is the involvement of Samia  Haddock Lobo, a Brazilian businesswoman (at present a fugitive  from justice) in the dismantled drug gang. Haddock Lobo is a  member of a very respectable Rio de Janeiro family that  allegedly has properties and investments in Paraguay. Antonio  Mota Graca, the entrepreneur's husband, escaped from a Sao Paulo  prison approximately two years ago. He was in prison on drug  trafficking charges. Brazilian Federal Police sources think Mota  Graca is hiding somewhere in Paraguay.    If all this was not enough, Brazilian journalists following  the Tocantins case told NOTICIAS that one of the passports used  by arrested Colombian citizen Vicente Rivera Ramos, son of one  of the Medellin cartel's big shots, was stamped several times by  our country's immigration authorities, indicating that his trips  between Colombia, Brazil, and Paraguay were frequent. It is not  too credible to maintain that the international drug trafficking  ""big shot"" visited our country frequently simply because he was  attracted by the beauty of our women or the sweetness of our  polkas and guaranias [national folk music].    Central Bank, Federal Revenue Office (the central tax  collection organization), and Federal Police authorities in the  neighboring country are concerned with the volume of drug  trafficking operations in Brazil, and in the next few days will  start a large joint operation to exchange information, trying to  detect any money laundering scheme used in the country. No one  doubts that the U.S. DEA will follow the Brazilian  anti-narcotics operation very closely and that one of the  study's main targets will be precisely the Ciudad del Este-Foz  do Iguacu axis.

The  police formed a special group to foil this attempt. The police  saw the said car with a fake license plate numbered 859638  coming towards Gulshanabad check post. The police party as  planned pursued the car and sent information by wireless to Laji  police to stop that car. When the suspect car arrived near Laji,  the police there signaled the suspect car to stop at a blockade.  The imposter accelerated instead of stopping.

Police officers will  follow up the case closely in accordance with their preliminary  assumption, which is based on the evidence. Further information  will be sought. Although preventive measures have been regularly  reviewed and implemented, there are still some loopholes, he  noted.    Commenting on the same incident, Deputy Prime Minister  Bunchu  Rotchanasathian said the National Security Council has followed  up the issue. He admitted that it is fortunate that the  explosives were discovered before a serious incident occurred.  Regarding this, he believes it will not be difficult to find  the culprits.

The sources said that the most important organization  targeted by the campaign is an organization which calls itself  ""the British branch of the Islamic Liberation Party.""    The police has sent documents obtained during the storming  and searching of houses of some members of the organization to  the attorney general and the home secretary to take urgent  measures.    The documents include propaganda material calling for the  hijacking of passenger planes and the use of terrorist methods,  on the grounds that they are legitimate means, to confront what  it terms ""real enemies of Islam.""    The organization is accused of inciting racist and  anti-Semitic feelings, thus violating British law.    So far the authorities have not officially proved the  existence of channels of communication between the British  organization and the ""Liberation"" parties operating in the  Middle East. As is known, one of the Liberation Party's  organizations was accused recently of trying to assassinate King  Husayn of Jordan.    The Liberation Army is officially banned from operating in  almost all Islamic states because it participated in violent  operations in several states, including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt,  and Indonesia. Its members are known as the Afghan Arabs, even  though a small number of them actually fought in Afghanistan.    Police sources say that the British branch of the Liberation  Party is active among university students in London, who come  from more than 20 Muslim countries, and recruits some of them.  The party is active in Birmingham, Bradford, and York among  students and emigrant workers from the Indian subcontinent and  Arab states.    Campaigns are launched against other groups operating as  charity organizations, especially to support Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Farid Qasim, spokesman for the British branch of the  Liberation Party, yesterday denied the accusations leveled at  the party by the police. He said that his group is carrying out  ""legal informational actions"" dissociated from any ""activities  violating the law.""    The information about the Liberation Party's activities and  other groups in Britain came from France and several Arab  states, according to the sources.    The police sources estimated the number of the  organization's  members in Britain at ""a few score,"" saying that some of them  received special training in states like Iran, Afghanistan, and  Sudan. The organization's members could face imprisonment or  expulsion from Britain if they are convicted of violating the  law.     "

LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A murder suspect was killed in a shoot-out with police in a Wilmington  neighborhood after he shouted, ""If you want me, come and get me,"" authorities  said Sunday.    No officers were injured in the shooting, which occurred as officers chased the  suspect through back yards and into the 1500 block of East Cruces Street about  7 p.m. Saturday, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Kathleen Murcott.    The murder suspect, a 23-year-old man, was not identified pending notification  of relatives.    The suspect was wanted in the Aug. 13 shooting death of Lanny Tapp during an  argument that took place a few blocks from Saturday's gun battle.    Police said they learned of the suspect's whereabouts Saturday from a resident  in the Wilmington neighborhood. Five officers went to Cruces Street, where  another resident pointed out the suspect and said he was carrying a gun,  Murcott said.    A chase ensued, with the suspect ending up in front of a Cruces Street  residence, where Officers Michael Marco, 42, and Matthew Spillane, 24, were  waiting, Murcott said.

This operation was  coordinated with Mexican authorities who, through Operation  ""Azteca,"" have in recent days confiscated almost a ton of  cocaine in Mexico.    The drug traffickers were illicitly sending cocaine from  Colombia to the United States through Mexico, and a large part  of their illegal profits were returned to Ecuador to be invested  in real estate and luxury items.    On 28 December 1993 the police began the antidrug operation.  The organization in Mexico was led by Humberto Segundo  Montenegro Freire, a Colombian citizen now being held by the  Mexican authorities; 20 other persons in his organization, who  were Colombian, Mexican, and Spanish nationals, were also  arrested.    A number of Humberto Montenegro's close relatives lived in  Quito, including his mother, Clara Freire, his siblings,  Fernando Montenegro, Cecilia Montenegro, Carlos Montenegro, and  Liliana Montenegro, and his brother-in-law, Modesto Polo Perez.  They received the money that Humberto Montenegro sent from  Mexico, and invested it in real estate, luxury cars, jewels, and  other items. These funds were brought to Ecuador by couriers who  traveled back and forth between Mexico and Ecuador.    Operation ""Azteca"" was set up after the seizure of almost a  ton of cocaine in Mexico on 18 and 19 December 1993, leading to  the arrest of Humberto Montenegro and 20 of his colleagues.  After this operation in Mexico, and with confirmation of  intelligence reports on money transfers to Ecuador, the National  Police initiated Operation ""Azteca"" in Ecuador, acting in  coordination with Mexican authorities. This operation led to the  arrest of 11 persons and the seizure of a number of properties,  weapons, jewels, and numerous luxury cars.    After the operation, numerous bank accounts used by members  of the organization were identified. The police, acting in  coordination with the appropriate authorities, are investigating  the identities and movements of these accounts. Police sources  have said that since these inquiries have just begun, it will  not be possible to provide further information at this time.    The police stated that, at the time this report was  released,  there were no indications that Ecuadoran banks were supporting  or abetting these illicit activities. However, the  investigations are continuing, and they remain in contact with  officials from the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico, in  order to exchange information that may aid in the investigative  process in both countries. For that reason, an Ecuadoran  National Police delegation will soon visit Mexico.    The Ecuadoran police are working every day to maintain civil  peace in Ecuador, reported official police spokespersons.     "

After all, there were a few occasions when he showed no aggression, simply  walking away from suspects.    And there was the time the 85-pound dog was chased by a goose.    ""Some of the administrators wanted to get rid of him,"" said Police Officer  Frank LaVigne, the dog's handler.    But that is all behind Bill now.      Years of Chases    After extra hours of training by LaVigne, the dog proved his worth during more  than five years of chasing criminals. In more than 100 searches for suspects,  Bill was successful in 65 of them, police officials said.    So earlier this month, when the 9-year-old dog retired, he got his retirement  party, just like all other Police Department retirees.    Top police officials, including Police Chief Ron George, and LaVigne were there  to help celebrate.    The dog, who is suffering from arthritic-type problems in his joints, received  his share of presents.    There was a 12-by-18-inch white cake. Bill had several pieces.

Reflecting on the five years he and Bill spent together on the streets, LaVigne  said, ""Bill was mellow until he needed to be aggressive.""    Bill was smart and tough, LaVigne said.    LaVigne remembered the time, about three years ago, when Bill found a car-theft  suspect after other officers had given up the search.    Bill kept barking and scratching at a garage that police had locked after  searching it, LaVigne said.    The garage was searched again and the suspect was found hiding in a cabinet,  LaVigne said.    The suspect had somehow sneaked inside after the police made their initial  search, LaVigne said.    LaVigne also recalled the time, despite a cut paw, when Bill was able to hold  onto a man trying to flee after beating up a woman. The man had cut Bill's paw  with a large iron chain. Bill needed stitches to close the wound.    ""He was exceptional. He knew when to switch it on and when to switch it off,""  Sgt. Ralph Carter said.    During his retirement party, Bill showed his friendly side by playing with the  three small LaVigne children.    Later, he demonstrated his aggressiveness when LaVigne commanded him to tackle  a police officer who was pretending to be a fleeing criminal.    Bill will spend his retirement years with the LaVigne family at their Moreno  Valley home in Riverside County.

After Austria's entry into the European Union  [EU], their major task will be to control the 1,200-km external  EU border with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia,  and other countries.    Loeschnak, who flew to the Nikolsdorf border crossing on  board a Bell Augusta-type police helicopter, stated: ""The  control of the border by the police, customs officers, and the  Army has proven successful but is no permanent solution. Thus,  the historic opportunity that is opening up after entry into the  EU should be used to establish a uniform border police.""    In the event of EU membership, controls at the border with  Germany and Italy would no longer be necessary. Redundant  customs officers might be incorporated into the border police.  Currently, 3,800 customs officers are being asked whether they  want to continue to be employed by the Finance Ministry or  whether they want to join the border police. Loeschnak  mentioned the following major reform goals:     -  The equipping  of border control offices with computers to make it easier to  call up data of wanted persons.    -  Enabling the new border police  to slowly reduce the deployment of the Army at the  borders.    -  Strengthening the border police in the fight against  crime and illegal refugees.

ASIANS;    CULTURAL RIFT: OFFICERS IN ORANGE COUNTY'S LITTLE SAIGON MUST LEARN NEW SYSTEM  OF VALUES TO BE EFFECTIVE.      By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      On the streets of Orange County's Little Saigon, it's the little things that  can close the rift between an American police officer trying to get to the  bottom of a crime and a Vietnamese-American caught between two cultures.    It is disrespectful to touch a Vietnamese man on the head, summon him with an  index finger or show him the bottom of one's shoe while sitting. So is shaking  hands with a Vietnamese woman unless she is Americanized. If she is not, a  simple bow will do.    ""There are a lot of little things to be aware of with newcomers,"" said Santa  Ana Police Officer Di Au, a Vietnam War refugee. ""In Vietnam, for example, it's  customary when stopped by police to get out of your car and walk to the  officer. Here, you don't do that. It can cause tensions if police don't know  what to expect.""    Today, peace officers assigned to Southeast Asian communities in Orange County  and other parts of the nation receive cultural training to overcome a  traditional mistrust of law enforcement that impedes efforts to protect  Southeast Asian communities.    ""As police officers, you have to learn to work in Asian communities in a  different way,"" said San Francisco Police Sgt. Tom Perdue, of the city's Asian  gang detail. ""You subtly approach people and learn to function from their  perspective. Our concepts of right and wrong are the same, but we are 180  degrees apart in the way we act.""    Influenced by Buddhism, Taoism and Confucian thought, say Southeast Asian  historians, Southeast Asians dislike confrontation, and often try to take an  indirect approach to problems on their own. If a crime befalls them, they tend  to blame themselves for letting it happen.    Southeast Asians also are less likely than other Americans to talk about their  feelings in public or with someone they do not know, such as a police officer  who tries to question them about an incident.    ""Saving face,"" the act of avoiding shameful or embarrassing situations, comes  into play strongly when a crime has occurred. Police say Southeast Asians are  especially reluctant to report or talk about drug use, gang involvement, child  abuse, rape and other sexual assaults because of the risk of embarrassment to  their families.    ""They don't volunteer things. They only answer your questions, so you have to  dig a lot more to get any information,"" said Thien N. Cao, a Vietnamese refugee  who is now a police liaison officer in Garden Grove's Vietnamese community.    Further distancing police from the Southeast Asian community are customs that  are not accepted or legal in the United States, a situation that can lead to  misunderstandings with law enforcement.    For example, ""nickeling,"" a Vietnamese home remedy in which a coin is rubbed  hard on the side of a sick child's neck, could be misinterpreted as child abuse  by educators or social workers because it often leaves bruises.    Corporal punishment by parents is accepted as well, and many Southeast Asians  believe domestic violence should be solved within the family and without the  help of police or social service agencies.    The hesitancy to get involved, specifically for the Vietnamese and Cambodians,  is exacerbated by their experience with law enforcement in their home  countries.    Officers were often low paid, uneducated and corrupt. They often employed  methods such as coerced confessions, beatings and immediate jailings. After the  fall of Saigon in 1975, police were used by the communists to enforce the  regime and to jail political dissidents.    ""You need to sit back and ask, 'Where do these people come from?' You will see  they were brought up in an era of violence and not knowing who to trust, not  even the police,"" Perdue said.    Police and sheriff's departments have tried to close the culture gap with a  variety of training techniques ranging from 45-minute videotapes to  full-fledged classes at police academies.    In addition, the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a social service  agency that provides counseling and crime-prevention information, offers  quarterly seminars to police, probation officers and schoolteachers to teach  them how to cope with cultural differences.    ""Law enforcement officials are becoming more effective in communications,"" said  Nhu-hao Duong, a refugee coordinator for the Orange County Social Services  Agency. ""They are now careful about body language, their voices and hand  gestures.""    Duong said officers often misinterpret innocuous behavior, such as lack of eye  contact, as indications of deceit. Vietnamese, she said, look at the ground to  show respect and put their hands on their belts, one hand covering the other.    ""Police feel this can be shifty. They ask more questions and things can get  worse,"" Duong said.    Similarly, Officer Au said he has seen police get upset with Vietnamese who  were smiling when detained. The smile also can be a sign of respect. "" 'What,  do you think it's funny?' "" Au quoted officers as saying.    At the Orange County Sheriff's Academy, Westminster Detective Marcus Frank, who  specializes in Southeast Asian crime, teaches an eight-hour course. Videotapes  also have been produced by the Anaheim Police Department and the Orange County  Human Relations Commission.    Officers learn that they should, when practical, get permission from the head  of the household before talking to anyone else in the family. Out of respect,  men should be addressed as ong and women as ba.    ""If you don't see there is a cultural difference, you won't get anywhere,"" said  Garden Grove Sgt. Frank Hauptmann, who is assigned to the Asian detail. ""Just  the way you summon people can get you in trouble. Don't use your finger. That  is how a dog is summoned in Vietnam.""    Westminster Officer Robert Trotter, who is assigned to the Little Saigon  substation, said Vietnamese are more sensitive than others to being embarrassed  in front of their friends. So he tries to separate everyone at a crime scene  and question witnesses privately as much as possible.    Police officers in other communities have learned similar lessons over the  years.    Officer Al Lotz, a Vietnam War veteran who specializes in Southeast Asian crime  in Houston and teaches the culture to his fellow officers, said working in  Houston's Southeast Asian community demands patience and empathy.    ""I have developed compassion for them,"" Lotz said. ""They are being ripped off  by their own people, and they went through hell to get to this country, and all  they want to do is live in freedom. In my class, I try to explain how lost they  are and what it is like living between two cultures.""    Because Southeast Asians like to know whom they are dealing with, police soon  find out that they have to spend a great deal of time getting to know victims  and witnesses on a personal level before they will cooperate. On a social  level, they must attend merchant association meetings and cultural events.    Many times, officers say, they have to serve subpoenas in person and then drive  the witnesses to court to assure that they show up. Police also have to  re-interview witnesses and victims repeatedly before they begin to get usable  information.    On their rounds, officers try to explain that being a crime victim, even of  rape or sexual abuse, is not something to be so ashamed of that nothing should  done about it.    A few departments have created permanent community liaisons, usually a  Vietnamese, who stays in constant contact with the city's Southeast Asian  merchants and civic leaders.    ""If they don't know you, they won't talk to you,"" Garden Grove Police Chief  John Robertson said. ""We try to make regular rounds, but it takes years and  years to develop relationships. You have got to be in it for the long run.""    Cao, who fled Vietnam in 1975, has been the Garden Grove Police Department's  emissary of good will since 1981. Every week he goes door to door, covering  miles of pavement at scores of strip malls that are home to the county's  Vietnamese retailers.    His weapons are crime-prevention pamphlets in English and Vietnamese. It is a  treadmill of hair salons, groceries, bakeries, restaurants, jewelers,  clothiers, billiard parlors and drug stores.    ""This is like a sales job, only I am selling security,"" Cao said. ""At the  beginning, it was really humiliating. They didn't even want us in the store.  They'd look away or ignore us or ease us out the door.""    Cao said he did not wear his white and blue uniform for a while to make  merchants more comfortable when he dropped by to see them. Today, he leaves his  uniform on, testimony to some of the department's progress.    More Southeast Asians are reporting crime, but there are still difficulties  getting them to testify in court and cooperate with investigators.    Robertson said he repeatedly gets critical mail from citizens complaining that  the Southeast Asian community is getting special attention. He recently  received a batch of letters after his department sent out a bilingual  crime-prevention brochure in the city water bills.    ""I call this bigotry,"" Robertson said. ""If people could only understand that  everything is reversed for them -- culture, food, speech, clothes. They don't  know what to expect. They are fearful and wonder why it is held against them  for being here.""

Laurence W. Jarman, 70, was wounded by Police Officer C. Andrew Hoffman, 25,  after Jarman allegedly pointed a gun at the officer, who was trying to break up  a dispute between two other men outside Jarman's house in the 2900 block of  Imperial Avenue.    Hoffman fired several shots at Jarman, who was standing behind a screen door in  his house, police said. The elderly man reportedly fired at least one shot back  at the officer.    After Jarman retreated into his house, a SWAT team was called in. SWAT officers  made contact with Jarman by telephone and persuaded him to surrender. A search  of the home uncovered a loaded revolver, police said.    Jarman was wounded in the leg and foot, and was taken to UC San Diego Medical  Center. He was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.    In an unrelated shooting, Edmond White, 31, was wounded in the back while he  and some friends were drinking beer on the sidewalk at Greenlawn and Skyline  drives. Police said a gunman drove up, got out of his car and shot at the  group, hitting White.    White was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he was reported in serious but stable  condition late Sunday.

Laurence W. Jarman, 70, was wounded by Police Officer C. Andrew Hoffman, 25,  after Jarman allegedly pointed a gun at the officer, who was trying to break up  a dispute between two other men outside Jarman's house in the 2900 block of  Imperial Avenue.    Hoffman fired several shots at Jarman, who was standing behind a screen door in  his house, police said. The elderly man reportedly fired at least one shot back  at the officer.    After Jarman retreated into his house, a SWAT team was called in. SWAT officers  made contact with Jarman by telephone and persuaded him to surrender. A search  of the home uncovered a loaded revolver, police said.    Jarman was wounded in the leg and foot, and was taken to UC San Diego Medical  Center. He was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.    In an unrelated shooting, Edmond White, 31, was wounded in the back while he  and some friends were drinking beer on the sidewalk at Greenlawn and Skyline  drives. Police said a gunman drove up, got out of his car and shot at the  group, hitting White.    White was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he was reported in serious but stable  condition late Sunday.

POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING  3 OTHER INCIDENTS TO SEE IF THEY ARE RELATED.      By URSULA WILJANEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 19-year-old Atwater man was killed and three suspects were arrested during a  weekend of gang violence that included five drive-by shootings, police said.    Two of the drive-by shootings took place within a block of each other -- near  Avenue 34 and Verdugo Road -- and involved the same two rival gangs, said  Detective James McCann of the Los Angeles Police Department. Police are  investigating the other three incidents to see whether they are related, he  said.    The violence began Friday evening when four members of one gang drove by a  house at 2706 1/2 W. Avenue 34 and opened fire, McCann said. Several rival gang  members inside the house were armed and returned the fire, he said.    During the shoot-out, 19-year-old Anthony Marquez, who was sitting in the  passenger seat of the car, was fatally shot, McCann said. The other youths in  the car drove to his home in the 2900 block of Glenhurst Avenue and left  Marquez in the car in the driveway, telling his mother that Marquez needed  medical help, McCann said.    Marquez died several minutes later, McCann said.    A 17-year-old youth who police say belonged to Marquez's gang has been accused  of murder in Marquez's death. Police held the youth accountable under a  ""precarious liability"" statute, alleging that Marquez was killed during the  commission of a felony that the youth helped to plan and execute, McCann said.    The youth, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile, is being held in  Eastlake Juvenile Hall and was scheduled to be arraigned this week. He faces  charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit assault  with a deadly weapon and firing into an inhabited dwelling, McCann said.    On Monday afternoon, about six youths who police say were members of Marquez's  gang were standing in front of a market at Avenue 34 and Verdugo Road when  several youths from a rival gang drove by in a pickup truck and fired on them,  McCann said. Witnesses told police that four of the six youths on foot were  armed and fired back, he said.    The youths ran into a nearby lot, stashed their weapons in some refuse, then  forced their way into a woman's home at 3322 Verdugo Road and hid inside,  McCann said.    Witnesses told police that they saw a youth with a gunshot wound to his stomach  running away and clutching a gun, McCann said, but police so far have been  unable to confirm the injury.    When police arrived at the woman's house, they were able to get her and her  children out, McCann said, but the youths refused to emerge until about an hour  later when a police SWAT team threatened to enter.    Police questioned 10 youths from the two gangs and arrested two of the six who  had hidden inside the house, McCann said.    Max Figueroa, 21, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a weapon in violation  of his parole, McCann said. A 15-year-old, whose name was withheld because he  is a juvenile, was arrested on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a  negligent manner, carrying a concealed weapon and receiving stolen property,  McCann said.    In another drive-by shooting on Saturday, 20-year-old Johnny Rivera was shot at  a bus stop, McCann said.    Rivera was standing with three friends in front of a 7-Eleven store at Avenue  51 and Figueroa Street about 2:30 a.m. Saturday when several youths drove by in  a black car and fired one shot out the window, witnesses told police. Rivera  ran one block and collapsed where police found him, McCann said.    Rivera was taken to County-USC General Hospital, where he was reported in  stable condition Wednesday.    Police also are investigating two drive-by shootings that took place late  Monday night within a block of Monday afternoon's street shoot-out, McCann  said. No injuries were reported in those incidents, he said.

0,FT942-14274 ,"FT942-14274 _AN-EDUD3ACAFT 940421   FT  21 APR 94 / Adviser to dead Kuwaiti urged to come forward      By JIMMY BURNS   Police last night appealed for the financial adviser to the murdered member of one of Kuwait's wealthiest business families to help them with their inquiries. The adviser is thought to be a London stockbroker but his identity is not known. The victim - whose decapitated and burnt body was found in Manchester in December - was yesterday identified as Mr Adnan Abdul Hameed Al-Sane. His family business interests are thought to include several businesses and private holdings in the Middle East, properties in Europe and offshore bank accounts. Police said Mr Al-Sane was the youngest member of a family of 11 and the only one not living in Kuwait. Banking sources said he is understood to have left his country with a large debt after a local stock market crash. He is believed to have settled in London in 1986 after living for a period in Bahrain. Det Supt Bernard Rees of Manchester police, who is leading the investigation, said that he wanted to interview an individual who is believed to have advised Mr Al-Sane on his extensive interests. There is no suggestion that the individual was in any way involved with the murder. Police who searched Mr Al-Sane's apartment in Maida Vale, north London, discovered papers relating to his financial dealings missing from boxes of files. They have been told by close relatives that the files contained details of properties held in Switzerland, France, Jordan and the Cayman Islands, Swiss bank accounts and share certificates. According to the police, Mr Al-Sane's severed and mutilated head was found in Staffordshire seven weeks after the discovery of his torso near a Manchester railway station. The victim was identified by his solicitor after a photograph of a model of his head was circulated by police. The mystery surrounding Mr Al-Sane's macabre murder deepened yesterday when it emerged that a Jordanian citizen wounded with his girlfriend in a shooting incident in London at the weekend had been involved in a civil legal action involving Mr Al-Sane. The Jordanian, who is recovering in a London hospital, was being sued in connection with Pounds 600,000 that Mr Al-Sane claimed was owed to him.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Anthony Coleman, 19, was arrested Sunday night after he allegedly shot and  seriously wounded a 16-year-old girl, Lillian Kelley, who was nine months  pregnant, police said.    In the second case, police arrested Armando Cisneros, 39, on Saturday after he  allegedly knocked to the ground the woman with whom he lives and she suffered a  miscarriage.    Both men were held without bail on suspicion of murder, pending their  arraignments today in Pomona. Police said they believe it was likely that the  charges against Cisneros would be reduced, because murder charges can be filed  only if it is determined that the fetus would have been capable of surviving  outside the womb.    In the incident involving Coleman, Kelley's near-term fetus was killed when a  slug from a .38-caliber revolver pierced her abdomen as she sat in a Pomona  apartment that she was visiting, Pomona Police Detective Ed McLean said. Kelley  was listed in serious condition at Pomona Valley Community Hospital Monday, a  hospital spokeswoman said.    The shooting occurred after Yamil Henderson of Pomona, who was also visiting  the apartment, took out the revolver and began playing with it, police said.    ""He was cocking the gun, pointing it around, pointing it at himself,"" Pomona  Police Lt. Chuck Heilman said.    Coleman, who lived in the apartment, apparently was trying to take the gun away  from the man when it went off, McLean said.      Could Be Accident    ""It conceivably could just be an accident -- an unfortunate accident,"" Heilman  said.    The father of Kelley's unborn child was present at the time but was not  involved in the incident, he said. No charges were filed against Henderson.      Taken to Hospital    Police arrested Cisneros on suspicion of felonious assault after he allegedly  knocked down his girlfriend, Maria Barrios, 32, during a fight at their Pomona  apartment. Barrios, who was three months pregnant, complained of abdominal  pains after the incident and was taken to Pomona Valley Community Hospital,  where she miscarried, Heilman said.    Barrios was discharged from the hospital Sunday, a spokeswoman said. After the  miscarriage, police filed a murder complaint against Cisneros, Heilman said.    The district attorney's office had not decided Monday whether to file murder  charges against either man.

Police sources reported that terrorists planned to detonate  a  car bomb containing 600 kg of explosives in Lima on 17 May on  the 14th anniversary of the launching of the SL ""people's war.""    The attack was aborted when extremist Ayma Rosa Cabanillas  Contreras, 22 years old, was arrested. She confessed that she  was chosen to conduct the subversive operation and to provide  the necessary materials to those entrusted with perpetrating the  attack.    Cabanillas Contreras has four police records for involvement  in terrorist attacks. The police source said she was arrested  on 10 May ""after an exhaustive intelligence operation that  started about four months ago.""    Cabanillas has been placed at the disposal of the military  courts on charges of ""treason against the fatherland,"" the legal  term in Peru for aggravated terrorist crimes. If found guilty,  she could be sentenced to life imprisonment.    Cabanillas is the second SL leader to be arrested by the  Peruvian Police in the past two months. The police already  arrested Felipe Tenorio, believed to be the SL ""Number Two.""

The incident began at 1:30 p.m., when Officer Cinda R. Jauregui and other  narcotics officers attempted to serve a search warrant in the 4000 block of  36th Street, near University Avenue. Police Lt. Greg Clark said officers were  confronted by two men who fired at least one shot from a .22-caliber rifle.    Jauregui, who police said has been on the force more than 10 years, was shot in  the left hand. She was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where she underwent  surgery and was listed in good condition.    The injured suspect, identified as Jorge Gonzales, 25, was listed in serious  but stable condition Thursday night at Mercy Hospital. Doctors repaired eight  bullet wounds in his thighs, abdomen, buttocks, groin and hips, a hospital  spokeswoman said.    Gonzales was charged with possessing a controlled substance and possessing a  controlled substance for sale, police said. They did not specify what drug was  involved.    A second suspect, who escaped from the bungalow where the shooting occurred,  was captured at 5 p.m. Police identified the man as Ruben F. Flores, 21;  charges against him were pending.    According to Clark, the officers were looking for heroin when they arrived with  a search warrant. Clark said one of the men fired the rifle at the officers,  who returned fire. Investigators said they did not know how many shots were  fired by both sides. A rifle believed to have been used by a suspect was  recovered in the yard of the residence, and another rifle was found in some  bushes two houses away, Clark said.    Traffic was snarled for about two hours during the incident, as police  barricaded several blocks on University Avenue, east and west of 36th Street.  Police also ordered students at nearby Edison Elementary School and Wilson  Middle School to be kept indoors during the incident, as police surrounded an  entire block looking for the second suspect.    SWAT officers were called to search the bungalow for the second man. The search  proved fruitless, and officers began stopping and questioning men in the area  who resembled the suspect.

Tanabe is the leader of  Dinshoukai, a faction of Yamaguchi-gumi, one of the main mafia  organizations in Japan. The Federal Police [PF] arrested him in  Londrina, Parana State.    Police officer Itanor Neves Carneiro said: There are strong  indications that there are other Yakuza members in the country.    The PF suspect that Tanabe came to Brazil to run an  international drug-trafficking ring and to send Brazilian women  to Japan to work as prostitutes. The extradition request was  based on the seizure of 5.8 kg of cocaine in the Japanese city  of Shizuoka in February 1993. It was the fifth largest seizure  of cocaine in Japan, an amount worth $4 million in Japan and  $90,000 in Brazil. At that time trafficker Takahiro Shiba  confessed to the Japanese police that the cocaine had come from  Brazil, and that it belonged to Tanabe.    Like most Yakuza members, Tanabe has tattoos on his body  from  his chest down to his ankles. Upon his transfer to Sao Paulo,  Tanabe confirmed that he is a ranking member of Yamaguchi-gumi,  but declined to give details. Nor did he want to explain why  one digit of the little finger on his left hand had been severed.    Tanabe has a daughter born in Brazil -- Mary, 10 months old  -- and was living with her and his Japanese wife, Kiyomi, in  Brazil.     "

OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER      A San Diego fisherman drowned when his boat capsized in San Diego Bay off  Shelter Island Tuesday morning -- apparently after a luxury cabin cruiser had  sped by, creating a formidable wake.    Thomas Corona, 64, of the 1700 block of Petra Drive, died after several  attempts at resuscitation at the scene and at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital, the  county medical examiner's office said.    His boat, the 40- to 45-foot Chaser, was returning from a fishing trip, Harbor  Police Sgt. Robert Irwin said. He said it flipped over in about 45 feet of  water in the main ship channel about 300 yards south of Shelter Island, near  buoy 16.    Irwin said witnesses said the Chaser, as well as an 80-foot, white cabin  cruiser, were headed into the bay, toward downtown, side by side.    The witnesses said the wake from the bigger boat -- which they said was  traveling at about 25 m.p.h. -- could have caused the Chaser to capsize. The  witnesses said the cabin cruiser, which had gold lettering on its stern,  continued down the bay without stopping.    Irwin also said the witnesses, who were on shore, could not make out the name  of the boat other than it ending in the word sea.    Meanwhile, the Chaser, which witnesses said had been traveling about 5 m.p.h.,  rolled over, and very little was visible above water.    ""It virtually capsized to where the hull tucked over and rolled on its  starboard side,"" Irwin said.    A 41-foot U.S. Coast Guard rescue boat, which was within two minutes of the  Chaser, immediately responded, Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Driscoll said.    Divers from the Harbor Police arrived shortly after, fighting to free Corona,  who was trapped underneath.    Once Corona was pulled onto the rescue boat, the divers performed  cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Meanwhile, the boat's only other occupant,  49-year-old Ben Storniolo of San Diego, swam away from the Chaser and was  pulled from the water unharmed.    Irwin said authorities did not find the boat the witnesses had described. ""The  description was real sketchy,"" he said.    If the boat is located, he said, it's unclear whether the captain could be  prosecuted.    ""We would need to determine if there was any negligence on his part,"" Irwin  said. ""According to witnesses (the captain of the cabin cruiser) might not even  have been aware of what happened.""    According to Driscoll, there is no speed limit in the bay ""per se, but you are  responsible for the safe operation of your vessel.""    ""People are responsible for any damage their wake puts up,"" Irwin added. Harbor  Police are investigating.    Tuesday evening, the Harbor Police, who had been using flotation devices to try  to raise the boat, said they will attempt it again today in conjunction with  the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.    ""It was an effort, but they did not get it up all the way,"" Harbor Police Sgt.  Sharon Bergan said. ""Part of it is showing"" above the water.

More than 50 people  were wounded in the explosion. Five people who were gravely  wounded were transferred to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, where  one of them died of her wounds. Another four wounded are  currently being transferred to the Tel Hashomer Hospital. Eight  of the wounded were released; 33 people were hospitalized in the  'Afula Hospital with light to moderate injuries.    Police Minister Shahal and Police Commissioner Peled arrived  at the scene. Minister Shahal said that since the Hebron  massacre the Police feared Arab terrorist attacks, and several  attacks were indeed foiled. Commissioner Peled said that it is  possible that as of tomorrow no vehicles from the territories  will be allowed entrance into the Green Line, because it is  inconceivable that Israel would allow inhabitants of the  territories to enter the Green Line to carry out attacks. The  issue of the closure will also be reassessed. The commissioner  added that the timing of the attack -- 40 days after the Hebron  massacre -- did not surprise the police, which were recently  reinforced along the Green Line and in Jerusalem.    Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the car used for  the explosion was stolen from the Tel Aviv area.

The two  were arrested at dawn on Friday.    ORFK's Colonel Istvan Balatoni told reporters on Friday that  14-15 flats were searched, fascist publications and 500  swastika-emblems were confiscated, and 18-20 people were  questioned during the dawn sweep carried out in cooperation with  the Office for National Security.    According to Balatoni, the Hungarist Movement went public at  its April 27 news conference in order to recruit sympathizers,  because their founding document was signed only by 11 people,  some of whom told the police that they knew nothing of Szalasi's  ideology. (Ferenc Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led Hungary's fascist  Arrow-Cross Party and Hungarist Movement. He was executed as a  war-criminal in 1946.)    Balatoni stressed that charges of inciting ethnic hatred had  only been lodged against Szabo and Gyorkos, while the police  lacked sufficient evidence against the third Hungarist leader,  Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem. Last year for a similar crime Gyorkos was  sentenced to a year's imprisonment, suspended for three years.    The colonel denied any connection between the police action  and the Hungarian Democratic Forum presidium's Thursday morning  condemnation of the Hungarist Movement or Prime Minister Peter  Boross's Thursday afternoon statement to the same effect.  Balatoni said that preparing such a coordinated operation takes  a longer time, and it has to be carried out at a time when the  suspects are most probably at home.     "

By RICHARD A. SERRANO and TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      When Hubert Williams was police chief in Newark, N.J., during the early 1980s,  city officials imposed a hiring freeze, announced layoffs and eliminated almost  a third of his uniformed officers.    In retaliation, the police union picketed City Hall. Out-of-work officers  mounted a ""Fear City"" campaign and distributed bulletins warning visitors not  to shop in Newark lest they be robbed or mugged. Other officers stayed home  with the ""blue flu."" And the windows of 90 radio cars were shattered in the  police parking lot.    ""That was pure unadulterated hell,"" the chief recalled.    In Los Angeles, where a similar budget crisis is looming, Mayor Tom Bradley  this week ordered an emergency, seven-month hiring freeze -- in the midst of  one of the city's most violent years in history. The city may face a  $120-million budget deficit over the next 18 months if cost-cutting steps  aren't taken.    But his announcement drew immediate cries of doom of another kind. Some police  and community leaders Thursday warned that the city's crime rate might worsen  if the police drop their guard.    Some police officials predicted fewer officers on the beat, slower police  response times, less time for crime prevention work and sinking morale among  the LAPD's 8,400 sworn officers. Community activists also worried that the  hiring freeze would signal a field day for crooks, who already outnumber police  in parts of the inner city.    On Thursday, the day after the mayor ordered the halt on police hiring, City  Council member Joy Picus pledged to introduce a resolution to overturn the  freeze.    ""I will not stand still and let the number of officers be reduced,"" she said at  a news conference on the lawn of the LAPD's patrol station in Reseda. ""You  can't turn recruitment on and off like a switch and expect it to be  successful.""    Police officials said they lose about 400 officers each year through attrition,  with most of those positions being filled by graduates from the Police Academy.  They said that the seven-month freeze would translate into a loss of about 200  officers and that some recruitment and academy personnel might have to be  reassigned.    But they also said that 300 recruits enrolled in the academy will graduate in  the months ahead. The real crunch, they said, won't come until late spring or  early summer.    Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman, said there will be no  new classes started after December. He said the department is hoping that the  freeze is only temporary.    ""If it goes very long, then we'll get into a hole that is very difficult to get  out of,"" he said.    A short-term freeze, on the other hand, might ""turn out to be nothing more than  an uncomfortable hiccup,"" he said.    Chief Daryl F. Gates said the city's ""roller coaster"" style of management is to  blame for the budget crisis. He said that for years he has asked for a  contingency fee in his budget to pay for equipment and other costs but that  ""that has gone on deaf ears.""    Other police departments have been down this road.    In Houston, a cutback resulted in a 3% reduction in police salaries, he said.  In New York, he added, the mayor is requiring a 1% cut in salaries for all  police managers. He said New Orleans for a while put their police officers on a  reduced, four-day workweek.    Two weeks ago, a panel of Washington civic leaders concluded that its Police  Department was poorly organized, with one out of five officers not working in  the field. The group, brushing away contentions that there is a link between  crime and police manpower, called for a 27% reduction in the Police  Department's 6,024 uniformed and civilian positions.    Their premise is not supported by all law enforcement experts. Many believe  that an increased police presence on the street goes a long way to stemming  crime.    ""It's common sense that when you're speeding and you pass a cop, you slow  down,"" said Jerry Needles, director of police organizational services for the  International Assn. of Chiefs of Police in Washington.    ""Or, if you're going to pull a burglary or rape somebody and you see a cop on  the block, what would you do? Well, you'd change your mind real fast. It's that  simple.""    Police experts and citizen groups also worry about what effect the freeze will  have on crime prevention. They believe that successful programs like the DARE  drug education effort in the schools help reduce future crime rates.    Ralph Sutton, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles, said that  if police crime prevention suffers, community groups like his will have to step  in.    ""It would signal an opportunity for us, at a time of adversity, to take control  of our situation and help the police, who would be undermanned to do their  job,"" he said. ""We'll need more people in the community involved in sending  notices to the criminal element that we will drive them out.""

""I will not stand still and let the number of officers be reduced,"" she said at  a news conference on the lawn of the LAPD's patrol station in Reseda. ""You  can't turn recruitment on and off like a switch and expect it to be  successful.""    Police officials said they lose about 400 officers each year through attrition,  with most of those positions being filled by graduates from the Police Academy.  They said that the seven-month freeze would translate into a loss of about 200  officers and that some recruitment and academy personnel might have to be  reassigned.    But they also said that 300 recruits enrolled in the academy will graduate in  the months ahead. The real crunch, they said, won't come until late spring or  early summer.    Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman, said there will be no  new classes started after December. He said the department is hoping that the  freeze is only temporary.    ""If it goes very long, then we'll get into a hole that is very difficult to get  out of,"" he said.    A short-term freeze, on the other hand, might ""turn out to be nothing more than  an uncomfortable hiccup,"" he said.    Chief Daryl F. Gates said the city's ""roller coaster"" style of management is to  blame for the budget crisis. He said that for years he has asked for a  contingency fee in his budget to pay for equipment and other costs but that  ""that has gone on deaf ears.""    Other police departments have been down this road.    In Houston, a cutback resulted in a 3% reduction in police salaries, he said.  In New York, he added, the mayor is requiring a 1% cut in salaries for all  police managers. He said New Orleans for a while put their police officers on a  reduced, four-day workweek.    Two weeks ago, a panel of Washington civic leaders concluded that its Police  Department was poorly organized, with one out of five officers not working in  the field. The group, brushing away contentions that there is a link between  crime and police manpower, called for a 27% reduction in the Police  Department's 6,024 uniformed and civilian positions.    Their premise is not supported by all law enforcement experts. Many believe  that an increased police presence on the street goes a long way to stemming  crime.    ""It's common sense that when you're speeding and you pass a cop, you slow  down,"" said Jerry Needles, director of police organizational services for the  International Assn. of Chiefs of Police in Washington.    ""Or, if you're going to pull a burglary or rape somebody and you see a cop on  the block, what would you do? Well, you'd change your mind real fast. It's that  simple.""    Police experts and citizen groups also worry about what effect the freeze will  have on crime prevention. They believe that successful programs like the DARE  drug education effort in the schools help reduce future crime rates.    Ralph Sutton, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles, said that  if police crime prevention suffers, community groups like his will have to step  in.    ""It would signal an opportunity for us, at a time of adversity, to take control  of our situation and help the police, who would be undermanned to do their  job,"" he said. ""We'll need more people in the community involved in sending  notices to the criminal element that we will drive them out.""

Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said the investigation involved employees ""pretty  high up"" in the department, but he would not name them or say what actions are  under review. The investigator, Leslie (Pete) Norregard of Irvine, will report  directly to City Manager James C. Hankla, according to a Police Department  memo.    One police officer who confirmed that he was interviewed by Norregard said he  was asked whether Deputy Chief David Dusenbury was involved in any misconduct,  including an incident three years ago in which Dusenbury allegedly hired as his  secretary a woman with misdemeanor arrest record of prostitution and petty  theft.    The officer, Jack O'Neil Jr., said he was asked similar questions in December  by a deputy police chief who oversees the department's internal affairs  section.    Dusenbury, who once headed the department's vice squad and had a reputation for  being tough on prostitution, refused to comment. He referred questions to  Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley, who also said he could not to comment.    One former police official, retired Deputy Chief William Stovall, said Monday  that he raised questions about Dusenbury's choice of a secretary with  then-Chief Charles B. Ussery. Dusenbury told him he knew of the woman's  criminal past and promised to fire her if she got in trouble again, Stovall  said. But Stovall said he was worried because the woman had access to police  computer records.    The secretary worked for the police force for only a month, Stovall said. He  did not know why she left.    Before he retired in August, 1987, Stovall said, he also told the new Police  Chief Binkley about the incident.    The current investigation was disclosed recently in a memorandum to the city's  650 police officers. In it, Binkley asked that all department employees  cooperate with Norregard in an inquiry that is ""being conducted under and  directly for"" Hankla.    Kell said the hiring of a private detective was unusual but may become more  commonplace to lend credibility to investigations of alleged police misconduct.    ""It hasn't worked too well having the police investigate the police,"" the mayor  said.    Three plans to create a police review board or have an independent investigator  are being reviewed by the Long Beach City Council.

0," FR940511-1-00037   FR940511-1-00009        Under the PPPA, effectiveness standards have been established for special packaging (16 CFR 1700.15), as has a procedure for evaluating the effectiveness (16 CFR 1700.20). Regulations have been issued requiring special packaging for a number of household products (16 CFR 1700.14). The findings that the Commission must make in order to issue a standard requiring child-resistant (``CR'') packaging for a product are discussed below in Section D of this notice. For the purposes of the PPPA, the amount of a substance ``in a single package'' that triggers the requirement to place the product in CR packaging refers to the total amount in a single retail unit of the substance.   The PPPA allows the Commission to require CR packaging for household substances, which include foods, drugs, or cosmetics as these terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321). 15 U.S.C. 1471(2)(B). Mouthwashes are either drugs, if they make medical claims, or cosmetics.   Section 4(a) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1473(a), allows the manufacturer or packer to package a nonprescription product subject to special packaging standards in one size of non-CR packaging only if (1) the manufacturer (or packer) also supplies the substance in CR packages and (2) the non-CR packages bear conspicuous labeling stating: ``This package for households without young children.'' 15 U.S.C. 1473(a). If the package is too small to accommodate this label statement, the package may bear a label stating: ``Package not child-resistant.'' 16 CFR 1700.5(b). The right of the manufacturer or packer to market a single size of the product in noncomplying packaging under these conditions is termed the ``single-size exemption.''   The Commission may restrict the right to market a single size in noncomplying packaging if the Commission finds that the substance is not also being supplied in popular size packages that comply with the standard. 15 U.S.C. 1473(c). In this case, the Commission may, after giving the manufacturer or packer an opportunity to comply with the purposes of the PPPA and an opportunity for a hearing, order that the substance be packaged exclusively in CR packaging. To issue such an order, the Commission must find that the exclusive use of special packaging is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the PPPA.       2. The Mouthwash Petition       On March 2, 1993, the Commission was petitioned to require child resistant packaging for mouthwashes containing more than 5 percent ethanol. The term ``mouthwash'' includes liquid products that are variously called mouthwashes, mouthrinses, antiseptics, gargles, fluoride rinses, anti-plaque rinses, and breath fresheners. It does not include throat sprays or aerosol breath fresheners. The petition was submitted by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and 28 states, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.   The petitioners stated several reasons for their request: (1) Many mouthwashes contain high percentages of ethanol, an extremely toxic substance, in a package large enough to cause children serious injury or death; (2) these mouthwashes are accessible to children because they are generally considered innocuous and do not have CR packages; (3) they are attractive to children because of their appealing taste, color, and smell; and (4) data show that children have been seriously injured or died from accidental ingestion of ethanol-containing mouthwashes.   On November 17, 1993, the Commission granted the petition. Although the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (``NDMA'') and the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association (``CTFA'') had announced plans to implement a voluntary program to place mouthwashes with more than 5 percent ethanol in CR containers, the Commission found that mandatory action still may be necessary. In April 1994, the NDMA and CTFA notified the Commission that the products subject to their voluntary program had been changed from mouthwashes with more than 5 percent ethanol to mouthwashes with 3 grams or more in a single container.       B. Toxicity       The Commission's toxicity review indicates that mouthwashes with ethanol can present a serious ingestion hazard to children. Most of the popular adult mouthwashes contain between 14 percent and 27 percent ethanol. By comparison, beer contains between 5 percent and 7 percent ethanol and wine contains 12 to 14 percent ethanol.   Ethanol depresses the central nervous system. Symptoms of acute ethanol poisoning in children include irritability, lethargy, and unconsciousness which can lead to coma and death at high doses. Lethal blood levels of ethanol in children are reported to range between 250 and 500 mg/dl, and the lethal dose of ethanol is 3 g/kg. Deaths or serious injury could occur at lower doses due to other ethanol-induced effects. Ethanol poisoning in children can produce certain metabolic complications such as hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypokalemia.   A review of the relevant literature shows that three deaths of children under 5 years of age have been reported. The most recent death reported occurred in 1992 and involved a 3-year-old girl who ingested an unknown amount of mouthwash that contained 18 percent ethanol. Several other cases of ethanol-induced hypoglycemia or toxicity following mouthwash ingestion are reported in the literature.   The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (``NEISS'') reported 36 cases of ethanol-containing mouthwash from January 1987 through November 1993. Based on these ingestions, it was estimated that a total of 1,670 mouthwash poisoning cases were treated in hospital emergency rooms in the United States during that time. An estimated 81 percent of these children were 1 or 2 years old, and about 5 percent of the children were hospitalized.

In April 1994, the NDMA and CTFA notified the Commission that the products subject to their voluntary program had been changed from mouthwashes with more than 5 percent ethanol to mouthwashes with 3 grams or more in a single container.       B. Toxicity       The Commission's toxicity review indicates that mouthwashes with ethanol can present a serious ingestion hazard to children. Most of the popular adult mouthwashes contain between 14 percent and 27 percent ethanol. By comparison, beer contains between 5 percent and 7 percent ethanol and wine contains 12 to 14 percent ethanol.   Ethanol depresses the central nervous system. Symptoms of acute ethanol poisoning in children include irritability, lethargy, and unconsciousness which can lead to coma and death at high doses. Lethal blood levels of ethanol in children are reported to range between 250 and 500 mg/dl, and the lethal dose of ethanol is 3 g/kg. Deaths or serious injury could occur at lower doses due to other ethanol-induced effects. Ethanol poisoning in children can produce certain metabolic complications such as hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypokalemia.   A review of the relevant literature shows that three deaths of children under 5 years of age have been reported. The most recent death reported occurred in 1992 and involved a 3-year-old girl who ingested an unknown amount of mouthwash that contained 18 percent ethanol. Several other cases of ethanol-induced hypoglycemia or toxicity following mouthwash ingestion are reported in the literature.   The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (``NEISS'') reported 36 cases of ethanol-containing mouthwash from January 1987 through November 1993. Based on these ingestions, it was estimated that a total of 1,670 mouthwash poisoning cases were treated in hospital emergency rooms in the United States during that time. An estimated 81 percent of these children were 1 or 2 years old, and about 5 percent of the children were hospitalized.          "

Tanabe is the leader of  Dinshoukai, a faction of Yamaguchi-gumi, one of the main mafia  organizations in Japan. The Federal Police [PF] arrested him in  Londrina, Parana State.    Police officer Itanor Neves Carneiro said: There are strong  indications that there are other Yakuza members in the country.    The PF suspect that Tanabe came to Brazil to run an  international drug trafficking ring and to send Brazilian women  to Japan to work as prostitutes. The extradition request was  based on the seizure of 5.8 kg of cocaine in the Japanese city  of Shizuoka in February 1993. It was the fifth largest seizure  of cocaine in Japan, an amount worth $4 million in Japan and  $90,000 in Brazil. At that time trafficker Takahiro Shiba  confessed to the Japanese police that the cocaine had come from  Brazil, and that it belonged to Tanabe.    Like most Yakuza members, Tanabe has tattoos on his body  from  his chest down to his ankles. Upon his transfer to Sao Paulo,  Tanabe confirmed that he is a ranking member of Yamaguchi-gumi,  but declined to give details. Nor did he want to explain why  one digit of the little finger on his left hand had been severed.    Tanabe has a daughter born in Brazil -- Mary, 10 months old  -- and was living with her and his Japanese wife, Kiyomi, in  Brazil.     "

The killers kidnapped  his wife, Marija, who owned a little cafe on Dolac which the Zec  family had obtained in the past thanks to good connections with  powerful people, mainly Serbs in the communist system, and his  daughter Aleksandra (age 12). Marija and Aleksandra were later  shot and killed. The bodies were found near the Adolfovac  mountain lodge on Sljeme.    A week after that crime the Croatian police arrested  suspects  who confessed to the murders during the investigation. They were  Nebojsa H., Munib S., Sinisa R., and Igor M., who took part in  Zec's murder and the kidnapping of his wife and daughter, and  Suzana Z., who accompanied the murderers.    In mid-December of the year before last, all the suspects  were already in prison pending the investigation. It was learned  from police circles that they had confessed to that and certain  other crimes. The Zec case seemed to have been solved.    But some 10 months after the murder of Mihajlo Zec, his wife  Marija, and his daughter Aleksandra, charges were dropped  against the arrestees because of procedural mistakes in  investigatory proceedings. Their lawyers felt that there was a  good chance of an acquittal even if there had not been those  procedural mistakes, because under the conditions of an  immediate danger of war (and those conditions prevailed in  Croatia in the fall and winter of 1991) even members of the  reserves of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MUP] had the right  to use firearms in a number of critical situations, for example,  if a person attempted to flee to avoid arrest.    All those suspected of having murdered the Zec family were  members of a reserve unit of the MUP whose commander was  Tomislav Mercep. This is Mercep's famous unit that played a  decisive role in the defense of Gospic and liberation of part of  western Slavonia; it was initially founded back in the time of  Vukovar, when Mr. Mercep was responsible for defense of that  city, and from time to time serious violations of the rules of  war have been attributed to its members.    At the time of the crime against the Zec family, there was  talk in Croatia about the disappearance of a certain number of  Serbs from Zagreb. There was also talk about the mysterious  disappearance of certain Croats well-known to the public.    The best-known of these cases was the disappearance of Mrs.  Marina Nuic, president of the Kraljevica branch of the HDS  [Croatian Democratic Party]; nothing is known about her fate  even today.    Not only that, but several members of the Croatian Armed  Forces, most of them members of the MUP reserves, have also  disappeared.    Two years after these enigmatic disappearances, some of  whose  victims were relatively well-known, representatives of the  United Nations want to do some digging in the area of Pakrac,  where it is said that several murdered Serbian civilians have  been buried.    According to the information we have obtained, those buried  in the zone of Pakracka Poljana are not only Serbs, but also  Croats, indeed distinguished Croatian nationalists who in the  dramatic months toward the end of 1991 seemed dangerous to  someone.    How the Zec Family Was Killed    The Croatian police have reacted promptly and effectively to  a number of the mysterious disappearances. The contents of an  extensive police investigation were submitted to a few of the  highest officials of the Croatian Government some six or seven  months ago. That ""report"" ran to 13 typed pages and was  classified as a state secret.    ""The report was written by one of the Croatian intelligence  services,"" says a government official who has had it in his  possession.    The full title of the document, which we obtained from the  very top leadership of the government, reads: ""Report Drafted  Concerning the Criminalistic Workup of the Murder of Mihajlo  Zec, His Wife Marija, and His Daughter Aleksandra, and Also  Related to Information About Persons of Serbian Nationality  Taken From the City of Zagreb and Other Areas to the  Headquarters of a Reserve Unit of the MUP of the RH [Republic of  Croatia], Where Several of Those Persons, as Well as Members of  the Reserve Unit of the RH MUP, Were Killed."" The ""Report""  begins with a description of the murder of the Zec family. It  states precisely that on or about 2300 hours on 7 December 1991  members of the MUP reserves in camouflage uniforms were taken in  a van and a VW Golf automobile to No. 22 Poljanicka Street in  Zagreb.    According to the police report, which was later published in  all the major Croatian newspapers, they were Munib Suljic, who  was age 32 at the time; Sinisa Rimac, age 19; Igor Mikola, age  20; Nebojsa Hodak, age 25; and Snjezana Zivanovic, age 20.    Because Mihajlo Zec attempted to flee from the house, one of  these five members of the MUP reserve unit killed him with  rounds from an automatic rifle. Following the murder, the  persons in camouflage uniforms took about 30,000 dinars from the  house and took away the murdered man's wife and daughter. They  took them to the Adolfovac, where they bound, gagged, and  blindfolded them and then killed and buried them.    The statement by Munib Suljic, who allegedly led the  suspects, is quoted in the ""Report."" According to that  statement, at the Zagreb fairgrounds, where the equipment  storehouse of their unit was located, he was given the  assignment of finding and bringing in Mihajlo Zec by the  commander Zvonko Trusic in the presence of Tomislav Mercep.    When the police searched the house of the Zec family, they  found a threatening letter sent to Zec from Zagreb on 29  November 1991. We quote the letter in its entirety:    ``1. You have until 24 December, and by that date you must  leave Croatia. Beginning on 25 December and thereafter, your  life will not be worth anything.    ``2. You may not convey your house and other real estate  (Tresnjevka Opstina and the Assembly of the city of Zagreb have  been notified). It will all be turned over to the Croatian state  to care for Croats who have been the victims of genocide.    ``3. We know that you have sent out foreign exchange along  with your gold, but because this was taken from Croatia there  will also be punishment for that.    ``HOP    ``Croatian Defense Movement    ""It is our sacred duty to cleanse Croatia within a period of  24 months so that not a single peasant sandal [opanak] treads  any longer on this holy land.""    The police officials who drafted the report added that the  HOP [Croatian Defense Movement], along with certain people from  abroad, had been established by certain well-known politicians  of the Republic of Croatia so that they could operate outside  the legal and political system of the Croatian state.    The case of the Zec family was obviously an occasion for the  Croatian security services to devote serious attention to  discovering those responsible for the disappearance of several  people of Serbian and Croatian nationality. Some of those  disappearances are described in detail in the ""Report.""    The Horrible Deaths of Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic    The case of Milos Ivosevic is the first one mentioned after  the killing of Mihajlo, Marija, and Aleksandra Zec.    According to the ""Report,"" on 31 October 1991 members of the  reserve unit of the MUP already mentioned picked up Ivosevic,  who headed the customs office in the Zagreb railroad switchyard,  whose address was No. 81 Rudeska Road, and took him to the  Zagreb fairgrounds along with Rado Paic and Marko Gruic, whom he  knew. Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic were later taken to Pakracka  Poljana. A fairly new Golf automobile, 20,000 dinars, and about  300 German marks [DM] were taken from Ivosevic.    The ""Report"" said that Ivosevic, Paic, and Gruic, along with  nine other persons unnamed from Pakracka Poljana, were taken to  the basement of a house in the village Bujavice near Pakrac,  where B.M., J.A., A.A., Z.A., and a person known as ""Bego,""  members of the reserve unit of the MUP which has been mentioned,  shot and killed them.    The bodies of those killed were found in the village  Bujavice  and were taken to the Bureau for Forensic Medicine and  Criminalistics in Zagreb, where an autopsy was performed, and  after that they were taken by their families.    It is of particular interest that the automobile of the  murdered Milan Ivosevic was found in the possession of those  suspected of having murdered the Zec family. The police returned  that car to the Ivosevic family. According to the testimony of  one of the members of the MUP reserve unit who was interrogated,  Milos Ivosevic was arrested by order of Zvonko Trusic.    The Murder and Robbery of Stevan Brajenovic    The next case that the ""Report"" describes in detail concerns  another customs officer, Stevan Brajenovic, head of the Dobovo  customhouse, who on 8 November 1991 was taken from his residence  at No. 14 Djuro Simunic Street in Zagreb by B.T., M.B., and two  other members of ""Mercep's unit.""    According to the ""Report,"" the auxiliary police also drove  away Brajenovic's Toyota Corolla. Brajenovic was taken to the  Zagreb fairgrounds and then to Pakracka Poljana, where on 12  December 1991 he received a wound in the abdomen. He was shot by  a guard nicknamed Karlo. At the time when the ""Report"" was  written, Brajenovic's car was being used to meet the unit's  needs, and the money taken from Brajenovic (about DM10,000) was  delivered to P.Dj., an active employee of the Police Department  in Zagreb, who for a time was commander of the unit in Pakracka  Poljana.    The Murder of Ina Zoricic-Nuic    The authors of the ""Report"" make reference to the statement  by M.S., who said that Brajenovic was arrested by order of  Zvonko Trusic. The following case, which the ""Report"" describes  in detail, does not involve Croatian citizens of Serbian  nationality, but a Croatian woman, whose disappearance has been  frequently discussed in our media. We are referring to Ina  Zoricic-Nuic, known as Marina Nuic, born 1960. Marina Nuic was  the head of the HDS in Kraljevica. Her father was a member of  the HDZ, and Mrs. Nuic was responsible for the housing of  refugees from Slavonia in the coastal area known as Primorje.    According to the ""Report,"" she was arrested on 3 November  1991 near the Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb at the funeral of Pavo  Mlinaric, a member of the MUP reserve unit that has been  referred to here.    The authors of the ""Report"" think that Ina Zoricic-Nuic was  arrested because she had prepared an assassination attempt on  Tomislav Mercep. In any case, she was also taken to the Zagreb  fairgrounds, where she was interrogated by P.Dj., the unit's  commander who has already been mentioned. Following the  interrogation, Ina Zoricic-Nuic, the ""Report"" explicitly states,  was taken to Pakracka Poljana by order of Tomislav Mercep  himself. J.A. and S.R., members of the MUP reserve unit, shot  and killed her in Pakracka Poljana. Ina Zoricic-Nuic, according  to the ""Report,"" was buried approximately 1 km from the  improvised prison in Pakracka Poljana in the direction of Janja  Lipa.    The Murder of Aleksandar Antic    One other Croat was killed at that time in Pakracka Poljana.  This was Aleksandar Antic, who himself belonged to the MUP  reserve unit. Aleksandar ""Sasa"" Antic was allegedly killed  because he had taken from Tomislav Mercep's car ""a sizable  number of blank identity cards of reserves of the MUP of the  Republic of Croatia."" The ""Report"" says that Antic was killed by  I.M. and S.R., members of the same unit, and that the commanders  of that unit knew about the murder.    The ""Report"" also states that N.P. and B.V., Serbs from  Kutina who had to dig the grave in which Aleksandar Antic was  buried, were present at the murder of Aleksandar Antic.    N.P. and B.V., Serbs from Kutina, are the only victims whose  names we are not publishing, solely because these are people who  survived Pakracka Poljana. According to the police report, they  were arrested by K.P., a member of the MUP reserve unit who  owned a private butcher shop in Zagreb, with the help of several  persons whom the police had been unable to identify at the time  when the report was written.    Two Mercedeses and one BMW were taken from the Kutina Serbs,  as well as appliances and equipment from their homes. N.P. and  B.V. spent about a month in prison without any court order  whatsoever. During that time, according to the ""Report,"" they  were tortured (electric current was applied to them, wire and  nightsticks were forced into their rectum, and so forth). They  were released on 18 December 1991. One of them spent some time  in Zagreb hospitals, where he was treated for injuries received  while he was in prison.    The ""Report"" says that several dozen persons from the area  of  Zagreb, Kutina, and other towns were taken to the prison in  Pakracka Poljana, ""from what we know now."" The drafters of the  ""Report"" suggest that the persons taken were mainly quite rich,  and ""quite valuable personal property"" was taken from them at  the same time.    The Murder of Djuro Dobrota and Nedeljko Igric    Certain cases of the unclarified disappearance of Croatian  citizens in other parts of the country are also mentioned near  the end of the ""Report."" It says first that ""the unit of the MUP  RH reserve unit under command of Mr. Tomislav Mercep"" took part  in military operations in the region of Vukovar and then in the  region of Gospic. It says that on the territory of Gospic that  unit operated the same way it had on the territory of Pakrac. It  refers to several cases of murder or kidnapping.    Thus, in Karlobag, according to the ""Report,"" members of the  MUP reserve unit that Tomislav Mercep formed took custody of and  arrested the retired policeman Djuro Dobrota, whose personal car  they confiscated. S.J., M.I., and R.S. shot Dobrota on the road  between Velebeni and Ostarija.    These same reserve policemen, members of the special Mercep  unit, arrested in Karlobag Nedeljko Igric, whom, according to  the ""Report,"" they beat with a metal rod in a police Landrover.  Then they executed him before a firing squad.    The automobile of Momcilo Cipcic of Gospic, who was taken to  Karlobag with his wife Veselinka and two Croats, was also found  in the possession of members of that unit. The Ciplic family and  their friends, who disappeared in the autumn of 1991, had not  been found by the time when the ""Report"" was written.    The ""Report"" also mentions a case from Vukovar, where  Tomislav Mercep was the principal organizer of the city's  defense until the arrival of Mile ""Hawk"" Dedakovic, who is being  tried right now in Zagreb for having embezzled money.    The authors of the ""Report"" believe that a person nicknamed  ""Gango"" in the group of M.P., one of the leaders of the defense  of Vukovar in the summer of 1991, murdered the director of the  SDK [Social Accounting Service] in Vukovar and took from the  safe a large amount of money (the figure of no less than DM20  million is mentioned!), as well as jewelry, gems, and works of  art.    At the very end of the ""Report"" it is said that the cited  information was obtained through talks with the murder suspects,  who were all members of the MUP reserve unit under the command  of Tomislav Mercep.    The suspects were arrested and detained in the rooms of the  police administration headquarters in Zagreb on the basis of the  Decree on Internal Affairs in Wartime or Time of Immediate  Threat to the Independence and Unity of the Republic of Croatia.    It should also be emphasized that the drafters of the  ""Report,"" operatives in one of the Croatian security services,  mentioned the possibility that the members of the MUP reserve  unit, which was stationed in Pakracka Poljana, had lists of  people they were supposed to arrest and execute. Those lists  included names of Serbs and Croats, including even certain  employees of the Zagreb Police Department and the MUP of the  Republic of Croatia.    Will Any Members of the HDZ Be Charged With War Crimes?    Members of the unit in Pakracka Poljana obtained the  necessary information about employees of the Zagreb Police  Department and the MUP by telephoning the Zagreb Police  Department, according to the information of the authors of the  ""Report,"" mainly after 2100 hours. It is also important that  some members of the reserve unit, who had been under suspicion  of having actually committed murders, kidnappings, and  robberies, were recorded in police files even earlier as  criminals and thugs.    The Croatian police obviously took extensive steps to combat  the lawlessness and violence that existed in certain parts of  the Croatian Government. Much of the information published in  the ""Report""--which is classified as a state secret--was  gathered back in late 1991 and early 1992.    The ""Report"" itself was submitted to several of the highest  officials of the Croatian Government this past spring.    Before we came into the possession of one of the few copies  of the ""Report,"" one of the ministers in the Croatian Government  warned us that in view of the interest of UN representatives in  war crimes on the territory of Croatia some of the Croatian  politicians might soon find themselves before an international  court!    If certain Croatian political leaders received the ""Report""  back in the spring, it is logical to put the question: Why was  nothing undertaken by the judiciary, especially the state  prosecutor's office? Did Stjepan Herceg have to resign because  he did not win a single important case, or because he did not  want to act against people suspected of serious crimes who at  the same time had played a heroic role in the homeland war?    One of the most difficult postwar problems in Croatia is the  attitude toward those volunteers in the homeland war who  violated international war conventions (which Croatia has  adopted) and who committed crimes which cannot be justified from  the civilian and peacetime standpoint.    This problem is especially serious if any politicians still  active are among the perpetrators.    One of the most complicated aspects of the conflict in the  Croatian Democratic Union concerns the fact that certain  distinguished members of the incumbent party may be charged with  war crimes as well as with wrecking the political and legal  system of the Republic of Croatia.    The leadership of the government and party still have not  found the strength to face this danger.     "

Asked at a press briefing whether an arrest was imminent, or if a piece was  still missing, Capt. Dick Toneck said investigators are stuck.    ""A piece is still missing,"" he said. ""If I had something to bring forth in the  way of an arrest, I would relish that. But, as it stands, we're sifting through  all the clues and all the tips people have phoned in. We're just hoping one  will lead to an arrest.""    Toneck said the Police Department's 33 investigators working the case full time  have called back almost everyone who phoned in with information.    The case has received widespread media coverage in San Diego, where Police  Chief Bob Burgreen has labeled the search for the killer the largest manhunt in  the city's history and the department's No. 1 priority.    Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 were murdered inside  their homes in the middle of the day, after the killer entered through an  unlocked or open door, police say. The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail  Clark, was the mother of one of the victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were  stabbed inside their home in University City on Sept. 13. The three other women  lived within two blocks of one another in a row of apartment houses in  Clairemont.    The manhunt and subsequent publicity led to a run on locks and security devices  at local stores. Police have held twice-weekly press briefings, at which they  often have nothing new to report. The briefings are to be reduced to once a  week later this week.    On Monday, Toneck, one of seven ranking officers assigned to the case full  time, said investigators don't have a clear idea of the killer's possible  whereabouts or whether he has left the area.    ""We don't have anything to indicate (the suspect) is still here,"" Toneck said.  ""God forbid he's still here. We don't have any leads to tell us where he may  be.""    Toneck said the leads had given police a range of possible suspects ""who fit  the description to a T. And yet, those are not the people. Their backgrounds,  their whereabouts, just don't fit.""    Toneck has said police are eyeing a number of possible suspects but have no one  under ""classic surveillance."" He declined to say what that means.    The department made a controversial arrest shortly after the third killing in  early April when a native-born Puerto Rican -- and a decorated ex-Marine -- was  followed for weeks and finally detained because he closely resembled a  composite drawing of the suspect.    The man later said he phoned police and told them he committed the crime in the  hope he could then convince them he was innocent. He was cleared shortly after  his arrest.    Just last week, police ruled out any link between the serial slayings and a man  arrested on suspicion of rape in Escondido.    The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned black  male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with medium build and short, dark, kinky hair. He  was briefly seen by a painter as he ran from the Clairemont apartment where  18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed April 3.    It is that one sighting upon which the widely distributed composite of the  suspect is based.    Toneck said that, based on a psychological profile prepared for the Police  Department by the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., the killer is thought to be a  loner and ""disorganized"" in his methods of operation.    Police believe the weapon used in each of the killings was obtained at the  scene; in every case but the first, investigators later found knives believed  to have been the killer's weapon.    Although he appears to be a loner, ""there's no doubt that somebody -- a loved  one, a neighbor, a close friend -- knows this guy,"" Toneck said. ""We just don't  know why this person hasn't called in and said, 'I know this guy.' We're hoping  that will happen.""    But police have declined to say what, if any, reason they have to believe  someone knows the suspect. They also decline to discuss almost any question  relating to evidence.    Toneck said the number of investigators working the case was recently scaled  back from 34 to 33, and that $145,000 has been spent investigating the  slayings. He said the number of detectives working the case ""may be scaled back  further at the point where the leads start to diminish.""    Police are concerned that unsuspecting residents may soon grow complacent and  stop taking the precautions that many in the area instituted after the fourth  and fifth killings in University City on Sept. 13, Toneck said.    ""People are going to get complacent. But as we've said to them, don't get  complacent.

The Israeli Embassy was probably the target of the bomb  attack. The accident forced the terrorists to desert their  truck, which was eventually moved to Lumpini Police Station.    Inestimable damage and tragedy would have resulted if the  terrorists were able to carry out their mission. What prevented  the tragedy was the accident, not the ability of the officials  concerned.    Police and security officials and questioning of witnesses  indicate initially that the bombing attempt was the work of  international terrorists, possibly Arabs who seek to avenge the  Hebron massacre.    Among the observations concerning the bombing attempt are:  How did immigration officials allow these terrorists to enter  the country? Is the intelligence network sound and is its  coordination with foreign intelligence agencies efficient?    True, because Thailand is a democratic country and tourism  is  a major revenue earner, its check on arriving foreign tourists  is rather loose. But this should not mean that entries are  permitted without checks or for selfish reasons.    Another observation is: Why did officials of the Lumpini  Police Station leave the explosive-laden truck unchecked for six  days? This delay deprived others of any chance of a timely  arrest of suspects. Was there a written record of the accident?  Was there a neglect of duty?    Although the cold war has ended, disputes among nations have  continued more vigorously in some places, such as in the former  Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, and in the Middle East.  International terrorism has not ceased. The countries who have  lax security will fall prey first.     "

Under the auspices of the Orange County Human Relations Commission and the U.S.  Justice Department, more than 200 participants convened in a series of panel  discussions at the Garden Grove Civic Center not far from Little Saigon, the  largest Vietnamese business center in the nation.    ""We need to make a beginning and bring together law enforcement and the  Southeast Asian community. We hope this will provide a chance to identify  problems and goals,"" said Barbara Considine of the Human Relations Commission.    Orange County is home to about 130,000 Southeast Asian immigrants, mostly  concentrated in Westminster and Garden Grove. Police departments in both cities  have developed specialized units and educational programs to fight crime in  Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian neighborhoods.    Considine said the conference's recommendations to improve police relations in  the Southeast Asian community will be formalized in a report by the U.S.  Justice Department for national distribution.    For almost eight hours, panelists addressed a wide range of both cultural and  criminal problems encountered by police. They cited increasing gang activity by  Southeast Asians, drug use, auto theft rings and violent crime often  perpetuated by highly mobile youths who flee to other parts of the country.    Asian crime experts said the gang situation is expected to worsen as the newest  immigrants from Southeast Asia arrive in United States. About 1,000 a month  settle in Orange County.    Unlike the educated and professional class that immigrated immediately after  the Vietnam War, the latest arrivals are often poor, uneducated youths who do  not have families -- characteristics that make them particularly susceptible to  gang recruitment.    Police said the immigrants are hampered by language barriers, ignorance of the  court system and cultural differences. Police themselves have to deal with a  lack of cooperation by Southeast Asian crime victims and difficulties  recruiting Southeast Asians for police work.    Among other things, law enforcement officials said, Southeast Asians are  hesitant to report crimes or cooperate with officers because of fear of  retaliation and a traditional mistrust of police, who were often corrupt in  their home countries.    To overcome the difficulties, panelists said, law enforcement must develop  persistent public relations efforts and educational programs to develop trust  in the Southeast Asian community. They highlighted the use of police  substations, anonymous hotlines, bilingual programs, Asian advisory committees  and special liaisons who keep in regular contact with business owners.

The transportation workers' show of force will effect 4  million Caracas residents, and it is possible that drivers in  the countryside affiliated with the sole union of small  transportation vans and buses (interprovincial vans and buses)  will join the strike.    The drivers demand a readjustment in fare prices and the  immediate payment of government commitments owed them since  December under a subsidy agreement for student bus tickets.    Meanwhile, Sucre Municipality -- the second largest  municipality in the capital -- prohibited public demonstrations  and suspended all classes in its jurisdiction.    Political analysts recommended canceling classes throughout  the capital to avoid disturbances such as those that occurred on  Thursday, when a police officer killed student German Sotillo  with three gunshots.    Deputy Transportation Minister Francisco Urdaneta met with  transportation workers the previous evening and promised to pay  the subsidy debt in full as of next week. The drivers, however,  did not accept the offer and stated that the final hour had  arrived.    Newspaper sources reported that given the looming difficult  situation, an emergency unit was organized in Sucre Municipality  by the Caracas Metropolitan Police, the Judicial Technical  Police (PTJ-detectives), the Directorate of Intelligence and  Preventive Services (Disip), and Civil Defense.    Their spokesmen assured that the officers of these police  units are on a state of alert and are studying strategies to  prevent street disturbances.     "

Police suspected these people would then smuggle into  Thailand Chinese who wanted to resettle in third countries  before making overseas trips, mostly to the United States, when  they would take the illegal immigrants with them, he said.  Several Chinese have already been arrested in the provinces in  connection with drug trafficking, evasion of criminal charges in  their countries and killing of their business partners.    Police investigators were focusing on five cases where eight  Chinese aliens were all shot to death with .38 revolvers, the  source said.    In the first case, Nakhon Pathom police found the bodies of  two Taiwanese men, Chuen Si Yuan and Lin Tong Huan, in Nakhon  Chaisi district on July 9, last year. The second case occurred  on August 10 last year, in Phetburi's Tha Song Yang district,  where local villagers heard three gunshots before finding Siew  Si Tong and Lai Sun Kiang, both from Hong Kong, had been killed.    Also on the same day, Phetburi's Muang district police found  Li Chang Ho and So Seng Liang, who came from China, were shot to  death.     "

Police said the bombs had blown up three high-voltage pylons in southern Chile. Explosive devices were also hurled against a police station and army buildings in Santiago during the black-out. No one was injured. A similar attack last week briefly cut power to the capital. Police yesterday blamed the attacks on the Manuel Rodrguez Patriotic Front, a small Marxist guerrilla group that refused to lay down its arms after Chile's return to democracy in March 1990. The group has been weakened by desertions and internal divisions, and has seemed largely inactive for most of this year. Police suspect the attacks were meant to draw attention to some 40 political prisoners in Chile. Six guerrillas have been on hunger strike for a month in protest at their prolonged captivity. Chile's political prisoners are one of the unsolved legacies of General Augusto Pinochet's 16-year dictatorship. Many have been in jail for years awaiting trial, while others were convicted in military courts on the basis of confessions extracted under torture. President Patricio Aylwin has pardoned some 300 political prisoners since he took office, but says he cannot free the remainder as they were involved in crimes of violence.

The responsibilities of a country's police are to preserve  social order, curb crime, and protect the people. Of course,  there are police who suppress the people.    The mainland has added the word ""people's"" to its police, to  read the ""People's Police."" They should do more than the police  in other countries in doing good for the people and serving the  people but this is not the case.    As the mainland police have disclosed, in 1993, 7 percent of  public security personnel were dismissed from their posts or  transferred out of public security departments and about 3,400  public security personnel were given criminal punishments or  expelled from the CPC. This included more than 120  section-level public security cadres. This situation suggests  that, from one angle, the public security contingent is  irrelevant to ""serving the people"" and neither is it a reliable  tool of the party. This is, of course, a tragedy for the CPC,  which entrusts its political power to the armed forces and the  police force.    In order to strengthen and expand the police force, on 28  March this year, Premier Li Peng endorsed Order No. 12 of 1994  on ""Strengthening, Rectifying, and Expanding the Public Security  Contingent"" and Order No. 13 of 1994 on ""Supplementing and  Improving the Armed Police Force.""    Order No. 12 was issued through the Ministry of Public  Security to the party committees of all provincial (autonomous  regional) and city public security departments (bureaus) in  early April whereas Order No. 13 was issued to all provincial  (autonomous regional) and city armed police corps on 8 April.    The State Council Allocates 1.8 Billion Yuan to Public  Security Departments and Security Control Departments    Order No. 12 points out: In light of their social  environments, all provinces (autonomous regions) and cities,  from 1994 to 1996, should rectify and strengthen the leading  groups of their public security contingents and develop these  contingents in the ratio of 2 or 4.5 public security personnel  per million of population, depending on the local conditions.  In some important cities and in cities or regions where party,  government, scientific, technological, and industrial  organizations are concentrated, public security contingents  should be formed in the ratio of 6:1,000.    Viewed from provincial public security departments'  arrangements, the country will increase public security  personnel by 400,000 from 1994 to 1995; the central and local  authorities will build or expand 70 to 80 public security  schools, 10 or 12 of which will be senior public security  schools. The central government will be responsible for 40  percent of the funding and local governments will allocate the  remaining 60 percent. The central government will increase the  percentage of fund allocation for some key provinces and cities  appropriately. In mid-March, the State Council allocated 1.8  billion yuan for public security departments and security  control departments. An informed source confirmed that 35,000  cadres (including demobilized soldiers) from localities and  government institutions had been sent to work in public security  departments.    The State Council Provides the Ministry of Public Security  With More Power To Use Force    With the State Council's authorization, on 1 March the  Ministry of Public Security issued the ""Regulations on the Use  of Arms During Patrols and When Performing Duties."" The  regulations point out: Arms can be used against any resistance  to arrest, any attempt to resist, any action of violent  resistance, or any assault on public security personnel. Arms  can be used to stop agitation in public or state buildings and  any attempt to destroy state buildings, public property,  government institutions, and vehicles, if persuasion proves to  be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on party,  government, and military institutions; public security  departments; detention centers; prisons; financial  organizations; banks; and important state departments. Arms can  be used to stop assaults on radio and television stations as  well as central and local press and news agencies, if a warning  proves to be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on  airports, seaports, customs departments, and frontier stations.  Arms can be used to stop assaults on power stations, water  supply centers, and railway departments, if a warning proves to  be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop any attempt to  blockade highways, shipping routes, railways, bridges, and  tunnels, if a warning proves to be of no avail.    Tao Siju: The Public Security and Armed Police Forces Will  Deal With All Eventualities    Order No. 13 points out: Local governments should exercise  direct leadership over armed police units. Armed police and  public security units should be integrated. From 1994 to 1996,  the country will expand the People's Armed Police Force [PAP]  personnel to 450,000, improve the quality of the personnel, and  enhance their efficiency in performing mobile duties. By the  end of 1994, a three-level armed police force mechanism  comprising provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities  directly under the central authorities), prefectures, and  counties will be formed.    It has been learned that more than 38,000 demobilized  soldiers and soldiers on active service joined the PAP in 1993.  Tao Siju, PAP political commissar Ministry of Public Security  chief, said: The central task of public security and armed  police units is to improve their quality, raise their work  consciousness, and enhance their combat effectiveness. During  an inspection of a police academy in early April, Tao Siju said:  From now on, the public security and armed police forces will  deal with contingencies. In an important region, the public  security and armed police forces should be able to dispatch  40,000 to 50,000 personnel to the scene of any eventuality  within four hours. In the case of an emergency, they should be  able to dispatch 5,000 to 8,000 personnel to the scene within 20  minutes.    He also said: About 80,000 cadets will graduate from public  security and armed police academies this year and they will be  assigned to work in all parts of the country. These academies  will recruit 150,000 cadets this year. Unqualified personnel  will be removed from public security departments within three  years.    The People's Police Have Become Tools To Suppress the People    The abovementioned examples prove that the CPC is  strengthening and expanding its police force.    Social order on the mainland is deteriorating. This is  obvious to all. It is also an indisputable fact that the  quality of mainland public security personnel is low, as is  their efficiency in cracking criminal cases. Such being the  case, the CPC needs to strengthen its police force.    Apart from maintaining social order and curbing crime, the  public security and armed police forces are also responsible for  cracking down on dissidents. To cope with one dissident, dozens  or even hundreds of policemen are used. This includes following  and keeping a watch on the dissident. When Wei Jingsheng tried  to return from Tianjin to Beijing, seven truckloads of police  were mobilized to stop him. If used this way, the police force  does not have adequate personnel to cope with eventualities. In  addition, the ""Regulations on the Use of Arms During Patrols and  When Performing Duties"" run counter to the ""PRC Constitution,""  which stipulates that civilians have the right to hold  demonstrations.    The people's police have now become tools to suppress the  people. CPC leaders have removed the disguise of the  constitution and blatantly created the image of a police state  among the people. Did any fascist, police state in the world  ever come to a good end?     "

The trading  company, Mitaka Boeki, allegedly contravened a requirement under  the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law to report to  the finance minister any overseas remittance of money exceeding  5 million yen.    Investigators suspect the company fabricated a contract  document regarding the import of North Korean marine products to  make the banking remittance look legal, police said.    Police said they suspect the Kobe-based trader also exported  50 used cars worth 255,000 dollars to North Korea without  obtaining the required permission from the prefectural public  safety commission.    Remittances of money from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in  Japan to North Korea have come under scrutiny in connection with  allegations that Pyongyang is trying to develop nuclear weapons.  Some U.S. Congress members and government officials have been  urging Japan to regulate the flow of money which the Japanese  Cabinet Information Research Office reportedly estimates at up  to 200 billion yen a year.    Earlier this year, police raided another Japanese trading  company on suspicion that they exported to North Korea  high-technology equipment capable of being used for military  purposes.    The Yokohama-based trading house was searched on January 14  on suspicion that it exported a spectrum analyzer that could be  used to boost the target-hitting accuracy of the Nodong-1  missiles Pyongyang test-fired in the Sea of Japan last year.  Police arrested the president of the company, Masahiko Kondo,  on the day and sent papers to the prosecutors on March 30.     "

0,FT932-12889 ,"FT932-12889 _AN-DD1BPAACFT 930427   FT  27 APR 93 / Police seek more powers to combat terrorism      By JIMMY BURNS, RALPH ATKINS, JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD WATERS   SENIOR police officers stepped up their calls for wider powers and greater resources to fight terrorism yesterday as a series of arrests were made in connection with Saturday's bomb, which devastated a wide area in the heart of the City of London. But the government refused to be pushed into a wholesale review of its anti-terrorist policy in spite of concern in Westminster and Whitehall. Downing Street said the government was determined to resist playing into the terrorists' hands with a 'knee-jerk' reaction. Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, said: 'It is the duty of us all to show that this kind of campaign will never succeed.' Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that a warning of a 'heightened threat' was circulated to police the day before the City bomb. It refused to disclose any details though forces throughout the country were reportedly put on alert. Yesterday, up to 20,000 City workers were either unable to work or were relocated in temporary offices with only the barest facilities. Some of the banks and other businesses worst affected by the blast had to take up space in the offices of their competitors in order to get back to work. Nevertheless, the Corporation of London, the City's local authority, declared its efforts to get people to work were a success, with 'more than 90 per cent' of City workers able to carry on as normal. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, said he wanted the government to change the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to give police greater flexibility to search vehicles on suspicion of terrorism. His comments were echoed by senior Metropolitan police officials. Police believe the act lays them open to civil action in cases where a road check does not lead to a conviction. 'We think there is a case for relooking at that legislation. It does reduce our effectiveness,' Mr Kelly said. Mr John Major, the prime minister, did not respond to the comments, but said London had given its response in opening financial markets: 'Today in the City it's business as usual.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, emphasised his determination to tackle terrorism but said there could be no guarantee against further bomb attacks on the UK mainland. Last night, police were trying to establish a connection between those arrested - described as fewer than 10 men and women - and the weekend bombs. The anti-terrorist squad said two men were seen hurrying from the tipper truck containing the bomb, but the witness failed to get a clear view of them. Police were also studying video film from police traffic cameras and an office security camera for clues. Although the images were not of sufficient quality to identify the bombers, they confirmed that the bombers' vehicle had been parked in Bishopsgate before 9am on Saturday. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the British Bankers' Association, said the effect of the latest bomb would be to 'increase insurance premiums, but hopefully not to the extent that people will say the City is uncompetitive'.

In the riot in the street this afternoon five people were  slightly wounded by stones, among them policemen, an IDF Radio  correspondent and an Israel television worker. Our  correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i reports that hundreds of raging  rioters threw stones, attacked policemen and passersby, called  for avenging the Hebron massacre, and chanted anti-Israeli  slogans. One shop was torched and several other shops on Yefet  Street were damaged. Tires and garbage canisters were set  ablaze and windows of several vehicles were smashed. The police  used tear gas and repulsed the rioters from the street. Arab  dignitaries from Yafo, Tel Aviv municipality representatives,  and Police commanders are trying to calm tempers. Police  Commissioner Rafi Peled is also at the site. [passage omitted]    A youth was killed by Border Police gunfire in the village  of  'Isawiyah north of Jerusalem. Our police affairs correspondent  Aviv Bushinsky reports a border police unit was stoned and  several policemen were wounded. The force used tear gas to  disperse the rioters. One of the youths took a gas grenade and  hurled it at the policemen. One of the policemen, who thought  the youth was handling a hand grenade, shot the youth and killed  him. The youth was taken for burial, and a riot erupted in the  place.    A tourist was slightly wounded by shots fired by a Jew from  the settlement of Betar in Hagay Street in East Jerusalem. Our  police affairs correspondent reports the man, who was apparently  drunk, said he fired the shots after he spotted terrorists. The  man was detained for interrogation. [passage omitted]     "

The chase left the Anaheim man wounded from police gunfire. A passing motorist  was slightly injured after a stray bullet shattered her windshield and sprayed  her with fragments of glass, police said.    Brea Police Capt. Jim Oman said the incident began around 9:30 p.m. Thursday  when two men confronted Linda Pinney of Brea as she drove her gold Acura Legend  into her driveway on the 1400 block of Alta Mesa Way. One of the men yanked her  from the car, struck her in the face, jumped into the driver's seat and then  sped away in her car. The other man took off behind in a blue Nissan Maxima,  Oman said.      Husband Chased Cars    Pinney's husband was home at the time and saw the commotion. He ran to a pickup  truck parked nearby and began the chase.    The two cars made their way to the Orange Freeway and headed south at speeds of  up to 100 m.p.h., Oman said. But the husband closed in and overtook the Acura  in congested traffic near the Lambert Road exit in Brea. Oman said the husband  jumped from the truck and immediately began beating the driver of the Acura.    After a brief scuffle, the driver broke free and ran to the Nissan, jumped in  and again sped away. The husband climbed into the Acura and continued the chase  -- this time followed by police.    Near the Yorba Linda Boulevard exit in Fullerton, the chase ended when the  Nissan spun out of control and crashed into the freeway's center divider. The  husband stopped the Acura in front of the car, but this time stayed inside the  vehicle, Oman said.    Police shot Jay Le of Anaheim once in the left shoulder as he jumped from the  Nissan and flashed what an officer thought was a gun, Oman said. Officers later  found a toy gun in the car, but did not find a real weapon, he said. The  officer who fired, whose name is being withheld, was uninjured.    Police said during the gunfire a stray bullet shattered the windshield of a car  driven by 19-year-old Terry Susan Notthoff of West Covina, who was passing by.  Notthoff suffered minor injuries from broken glass and was taken to St. Jude  Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton, where she was treated for her  injuries and released.    Brea Police Lt. Chet Panique said that whenever traffic or pedestrians are  present, officers are told to use discretion in deciding whether to shoot at a  fleeing suspect or to hold their fire.    ""I just believe it would be putting them in too much jeopardy to tell them they  couldn't shoot on the freeway or congested areas,"" Panique said. ""A lot of it  boils down to common sense and taking the factors into consideration. . . . But  of course the officer is held accountable for the shooting.""      One Man Escaped    After being wounded, Le, 18, allegedly ran across the freeway and hopped a wall  into the Homestead Apartments on Deerpark Drive. The other suspect ran across  the freeway in the opposite direction and escaped.    Kyle Davis, a resident of the complex, said he was on his way home from work  when he heard shots and saw a man scale the wall and run into the complex.    ""First I thought maybe it was an auto accident,"" Davis said, ""so I stopped the  car and got out. As I was walking back I saw this guy hop the freeway wall and  start running through our complex, but I didn't think he did anything wrong.""    Davis said he saw two police helicopters hovering over the dimly lit complex in  search of the suspect. In the meantime, the fugitive climbed into a nearby  dumpster, but was seen by other residents, who alerted police.    ""A friend of mine said he knew where (the suspect) was hiding,"" said Davis, a  junior at nearby Cal State Fullerton. ""He said he was inside this dumpster, but  we didn't want to look in because police said he still had a gun.""    Oman said a police dog was sent into the dumpster and found Le, unarmed.    Le was treated at the scene for his gunshot wound, along with some cuts and  bruises, and was taken to St. Jude hospital in Fullerton. He was listed Friday  in stable condition.    Le was held at the hospital on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a  police officer, armed robbery and grand theft auto. His bail is set at $50,000.

POLICE SAID THE MAN CONFRONTED THEM BUT WOULD NOT SAY IF HE  WAS ARMED.      By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ANAHEIM      In the second shooting by city police in three days, an officer on Sunday  critically wounded a man who reportedly was attacking a woman in the bushes of  a residential area, police said.    The suspect, identified as 23-year-old Leonardo Macias Castelan, address  unknown, will be booked on suspicion of attempted rape, police said. Police  would not say whether Castelan, who is apparently not from Orange County, was  armed. He was in critical condition Sunday night at UCI Medical Center.    According to Anaheim police, a 34-year-old woman was walking home alone about 4  a.m. Sunday in the 2900 block of West Orange Avenue, near Beach Boulevard, when  she was attacked by a stranger who began choking her and dragging her into  bushes beside a house.    A passerby called police, Lt. Ray Welch said. Officers in three cars responded,  discovering the rape suspect as he held the woman down on the ground, officers  said. As the officers identified themselves, the suspect ""jumped up, confronted  the officers and was shot by one of the officers,"" according to an account from  Lt. Marc Hedgepeth.    ""We heard three gunshots -- boom, boom, boom, just as fast as you could shoot  'em,"" said Lee Miller, 60, who has lived for more than two decades on West  Orange Avenue, two doors from the crime scene.    ""No sooner did we hear the gunshots than the police were lined up for half a  block,"" Miller recounted. ""No one would say anything -- it was all very  hush-hush, and I had to call the Police Department myself to try and find  something out. But they just said: 'Stay in the house.' ""    Neighbor Charles Noland, 69, said he saw the victim standing beside a police  car soon after the shooting, hysterical. He said an officer tried to calm her,  saying he needed to ask her questions.    Police said the woman was then taken for treatment to a local hospital and  released.    Like Lee Miller, most neighbors in the area surrounding the shooting reported  hearing three shots. But the man staying at the house where the crime took  place said he heard police say seven shots were fired in all.    But the man, who requested anonymity, said he himself heard nothing.    ""We slept through the whole thing -- didn't even wake for the cops banging on  the door,"" his girlfriend said.    Alongside the house where they are staying, owned by the man's parents,  splotches of blood stained the pavement in a fenced-in patio area. Police also  dislodged a bullet from the side of the house.    But the bullets weren't confined to the immediate area. Verda Thomas, 60, who  lives across an alley from the crime scene, reported that she heard a bullet  hit her bedroom wall and found it on her back patio by a glass door Sunday  morning.    ""I know the difference between a (car) backfire and a bullet, and when I heard  that, I just froze in bed. If that had gone through the wall, it would have  been pretty scary,"" she said.    ""You know, this area used to be paradise; now it's hell,"" she said.    In fact, the frequency of burglaries, prostitution and violence along Beach  Boulevard in Anaheim and the bordering residential neighborhoods has gotten so  bad that local resident Bill McDonald, 36, said he just bought a .357-caliber  handgun to protect himself.

As is known, the Cabinet of Ministers already once granted  such powers to the police. It was done during the Saeima's  [parliament] Christmas break, when the Cabinet of Ministers took  advantage of Article 81 of the Satversme [Constitution]  permitting the government to make decisions under the rule of  law. The Saeima annulled this law when it returned, on the  basis of a special decision, according to recommendations from  both the Juridical and the Defense and Internal Affairs  Commissions. At present, the Cabinet of Ministers has decided  to conduct the changes in ordinary legislative fashion. ""During  discussions in the Saeima, the government was told that the  rejection was of a formal nature rather than an essential  character,"" Minister of Special Tasks Edvins Inkens stated at a  press briefing today. ""Information from the Ministry of  Internal Affairs proves that from the moment the police lost  these rights, criminals have become more impudent.""    The changes in the law, which were adopted today, also  foresee that the police will be obliged to take care of people  who have found themselves in a state of helplessness due to lack  of means and housing, by bringing them to the institutions of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The police will be  responsible for them. As E. Inkens explained, this provision  refers to beggars and homeless people.     "
0," LA051390-0197   218674    May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition      Part A; Page 20; Column 1; Metro Desk      2830 words      A ROLL-CALL OF GANG VICTIMS: 1990'S DEADLY NIGHTS OF WARFARE      By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      At least seventeen young men have died at the hands of Orange County gang  members this year. The oldest was 31, the youngest 15.    Some were gang members slain by rivals. Others were bystanders when gangs ran  amok. Police say gang members tend to travel armed, don't always aim well and  are profligate with their bullets.    Among the innocent slain this spring was a convenience store customer who  accused two gang members of shoplifting. They shot him point blank in the face.  A dishwasher was slain when the restaurant where he worked was held up by  suspected gang members.    Some of the homicides sparked community outrage and Page 1 stories; these  tended to be about young victims who had family and friends to mourn and bury  them. But it took only three paragraphs to note the passing of Jesus Perez, a  21-year-old illegal immigrant gunned down in Santa Ana on a Friday night in  what has by now become just an ordinary drive-by shooting.    Together, the murders point to a rising level of gang violence in Orange  County. Though no exact statistics exist, the district attorney's office  believes there were roughly 16 gang-related homicides during all of 1989, and  an average of roughly a dozen each year for the preceding three years.    ""More and more, you say, 'Who are you with?' and they identify themselves as  gang members,"" said Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry.    Homicide statistics are an imperfect measure of gang activity. Dozens of people  have also been shot or stabbed by suspected gang members this year. One of them  was 8-year-old Carlos Alvarez, pierced by a stray bullet while watching  television in his own living room. The bullet went through Carlos and the wall  and injured an aunt who was sleeping in the next room. But because both victims  survived, that case will never be classified as a gang-related crime.    Similarly, gang members crashed a party in Anaheim last month and three people  were severly stabbed in the resulting melee. One is still in critical  condition, Barry said. But those three people, whose names have not been  released by police, will be classified simply as assault victims.    As the violence mounts, police and the public quickly lose sight of the  humanity of the 17 young men slain in gang-related conflicts this year.    ""It's really easy to get hardened and say these (victims) are just gang members  . . . or criminals,"" Garden Grove Police Capt. David Abrecht said. ""We lose  sight of the fact that this is a bigger problem for our society than we'd like  to admit.""    These are the deaths so far in 1990, according to police, prosecutors, public  records and witnesses:    JAN. 2 10:29 P.M.: A Witness Is Shot    Pedro Perez, 30, is shot in the head by an unknown assailant on Myrtle Street  in Santa Ana. Information about the case is sketchy, to say the least. Police  say a suspect, dressed like a gang member, tried to rob a man. The man ran, and  the suspect fired three shots after him but missed. Then, for reasons  unexplained, the suspect turned and fired two shots at a group of people  standing nearby. One of the bullets hit Perez in the head. He died the next  afternoon.    Authorities know almost nothing about Perez, except that his fingerprints were  on file, and he was possibly an illegal immigrant. He was not carrying a  wallet. No one seems to know where he came from, where he lived or worked, who  killed him or why. The coroner has not be able to find any relatives. Perez's  body lies unclaimed in the morgue.    JAN. 5 11:59 P.M.: 2 Stabbed in a Fight    Hector De La Torre, 24, of Santa Ana, said to be a member of the F-Troop gang,  and Oscar ""Tiny"" Jiminez, 18, of Garden Grove, allegedly part of the Anaheim  Westside gang, are stabbed to death outside a home on 8th Street in Garden  Grove. Friends said their attackers were members of a third gang, the Hoodlum  Crips of Garden Grove.    De La Torre died an hour later in an emergency room of chest and groin wounds.  He lived with his mother, hadn't finished high school and listed his occupation  as a shipping clerk at Western Digital.    Jiminez, who was stabbed in the neck, bled to death at 2:45 a.m. Like De La  Torre, he was born in Mexico, and come to Orange County at age 6. He had six  years of education. His body was turned over to his mother.    Taula Poe, 20, of Westminster, and Arnold Mendoza, 19, of Garden Grove, will be  tried on murder charges fon June 21.    JAN. 20 9:56 P.M.: 'It's Such a Waste'    Javier P. Avila, 22, of Santa Ana, is shot in the head during a melee involving  at least 15 gang members armed with belts, bottles and knives. He dies in the  emergency room at 4:28 the next morning. Police say Avila and three friends got  into a fight with 10 members of the Middleside gang.    Born in Mexico, Avila came to the U.S. at age 12. For the last six months of  his life he had been working in the warehouse and driving a delivery truck for  Leah's Fabric in Anaheim. A co-worker said she does not believe he was a gang  member. She learned of his death when relatives came in to ask about insurance.    ""He was always happy, real pleasant, real nice,"" she said. ""We're stunned. We  just think it's such a waste, because he was nice, and he was so young.""    A teen-aged boy was arrested and charged with the murder. The case is still  pending.    FEB. 5 12:08 A.M.: Shot in the Back    Aurelio Navarette, 20, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack on Artesia  Boulevard in Buena Park. He was pronounced dead on arrival at La Palma  Intercommunity Hospital 40 minutes later. His brother, Otoniel, is wounded in  the arm.    Navarette's death certificate lists him as a Buena Park High School student,  but school officials say he had left several years ago.    Police say the brothers belonged to the Buena Park ""Eastsiders."" Two alleged  members of the rival ""One Way"" gang in Norwalk, aged 15 and 17, have been  charged. That homicide case, too, is still pending.    FEB. 23 10:33 P.M.: 5 Shots From a Pickup    Jesus Perez, a 21-year-old janitor, is a passenger in a car driving south on  Rene Drive in Santa Ana when a pickup truck carrying several people passes them  going in the other direction and fires at least five shots. Perez is struck in  the head. Brain surgery fails to save him and he dies four hours later.    Perez had come to the United States four years ago from Mexico, and his body  was sent back to Zacatepec for burial. Police do not have a suspect.    FEB. 24 7:51 P.M.: Bullets Spray a Family    Salvador Villa Arias, 18, is standing with several family members outside his  home on West 5th Street in Santa Ana when a red pickup truck drives by. A  gunman in the back sprays the group with at least six bullets, and one hits  Arias in the back of the head.    Police believe Arias was a gang member, but his mother, Teresa Villa, said her  son didn't smoke, didn't drink, didn't wear gang colors and did not have  friends in a gang. But family members noted that the notorious 5th Street gang  controls an area on the other side of Euclid Street, away from their  neighborhood.    Arias had recently left Los Amigos High School to work as a gardener. His body  was returned to Michoacan, Mexico, for burial.    The day after the shooting, police arrested Steven Joseph Salazar, 23, of Santa  Ana. Though investigators identified him as a gang member, they declined to  specify which gang. One investigator said he has found gang members who save  their press clippings in photo albums and view them as a status symbol.    MARCH 4 8:10 P.M.: Argument at a Dance Studio    Ha Huu Dang, 21, is shot in the head in the restroom of Jimmy's Ballroom Dance  Studio in Garden Grove. Police said Dang was not a gang member but had argued  with three young men who were.    Born in Vietnam, Dang had graduated from high school and moved to Orange County  two years ago. For the past six months, he had been working on an assembly line  at Starkey California in Anaheim, making hearing aids. His former boss, Keith  Stifter, described Dang as ""easy-going, willing to help, kind of a  happy-go-lucky guy. Never really seemed like anything bothered him.""    A woman who worked at the dance studio said Dang had come there every week or  two with a group of friends. ""After the shooting, his friends never came back,""  she said.    Police say they have a suspect but have not made an arrest.    MARCH 15 11:21 P.M.: A Bystander Panics    Margarito Alvarado-Robledo, 25, a dishwasher in the Mi Ho Restaurant in Garden  Grove, is in the kitchen putting away leftovers when a gunman demands money.  According to the owner, Alvarado-Robledo panics and tries to run, and the  robber shoots him in the neck. Police believe the robber is a gang member, but  have not made an arrest. Details are sketchy, and Garden Grove Police Capt.  David Abrecht said the case may not ultimately be classified as a ""gang-related  homicide.""    Alvarado-Robledo fought for life for seven days before he died. According to  his death certificate, he had completed elementary school, had been in Orange  County for two years, was married and lived in Stanton. His body was sent to La  Esperanza, Mexico for burial.    Speaking through a Korean interpreter, the owner, Chung W. Choi described  Alvarado-Robledo as a ""very good employee, very honest and hard-working."" Choi  said he had immigrated four years ago from Seoul, and the killing so frightened  him that for a time he contemplated returning to South Korea.    MARCH 19 12:11 A.M.: Confrontation in a Store    David Eugene Davenport, 31, walks into a Circle K convenience store in Garden  Grove to buy cigarettes. Davenport, who had lost his job and apartment and was  trying to find work, befriended the night clerk. He accuses two young men of  shoplifting. According to Garden Grove Police Det. Mike Handfield, the three  men argued briefly and stepped out of the store together. Then the younger of  the two shot Davenport in the face. He died instantly.    The two men and a juvenile girl in their car were later arrested. The  17-year-old's name has not been released, but prosecutors have asked for a  hearing May 25 in a bid to prosecute him as an adult. His companion, Cesar Nava  Sustaita, 19, has been charged with being an accessory to murder. Handfield  said both men belonged to the ""Hard Times"" gang based in the Buena Clinton  neighborhood.    Davenport grew up in Garden Grove, attended Rancho Alamitos High School and had  been working as a landscaper, said his mother, Ann Gehrig, who now lives in  Coulterville, Calif.    ""He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" Gehrig said.    There are no gangs in Coulterville, she said. ""That's one of the reasons we're  here.""    MARCH 24 1:42 A.M.: 'Rolling Gun Battle'    Nabor Eustolio Roman, 16, died after being shot several times in the back  during what authorities called ""a rolling gun battle."" Santa Ana police  described Roman as a well-known member of the Highland Street gang who  allegedly had shot and wounded a pedestrian earlier that night after an  argument over drugs.    An hour later, police said, members of a rival gang found Roman on Townsend  Street and shot him dead. Police said two separate guns were used in the  slaying. No one has been arrested.    APRIL 3 6:40 P.M.: 6 Shots From a Passing Car    Martin Lopez Rosiles Jr., 19, of Santa Ana, who had been working as a film  developer, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack in El Modena, an  unincorporated area near Orange. Another 17-year-old is wounded. Rosiles dies  45 minutes later in Chapman General Hospital.    The shooting is a typical gang attack. Vine Street residents said five or six  shots were fired from a gray Honda at random into a group of people standing in  front of a home. Police say gang members sometimes fire at people or a house  without even knowing their intended victim. The Rosiles case has not been  solved.    APRIL 10 6:20 P.M.: Holding a Child's Hand    Martin Julian Gonzalez, 21, is walking along Myrtle Street in Santa Ana headed  to the store, holding the hand of his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter, when a  man jumps out of a passing car at shoots him in the neck and chest. The girl is  unharmed. Gonzalez dies less than an hour later, despite emergency surgery at  UCI Medical Center in Orange. Friends said Gonzalez had been trying to  extricate himself from street life. Police believe the shooting is gang-related  but have made no arrests.    APRIL 20 10:30 P.M.: 'Puro Southside!' 'Highland!'    Rojelio M. (Roger) Ochoa, 17, is shot four times in the back after an argument  with suspected gang members at a birthday party for a friend on East 3rd Street  in Santa Ana. According to Santa Ana Police Lt. David Salazar, witnesses heard  Ochoa yell, ""Puro (Pure) Southside,"" then saw his attacker fire four shots and  shout, ""Highland!"" Ochoa was described as a gentle boy from a tough  neighborhood who had left school for a job learning to repair personal  computers.    Eight days later, Eleazar Gonzales, 20, was arrested on suspicion of the  murder. Two months earlier, Gonzales, identified as a longtime Highland gang  member, had been acquitted of the 1988 murder of a fellow gang member. Gonzales  has said he is innocent of both killings.    APRIL 22 12:52 A.M.: 'He Wasn't a Criminal'     Cesar Torres Salgado, 15, is shot three times in the side from a passing van  as he is leaving a Santa Ana party at a South Hickory Street home. By 3 a.m. he  is dead. Salgado's friend, Javier Torres, 18, is shot in the back but survives.    Police and neighbors say the house is a longtime ""Lopers"" hang-out and is  pockmarked with bullets. Neighbors say the Lopers have been feuding for some  time with the nearby ""Eastsiders."" But friends said Salgado, a Horizon High  School student, belonged to a third gang named ""Middleside."" His street name  was ""Night Owl"" because he liked to stay up late. But they said he was just a  guest at the party, an innocent teen-ager who did not deserve to die.    ""He was a home boy, but he wasn't a criminal,"" one said.    APRIL 30 11:15 P.M.: He Dies in a Cousin's Arms    Rosendo Ibarra, 17, of Anaheim, is gunned down while talking to his girlfriend  at a pay telephone in a Garden Grove shopping center parking lot. He is shot  twice, once in the head, and dies in the arms of his cousin, Mona Marquez,  before help arrives.    Garden Grove police say Ibarra, a construction worker who had been out of work  since breaking his leg in February, was a member of the Colonia gang in  Stanton. Relatives reported seeing a dark Cadillac circling their neighborhood  the night before, and believe the shooting was planned.    David Alan Davis, 22, and Joe David Kehler, 23, both of Anaheim, have been  arrested on suspicion of the murder. Both men have been separately charged in  drug cases but it is not known whether Ibarra's killing was drug-related.  Police are still seeking several other suspects in the murder.    Ibarra was the father of a year-old daughter named Casandra.    Mona Marquez cried last week as she tried to explain how it felt to hold her  cousin as he died. ""I don't know who to hate, but I want something done,"" she  said.    MAY 11 1:30 A.M.: An 'Ordinary' Drive-By    Jesus Gutierrez, 21, of Garden Grove, is killed by gunfire from a passing car  as he and a friend stand in front of a house on West Henderson Place in Santa  Ana. Witnesses said Gutierrez, who died at the scene, hung around with gang  members. Also wounded was Juan Manuel Alcantar, a 25-year-old Santa Ana man who  described himself as a former member of the Middleside gang.    A RECORD GANG DEATH TOLL    With at least 17 deaths in the first five months of this year, law enforcement  authorities say gang violence is surpassing 1989, when roughly 16 gang-related  murders were committed.

FEB. 23 10:33 P.M.: 5 Shots From a Pickup    Jesus Perez, a 21-year-old janitor, is a passenger in a car driving south on  Rene Drive in Santa Ana when a pickup truck carrying several people passes them  going in the other direction and fires at least five shots. Perez is struck in  the head. Brain surgery fails to save him and he dies four hours later.    Perez had come to the United States four years ago from Mexico, and his body  was sent back to Zacatepec for burial. Police do not have a suspect.    FEB. 24 7:51 P.M.: Bullets Spray a Family    Salvador Villa Arias, 18, is standing with several family members outside his  home on West 5th Street in Santa Ana when a red pickup truck drives by. A  gunman in the back sprays the group with at least six bullets, and one hits  Arias in the back of the head.    Police believe Arias was a gang member, but his mother, Teresa Villa, said her  son didn't smoke, didn't drink, didn't wear gang colors and did not have  friends in a gang. But family members noted that the notorious 5th Street gang  controls an area on the other side of Euclid Street, away from their  neighborhood.    Arias had recently left Los Amigos High School to work as a gardener. His body  was returned to Michoacan, Mexico, for burial.    The day after the shooting, police arrested Steven Joseph Salazar, 23, of Santa  Ana. Though investigators identified him as a gang member, they declined to  specify which gang. One investigator said he has found gang members who save  their press clippings in photo albums and view them as a status symbol.    MARCH 4 8:10 P.M.: Argument at a Dance Studio    Ha Huu Dang, 21, is shot in the head in the restroom of Jimmy's Ballroom Dance  Studio in Garden Grove. Police said Dang was not a gang member but had argued  with three young men who were.    Born in Vietnam, Dang had graduated from high school and moved to Orange County  two years ago. For the past six months, he had been working on an assembly line  at Starkey California in Anaheim, making hearing aids. His former boss, Keith  Stifter, described Dang as ""easy-going, willing to help, kind of a  happy-go-lucky guy. Never really seemed like anything bothered him.""    A woman who worked at the dance studio said Dang had come there every week or  two with a group of friends. ""After the shooting, his friends never came back,""  she said.    Police say they have a suspect but have not made an arrest.    MARCH 15 11:21 P.M.: A Bystander Panics    Margarito Alvarado-Robledo, 25, a dishwasher in the Mi Ho Restaurant in Garden  Grove, is in the kitchen putting away leftovers when a gunman demands money.  According to the owner, Alvarado-Robledo panics and tries to run, and the  robber shoots him in the neck. Police believe the robber is a gang member, but  have not made an arrest. Details are sketchy, and Garden Grove Police Capt.  David Abrecht said the case may not ultimately be classified as a ""gang-related  homicide.""    Alvarado-Robledo fought for life for seven days before he died. According to  his death certificate, he had completed elementary school, had been in Orange  County for two years, was married and lived in Stanton. His body was sent to La  Esperanza, Mexico for burial.    Speaking through a Korean interpreter, the owner, Chung W. Choi described  Alvarado-Robledo as a ""very good employee, very honest and hard-working."" Choi  said he had immigrated four years ago from Seoul, and the killing so frightened  him that for a time he contemplated returning to South Korea.    MARCH 19 12:11 A.M.: Confrontation in a Store    David Eugene Davenport, 31, walks into a Circle K convenience store in Garden  Grove to buy cigarettes. Davenport, who had lost his job and apartment and was  trying to find work, befriended the night clerk. He accuses two young men of  shoplifting. According to Garden Grove Police Det. Mike Handfield, the three  men argued briefly and stepped out of the store together. Then the younger of  the two shot Davenport in the face. He died instantly.    The two men and a juvenile girl in their car were later arrested. The  17-year-old's name has not been released, but prosecutors have asked for a  hearing May 25 in a bid to prosecute him as an adult. His companion, Cesar Nava  Sustaita, 19, has been charged with being an accessory to murder. Handfield  said both men belonged to the ""Hard Times"" gang based in the Buena Clinton  neighborhood.    Davenport grew up in Garden Grove, attended Rancho Alamitos High School and had  been working as a landscaper, said his mother, Ann Gehrig, who now lives in  Coulterville, Calif.    ""He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" Gehrig said.    There are no gangs in Coulterville, she said. ""That's one of the reasons we're  here.""    MARCH 24 1:42 A.M.: 'Rolling Gun Battle'    Nabor Eustolio Roman, 16, died after being shot several times in the back  during what authorities called ""a rolling gun battle."" Santa Ana police  described Roman as a well-known member of the Highland Street gang who  allegedly had shot and wounded a pedestrian earlier that night after an  argument over drugs.    An hour later, police said, members of a rival gang found Roman on Townsend  Street and shot him dead. Police said two separate guns were used in the  slaying. No one has been arrested.    APRIL 3 6:40 P.M.: 6 Shots From a Passing Car    Martin Lopez Rosiles Jr., 19, of Santa Ana, who had been working as a film  developer, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack in El Modena, an  unincorporated area near Orange. Another 17-year-old is wounded. Rosiles dies  45 minutes later in Chapman General Hospital.    The shooting is a typical gang attack. Vine Street residents said five or six  shots were fired from a gray Honda at random into a group of people standing in  front of a home. Police say gang members sometimes fire at people or a house  without even knowing their intended victim. The Rosiles case has not been  solved.    APRIL 10 6:20 P.M.: Holding a Child's Hand    Martin Julian Gonzalez, 21, is walking along Myrtle Street in Santa Ana headed  to the store, holding the hand of his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter, when a  man jumps out of a passing car at shoots him in the neck and chest. The girl is  unharmed. Gonzalez dies less than an hour later, despite emergency surgery at  UCI Medical Center in Orange. Friends said Gonzalez had been trying to  extricate himself from street life. Police believe the shooting is gang-related  but have made no arrests.    APRIL 20 10:30 P.M.: 'Puro Southside!' 'Highland!'    Rojelio M. (Roger) Ochoa, 17, is shot four times in the back after an argument  with suspected gang members at a birthday party for a friend on East 3rd Street  in Santa Ana. According to Santa Ana Police Lt. David Salazar, witnesses heard  Ochoa yell, ""Puro (Pure) Southside,"" then saw his attacker fire four shots and  shout, ""Highland!"" Ochoa was described as a gentle boy from a tough  neighborhood who had left school for a job learning to repair personal  computers.    Eight days later, Eleazar Gonzales, 20, was arrested on suspicion of the  murder. Two months earlier, Gonzales, identified as a longtime Highland gang  member, had been acquitted of the 1988 murder of a fellow gang member. Gonzales  has said he is innocent of both killings.    APRIL 22 12:52 A.M.: 'He Wasn't a Criminal'     Cesar Torres Salgado, 15, is shot three times in the side from a passing van  as he is leaving a Santa Ana party at a South Hickory Street home. By 3 a.m. he  is dead. Salgado's friend, Javier Torres, 18, is shot in the back but survives.    Police and neighbors say the house is a longtime ""Lopers"" hang-out and is  pockmarked with bullets. Neighbors say the Lopers have been feuding for some  time with the nearby ""Eastsiders."" But friends said Salgado, a Horizon High  School student, belonged to a third gang named ""Middleside."" His street name  was ""Night Owl"" because he liked to stay up late. But they said he was just a  guest at the party, an innocent teen-ager who did not deserve to die.    ""He was a home boy, but he wasn't a criminal,"" one said.    APRIL 30 11:15 P.M.: He Dies in a Cousin's Arms    Rosendo Ibarra, 17, of Anaheim, is gunned down while talking to his girlfriend  at a pay telephone in a Garden Grove shopping center parking lot. He is shot  twice, once in the head, and dies in the arms of his cousin, Mona Marquez,  before help arrives.    Garden Grove police say Ibarra, a construction worker who had been out of work  since breaking his leg in February, was a member of the Colonia gang in  Stanton. Relatives reported seeing a dark Cadillac circling their neighborhood  the night before, and believe the shooting was planned.    David Alan Davis, 22, and Joe David Kehler, 23, both of Anaheim, have been  arrested on suspicion of the murder. Both men have been separately charged in  drug cases but it is not known whether Ibarra's killing was drug-related.  Police are still seeking several other suspects in the murder.    Ibarra was the father of a year-old daughter named Casandra.    Mona Marquez cried last week as she tried to explain how it felt to hold her  cousin as he died. ""I don't know who to hate, but I want something done,"" she  said.    MAY 11 1:30 A.M.: An 'Ordinary' Drive-By    Jesus Gutierrez, 21, of Garden Grove, is killed by gunfire from a passing car  as he and a friend stand in front of a house on West Henderson Place in Santa  Ana. Witnesses said Gutierrez, who died at the scene, hung around with gang  members. Also wounded was Juan Manuel Alcantar, a 25-year-old Santa Ana man who  described himself as a former member of the Middleside gang.    A RECORD GANG DEATH TOLL    With at least 17 deaths in the first five months of this year, law enforcement  authorities say gang violence is surpassing 1989, when roughly 16 gang-related  murders were committed.

He was  commenting on a report in the latest issue of the WEEKLY MAIL    GUARDIAN that Deputy Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Basie Smit was  at the heart of an investigation by the Goldstone Commission  into a major gun-running operation by senior SAP officers.    According to the newspaper, the commission's report could  contain the hardest evidence to date of an organised third force  within the security forces. Gen van der Merwe said in a  statement: ""I am aware that Judge Goldstone is conducting an  investigation into allegations that senior members of the SAP  are involved in acts of violence and gun-running. However,  according to my knowledge, these allegations are not in any way  related to drug-trafficking.    ""Personally I have no reason whatsoever to believe that any  senior member of the SAP is involved in such illegal activities.""    He said although he was aware of certain allegations being  investigated by the Goldstone Commission against Gen Smit, he  was convinced any proper investigation would clear him and that  his honour and professional reputation would ""emerge unblemished  from this episode"".    ""I have already urgently requested the Goldstone Commission  in writing to hold a comprehensive public inquiry into this  matter. It is a matter of the greatest possible importance to  both the SA Police and the future of the judicial system that  this matter be dealt with in such a manner that justice is seen  to be done and that the basic principles of justice are strictly  adhered to,"" Gen van der Merwe said.

0," LA102989-0072   127234    October 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition      Metro; Part B; Page 3; Column 1      2061 words      OCCASIONAL OFFICERS;    POLICE, SHERIFF'S RESERVES HELP FILL LAW ENFORCEMENT GAPS AS VOLUNTEERS IN THE  WAR ON CRIME      By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Patty Williams spends most nights serving cocktails at a restaurant in Acton.  But at least four nights a month, she straps on a gun and cruises the streets  of Pacoima.    Williams is not hanging out with a gang or dealing drugs. The gun is a police  service revolver, and she rides in a Los Angeles Police Department  black-and-white.    Williams is one of the 740 reserve officers in the Los Angeles Police  Department and 1,000 reserve deputies in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department who donate part of their time each month to chase criminals down  alleys, patrol crime-ridden streets on horseback, scour canyons for lost hikers  and perform most of the other duties of their full-time counterparts.    For Los Angeles police reservists, the only monetary compensation is a $15  monthly stipend to cover dry-cleaning of uniforms. Sheriff's reservists are  paid $1 a year to qualify for the department's liability insurance, which  covers only paid employees.    Officials say reserves are an increasingly essential part of the war against  crime in the San Fernando and neighboring valleys as law enforcement agencies  struggle to keep up with growth in those areas.    ""The reserves fill in the gaps,"" said Sgt. Bob Kellar, who is in charge of  reserve officer training at the Los Angeles Police Academy in Elysian Park. ""It  adds up to a tremendous contribution to our police needs in the city of Los  Angeles, not to mention tax savings.""    The reserves saved the city at least $1.5 million last year, Kellar said. The  figure is four times that amount by the reckoning of James C. Lombardi, a  Police Department reservist who is president of the California Reserve Peace  Officers Assn., which represents the more than 10,000 reservists at law  enforcement agencies statewide. Counting the benefits for the equivalent number  of full-time officers and other savings, the reserves saved the city about $6  million, Lombardi said.    Sheriff's Department reserves saved county taxpayers more than $11.8 million in  the 1988-89 fiscal year, according to Sheriff's Department statistics.    Reservists come from all walks of life but share a love for police work, Kellar  said.    ""We have everything from zookeepers to bus drivers, plumbers, electricians,  bankers, lawyers -- you name it, we've got it,"" he said.    Some reservists intended to become full-time police officers when they were  younger but wound up in other careers. As reservists, they say, they can  satisfy their interest in police work while continuing to make a living in  other professions.    Many of them want to fight crime in their communities, while some have special  skills -- such as search-and-rescue training, ham radio proficiency or foreign  language skills -- that police departments need on a part-time basis but cannot  afford full time.    ""I always wanted to be a police officer,"" said Stan Brittsan, a Thousand Oaks  resident who supervises telephone repair technicians for Pacific Bell and is a  reserve observer in a Los Angeles police helicopter every other weekend. ""But I  became interested in another career, so I put aside police work. Later, I  thought, 'I'm pushing 30 years old. Maybe it's too late for a career change,  but I can become involved in law enforcement by becoming a reserve officer.' ""    Along with having the same responsibilities as regular officers, many  reservists face the same risks.    John Cresto, a La Crescenta computer consultant and reservist who was assigned  to the Rampart Division about three years ago, said he was helping other  officers make an arrest when shots rang out.    ""I was standing in the middle of the street and somebody decided to do a  drive-by shooting at the black-and-whites,"" Cresto said. No one was hit, and  other officers later arrested the gunman, said Cresto, who is now assigned to  the Police Department's Foothill Division.    In the last 30 years, at least 11 sheriff's reservists have been killed in the  line of duty, said Sheriff's Capt. Stanley Backman, commander of the  department's Reserve Forces Bureau. Among Los Angeles police reservists, one  has been killed on duty over the past 21 years, Lombardi said.    Years ago, Los Angeles police reservists were mostly assigned routine patrol  and desk assignments, Kellar said. But today reservists often are assigned  special duties such as operating the Immediate Booking and Release System, or  IBARS, in which arrested suspects are booked in the field during gang or  prostitution sweeps, and they take part in foot patrols in crime-plagued  neighborhoods, he said.    ""We are increasingly relying on our reserves,"" Kellar said. ""We are utilizing  them more and more and in a more varied manner.""    Using reserves for special assignments gives the Police Department's 7,900  full-time officers more time to respond to the overwhelming number of emergency  calls that take up almost all of an officer's shift, Kellar said.    Unlike often overworked full-time officers, reserves have the time to do the  kind of nuts and bolts, old-fashioned police work that has become a luxury in  Los Angeles, officials said. That includes patrolling city parks to keep away  drug dealers or even taking so-called ""community enhancement"" reports from  residents complaining of potholes or other non-criminal neighborhood nuisances.  Police send those reports to whatever agency has jurisdiction over the  particular problem.    ""I like the idea of an officer being able to help rather than saying, 'Hey,  there's nothing I can do,' "" said Sgt. Gary Merrifield, the reserve coordinator  for the Police Department's Foothill Division, which serves the northeast  Valley.    ""If I use these reserves to the maximum to relieve a patrol officer, then what  I've done is give the patrol the little extra time to handle extra calls,"" he  said.    Of the 740 police reservists, 225 are classified as ""line reserves"" -- meaning  they carry a gun and are authorized to perform the same duties as full-time  officers. About an equal number are ""technical reserves"" who do not carry a gun  and are typically assigned desk duty or other administrative tasks. The  remaining 300 are ""reserve specialists"" -- people who have expertise in  computers, for example, or clergymen who volunteer as department chaplains.    The Sheriff Department's 1,000 reservists include 698 uniformed deputies, with  the rest divided among the department's Mountain Search and Rescue Team and  Mounted Posse. About 450 of the uniformed reservists perform the same functions  as full-time deputies. The other 248 are specialists assigned to a variety of  details, such as the Media Specialists Company, which helps produce training  films for deputies.    The 38 reservists and 45 civilian volunteers in the Media Specialists Company  produce, among other films, a series based on shootings involving deputies,  said Sgt. Mark Aguirre, supervisor of the Sheriff's Media Resources Section,  which oversees the company. The 35-millimeter films, aimed at demonstrating the  right and wrong procedures, are videotaped and sold or loaned to law  enforcement agencies nationwide, he said.    Many of the company's volunteers are successful Hollywood directors, writers  and directors of photography, Aguirre said. ""They are motivated by a basic  civic pride and a willingness to become involved and a real dedication toward  law enforcement,"" he said.    In both departments, only reservists who undergo the same training as full-time  officers are authorized to carry a gun on and off duty.    Line reserve recruits in the Police Department train for almost 10 months at  night and on weekends to receive the same amount of training as full-time  officer recruits do in six months. Technical reservists graduate after 17  weeks, Kellar said. In the Sheriff's Department, reservists go through an  18-week academy, also at night and on weekends, and those who want to join the  mountain rescue team receive additional training.    Both reserve programs have fewer participants than when they were begun during  World War II to replace officers who had joined the military, officials said.    The Police Department's contingent of 740 is ""at about as high a figure as  we've ever been in recent years,"" Kellar said, although the number is far short  of the record 2,000 men and women who signed up in the mid-1940s. Still, the  figure represents a large increase over the all-time low of about 150 in the  early 1950s, Kellar said.    Lombardi said minimum training requirements for reservists -- in effect since  passage of a state law in 1981 -- have led to a decline in interest in such  work.    ""The requirements are heavy,"" he said. ""That discourages a lot of people, but  that's fine because we're after the finished product. We're not out to just  give a gun to somebody.""    Reservists stay with the department for an average of nine years, about as long  as the average full-time officer serves, Lombardi said.    Backman of the Sheriff's Reserve Forces Bureau blames attrition and a general  loss of interest in volunteer work for the decline in his ranks from 1,200 in  1982 to today's 1,000.    ""It's more difficult to recruit volunteers for anything,"" Backman said. ""I  think it's because so many people work at least one job and sometimes two jobs  apiece. They just aren't as volunteer-minded as the previous generation.""    Nevertheless, hundreds of young professionals in typically high-paying jobs --  the average California reservist is 32, with an annual income of $40,000 --  donate an average of 32 hours each month to help fight crime.    On a recent Friday night in the Foothill Division, for example, Williams the  cocktail waitress teamed up with Cresto the computer consultant and a Lockheed  engineer to arrest a suspected drug dealer sitting in a car next to a Tujunga  park known for drug dealing.    The officers were patrolling the park because neighbors regularly complain of  drug dealers there, Sgt. Merrifield said. Though they found no large amounts of  drugs in the car and ended up arresting the man on three outstanding traffic  warrants, the officers achieved their main objective: visibility.    ""The reserves augment our manpower,"" Merrifield said. ""The guy's away from the  park. People have seen the arrest made. The park will be dead for the rest of  the night, and we've put a lid on it.""    While many in the reserve unit usually patrol the streets in cars, others ride  horseback, fly in helicopters or hike through rugged terrain, looking for  missing people. The mounted reservists supply their own horses and pay for  their upkeep.    Ben Pedrick, for example, searches for downed planes or lost hikers in the  hills behind Santa Clarita when he isn't working as an agent for Great-West  Life Assurance Co. in downtown Los Angeles.    A member of the all-reserve Sheriff's Mountain Search and Rescue Team in the  Santa Clarita Valley since 1966, the 61-year-old Granada Hills resident has  witnessed the kinds of emergencies that he insures clients against in his other  career.    Two years ago, a lengthy search for a lost motorcyclist ended when Pedrick and  other team members found the woman's body in an open field. She apparently had  died of heat exhaustion after abandoning her disabled motorcycle to seek help  on foot, Pedrick said.    Pedrick assisted in removing the body of a man killed Aug. 15 when a private  plane crashed into a steep ravine off Templin Highway, north of Castaic. While  county Fire Department paramedics prepared the injured pilot to be hoisted into  a rescue helicopter, Pedrick and other rescue team members were flown to the  scene in a sheriff's helicopter to search for victims who might have been  thrown from the plane.    Pedrick said participation in the search-and-rescue team allows him to pursue  an interest in mountaineering and hiking. He said he enjoys the camaraderie of  the other 14 reservists on the Santa Clarita team.    ""When I was in college, I was a rock climber,"" Pedrick said. ""When I got into  my 30s, I had a family, so I couldn't go rock climbing anymore. This is local.  And it's a fun group of guys to be with -- everyone there is interested in  helping people.""    Indeed, many reservists say the most rewarding part of the work is helping  others while taking a break from making a living.    ""A lot of us got into it because we wanted to do something for our  communities,"" Williams said. ""You can maintain your enthusiasm. It's not like a  regular job where you have to go in every day.""      Photo, . . . but carries a pistol as a Police Department technical reserve  officer.

"," LA102989-0072   127234    October 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition      Metro; Part B; Page 3; Column 1      2061 words      OCCASIONAL OFFICERS;    POLICE, SHERIFF'S RESERVES HELP FILL LAW ENFORCEMENT GAPS AS VOLUNTEERS IN THE  WAR ON CRIME      By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Patty Williams spends most nights serving cocktails at a restaurant in Acton.  But at least four nights a month, she straps on a gun and cruises the streets  of Pacoima.    Williams is not hanging out with a gang or dealing drugs. The gun is a police  service revolver, and she rides in a Los Angeles Police Department  black-and-white.    Williams is one of the 740 reserve officers in the Los Angeles Police  Department and 1,000 reserve deputies in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department who donate part of their time each month to chase criminals down  alleys, patrol crime-ridden streets on horseback, scour canyons for lost hikers  and perform most of the other duties of their full-time counterparts.    For Los Angeles police reservists, the only monetary compensation is a $15  monthly stipend to cover dry-cleaning of uniforms. Sheriff's reservists are  paid $1 a year to qualify for the department's liability insurance, which  covers only paid employees.    Officials say reserves are an increasingly essential part of the war against  crime in the San Fernando and neighboring valleys as law enforcement agencies  struggle to keep up with growth in those areas.    ""The reserves fill in the gaps,"" said Sgt. Bob Kellar, who is in charge of  reserve officer training at the Los Angeles Police Academy in Elysian Park. ""It  adds up to a tremendous contribution to our police needs in the city of Los  Angeles, not to mention tax savings.""    The reserves saved the city at least $1.5 million last year, Kellar said. The  figure is four times that amount by the reckoning of James C. Lombardi, a  Police Department reservist who is president of the California Reserve Peace  Officers Assn., which represents the more than 10,000 reservists at law  enforcement agencies statewide. Counting the benefits for the equivalent number  of full-time officers and other savings, the reserves saved the city about $6  million, Lombardi said.    Sheriff's Department reserves saved county taxpayers more than $11.8 million in  the 1988-89 fiscal year, according to Sheriff's Department statistics.    Reservists come from all walks of life but share a love for police work, Kellar  said.    ""We have everything from zookeepers to bus drivers, plumbers, electricians,  bankers, lawyers -- you name it, we've got it,"" he said.    Some reservists intended to become full-time police officers when they were  younger but wound up in other careers. As reservists, they say, they can  satisfy their interest in police work while continuing to make a living in  other professions.    Many of them want to fight crime in their communities, while some have special  skills -- such as search-and-rescue training, ham radio proficiency or foreign  language skills -- that police departments need on a part-time basis but cannot  afford full time.    ""I always wanted to be a police officer,"" said Stan Brittsan, a Thousand Oaks  resident who supervises telephone repair technicians for Pacific Bell and is a  reserve observer in a Los Angeles police helicopter every other weekend. ""But I  became interested in another career, so I put aside police work. Later, I  thought, 'I'm pushing 30 years old. Maybe it's too late for a career change,  but I can become involved in law enforcement by becoming a reserve officer.' ""    Along with having the same responsibilities as regular officers, many  reservists face the same risks.    John Cresto, a La Crescenta computer consultant and reservist who was assigned  to the Rampart Division about three years ago, said he was helping other  officers make an arrest when shots rang out.    ""I was standing in the middle of the street and somebody decided to do a  drive-by shooting at the black-and-whites,"" Cresto said. No one was hit, and  other officers later arrested the gunman, said Cresto, who is now assigned to  the Police Department's Foothill Division.    In the last 30 years, at least 11 sheriff's reservists have been killed in the  line of duty, said Sheriff's Capt. Stanley Backman, commander of the  department's Reserve Forces Bureau. Among Los Angeles police reservists, one  has been killed on duty over the past 21 years, Lombardi said.    Years ago, Los Angeles police reservists were mostly assigned routine patrol  and desk assignments, Kellar said. But today reservists often are assigned  special duties such as operating the Immediate Booking and Release System, or  IBARS, in which arrested suspects are booked in the field during gang or  prostitution sweeps, and they take part in foot patrols in crime-plagued  neighborhoods, he said.    ""We are increasingly relying on our reserves,"" Kellar said. ""We are utilizing  them more and more and in a more varied manner.""    Using reserves for special assignments gives the Police Department's 7,900  full-time officers more time to respond to the overwhelming number of emergency  calls that take up almost all of an officer's shift, Kellar said.    Unlike often overworked full-time officers, reserves have the time to do the  kind of nuts and bolts, old-fashioned police work that has become a luxury in  Los Angeles, officials said.

0," LA021389-0101   18134    February 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 1; Column 1; Metro Desk      1571 words      BRAZEN BANDIT;    POLICE SAY IT WILL BE TOUGH TO CAPTURE DARING OUTLAW WHO BROKE OUT OF ORANGE  COUNTY JAIL      By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer      On a wall in his island home on Puget Sound, Michael Taylor hung a picture of  himself posing in front of posters of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted fugitives.    Police who searched the place saw it as an expression of an ambition, which  they found unsettling.    ""It seemed like it would make his life to be on that 10 Most Wanted list,"" said  Newport Beach Police Detective John Desmond.    Today, Taylor may be a candidate for just such a distinction. He is the target  of an intense nationwide manhunt that began last November when he and four  other inmates escaped from the Orange County Jail by rappelling from the roof  of the four-story structure with a rope of braided bed sheets.    Almost immediately, authorities concluded that Taylor was the mastermind of the  daring jailbreak. Almost 3 months later, he is the only one of the five  escapees who is still at large.    Taylor has a reputation as a self-confident thrill seeker who has been an  extraordinarily successful outlaw because he is also intelligent and a  perfectionist. The jail breakout, like other brazen escapes in his past, fit  the profile.    Police say that Taylor, 35, has made a career out of armed jewelry robberies  and that he goes about it like a corporate employee bucking for a promotion.  He's usually well dressed -- sometimes in a three-piece suit -- and he uses  rented, full-sized American cars for getaways.    Last week, police say, Taylor committed yet another bold robbery, holding up a  jewelry store near Chicago in which he and an accomplice made off with about  $450,000 in gems.    The fact that his picture is being passed around at police roll calls all over  the country -- including his native Chicago -- has not seemed to deter him. In  fact, the element of high risk is almost part of Taylor's signature.    Since 1987, police estimate, Taylor has stolen about $2 million in jewels from  almost two dozen Southern California stores, including seven in Orange County.    In the adrenalin-charged minutes of the robberies, police say, it is Taylor who  barks assignments to his partners, keeps track of the clock and quickly gathers  the loot.    ""He is not an emotional robber,"" said Jack Price, owner of Designer Jewelers  Inc. in Huntington Beach, who was the victim last year of a $450,000 holdup  allegedly committed by Taylor. ""It's a business for him. I was in the Army  Rangers in Vietnam, and we were taught to do everything click, click, click; he  was that kind of a methodical guy. He knew what he was doing . . . and he was  good at it.""    What police fear most is Taylor's cool temperament and cold-blooded character.  He has never been charged with shooting anyone, although police say he has been  armed in all of the robberies he has pulled -- and two of the Orange County  heists erupted into shoot-outs.    ""You've got a potentially dangerous person -- there's no doubt about it,"" said  Huntington Beach Police Detective Tom Gilligan.    Both the authorities and inmates who knew Taylor in jail distinguish this man  from most people in the system.    He doesn't drink and he doesn't use drugs, they say. He has a middle-class life  style with a live-in girlfriend and two kids, one of which he fathered. After  the string of robberies in Southern California, the family moved into a  waterfront house on Vashon Island in Washington state with a hot tub on the  rear deck and a private dock.    Police who searched the house found -- in addition to the photograph on the  wall -- an aquarium in which the gravel was sprinkled with stolen rubies.    Taylor is glib, friendly and a master at assuming fake identities.      Fake Identities    He has used numerous fake identification cards, including one that said he is  an employee of a bogus company called the Criminal Research Assn. in Chicago.  Another pictures him as the owner of the California Home Improvement Co. in  Long Beach.    Taylor, who has been known to carry an 18-karat gold handgun, assumed the alias  of Anthony Gianetti so effectively that some police departments still don't  know his real name. The Orange County Sheriff's Department released the  Gianetti alias when he escaped from jail. His former jail mates still call him  Tony.    ""I would probably describe him as the kind of person you'd find selling  automobiles or real estate,"" said Huntington Beach Sgt. William Van Cleve.  ""He's very outgoing, very friendly and he has a tendency to be charming in a  phony way.""    Newport Beach Police Detective John Desmond tracked Taylor for months, and  traveled to Washington for the search of his home.    ""I think he's not driven like a lot of guys are because they're addicted to  drugs,"" Desmond said. ""He's doing the best way he knows to make money; he's  just going about his business. And he's good at what he does.    ""I don't know if his ego is so big that he does it for notoriety too, but  that's a possibility.""      No Doubt of Mastermind    When they heard Taylor was involved in the escape last Nov. 20, detectives  Gilligan and Desmond had no doubt that he was the mastermind. Desmond said  Taylor had boasted that he was going to break out.    The district attorney had told Taylor he was facing more than 40 years in  prison for the seven Orange County robberies, and Los Angeles prosecutors were  planning to charge him with an additional 10 armed robberies.    Taylor was in a five-man cell in the Orange County Jail along with two other  inmates involved in the escape, Steven Wilson and Richard Fluharty. Sources  said the two other inmates who broke out with Taylor, Wilson and Fluharty were  not involved in planning the escape but joined in at the last minute.    One of those two broke his leg when he fell from the roof because the makeshift  rope ripped on barbed, razor-wire. He was captured outside the jail that night.  The other, who was in jail facing a murder charge, turned himself in on  Thanksgiving Day.    The five inmates involved in the escape made off from a rooftop recreation area  after cutting through a chain-link fence. Contrary to policy, they were not  searched for weapons or tools before being taken to the recreation area that  night.      Deputies Miscounted    And, as the Orange County grand jury found later, the deputies on duty at the  jail that night miscounted the 68 inmates as they left the roof, so the escape  was not discovered for several hours. A neighborhood caller told police he had  seen men running down the street in jail clothing.    The two deputies assigned to the rooftop area that night are still on  administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal Sheriff's Department  investigation.    After their escape, Wilson, Fluharty and Taylor stripped to their shorts and  convinced a bystander that they needed a ride to a hospital. Once inside the  car, police said, the escapees displayed a jail-made knife and threw the driver  out of the car.    Two weeks later, Wilson and Fluharty were arrested in Denver with the same  getaway car.    For Taylor, it may have been his most daring escape, but it only added to a  longtime reputation. After Taylor's arrest in Huntington Beach, police there  considered him so slippery that they warned the Sheriff's Department, which  runs the county jail, in writing: ""Given a chance, he will escape.""    ""Escape is kind of his middle name,"" Desmond said later.      Jumped From Car    Last June, Taylor had eluded Seattle police who spotted him on a ferry. Police  say Taylor escaped during a chase by jumping from his car while turning the  wheel over to his girlfriend.    A few weeks later, police say, he slipped away from the Border Patrol in New  Mexico when he was stopped at a checkpoint while driving a stolen pickup truck.  He ran more than 10 miles across the desert before police search dogs found him  buried in the dirt trying to hide from helicopters.    Taylor also escaped from California's Chino state prison in 1975 while he was  serving a sentence for an armed robbery committed when he was 21.    His history of escapes has caused some to question whether he should have been  treated as a greater security risk at the Orange County Jail.    There are four security categories in the jail that are designated by colored  wristbands worn by the inmates. A white band calls for minimum security, and  the grade increases through yellow, orange and red. Red-banded inmates are  isolated from the rest of the prison population.    Taylor wore an orange band.      Won't Discuss Security    Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson said that overcrowding at the jail prevents the  department from designating very many red-band prisoners. But he would not say  whether the overcrowding was a factor in classifying Taylor.    ""The security is something that we generally don't talk about,"" Olson said.  ""All I can say is that I don't want to get into that.""    The search for Taylor now involves dozens of police agencies across the  country, including the FBI. The day he allegedly staged the robbery last week,  Chicago's rank-and-file police officers had just been shown his picture and  heard a lecture about his typical ""method of operation.""    Because of his cunning, police say, he is going to be difficult to capture. But  also, partly because of his confidence, they are convinced he will be caught.    ""He is certainly brazen,"" said Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Barry. ""It's  going to be difficult to catch him . . . he's obviously very transient -- from  Los Angeles to Seattle to New Mexico -- but I don't doubt that he'll make a  mistake somewhere along the road.""

He pointed out that over 75 percent of the  area in Tak is mountains and dense jungles suitable for  marijuana cultivation by hill tribes such as at Pang Sangkasi,  Vang Tamlung, and Phaphun villages in Na Bot District and Na  Khiri village in Muang Tak District.    Police Colonel Thatnarong added that capitalists from the  northeastern region and upper part of the northern region will  normally give marijuana seeds to tribesmen to begin cultivation  at the beginning of the rainy season and provide the necessary  instructions to ensure a bumper harvest. Marijuana is  compressed into bars and sent by trucks to Chiang Rai Province  from where the drug will be shipped down the Mekong River to the  Gulf of Thailand for export to foreign countries and sale in  domestic markets.    The officer said: ""Our unit has been coordinating with the  northern branch of the Office of Narcotics Control Board in  search of marijuana plantations in the northern provinces. We  destroyed not less than 15 tons of the grass worth millions of  baht during each crackdown operation. However, the authorities  also faced numerous difficulties because all the plantations are  located in remote and mountainous areas which enables the  culprits to flee before their arrival.""    Meanwhile, Suphong Manatphaibun, deputy governor of Nakhon  Phanom Province, disclosed that the provincial administration  does not have sufficient information to confirm the NCB office's  claim that Nakhon Phanom is the largest marijuana-producing area  in the country. However, he admitted that there are some  marijuana plantations in the province. Several portions of the  drug found in the province were smuggled into the country and  authorities have been instructed to launch regular search and  suppression operations.    Sub-lieutenant Prawat Athipanya, deputy governor of Sakon  Nakhon Province, expressed his disagreement with the report by  the NCB Office saying Sakon Nakhon is one of the three largest  marijuana- producing provinces in Thailand, noting that small  plantations are scattered in the mountainous areas of Kut Bak  District and Phuphan reserve forest. Unlike other provinces,  Sakon Nakhon does not have any big investors engaging in  marijuana cultivation. The provincial administration has  ordered that continuous suppression operations be carried out  throughout the province.    Sub-lieutenant Praswant said: ""Most of the grass is grown in  Tha Uthen District of Nakhon Phanom Province and in Laos, where  Lao farmers plant marijuana along the bank of the Mekong River.  We can clearly see the plants from the Thai side."" He  disclosed that Sakon Nakhon is no longer a marijuana transit  point due to intensified suppression operations by provincial  officials.    Banphot Piamdi, director of the Narcotics Control Center in  the northern region, revealed that opium cultivation remains the  big problem in the 17 northern provinces. The total acreage  used for opium cultivation in 1993 was as high as 16,000 rai  [2.5 rai is equivalent to one 1 acre]. Marijuana cultivation  was first introduced to Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Mae Hong Son,  Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai Provinces in 1987 and later spread to  other nearby provinces. Tribesmen have found it easier and less  complicated to grow marijuana than opium. Moreover, they can  earn more from planting marijuana. More tribes people have now  shifted to planting marijuana, but most of them plant the crop  for their own consumption and sale in small quantities.  Marijuana is not as big a business here as it is in the  northeast.    Witthaya Kaeopharadai, Phalang Tham MP from Nakhon Si  Thammarat Province, said people should not think that the U.S.  drug charge against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is politically  motivated, adding that Thanong has acted correctly in appointing  lawyers to deal with and clear himself from the U.S. accusation.    Asked about the thesis by an NCB official on police  involvement in drug trafficking connections, Police General  Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department,  replied that the topic is not unusual. In the past, several  police officers and officials of other government agencies have  been arrested on drug charges.     "

Almost three-quarters of the crimes committed in Slovakia  are  of an economic nature. Representatives from the Financial  Police estimate tax evasion during the first three months of  this year to amount to nearly 3.5 billion korunas [Sk].  Criminal proceedings are already underway in cases involving  losses of about Sk1.0 billion. In scams involving the import of  oil products during the first quarter alone, certain importers  defrauded the state of some Sk300-400 million in taxes. The  Financial Police have reason to suspect that an extensive  network of fraudsters with contacts abroad is operating here.    The activity of the Financial Police in machinations in the  so-called old account between the Slovak and Czech Republics is,  at the moment, more of an investigative and informative nature.  It is apparent from the investigation, however, that ""in scams  associated with the old account between the Slovak and Czech  Republics during the first three months of the year alone,  evasion amounting to Sk1.0 billion is estimated."" However, it  is still not clear whether such an abuse of the account is  really a crime or merely an abuse of what the law does not  prohibit.    Minister Pittner said, in connection with screenings, that  they will be carried out by the Slovak Information Service,  because this task falls to it by law. Unfortunately, that part  of the ""screening law"" concerning the candidates for secret  collaboration, which the Constitutional Court of the former  Federation suggested be removed from the law, has not been  amended.

The PJE reported that those arrested were in possession of  weapons. Carmen Victoria Coronel, wife of Juan Jose Quintero  Payan, was among those arrested. Quintero Paya apparently is a  relative of drug-trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. The police  also reported that authorities seized a briefcase containing  4,000 new pesos and $7,000 in cash, as well as an additional  14,110 new pesos.    As part of the investigations, police raided the residence  of  Luis Enrique Fernandez Hurtado, who was not arrested, and seized  seven AK-47's, known here as ""goat horns""; an R-15 rifle; and a  .45 caliber pistol.    It also has been reported that the people killed in the bomb  blast have been identified as Marcial Gonzalez Muniz and  Guillermo Gomez Chavez. Manuel Delgadillo Paez, director of the  Investigations Department of the State Attorney General's  Office, also reported that experts are working to determine what  kind of explosives and how much were used in the bomb.    At 0200 (0800 GMT) Saturday, a Ford Grand Marquiz exploded  in  the parking lot of a Guadalajara Hotel where a birthday party  was being held. Two people were killed and five others injured  as a result of the explosion. The hotel management has filed a  property-damage suit against whomever is found guilty of the  attack. The police also reported that their investigations have  established that two stolen cars were parked in the parking lot  in which the bomb exploded.     "

It  is now a conscientious action taken by all members of the Army  and the National Police operating in that part of the Peruvian  jungle.    On 2 April in San Martin, an inhospitable area in the  Tarapoto jungle, a Dinandro [National Antidrug Division] patrol  supported by the Air Police detected a lab for processing  cocaine base and acted by surprise. Not even the torrential rain  or the thunderstorm stopped police, who arrested five people.    After the operation, police seized 128 kg of cocaine base,  many ingredients for making the drug, and a shotgun.    Back at the Tarapoto airport the arrested were taken to the  police station. The police then, without knowing reporters were  present, gave the arrested soft drinks and their own food  rations they used in their operations.    None of the arrested showed signs of violence on their  bodies  when they were put under the jurisdiction of judicial officials.  They also never complained about being mistreated by police.    A police sergeant said: ``We always respect the rights of  the  people we arrest, even under the most adverse circumstances  after they use their weapons on us and we capture them.''    This National Police action, without the tempting presence  of  cameras and microphones, shows that human rights are indeed  respected in Peru and that there is no need for ``spokesmen''  abroad to report alleged human right violations. The real  situation is in that remote region where perhaps one of those  ``spokesmen'' never saw what happened.     "

By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Three Saturday night parties in Los Alamitos, Santa Ana and Buena Park erupted  into bloody street fights among gang members, leaving two teen-agers dead and  three seriously wounded, police said.    The shootings and stabbings were unrelated, but all three melees involved large  parties that apparently were crashed by rival gang members. Police said it is  unusual for gangs to have such street brawls, noting that they typically attack  rivals in drive-by shootings.    ""Gang members are like everyone else, and Saturday night is party night,"" said  Buena Park Police Lt. Patrick Black. ""If rival gang members want to provoke  something, they usually know where to find them. But most of the time it leads  to drive-by shootings. I can't recall another one here like this in 10 years.""    In Los Alamitos, police were called at 11:10 p.m. to 3952 San Mateo Ave., a  residential street in the city's northern tip, sandwiched between Cypress and  Long Beach. Apparently a fight had erupted in the street among the guests and  an uninvited group of people from a rival gang, police said.    A 16-year-old boy, apparently the host of the party, was stabbed to death. One  of his guests, a 19-year-old male, was in serious condition with stab wounds at  Long Beach Memorial Hospital, police said Sunday.    After a helicopter search, police arrested a 17-year-old youth and a  19-year-old man, both from Los Alamitos, and were holding them for questioning.  As many as three other suspects remained at large Sunday, police said. Police  declined to identify any of the suspects or victims.    Gang violence is rare in Los Alamitos, and police there declined to discuss  gang problems in the city. But Cypress police, who patrol streets within a  block of the double stabbing, said they have seen increased gang activity in  their city.    ""There's been a noticeable increase over the last year or two. More and more of  our patrol people are coming in contact with various gangs,"" Cypress Sgt. Sandy  Stanton said.    ""We're still pretty untouched, compared to L.A. County,"" she said. ""It's pretty  unusual to have something this major occur. Mostly we just see more graffiti.  It's nothing real big right now, but three or four years down the road may be  something else entirely.""    On Sunday, pools of blood still caked the sidewalk and driveway in front of the  San Mateo Avenue house, a gray wood and brick home with a child's inflatable  swimming pool on the front porch roof.    Neighbors identified the dead boy as Eddie Naverette, who had recently moved  there with his mother and a younger brother and sister.    Roger Rangel, who had been Naverette's stepfather until he and the boy's mother  divorced, said Sunday that he did not think the boy was in a gang. Rangel said  the boy had dropped out of school, was working with his uncle's construction  company and spent a lot of time with his girlfriend and 1-year-old daughter  Alexis.    Neighbors said they have never seen gangs in their middle-class neighborhood of  single family homes, which is about two blocks from Los Alamitos High School.    ""I hope it's an isolated incident,"" said John Balestracci, 56, who lives across  the street from the house where the party was held. ""The mother just recently  took over the house.""    His wife, Jo Ann Balestracci, 31, said they watched part of the fight from a  window in their home.    ""All you saw were people running in all directions. We heard lots of yelling  and heard a girl screaming. And we heard some kid yelling, 'You're going to  die, boy, you're going to die!' ""    About the same time as the Los Alamitos stabbings, Santa Ana police found a  17-year-old shot dead and another 17-year-old with a gunshot wound to the head  at 1100 S. Rosewood Ave.    The two teens were not identified. The injured youth was in critical condition  Sunday at an unidentified hospital, police said. They had no suspects Sunday.    Santa Ana police said shootings grew out of a street fight involving two rival  gangs that had converged at a party.    One witness said he called police about 10 p.m. to break up the party, but  officers did not immediately respond.    ""I called four times over there. They said they were too busy,"" said Frank  Balderrama, who lives on Rosewood Avenue.    ""There was loud music and cars in the street so I called police. Then, about  five minutes later, there were 30 to 50 youths out there, pushing and shoving,""  Balderrama said. ""I called (police) again. Then I heard bottles being broken.  Some guys went in their cars and got chains. I called again. Then I heard five  shots.    ""It's a disgrace, the way (police) handled this. If they had cooperated with  the first call I made, (the victim) wouldn't be dead,"" Balderrama said. ""This  town needs more police officers on weekends.""    Police said Sunday that they could not comment on Balderrama's complaints  because the officers involved were not present.    Earlier Saturday night, about 8:30 p.m., Buena Park police received a call  about a large party that had ended in gunfire on Flamingo Drive, Lt. Black  said.    Gabriel Orozco, 18, of Cypress, was shot twice, with one bullet lodging in his  left elbow and another hitting his gallbladder. He was in serious but stable  condition Sunday after several hours of surgery at UCI Medical Center.    Police said at least two gangs were involved in the Buena Park shooting, but  they had no suspects.    Times staff writer Lucy Chabot contributed to this story.

The groups operate mostly out of Orange County in the Vietnamese communities of  Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, investigators said. But robberies as  far east as Phoenix and as far north as Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay  Area are being linked to the gangs.    The bandits have typically struck late at night and carried out highly  organized, paramilitary-type missions at some of California's best known  computer concerns -- binding and gagging workers and routinely issuing death  threats against them, authorities said.    ""Vietnamese subjects come in -- usually four to five at a time -- and  completely take over a company,"" said Santa Clara Police Sgt. Pete Pearson.  ""It's totally out of control.""    Federal agencies including the FBI and U.S. Customs Service acknowledged that  they are looking into the Vietnamese gangs as part of broad investigations of  microchip thefts and a black market that reaches into Pacific Rim countries  including Taiwan, Japan and Vietnam.    ""We are trying to get a handle on it,"" said Chuck Latting, an FBI spokesman in  San Francisco.    Because chip theft has only begun to emerge as a significant problem in the  last year, there are no reliable national statistics on the amount or value of  chips stolen annually. But several major companies have reported large losses  from the thefts in recent months.    For instance, Irvine-based computer giant Western Digital Corp. said that  microchip thefts have cost it $7 million so far this year.    ""There is not a company that hasn't had some form of theft,"" said Robert  Erickson, a Western Digital vice president.    Microchips -- which are used in everything from toasters to missiles -- make  attractive booty because they are small but valuable. Just a handful can bring  several thousand dollars. Furthermore, very few chips have serial numbers, so  they are difficult to trace.    For those reasons, microchip theft is quickly becoming a crime-of-choice for an  increasing number of people.    ""It's like a disease right now that we are seeing grow in the electronics  industry and I don't think by any means we've seen the peak,"" said Lee Roberts,  a private detective for several corporate victims. ""There's going to be more.""    Purchasers range from unwitting computer hackers picking up supplies at local  swap meets to the small electronics shops in the Little Saigon area of Orange  County that police say fence hot chips and are a key cog in the black market.    Ordinarily, the types of chips being stolen -- mostly DRAMs or dynamic  random-access memory chips -- retail for either $5 or $15 depending on  capacity, although in a few instances bandits have made off with chips worth  $400 each. Thieves then sell them at a reduced price.    ""Prices are usually much lower and that's what induces that businessman to want  to buy that product,"" said Irvine Police Sgt. Dick Bowman.    The chips are being stolen in three ways -- armed robbery by organized gangs,  random burglaries and small-time thefts by employees, authorities said.    Those officials confirmed that there have been at least 12 armed robberies in  which microchips were stolen in the last year in the Orange County and San Jose  area, two regions of California with high concentrations of computer companies.  At least eight of them were carried about by Vietnamese groups.    Police say the heavy Vietnamese involvement in microchip theft is because such  a high number of them are employed in the electronics industry.    Express Manufacturing Inc., an electronics company in Santa Ana, was a recent  victim of an armed robbery pulled off by Vietnamese bandits.    On Aug. 16, shortly after midnight, owner Chauk Chin was leaving the company  when two young Vietnamese men approached him, police said. The men pulled out  handguns and ordered the owner to return to his office. Once inside, they let  in three accomplices through the back door.    The group's leader was barefoot and dressed in black pajamas. He referred to  his compatriots not by name but by number. He shouted out instructions with  military precision. One suspect was ordered to search the premises for more  employees and found three.    ""The employees were bound with their arms behind their backs using duct tape,""  said Santa Ana Police Detective Bill Chaney. ""Legs were taped together and eyes  and mouths were taped. They were told to lie on the floor face down with one of  the suspects standing guard over them with a gun.""    Chin -- with a pistol pointed to the back of his head -- led the suspects to  the company's inventory. No one was injured, but $500,000 worth of microchips  were taken, police said.    Nearly all of the chips were subsequently recovered by police inside a Santa  Ana residence. Police arrested three men -- An Dinh Le, 26, and Vu Van Pham,  24, both of Santa Ana, and Benedi Pabillore, 23, of Downey -- on suspicion of  possessing stolen property. They were released pending further investigation,  and police have not charged the men with any crime including gang-related  theft.    Besides Express Management, police said at least eight other companies in  California were robbed by Vietnamese gangs in the last year, including the  following:    * ISIS Surface Mounting Inc. in San Jose, Aug. 31. Two Vietnamese suspects with  semiautomatic pistols tied up two employees and escaped with $400,000 worth of  microchips.    * Vantronic Corp. in San Jose, April 28. Three Vietnamese suspects told  late-shift employees to lie face down on the ground or be shot. They made off  with $100,000 worth of microchips.    * Telecomputer Inc. in Westminster, March 31. A Vietnamese suspect and a  Cambodian suspect tied up an employee and stole $100,000 in microchips.    * Data Technology Corp. in Santa Clara, Dec. 30. Four Vietnamese suspects  commandeered an employee's vehicle and forced him back into the company, where  they stole about $126,000 worth of computer equipment, mostly microchips.    * W. G. Holt Inc. in Irvine, Nov. 24 -- Thanksgiving Day. Two Vietnamese  suspects tied up a security guard and took $150,000 worth of microchips.    Police detectives in Southern California and the Silicon Valley recently found  evidence that the Vietnamese crime rings sometimes work together, trafficking  stolen chips -- sometimes known as semiconductors or integrated circuits --  from Northern California through Orange County.    The first link between the gangs was established after an investigation into a  murder at a San Jose restaurant Feb. 25.    One suspect -- later charged with murder -- was one of several San Jose  residents who ate dinner at the Tu Do restaurant the same night with a group of  men from Orange County.    Police were certain the reason for the murder was simply the result of a fight  with a diner at a nearby table. But they continued to interview witnesses  anyway as bits and pieces of that night's table talk leaked out. Before long,  investigators had pieced together a connection between the two groups.    ""The purpose of their meeting at that restaurant was to discuss the sale of  stolen integrated circuits,"" said San Jose Police Detective Walt Robinson.  ""Stolen integrated circuits from San Jose are being negotiated and sold off to  a group in Orange County.""    The man charged with murder even had a stash of chips in his car, police said.    Two months later on April 25, a similar murder occurred at the Phu Khanh  restaurant in Garden Grove around 10:30 p.m. Garden Grove Police Detective Ron  Shave is trying to find Hung Tien Tran, a Vietnamese man charged with murder  who has disappeared.    Shave said police have evidence to indicate that Tran is dealing in stolen  microchips. ""And we know that one of Hung's (Tran's) acquaintances was also at  the San Jose murder,"" Shave said.    Despite the links, police admit they are still a long way from cracking any of  the robbery rings largely because members can hide in the closed-mouthed  Vietnamese community.    ""We haven't been able to infiltrate it,"" said Lt. Mike White of Irvine.    Privately, many law enforcement officials concede that gangs are probably  responsible for at least a part of the burglaries, some of which are just as  well thought out as armed robberies but occur at times when companies are  completely empty of employees.    Burglars stole $176,000 worth of computer equipment -- mostly microchips --  from Unitex Inc. in Tustin over the July 4 weekend, police and company  officials said. The company's alarm system never rang through to the local  police station because the phone lines it needs to work were severed.    ""They cut the phone lines into our complex, pried our door open and came in and  just cleaned us out,"" said Don Smith Jr., the company's manager.    Tustin Police Lt. H.D. Williams says his investigation of the incident is ""dead  in the water.""    Nevertheless, the modus operandi in the Unitex burglary is rather common.    ""These guys are so sophisticated that in many of the instances they are  actually defeating the alarm system,"" said Roberts. ""On one occasion they came  prepared enough to where they brought a saw to actually cut through a metal  door.""    But some chip burglaries are committed by small-time operators rather than  Vietnamese gangs.    For instance, on Aug. 3, 27-year-old Johnny Charles Gallo showed up in a United  Parcel Service uniform at Toshiba America Electronic Components Inc. in Irvine.    ""He came up to the loading dock, identifies himself as a UPS driver and  attempts to take possession of electronic components,"" said White.    The employees called police.    ""They got a little suspicious when they didn't see the (UPS) truck,"" explained  White.    Police arrested Gallo after they found microchips inside a Ryder rental truck  he was driving. Schweber Electronics in Irvine claimed the chips inside Gallo's  truck were stolen from them a day earlier.    Gallo pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to 240 days in jail.    Besides battling armed robberies and burglaries, computer firms are desperately  trying to put down a series of microchip thefts by their own employees.    Western Digital has caught workers trying to take home 100 to 200 chips.    ""That's a lot of money for some guy making $4, $5, $6 an hour,"" said Bowman of  the Irvine police department.    AST Research Inc. in Irvine discovered late last year that some workers in its  order department were creating phony invoices and then sending chips to  addresses where they could later pick them up, according to police reports.    The company estimated it lost $184,000 as a result of the scheme. No arrests  have been made, but the case is still under investigation, Irvine police said.    Some police are convinced that some electronics shops in the Little Saigon area  of Orange County are the primary buyers and sellers of hot chips.    ""You can pick any shop in the area which sells loose chips and chances are they  are selling stolen chips. It's that prevalent,"" said Westminster Police  Detective Marcus Frank. ""We know a lot of the chips stolen in Orange County and  California are being brought into this area to be resold.'    Garden Grove police recovered $5,000 worth of stolen chips in April from an  electronics company called AQA Inc., which recently moved to Cypress. The chips  were taken from a Houston firm, which recognized them in an advertisement.    AQA manager Conn Wong refused to comment on the advice of his attorney but one  of his employees said the company did not know the chips were stolen.    Convicting a store owner selling stolen chips is nearly impossible because  state law requires he must have knowingly purchased hot property.    ""The people are smart and they know that if somebody comes in and says 'I just  stole this' then they probably won't buy it,"" said White. ""And that's what we  need to do to make arrests.""    Foreign traffic in stolen chips is believed to be considerable because of the  number of computer manufacturers in the Pacific Rim clamoring for chips.    Western Digital discovered that 500,000 defective chips had been stolen from  its inventory and that some of them were on their way to Taiwan. Fearing that  if the bad chips were sold it would damage the firm's reputation, Western  Digital tried to buy them back for $11 a chip. Somebody else got them for $12.    The international black market for stolen chips is perhaps the most troubling  aspect for many companies. The U.S. government strictly forbids sales of  microchips to certain countries and any violations are dealt with severely.    Private consultants and local police stress that computer companies need to  improve security in order to prevent further thefts.    ""The electronics industry is such an easy target,"" said Roberts. ""It's easier  than a bank, it's easier than an armored car, it's easier than a jewelry  store.""    Some companies have heeded the warnings. ICL North America in Irvine recently  installed security cameras and started an anonymous hot line for employees to  report internal thefts.    But few companies are eager to go much further, refusing to consider such  things as searching employees when they leave work.    Police and industry leaders meet regularly in the San Jose area to discuss  strategies to reduce microchip thefts under the auspices of the District  Attorneys Technology Theft Assn. Southern California does not have anything  similar.    ""There needs to be a concentrated effort by the electronics industry and law  enforcement,"" said Roberts. ""Until that's done, I don't see any resolution of  the problem.""    Le Kim Dinh served as a translator in the reporting of this article.

The groups operate mostly out of Orange County in the Vietnamese communities of  Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, investigators said. But robberies as  far east as Phoenix and as far north as Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay  Area are being linked to the gangs.

He pointed out that over 75 percent of the  area in Tak is mountains and dense jungles suitable for  marijuana cultivation by hill tribes such as at Pang Sangkasi,  Vang Tamlung, and Phaphun villages in Na Bot District and Na  Khiri village in Muang Tak District.    Police Colonel Thatnarong added that capitalists from the  northeastern region and upper part of the northern region will  normally give marijuana seeds to tribesmen to begin cultivation  at the beginning of the rainy season and provide the necessary  instructions to ensure a bumper harvest. Marijuana is  compressed into bars and sent by trucks to Chiang Rai Province  from where the drug will be shipped down the Mekong River to the  Gulf of Thailand for export to foreign countries and sale in  domestic markets.    The officer said: ""Our unit has been coordinating with the  northern branch of the Office of Narcotics Control Board in  search of marijuana plantations in the northern provinces. We  destroyed not less than 15 tons of the grass worth millions of  baht during each crackdown operation. However, the authorities  also faced numerous difficulties because all the plantations are  located in remote and mountainous areas which enables the  culprits to flee before their arrival.""    Meanwhile, Suphong Manatphaibun, deputy governor of Nakhon  Phanom Province, disclosed that the provincial administration  does not have sufficient information to confirm the ONCB  office's claim that Nakhon Phanom is the largest  marijuana-producing area in the country. However, he admitted  that there are some marijuana plantations in the province.  Several portions of the drug found in the province were  smuggled into the country and authorities have been instructed  to launch regular search and suppression operations.    Sub-lieutenant Prawat Athipanya, deputy governor of Sakon  Nakhon Province, expressed his disagreement with the report by  the ONCB Office saying Sakon Nakhon is one of the three largest  marijuana-producing provinces in Thailand, noting that small  plantations are scattered in the mountainous areas of Kut Bak  District and Phuphan reserve forest. Unlike other provinces,  Sakon Nakhon does not have any big investors engaging in  marijuana cultivation. The provincial administration has  ordered that continuous suppression operations be carried out  throughout the province.    Sub-lieutenant Praswant said: ""Most of the grass is grown in  Tha Uthen District of Nakhon Phanom Province and in Laos, where  Lao farmers plant marijuana along the bank of the Mekong River.  We can clearly see the plants from the Thai side."" He  disclosed that Sakon Nakhon is no longer a marijuana transit  point due to intensified suppression operations by provincial  officials.    Banphot Piamdi, director of the Narcotics Control Center in  the northern region, revealed that opium cultivation remains the  big problem in the 17 northern provinces. The total acreage  used for opium cultivation in 1993 was as high as 16,000 rai  [2.5 rai is equivalent to one 1 acre]. Marijuana cultivation  was first introduced to Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Mae Hong Son,  Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai Provinces in 1987 and later spread to  other nearby provinces. Tribesmen have found it easier and less  complicated to grow marijuana than opium. Moreover, they can  earn more from planting marijuana. More tribes people have now  shifted to planting marijuana, but most of them plant the crop  for their own consumption and sale in small quantities.  Marijuana is not as big a business here as it is in the  northeast.    Witthaya Kaeopharadai, Phalang Tham MP from Nakhon Si  Thammarat Province, said people should not think that the U.S.  drug charge against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is politically  motivated, adding that Thanong has acted correctly in appointing  lawyers to deal with and clear himself from the U.S. accusation.    Asked about the thesis by an ONCB official on police  involvement in drug trafficking connections, Police General  Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department,  replied that the topic is not unusual. In the past, several  police officers and officials of other government agencies have  been arrested on drug charges.     "

It was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County in 3 weeks.    Police responded to a disturbance call at a house in the 6800 block of Red  Coach Drive about 1:15 p.m. and were confronted by Alan Edward Norried, 26,  Huntington Beach Police Sgt. William Stuart said.    ""He had some kind of an Okinawan karate weapon"" in one hand and a nunchaku in  the other hand, Stuart said. ""Apparently he charged toward the officers and  they opened fire.""    Neither of the officers was injured and their names were not released.    In a prepared statement, Investigations Sgt. W.C. Peterson said officers were  called to the residence by a neighbor reporting a disturbance. Upon arriving,  they heard noise inside the home.      Police Confronted    The officers ""called into the home and were admitted to the home where they  were confronted by Alan Norried,"" according to Peterson.    ""Norried advanced on officers with a martial arts-type weapon in each hand,"" he  said. ""Repeated demands by officers to drop the weapons and freeze . . . were  ignored and the officers retreated for their safety.""    When ""Norried reached a point very close to the officers and they were in  danger of serious injury, two officers fired at Norried,"" Peterson said. He was  pronounced dead at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.    Both officers were placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with  department policy, Peterson said. Police declined to comment further on the  case, referring inquiries to the Orange County district attorney's office,  which was investigating the matter as is standard procedure for  officer-involved shootings.    One Red Coach Drive neighbor who asked that she not be identified said police  had been to the residence where Norried was shot on prior occasions. Stuart  said he could not verify that claim Sunday night.    Norried's parents have lived at the residence about 15 years and he  occasionally lived there with them, the neighbor said. Yet the man and his  family were not particularly well known in the neighborhood, she said.    Stuart said the Okinawan karate weapon held by Norried was ""a sai,"" which  originally was a farm implement.    ""One pointed end is used for thrusting and stabbing movements"" while the other,  forked end is used ""to catch wrists, clothing or other weapons an opponent may  have,"" he said. ""It is used to twist, lock or disable an opponent.""    The nunchaku is a martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected with a  rope or chain, Stuart said.    The death was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County since Jan. 20,  when Dennis Paul Gonzales, 20, of Garden Grove was shot to death in a volley of  gunfire by two Garden Grove policemen responding to a disturbance call at a  residence.    Police said the officers opened fire only after seeing Gonzales point what  later was determined to be a toy gun at them. Three eyewitnesses to the  shooting disputed the police version of the incident, although a district  attorney's investigator said preliminary investigation cast doubt on the  witnesses' account.    On Feb. 2 police shot and killed an unarmed man outside an Anaheim motel room  near Disneyland, where his wife and 9-year-old stepson were waiting for him to  return from an errand.    Robert Vincent Edson, 28, of Orange, died of a single gunshot wound when two  uniformed Anaheim police officers fired 10 shots at him following an auto  chase. Police said Edson had appeared to reach for a weapon on the second-floor  balcony of the motel.    Edson's friends said the man led police on a 45-minute chase when they tried to  stop him for a traffic violation because he was driving with a suspended  license and could not afford auto insurance.    The Edson shooting also is under investigation by the county district attorney.    On Feb. 4 the district attorney's office cleared Newport Beach police of  wrongdoing in the shooting of an unarmed Liberian immigrant along the beach  last Labor Day weekend.    Sundaga Bryant, a Santa Ana resident, was critically wounded in his arms and  torso by a single blast from the officer Derek Duncan's 12-gauge shotgun. The  officer said he mistook a portable radio that Bryant carried for a gun.    The Newport Beach officer ""reasonably and honestly, albeitly mistakenly,  believed that he was being confronted by a life-threatening danger,""  investigators from the district attorney's office concluded in ruling out  criminal charges.    Bryant, 26 at the time, has sued the city of Newport Beach and Duncan for $1  million.    In recent years there have been a number of fatal shootings by Huntington Beach  police. On Sept. 22, 1988, the son of a Los Angeles County sheriff's lieutenant  was shot to death by an officer who responded to a disturbance at a Jamaica  Circle home where the man appeared at the door with a gun.    In 1985 two men were killed by Huntington Beach police. On Aug. 1, 1985, a  Huntington Beach police officer shot and killed a man who threatened him and  others with a knife at a Wildrose Lane home. And on April 13, 1985, a  Huntington Beach police officer killed a robbery suspect when he responded to a  silent burglar alarm and was confronted by two men at a shop near Main Street.      POLICE SHOOTINGS -- ORANGE COUNTY; MARTIAL ARTS; HUNTINGTON BEACH POLICE  DEPARTMENT    "," LA022089-0092   21483    February 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 1; Column 5; Metro Desk      895 words      POLICE KILL MAN THEY SAY WAS RUSHING THEM WITH WEAPONS      By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer      A Huntington Beach man who ""charged"" at two police officers with martial arts  weapons in each hand was shot and killed Sunday in a home on a quiet  residential street, police said.    It was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County in 3 weeks.    Police responded to a disturbance call at a house in the 6800 block of Red  Coach Drive about 1:15 p.m. and were confronted by Alan Edward Norried, 26,  Huntington Beach Police Sgt. William Stuart said.    ""He had some kind of an Okinawan karate weapon"" in one hand and a nunchaku in  the other hand, Stuart said. ""Apparently he charged toward the officers and  they opened fire.""    Neither of the officers was injured and their names were not released.    In a prepared statement, Investigations Sgt. W.C. Peterson said officers were  called to the residence by a neighbor reporting a disturbance. Upon arriving,  they heard noise inside the home.      Police Confronted    The officers ""called into the home and were admitted to the home where they  were confronted by Alan Norried,"" according to Peterson.    ""Norried advanced on officers with a martial arts-type weapon in each hand,"" he  said. ""Repeated demands by officers to drop the weapons and freeze . . . were  ignored and the officers retreated for their safety.""    When ""Norried reached a point very close to the officers and they were in  danger of serious injury, two officers fired at Norried,"" Peterson said. He was  pronounced dead at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.    Both officers were placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with  department policy, Peterson said. Police declined to comment further on the  case, referring inquiries to the Orange County district attorney's office,  which was investigating the matter as is standard procedure for  officer-involved shootings.    One Red Coach Drive neighbor who asked that she not be identified said police  had been to the residence where Norried was shot on prior occasions. Stuart  said he could not verify that claim Sunday night.    Norried's parents have lived at the residence about 15 years and he  occasionally lived there with them, the neighbor said. Yet the man and his  family were not particularly well known in the neighborhood, she said.    Stuart said the Okinawan karate weapon held by Norried was ""a sai,"" which  originally was a farm implement.    ""One pointed end is used for thrusting and stabbing movements"" while the other,  forked end is used ""to catch wrists, clothing or other weapons an opponent may  have,"" he said. ""It is used to twist, lock or disable an opponent.""    The nunchaku is a martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected with a  rope or chain, Stuart said.    The death was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County since Jan. 20,  when Dennis Paul Gonzales, 20, of Garden Grove was shot to death in a volley of  gunfire by two Garden Grove policemen responding to a disturbance call at a  residence.    Police said the officers opened fire only after seeing Gonzales point what  later was determined to be a toy gun at them. Three eyewitnesses to the  shooting disputed the police version of the incident, although a district  attorney's investigator said preliminary investigation cast doubt on the  witnesses' account.    On Feb. 2 police shot and killed an unarmed man outside an Anaheim motel room  near Disneyland, where his wife and 9-year-old stepson were waiting for him to  return from an errand.    Robert Vincent Edson, 28, of Orange, died of a single gunshot wound when two  uniformed Anaheim police officers fired 10 shots at him following an auto  chase. Police said Edson had appeared to reach for a weapon on the second-floor  balcony of the motel.    Edson's friends said the man led police on a 45-minute chase when they tried to  stop him for a traffic violation because he was driving with a suspended  license and could not afford auto insurance.    The Edson shooting also is under investigation by the county district attorney.    On Feb. 4 the district attorney's office cleared Newport Beach police of  wrongdoing in the shooting of an unarmed Liberian immigrant along the beach  last Labor Day weekend.    Sundaga Bryant, a Santa Ana resident, was critically wounded in his arms and  torso by a single blast from the officer Derek Duncan's 12-gauge shotgun. The  officer said he mistook a portable radio that Bryant carried for a gun.    The Newport Beach officer ""reasonably and honestly, albeitly mistakenly,  believed that he was being confronted by a life-threatening danger,""  investigators from the district attorney's office concluded in ruling out  criminal charges.    Bryant, 26 at the time, has sued the city of Newport Beach and Duncan for $1  million.    In recent years there have been a number of fatal shootings by Huntington Beach  police. On Sept. 22, 1988, the son of a Los Angeles County sheriff's lieutenant  was shot to death by an officer who responded to a disturbance at a Jamaica  Circle home where the man appeared at the door with a gun.

OFFICERS OUTSIDE CITY PROBED;    POLICE: SOURCES SAY DEPUTY CHIEF GLENN A. LEVANT DISPATCHED DETECTIVES TO A  CHIC HOTEL WHOSE OWNER HAS BUSINESS TIES TO TWO LEVANT RELATIVES AND DARE.      By DAVID FREED and LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      The Los Angeles Police Department is examining allegations that its drug czar,  Deputy Chief Glenn A. Levant, dispatched a team of elite narcotics detectives  outside city limits to investigate burglaries at a chic hotel whose owner has  business ties to two relatives of Levant, The Times has learned.    Detectives spent two days last November staking out Le Mondrian hotel in West  Hollywood after a representative of the hotel's owner called Levant, sources  said.    Le Mondrian's owner, Severyn Ashkenazy, employs Levant's brother-in-law,  Richard Chase, as president of a company based in Le Mondrian.    In 1988, Chase arranged a six-figure deal between one of Ashkenazy's companies  and the LAPD to rent unmarked cars for use by detectives under Levant's  command, according to company officials.    Ashkenazy also has business ties to Levant's wife, Jayne. He helps fund and  direct a hotel referral service that she runs from an office in Beverly Hills.    In addition, Ashkenazy sits on the 100-member board of a non-profit  organization that raises money for Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), the  Police Department's acclaimed anti-narcotics school program that Levant  directs.    Questions involving the Le Mondrian investigation surfaced earlier this year  during a routine management audit of all narcotics operations, police sources  said.    Levant, 49, said he has done nothing improper. He declined to publicly discuss  matters relating to Le Mondrian except to say that ""there was a logical  investigative reason"" for sending officers to the hotel.    Police Department policy, Levant said, prevented him from responding more fully  pending the outcome of the audit, which is being coordinated by a top aide to  Police Chief Daryl F. Gates.    Levant pointed out that it was he who initiated the audit in January to assess  all facets of the LAPD's anti-narcotics activities.    Gates, through a spokesman, also declined to answer questions about Levant  until the audit is completed. That process is expected to take at least another  three weeks.    The Police Department has a conflict-of-interest code that requires officers to  submit a statement of disqualification to the chief ""if they believe that they  are involved in a department decision-making process in which they have a  conflict of interest."" The department's manual does not make clear what is  considered a conflict.    Gates's spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, declined to comment on whether Levant  filed a disqualification statement on matters relating to Le Mondrian.    A Los Angeles police officer for 27 years, Levant is regarded by some in the  department as a contender to eventually succeed Gates.    Gates named Levant deputy chief in September, 1987, and to the informal  position of drug czar four months later.    Levant devotes much of his time raising public support for DARE, whose annual  budget has grown to more than $1 million under his direction. Levant also  oversees various department functions, including the internal affairs and  organized crime divisions. He commands nearly 400 narcotics investigators and  has broad discretion in setting their missions.    One such mission involved Le Mondrian, according to police sources who spoke on  condition of anonymity.    On Nov. 20-21, a team of detectives assigned to the LAPD's Major Violators  Section, which normally investigates top-level drug traffickers, went to the  hotel at Levant's direction, sources said.    Several detectives checked into two rooms at the hotel. They set up electronic  surveillance equipment and left an undisclosed amount of ""bait"" money in one  room and monitored the room from the other room.    The next day, after no one had taken the money, the detectives ended the  stakeout and left the hotel, sources said.    The officers eventually were paid overtime by the city for the two-day  surveillance and were reimbursed for their expenses, said one source.    Police officials would not say how much the operation cost.    It is not uncommon for detectives from the 47 municipal law enforcement  agencies in Los Angeles County to conduct surveillance outside their normal  geographic areas of assignment. But normally, they pursue investigations that  are initiated within their own jurisdiction.    In this case, the theft complaint was initiated in Los Angeles County, not the  city of Los Angeles.    As a rule, police are required to alert officials of the city in which they are  temporarily operating.    In the case of Le Mondrian, sources said, detectives telephoned the watch  commander at the sheriff's West Hollywood station in advance.    What was unusual, sources said, was the nature of the investigation itself.    ""These (detectives) are heavy hitters who go after big fish, Colombians,"" said  one officer. ""This case had nothing to do with narcotics. There was a problem  with (theft). It was a waste of their time. But, hey, (Levant is) the drug  czar. How you gonna say no?""    According to Ashkenazy, the LAPD investigation came about after several guests  complained of thefts from their rooms. Those burglaries, he said, happened to  coincide with rumors that a drug ring had set up shop in the hotel.    ""We arranged for the Police Department . . . to come and see what it was we had  here,"" Ashkenazy said. ""Strange enough, it ceased as soon as the word got out.""    Asked why the Le Mondrian did not request assistance from the Sheriff's  Department, in whose jurisdiction Le Mondrian is located, Ashkenazy said, ""The  sheriff is not equipped to deal with drugs.""    Deputies at the West Hollywood station -- which is less than a mile from Le  Mondrian -- said they could not recall being notified by LAPD about any  problems at the hotel.    The sheriff's narcotics chief disputed Ashkenazy's assertion that his  department was not equipped to handle such a case. ""Had they called the  sheriff,"" Capt. Bob Wilbur said, ""we would have responded and we would have  done surveillance.""    Ashkenazy's executive vice president, attorney Gary W. Nielsen, said he  contacted Levant to discuss thefts at the hotel -- including the theft of some  drugs from a guest about two months earlier.    ""I didn't call to report a crime, but to initially ask for some advice on a  matter I viewed as sensitive,"" Nielsen said. Nielsen called Levant, he said,  because he ""wanted someone with expertise . . . I see him once in a while at  parties and at dinners . . . It's a first name basis. He is a person I admire  very much.""    Nielsen said he asked Levant whether the hotel should hire a private detective.    ""I think he told me there weren't private detectives that would have much  knowledge about drugs and that this was something his department would look  into,"" Nielsen recalled.    Other hotels commonly hire private investigative agencies to take on such  cases, according to detectives and hoteliers.    Since August, 1988, Levant's brother-in-law, Richard Chase, has been president  of an Ashkenazy company, Resources Exchange, located on the second floor of Le  Mondrian.    The company barters goods and services ranging from hotel rooms to billboard  advertising in exchange for items of equal or greater value.    According to Nielsen, Chase ""made the deal"" to sell rental car services to the  Police Department in late 1988. Chase traded billboard and bus stop advertising  to RPM Rent-a-Car of Los Angeles for more than $100,000 in rental car services,  Neilsen said.    The rental car services then were sold to the Police Department for use by  plainclothes officers. Nielsen said the cars cost the department ""20% less than  they were paying"" at the time to other rental companies.    Chase, according to Nielsen, ""was very proud of the fact that it was one of his  first or second deals."" The arrangement with RPM was one of several negotiated  by Chase that year.    ""The company had a good year (in 1989) and this was a small part of that good  year,"" Nielsen said. ""He got a bonus for 1989.""    The car rental arrangement ended about a year later, in part because virtually  every RPM car was white, which distressed narcotics officers.    ""You can imagine getting followed by six or seven white cars,"" said one  officer. ""It was a joke.""    Neither Neilsen nor RPM officials would disclose the specific value of the  rental car transaction. City Controller Rick Tuttle's office also was unable to  provide details.    ""There are certain accounts controlled by the Police Department that are not  public,"" said Barbara Friedman, administrative deputy controller.    Nielsen said he did not know whether Levant had any role in the rental car  negotiations or approved the deal. However, sources said the deal came about  after Levant contacted Ashkenazy regarding car rentals. Chase could not be  reached for comment.    His sister and Levant's wife -- Jayne Levant -- is executive vice president of  Small Luxury Hotels Inc., an international association of 32 hotels and  resorts.    Ashkenazy helped found the association and is one of its current directors,  according to J. William Sharman Jr., a Houston, Tex., businessman who serves as  the organization's chairman. Sharman said the association was conceived 4 1/2  years ago by Jayne Levant.    Sharman said that the association acts as a referral, reservations and  promotional service for Ashkenazy and other member hotel operators. The hotel  operators pay an initiation fee, plus $12 per room per month to the  association.    Ashkenazy also is among about 100 business and community leaders who serve as  directors of the non-profit Crime Prevention Advisory Council (CPAC), which  raises funds and organizes charity functions for DARE. The council operates out  of Levant's office and he is its executive officer, the organization's 1988 tax  return shows.    Each CPAC director is asked to contribute at least $1,000 a year to DARE.    Ashkenazy said he was not certain how much he has donated, although Nielsen  said that Ashkenazy contributes free meeting facilities and price breaks on  meal tabs at his Bel Age hotel.    Ashkenazy scoffed when asked by The Times whether Levant sent detectives to Le  Mondrian as a personal favor.    ""This is utter nonsense, you're barking up a silly tree,"" Ashkenazy said. ""He  (Levant) is a highly ethical man, a very bright man.""      Photo, Glenn A.

The new suspect was arrested upon arriving Hat Yai Airport.  Police refused to identify the suspect and would not allow the  press to cover the arrest.    Meanwhile Bangkok police chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit  Kanchanakit  said the other Iranian, who was charged on Friday in connection  with the conspiracy had sneaked back into Thailand because he  was involved with a Thai woman.    But informed sources said police had not ruled the  possibility that Hossein Shahriari Far, 26, returned to Thailand  for a second sabotage attempt.    Chaisit said the suspect was ""too complacent and thought  that  Thai authorities had given up their attempts to catch him"".    Far was arrested on Friday night at the Inthra Hotel in  Songkhla's Hat Yai district.    The sources also said they believed those involved in the  plot still had a supply of C-4 plastic explosive hidden some  where in Thailand and believed to be in the possession of a Thai  woman.    Police have summoned more than 40 witnesses for questioning.  They have finished interviews with 10 of them, according to the  sources, who said investigators had been ordered to wrap up  their inquiries in seven days.    The sources added that police had reliable evidence  indicating that the plot was directed at the Israeli Embassy.  The evidence includes a bag that is the same as those  distributed at a Palestinian training camp.    Two other Iranians taken into custody during the same raid  in  Hat Yai are being held for questioning.    Far is scheduled to appear in South Bangkok District Court  on  June 9.     "

The PJE reported that those arrested were in possession of  weapons. Carmen Victoria Coronel, wife of Juan Jose Quintero  Payan, was among those arrested. Quintero Paya apparently is a  relative of drug-trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. The police  also reported that authorities seized a briefcase containing  4,000 new pesos and $7,000 in cash, as well as an additional  14,110 new pesos.    As part of the investigations, police raided the residence  of  Luis Enrique Fernandez Hurtado, who was not arrested, and seized  seven AK-47's, known here as ""goat horns""; an R-15 rifle; and a  .45 caliber pistol.    It also has been reported that the people killed in the bomb  blast have been identified as Marcial Gonzalez Muniz and  Guillermo Gomez Chavez. Manuel Delgadillo Paez, director of the  Investigations Department of the State Attorney General's  Office, also reported that experts are working to determine what  kind of explosives, and how much, were used in the bomb.    At 0200 (0800 GMT) Saturday, a Ford Grand Marquiz exploded  in  the parking lot of a Guadalajara Hotel where a birthday party  was being held. Two people were killed and five others injured  as a result of the explosion. The hotel management has filed a  property-damage suit against whomever is found guilty of the  attack.    The police also reported that their investigations have  established that two stolen cars were parked in the parking lot  in which the bomb exploded.     "

The organization is well-commanded, with several executives  supporting the boss. Chinese henchmen lure farmers and  fishermen to work in Japan, the sources said.    In cases of Chinese illegally entering Japan in groups, only  18 in two groups arrived in 1990, but the number has sharply  increased, to 396 in 14 groups in 1992 and 335 in seven groups  in 1993.    This year, over 250 Chinese in eight groups have already  been  smuggled into Japan, including a group of nearly 100 that  arrived in Shimane Prefecture on a freighter this week, they  said.    The ""snake head"" organization arranges various methods for  illegal entry, such as traveling hidden on fishing boats and  freighters or with forged passports, they said.    After they arrive in Japan, residents from either China,  Hong  Kong or Taiwan or Japanese ""yakuza"" gangs guide the workers.    The illegal immigrants pay about 200,000 yen as security to  gain entry, paying more after the attempt succeeds, the sources  said.    The primary targets of the organization are farmers in  suburban areas and fishermen working in aquiculture, and those  who hope to work in Japan to make more money, they said.    ""Snake head"" members lure them with the promise of a safe  and  comfortable journey, but they are actually packed in the hold of  freighters and are only given instant noodles twice a day, they  said.    The organization sometimes holds the illegal entrants in  Japan until they pay the remaining fee, or abandons them without  giving them job they were promised, the sources said.     "

0,FT933-14946 ,"FT933-14946 _AN-DGLB7ABFFT 930712   FT  12 JUL 93 / Police face up to being measured: The implications of service contracts for constables      By ALAN PIKE   AS LAST week's Association of Chief Police Officers conference considered a potential new world of short-term contracts and performance-related pay, a single chief constable spoke from experience. He was Mr Desmond O'Brien, chief of the British Transport Police, which already has all its senior officers on fixed-term contracts with performance review related to pay. It is the only force in the country to be operating a procedure which the government-appointed Sheehy committee has recommended should apply throughout the police service. Mr O'Brien, his deputy and assistant chiefs transferred voluntarily to the system three years ago. Mr O'Brien said it had proved that measurable performance indicators could be set for the police. He told his fellow senior officers at the conference: 'In dealing with under-performing constables, we should also cater for under-performing chief constables.' British Transport Police provides police services for British Rail and London Underground. Under the performance review system, Mr O'Brien agrees personal objectives with his deputy and four assistant chief constables annually, and each May gives them performance ratings that are reflected in their pay awards. Mr O'Brien's own personal objectives are agreed with the chairman of the police committee. Individual objectives relate to police management issues. But, Mr O'Brien said, the force had to ensure that it met its customers' expectations. To help achieve this a budget group, consisting of the managing directors of the rail businesses and the chief constable, produces a contract setting out operational objectives and priorities - the current objectives relate to crimes of violence, obstruction of railways, actions which endanger customers and staff, graffiti and disruptions to services by suspect packages. The contract is used by the police committee, railway businesses and customers as a means of measuring the force's performance. Mr O'Brien believes that the establishment of a clear means of focusing on specific objectives has contributed to a reduction in crime levels and an increase in detection rates over the past three years. When British Transport Police advertises for senior officers it makes clear that - unlike the rest of the police service - successful applicants will be on fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay. 'There is no shortage of applicants willing to accept posts on these terms,' Mr O'Brien said. 'It is surely wrong that an officer should be appointed to a senior post at the age of 40 and remain in it for the next 20 years without any specific assessment of performance.' This is certainly the view of Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries and of the committee of inquiry into police pay and responsibilities whose report is being considered by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary. Sir Patrick believes the pay of senior officers, in particular, should be performance related, and this is unlikely to meet serious resistance in the police service. Chief constables are, however, much more apprehensive about the implications of extending some of the same principles - particularly fixed-term contracts  -to lower ranks. The Sheehy committee recommends that police officers should serve on initial 10-year contracts, subsequently renewed each five years. Some senior officers believe their ability to attract sufficient high-quality recruits, both graduates and non-graduates, would be undermined by the fear of possible dismissal after 10 years. They say all that is needed is a procedure making it easier for the service to shed under-performing individuals.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9221 Police Protection.

Michael Allan Munt, 36, told police he was angry that noise from an elementary  school near his home was keeping his terminally ill father from sleeping. Munt  lives with his elderly parents.    ""At this time, we have no indications that he intended to follow through with  the threat,"" Los Angeles Police Lt. William Gaida said. ""I'm sure he regrets  making the statement. People say things when they are angry.""    The Los Angeles County district attorney's office Tuesday charged Munt with one  felony count of making a threat against a school official, said Capt.

School Letting Out    Munt was arrested after he went to Calabash Street School about 2:50 p.m. and  told an official to order the children to be quiet. School was letting out and  students were boarding buses and waiting for rides in front of the school,  which is across the street from Munt's home in the 4700 block of Degovia  Avenue, school officials said.    Told that it would be difficult to make the children be quiet, Munt allegedly  replied, ""If you don't do it, I'm going to get my AK-47 and I'll take care of  it,"" Higgins said.    Munt has no criminal record and doesn't fit the profile of someone who would  follow through on his threat, Higgins said. Munt has no guns registered to him  and a search of his house turned up no weapon, he said.    Police also said Munt has no history of complaining about the school.    School administrators and police met with about 50 parents at the school  Tuesday in an attempt to alleviate their fears.      Court Order Possible    Jack Jacobson, region administrator, said the Los Angeles Unified School  District will ""pursue the possibility"" of trying to obtain a court order  preventing Munt from coming on the school campus. He said the district will  provide funds to hire a full-time aide to check the identification of anyone  entering the school's front gate.    Ron Block, who has a son at the school, said he believes school officials and  police handled the situation responsibly. He suggested that parents send a  letter to Munt to let him know they are in sympathy with his plight in caring  for his father.    Another parent, Nick Coates, said he was shocked that Munt was out of jail  Tuesday morning and urged school officials holding Tuesday's meeting to inform  as many parents as possible about the facts of the situation.    Munt could not be reached for comment.    Meanwhile, the school has rerouted buses to the back of the campus to try to  reduce noise near Munt's home, said site administrator Marge Roten.

The sources also said they believed those involved in the  plot still had a supply of C-4 plastic explosive hidden some  where in Thailand and believed to be in the possession of a Thai  woman.    Police have summoned more than 40 witnesses for questioning.  They have finished interviews with 10 of them, according to the  sources, who said investigators had been ordered to wrap up  their inquiries in seven days.    The sources added that police had reliable evidence  indicating that the plot was directed at the Israeli Embassy.  The evidence includes a bag that is the same as those  distributed at a Palestinian training camp.    Two other Iranians taken into custody during the same raid  in  Hat Yai are being held for questioning.    Shahriarifar is scheduled to appear in South Bangkok  District  Court on June 9.     "

When it takes to the skies at night, its moniker becomes Eagle III.    Until two years ago, the night shift copter was known as Eagle II. But that  name conjures up bitter memories for the crew members who fly the machines in  Orange County. The name Eagle II was retired in memory of the three men who  died when a Costa Mesa police helicopter collided in the air with a Newport  Beach police chopper in March, 1987.    Although the name change provides a ready reminder of the hazards of police  helicopter work, police departments in the county have been undaunted in  pressing forward to start or expand aerial patrols:    * Santa Ana increased the helicopter coverage it receives on a contract basis  from Costa Mesa Police as of last Sunday. Instead of flying three times a week,  the patrols, formerly made three times a week, are now made nightly. Duty is  rotated among three Santa Ana officers to accompany the Costa Mesa police  pilots as observers.    * The Brea Police Department has for the last three months been studying the  feasibility of starting its own helicopter patrol.    * Some police departments are planning to beef up or modernize their helicopter  fleets. Costa Mesa plans to add another four-seat helicopter with some of the  money it receives from its contract with Santa Ana. Newport Beach police plan  to replace an older copter with money realized from the sale of assets seized  from drug dealers. And Huntington Beach -- which 20 years ago was the first  Orange County police agency with helicopter service -- ordered two new advanced  helicopters that will be available in two years.      12 Available    All told, there are 12 police helicopters available for duty among five law  enforcement agencies in Orange County. All but two -- the Orange County  Sheriff's Department copters known as Duke I and Duke II -- are used in cities  in the northern section of the county. There have been years of talk about the  advantages of creating helicopter pools for routine patrols, but a Huntington  Beach police captain who has studied the issue said such an arrangement appears  years away because of questions about how it would be implemented.    Santa Ana, however, has taken the first step. The contract by which Costa Mesa  will receive as much as $200,000 a year allows Santa Ana to have police  helicopter patrols that use its own officers as observers -- at a fraction of  what it would cost to buy helicopters and train its own crew. (Newport Beach,  for example, spends $490,000 a year on its helicopters, and that figure does  not take into account the crew members' salaries.) New turbine-powered machines  can cost up to $700,000, police helicopter officials said, and, of course, the  maintenance, fuel and associated training would be extra.    Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters said the agreement with Costa Mesa proved  successful during a yearlong test of patrols on Friday, Saturday and Sunday  nights.    ""We tried it on a test basis for three days a week,"" Walters said. ""We  evaluated it closely and found it very beneficial.""    Costa Mesa Sgt. Bill Bechtel, who helps supervise his department's helicopter  operations, said the the money will be applied to the purchase of another  McDonnell Douglas 500E, the black-and-white sedan of the skies. Having another  copter will help reduce ""down"" time because of maintenance, he said, and it  could also mean that two helicopters could be in the air at once serving both  Costa Mesa and Santa Ana.    Adding to the patrol area will not affect response time significantly, Bechtel  added, contending that the copters would still be able to get to just about any  spot in five minutes or less.    In what also could become a law-enforcement trend, Newport Beach is planning to  pay the $600,000 price for a new helicopter with funds obtained from the sale  of assets seized from drug dealers, Newport Beach Officer Bob Oakley said.    Officials in local police departments say the machines have proved their worth  time and again and that new uses for them are being found all the time.    Bechtel said the Costa Mesa one answers more than 400 radio calls for  assistance a month and was directly responsible for 174 arrests made in the  12-month period ended July 31. (Figures for drunk drivers are not included in  this tally.)    Huntington Beach police say their copters are especially useful in spotting  traffic violations. Should an officer in a helicopter suspect that a particular  motorist has run a red light, for example, he can direct an officer in a patrol  car below to stop the vehicle.      700 Tickets a Year    ""We write 700 tickets a year,"" boasted Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Jeff King.    Helicopter officials shy away, however, from drawing direct comparisons to the  productivity of helicopter versus ground units. ""It's kind of hard to compare  the effect of something that can't do comparable functions,"" Oakley of Newport  Beach said.    For instance, finding people hiding at night is something police helicopters  are specially equipped for -- there are the spotlights and the infrared scopes  in the cockpit. The infrared is especially helpful; with it, officers can tell  which cars in a parking lot were driven most recently because the device can  detect heat from the engines.    The infrared equipment's abilities have even astonished other officers, Bechtel  said. In one recent case, he said, he was directing ground officers to an auto  theft suspect whom they thought was lying in a field that had been thoroughly  searched, eluding even the noses of police dogs.    On the infrared scope, however, the suspect ""glowed like a light bulb"" on the  monitoring screen. The officers on the ground were incredulous, though, until  the helicopter beamed its light on the suspect. That, Bechtel said, sent the  suspect scampering off into a nearby auto mall; the officers chased him and  eventually were able to arrest him.      A Few Complaints    Helicopter officials said the noise from low-flying police helicopters  sometimes brings complaints from residents, but King said people usually are  more understanding when they are told why the helicopter was there.    Some of the police agencies have taken steps to control noise. Shortly after  the Orange County Sheriff's Department began using them, the copters' tail  rotors were replaced with quieter blades, a sheriff's spokesman said.    Despite their usefulness, agencies have hesitated to pool their helicopter  patrols because of financial and logistical concerns. Although the five  agencies routinely answer emergency calls from neighboring police departments  that do not have helicopters, Santa Ana is the only department to pay for the  use of another city's whirlybird.    Huntington Beach bases its copter on Gothard Street in a rural area, but each  of the other agencies operates out of John Wayne Airport.    Huntington Beach Capt. Merle Schneblin, who recently completed a report on the  pooling issue as part of a management study course, said that agencies refuse  to come to terms with the idea of consolidating resources.      Mixed Response    Schneblin said he found ""a lot of feelings for it, a lot of feelings against  it"" when he recently brought police officials together to discuss the issue. He  predicted that officials will not seriously consider it, however, until a  serious budget crunch or a disaster proves the wisdom of having areawide copter  patrols.    ""It's probably going to take some catastrophe . . . to force the issue,"" he  said.    Westminster Police Chief Jim Cook said that his department might be interested  in a joint helicopter agency but that it has no plans to start its own service.    ""They are very expensive. . . . I think they are very good programs, but they  are not on our list of priorities in the future,"" Cook said.    And Fullerton Police Capt. Richard Kvancz said that his department has  informally been discussing the possibility of adding a helicopter for years,  even joining in a joint agency of cities in the area. But he also expressed  concern about the expense. ""It's very expensive, not only the initial costs but  the maintenance and additional training.""

When it takes to the skies at night, its moniker becomes Eagle III.    Until two years ago, the night shift copter was known as Eagle II. But that  name conjures up bitter memories for the crew members who fly the machines in  Orange County. The name Eagle II was retired in memory of the three men who  died when a Costa Mesa police helicopter collided in the air with a Newport  Beach police chopper in March, 1987.    Although the name change provides a ready reminder of the hazards of police  helicopter work, police departments in the county have been undaunted in  pressing forward to start or expand aerial patrols:    * Santa Ana increased the helicopter coverage it receives on a contract basis  from Costa Mesa Police as of last Sunday. Instead of flying three times a week,  the patrols, formerly made three times a week, are now made nightly. Duty is  rotated among three Santa Ana officers to accompany the Costa Mesa police  pilots as observers.    * The Brea Police Department has for the last three months been studying the  feasibility of starting its own helicopter patrol.    * Some police departments are planning to beef up or modernize their helicopter  fleets. Costa Mesa plans to add another four-seat helicopter with some of the  money it receives from its contract with Santa Ana. Newport Beach police plan  to replace an older copter with money realized from the sale of assets seized  from drug dealers. And Huntington Beach -- which 20 years ago was the first  Orange County police agency with helicopter service -- ordered two new advanced  helicopters that will be available in two years.      12 Available    All told, there are 12 police helicopters available for duty among five law  enforcement agencies in Orange County. All but two -- the Orange County  Sheriff's Department copters known as Duke I and Duke II -- are used in cities  in the northern section of the county. There have been years of talk about the  advantages of creating helicopter pools for routine patrols, but a Huntington  Beach police captain who has studied the issue said such an arrangement appears  years away because of questions about how it would be implemented.    Santa Ana, however, has taken the first step. The contract by which Costa Mesa  will receive as much as $200,000 a year allows Santa Ana to have police  helicopter patrols that use its own officers as observers -- at a fraction of  what it would cost to buy helicopters and train its own crew. (Newport Beach,  for example, spends $490,000 a year on its helicopters, and that figure does  not take into account the crew members' salaries.) New turbine-powered machines  can cost up to $700,000, police helicopter officials said, and, of course, the  maintenance, fuel and associated training would be extra.    Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters said the agreement with Costa Mesa proved  successful during a yearlong test of patrols on Friday, Saturday and Sunday  nights.    ""We tried it on a test basis for three days a week,"" Walters said. ""We  evaluated it closely and found it very beneficial.""    Costa Mesa Sgt. Bill Bechtel, who helps supervise his department's helicopter  operations, said the the money will be applied to the purchase of another  McDonnell Douglas 500E, the black-and-white sedan of the skies. Having another  copter will help reduce ""down"" time because of maintenance, he said, and it  could also mean that two helicopters could be in the air at once serving both  Costa Mesa and Santa Ana.    Adding to the patrol area will not affect response time significantly, Bechtel  added, contending that the copters would still be able to get to just about any  spot in five minutes or less.    In what also could become a law-enforcement trend, Newport Beach is planning to  pay the $600,000 price for a new helicopter with funds obtained from the sale  of assets seized from drug dealers, Newport Beach Officer Bob Oakley said.    Officials in local police departments say the machines have proved their worth  time and again and that new uses for them are being found all the time.    Bechtel said the Costa Mesa one answers more than 400 radio calls for  assistance a month and was directly responsible for 174 arrests made in the  12-month period ended July 31.

Don Brown said.    CHP officers stopped 800 drivers at a sobriety checkpoint Friday night in  Baldwin Park, arresting five on suspicion of driving under the influence.    Police in Los Angeles set up a van that houses their Immediate Booking and  Release System behind Parker Center police headquarters, where it was to be in  operation from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. New Year's Day.    Traffic officers throughout the city planned ""maximum deployment,"" utilizing  all available officers and assigning them specially to look for motorists under  the influence of alcohol or drugs.

In Costa  Mesa, seven two-officer teams will look for drunk drivers, then put them behind  bars with the help of specially assigned jail personnel, Police Sgt. Tom Winter  said.    The CHP reported one alcohol-related traffic death about 11 p.m. Friday, six  hours into the agency's holiday fatality reporting period that ends midnight  Monday.    Rene Rodriquez, 21, was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and  vehicular manslaughter after the fiery crash on the Harbor Freeway near El  Segundo Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles.    Investigators said Rodriquez drove his Datsun 280Z onto the freeway at about  100 m.p.h.

Thus, this tunnel  is very troubling to the people of the world.    These rumors got started in the West, particularly in the  United States, the enemy of Libya's leader, Qadhdhafi. There  have also been reports that Thai engineers designed this nuclear  weapons plant. And there are more than 60 Thai laborers working  on this tunnel. [passage omitted]    Police Major General Luan Panarotsathip, the commander of  the  Suppression Division, ordered Police Colonel Chaloemchat  Sittanon, the deputy commander, and Police Colonel Chumphon  Manmai, the superintendent of Precinct 2, to coordinate things  with the Labor Skills Development Department in order to conduct  an investigation.    A few days later, police officials checked the people at  that  company. It was suspected that this was an engineering company  that was involved in sending Thai laborers to work in Libya. The  police detained four officials at the Suppression Division and  seized a number of documents. [passage omitted]    On the morning of 14 October, Police Colonel Chumphon and a  team of officials raided a condominium located at 13/1  Nimmanmoen, Lane 12, Suthep Subdistrict, Chiang Mai City. The  offices of the W and M Company Ltd. were located there. When the  police rushed in so early in the morning, Mr. Wirot  Sakunmuthita, the owner of the company, looked very bewildered,  and the more than ten workers there all wondered what was  happening.    ""What the hell is going on,"" said Mr. Wirot looking at the  police officials. Focusing on Chumphon Manmai, who had entered  the office ahead of the other police officials, he asked, ""Do  you have a search warrant?""    ""We have both a search warrant and a warrant for your  arrest,"" said Police Col. Chumphon, taking out the warrants for  him to see. Mr. Wirot's attitude softened, and he tried to ask  what was going on. He asked why the police wanted to search his  company. When informed that officials believe that this company  is sending workers to work abroad without authorization, Mr.  Wirot angrily said that ""this is clearly a political matter.""    But even though Mr. Wirot made a scene, the police began  searching the offices, which were filled with modern equipment.  They were particularly interested in the ten computers and  computer disks. Wirot just stood there complaining, saying that  ""the United States probably put pressure on you to do this.""    In the end, the Suppression Division officials seized three  computer disks and a number of documents concerning the  operations of this company. After that, the police escorted Mr.  Wirot to his house at 65/7 Sirorot Road, Lane 1, Suthep  Subdistrict, and found 158 disks containing information on  sending laborers from the north to work in Libya. They also  found receipts and expenditures journals.    The police charged Mr. Wirot with hiring Thai laborers and  sending them to work abroad without authorization. Mr. Wirot  admitted that he was the owner of the W and M Company Ltd., and  said that he was the engineer who had designed that tunnel in  Libya.    Libya awarded the contract to build this tunnel to the  M.N.C.  Company Ltd. Construction got underway two years ago. It is  thought that construction will be completed within another year.  This tunnel is about 17 meters wide and about 110 meters long.  Wirot was paid 25 million baht to draw up the plans and oversee  the construction. The Libyan government has invested  approximately 700-800 million baht in building this tunnel.    And they plan to build several more tunnels!    Mr. Wirot denied knowing anything about this. And he said  that he isn't interested in what Libya plans to do with the  tunnels once they are completed. He said that he doesn't know if  they will use them as air raid shelters or sites for nuclear and  chemical weapons plants. But Wirot has to fly to Libya about  twice a month.    A report from an intelligence unit stated that the situation  concerning the construction of chemical and nuclear weapons  production plants in Libya is expanding, particularly in Lotta  and Banghazi, which are located about 10 hours away from  Tripoli, the capital. Those plants are located in valleys with  an area of more than 1,000 rai and in underground tunnels. There  are at least nine such plants.    Most of the chemicals are sent directly from Germany. It's  said that if these chemicals come in contact with the air, they  will immediately burst into flames. If applied to steel, this  chemical can quickly melt the steel. They now have about 120  tanks of this chemical, with each tank weighing 40 tons. Because  of its great concern about this, the United States is closely  monitoring the construction of these tunnels in Libya.    Police officials are very suspicious about the role played  by  Mr. Wirot. They wonder who he is exactly and how he managed to  gain a monopoly on the construction of these tunnels.    Another question that the police must answer concerns the  relationship between the engineer who drew up the plans, that  is, Wirot, and a Thai engineer who studied in Germany and who is  an expert on chemicals. The police wonder how important he is in  the construction of these tunnels.    The United States has charged that these tunnels are being  modified so that they can serve as plants for producing nuclear  and chemical weapons, mankind's most destructive weapons.     "

A new station wagon slowly made its way along the graffiti-marred block and  stopped in front of the gathering. Two of the youths rushed to the car's  windows and leaned in. Words were passed, then money. Change was handed back to  the driver, along with a small bag of what appeared to be marijuana.    The station wagon headed off, and the young men went back to the curb.    It has been less than four months since a Los Angeles Police Department task  force that targeted the half-mile stretch of Blythe Street was disbanded, but  police and residents say drug dealers and gangs are beginning to make a  comeback in the neighborhood.      Police Target    From July, 1987, until May of this year, Blythe, from Van Nuys Boulevard to  Brimfield Avenue, was the target of the 13-officer Narcotics Enforcement  Detail, as well as a variety of neighborhood-improvement efforts by the city  and apartment owners and residents.    And by all accounts, the campaign was successful. The task force officers made  more than 500 arrests. Drug dealers and gang members were forced off the curbs  of the apartment-lined street, and the neighborhood lost its distinction as a  drive-through drug market.    ""Blythe Street was pretty clean when we left,"" said Sgt. John Preston, one of  the task force's supervisors.    But like weeds cut down but not uprooted, drug peddlers once again await  customers on the curbs along Blythe. The neighborhood is again marked with  graffiti. And residents, who a year ago saw vast improvements, now say the  neighborhood is sliding back.    ""Things got good here; now I think they are getting worse again,"" said a  longtime resident who last year allowed the officers to use her apartment to  secretly watch drug dealers. She asked not to be identified because she fears  reprisals from gang members and drug peddlers.    ""I get up two, three times a night when I hear things, shots,"" she said. ""In  the day I see the boys on bikes, looking out for the drug dealers. I call the  police so much they must know my voice. Soon it will be like there was no  difference.""

Police gang and narcotics squads have increased patrols on Blythe since the  task force was disbanded. But police concede that crime is on the increase in  the neighborhood of mostly low-income families and new immigrants, many of whom  live in crowded apartments and are unemployed.    ""It is getting kind of rough there again,"" said Sgt. Jim Flavin, in charge of  an anti-gang unit that patrols Blythe. ""When the NED guys pulled out, the gang  guys pulled back in.""    David Combs, a manager of a Blythe Street apartment building, said gangs and  drug dealers have boldly stepped forward in recent months to reclaim the  street.

In May, there was an attempted murder on Blythe, which police believe occurred  when a motorist tried to ""take the dime"" from two drug dealers. Police said the  motorist grabbed drugs from the dealers and sped off without paying. He drove  to Willis Avenue but could not escape because of a concrete roadblock placed  across Blythe by the city two years ago to discourage drive-through drug  dealing.    When the drug thief turned his car around and tried to drive past the dealers,  police said, a steel pipe was hurled into the car. The driver was seriously  injured but survived. Police see the incident as further evidence of the  neighborhood's problems.    Authorities are puzzled about what, if anything, can be done to stop the  neighborhood's decline.    While the task force was a successful operation, the unit was only a temporary  solution to the neighborhood's problems, said Deputy Police Chief Ronald A.  Frankle.

The unit was disbanded in April.    It is unlikely that another unit will be formed, Frankle said, since police  administrators have decided that manpower cannot be spared.    Authorities said law enforcement is only part of a solution to Blythe Street's  problems. Alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, poverty and crowded housing  also must be addressed, they say.    Bernardi's office has scheduled a meeting of owners, managers, police and city  officials Thursday to again discuss solutions to neighborhood woes. ""I don't  think there are any magic answers,"" Slater said. ""But we have to get as many  people involved as possible. It will take perseverance.""    Some on Blythe already have shown they can persevere.    Combs, the apartment manager, said it has been an uphill battle in the past  year to clean up the 40-unit complex he manages. He said he has evicted dozens  of suspected gang members and drug dealers who were crowded into apartments in  the building.    A year ago, he said, syringes littered the building's stairwells and gang  members hung around outside. Now the building is clean, and there is no  loitering near the front gate, he said.

The Sheehy inquiry looked at research into market rates in the public sector before recommending performance-related pay for the police and a drop in starting salaries. But the federation has argued that there are no comparable public-sector jobs.

He said the number was evidently even higher,  for not all illegal activity has been uncovered.    Police have arrested many Russian military suspected of  crime  during the past month.    On March 8, police arrested two employees of a Russian  military unit in Tallinn. The men are suspected to have robbed  a Tallinn resident.    A day before, the security police and the police special  task  force ""K"" conducted an operation which resulted in the arrest of  two men who illegally sold weapons. The suspects had offered to  sell a consignment of Russian-made TT pistols. One of the men  was Yuri Terzikyan, noncommissioned officer at the Russian unit  stationed at Tondi, Tallinn.    Early on March 2, two Russian servicemen escaped from the  correctional isolation chambers of the Tallinn garrison, taking  two machine guns with 60 cartridges.    On March 1 Estonian border guards detained Russian navy  noncommissioned officer Alexander Yegorov at the border  checkpoint to Russia in Narva, northeast Estonia, on an attempt  to take a stolen Lada car out of Estonia.    Police had to interfere and stop Russian servicemen when the  latter in late February started to pull down a holiday home at  Suurupi near Tallinn. The holiday home had been leased to a  private company. Charges have been brought against the military  of the Tondi unit, including for 10,000 [currency not specified]  in damages to the leaseholder company.    Also in February, Estonian police seized 500 kilograms of  high-power explosive from a Russian noncommissioned officer.

HE TELLS WIVES HE HAS ABDUCTED THE MEN  FOR RANSOM.      By FRANKI V. RANSOM and BEN SULLIVAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      A mysterious telephone caller has harassed at least 42 San Gabriel Valley women  since April with phone calls in which he claims to be holding their husbands  hostage at gunpoint, authorities said.    No husbands have actually been held hostage and no one has been physically  injured. But the calls can be a terrifying experience, one of the victims said.    West Covina Detective Dennis Edwards said police believe that one man may be  responsible because of the similar nature of the calls. He said the caller  apparently selects as his targets people who are listed as a couple in the  phone book.    All of the victims have been listed in the telephone directory, said Lt. Phil  Bollington of the Temple City substation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department.    Twelve of the victims are from Pasadena, 12 from Monrovia, eight from West  Covina, nine from Glendora and one from Temple City, police and sheriff's  officials said.    Glendora Police Agent Kathy Harbour said victims reported that the caller  sounds like a male in his 30s, possibly with an East Coast or New York accent.    Police said the caller informs women that he has abducted their husbands for  ransom, tied them up and gagged them, and is holding a gun to their heads.  Edwards said the caller has demanded from $2,000 to $5,000.    No one apparently has given the caller any money.    He also has ordered the women to call him ""Sir"" and has used the husbands'  first names.    Sgt. Monte Yancey of the Pasadena Police Department said that in some  instances, the husbands were present when their wives received the calls. The  last report in Pasadena was a week ago, Yancey said.    The caller sometimes threatens wives by telling them that two men are standing  outside their homes waiting for them, Harbour said. The caller also has asked  sexually explicit questions, she said.    Sheriff's authorities in Temple City said the latest report came from a woman  who called Thursday morning.    The woman did not file a formal police report, Sheriff's Deputy Jeff Patterson  said.    On Wednesday morning, the man made at least four calls to Monrovia women,  police said. One of the victims was Pasadena Star-News reporter Janice Luder,  who wrote a first-person piece on the incident for Thursday's newspaper.    The caller, Luder wrote, said he had her husband bound and gagged and added ""I  have a gun to his head.""    When she asked if he was serious, the caller responded: ""This is not a joke,  and I will do the talking. You just listen.""    Eventually, Luder hung up and called her husband at work. He was not there.    ""My mouth went dry and my legs felt like sprung guitar strings,"" Luder said in  the article.    As she dialed 911, ""a creeping sense of foreboding and vulnerability took over.  Please God, let him be alright (sic),"" she wrote.    She said the 911 operator told her that she was the fourth woman in 20 minutes  to report a similar call.    ""My first reaction was relief,"" she wrote. ""I was just another random victim of  some sicko.    ""Then I felt angry and violated,"" she said. ""A faceless voice momentarily had  held incredible power over me.""    Kathleen Flynn, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, said the company has been  informed of the calls.    ""For obscene phone calls . . . we recommend simply hanging up,"" she said. Calls  can be traced if customers request it. However, because the caller only phones  once, such technology would be unlikely to help. Phone company officials were  unable to determine Thursday whether anyone had requested tracing in connection  with the case.    Police and sheriff's officials said there are no plans to form a task force to  catch the caller.    Dr. Martin Reiser, chief psychologist for the Los Angeles Police Department,  said such callers frequently are sexually motivated.    ""People who make threats and phone calls and try to get some kind of sexual  response obviously are people with sexual hang-ups and probably are getting  some kind of satisfaction from possibly upsetting the woman in the first place  and by getting response from the woman,"" Reiser said.

This is an enormous improvement  over the existing situation, for instance in fighting the  smuggling of cars.    So far, four to six ministries, the embassies, and other  authorities had to be used in prosecuting offenses beyond  borders, Beckstein said yesterday after speaking to his  Hungarian colleague Imre Konya.    The CSU politician said that establishing an international  investigation pool is an objective to be put into practice in  the medium term. Only through access to other countries' car  registration data can international car smuggling gangs be  stopped.    Stolen cars are mainly taken across the eastern borders.  Beckstein estimates that this is true for 50 percent of the  150,000 cars reported stolen in Germany last year. The cheaper  cars went to Romania, the more expensive ones to the former  Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus.    At the Bavarian borders, 15,688 foreigners were seized for  trying to cross the border illegally. This figure is 22 percent  higher than last year. At the border with the Czech Republic  alone, 13,191 persons were discovered; in addition, border  police arrested 4,256 persons that were smuggled into the  country, which is an increase of 89 percent over 1992. A total  of 1,698 people were arrested for smuggling foreigners into the  country (126 percent more than in 1992).    Of the 29,378 persons arrested at Germany's borders last  year, 65 percent were seized by Bavarian border authorities.  The interior minister considered this to be a proof of the  particularly ""intensive investigation work"" done by Bavarian  border police.     "

ANOTHER GROUP OF 111 LEAVES VOLUNTARILY FOR HANOI.      From Times Wire Services      HONG KONG      Police raided a Vietnamese refugee camp Friday and clashed with stone-throwing  ""boat people"" who reportedly feared they would be forced to return to their  Communist homeland. Hong Kong officials said 40 people were injured.    Police fired tear gas after the Vietnamese set fire to blankets and threw rocks  to prevent a search for homemade weapons, said government spokesman Timothy Li.  Twenty-seven Vietnamese were arrested and more than 700 weapons seized, police  said.    Earlier Friday, a group of 111 ""boat people"" voluntarily left Hong Kong on a  chartered airliner for Hanoi rather than face months or years in the crowded  camps without hope of resettlement abroad.    The 111 people made up the eighth group to return to Hanoi under a  U.N.-sponsored voluntary repatriation program, bringing to more than 865 the  number of Vietnamese who have willingly gone home.    Their calm departure was in sharp contrast to the scene two weeks ago when Hong  Kong police put 51 weeping ""boat people"" aboard a plane and sent them to Hanoi  against their will.    Hong Kong is now seeing a steady trickle of voluntary departures from its  camps, but government officials say this is not enough and forced repatriation  will resume next month.    The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is urging the British colony to put off  plans to send more people back against their will and give the voluntary  program a chance.    Television footage of Friday's camp raid showed police equipped with helmets  and shields firing tear gas. Smoke from the fires could be seen rising above  the center on outlying Lantau Island, which houses more than 3,000 Vietnamese.    ""The 'boat people,' in order to make the operation more difficult, pushed their  women and children to the front,"" said Security Secretary M. Geoffrey Barnes.    The government-funded radio reported that the resistance may have been prompted  by reports that some of those in the center may be in the next group of ""boat  people"" forced to return to their impoverished homeland.    Officials refused to say how many police joined in the operation, but the radio  put the number at about 300. Police said Friday night that said 14 Vietnamese  and 26 guards and policemen were injured in the camp.    The officials said five hours of counseling by the staff of the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees and voluntary agencies failed to persuade the  Vietnamese to cooperate.    Police reported two clashes Thursday night between Vietnamese armed with  homemade weapons at the Shek Kong Detention Center in which one person died and  10 others were injured.    Police said they were investigating the cause of the brawls between two rival  groups from Quang Ning. About 100 people were involved in the fighting.    According to police, five people have died this year in factional fighting that  erupts frequently in the crowded and squalid Vietnamese camps.    ""This latest violence is a further manifestation of the unrest in the camps  caused by the threat of forced deportation,"" said George Foulkes, of Britain's  opposition Labor Party. ""I fear that it is a foretaste of worse to come unless  the government abandons its policy.""    Foulkes also accused Britain of delaying deportations at the request of the  U.S. government.    ""While they are dithering and delaying, the situation in the camps is reaching  boiling point,"" he said.    A Foreign Office spokesman, who requested anonymity, said in response: ""The  facts are that considerable assistance is being given through our reintegration  package to the 'boat people.' . . . We are not waiting for Washington.""    About 44,000 ""boat people"" who have sailed into Hong Kong since mid-June, 1988,  are considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled persecution.    Those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals rejected can  volunteer to go home or face forced repatriation.    The 12,000 ""boat people"" in Hong Kong who arrived before the screening program  were automatically granted refugee status and are awaiting resettlement  overseas.

The  document, which is labeled ""top secret"" and has the file number  000898, lists Stasi measures to support Arab terrorists. A  brief excerpt:     -  creation of logistical bases in the GDR  capital with the inclusion of GDR citizens;    -  promotion of travel  by liaison people of the Carlos group to the FRG and other West  European countries;    -  efforts to acquire weapons, explosives,  money, and information;    -  inspiration for acts of violence of  armed struggle, including individual actions, attacks, etc.  against the imperialist policy of the United States, the  Zionists, and the clique around al-Sadat.    Contact addresses were the embassies in Yemen, in Baghdad,  and in Tripoli.    Man in Vienna Became Very Interesting    To put it clearly: All terrorist attacks organized via  Tripoli were supported logistically by the Stasi. This makes a  Vienna State Police official interesting for the GDR foreign  espionage service HVA (Foreign Intelligence Collection Main  Administration), because the most important counterespionage  activities of western security authorities went across  Hochenbichler's desk.    The investigations also get a new dimension as a result of  the allegedly close contacts between Hochenbichler and former  GDR Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil and Rudolfine  Steindling, a Viennese businesswoman and the trustee of the  Communist Party of Austria. The Berlin public prosecutor's  office thinks that both played a central role in the ""Koko""  empire (Commercial Coordination) of GDR foreign currency  acquisitor Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. Multidigit billion  sums were allegedly transferred illegally to other countries via  Koko. An arrest warrant has been issued for Steindling in  Germany.    The hunted woman enjoys Hochenbichler's sympathy. After all,  he was able to welcome ""Red Fini"" at his private party on his  50th birthday in the Vienna Police Directorate. ""Poor Fini,""  the official pitied her, must now ""invest millions in lawyers.""  Steindling's lawyer, Dr. Harry Neubauer, cannot say what links  Hochenbichler with the businesswoman. However, he rules out  that Hochenbichler's name turns up in the comprehensive Koko  trial files.    Beil, who is considered to be one of the architects of the  Koko empire, is reportedly an old, intimate friend of  Hochenbichler's. The state police official liked to boast of  this friendship. At the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations, State Protection Department, Koko Chief  Schalck-Golodkowski stated for the record that Beil had been an  ""unofficial employee"" of the HVA ""for decades."" ""In particular  in Austria"" he was working ""unofficially.""     "

Police yesterday named the dead man as Mr David Elton, a 48-year-old former executive director of Ultramar, which was bought by Lasmo after a three-month Pounds 1.1bn takeover battle last December. Mr Elton's body was found on Monday morning floating in the sea, a few miles from his second home in Middleton-on-Sea, West Sussex. Police had earlier discovered the body of Mr Elton's 43-year-old wife Jane at the house. She had died from head wounds. Police said last night that Mrs Elton's death was being treated as murder, but that following the discovery of Mr Elton's body they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder. Mr Elton resigned from the Ultramar board in January. Within days Lasmo announced that he and six other former directors would share an Pounds 8.1m pay-out, including a top-up to their pension funds. The package included Pounds 4.8m for termination of contracts, and Pounds 1.9m for pension contributions. Mr Elton was thought to be under stress after the takeover and the death of his mother.

0,FT934-13589 ,"FT934-13589 _AN-DJUC7AB4FT 931021   FT  21 OCT 93 / Howard accepts police proposals      By ALAN PIKE and ROBERT RICE   PROPOSALS to reduce police paperwork could release the equivalent of 2,300 officers for more active duties, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said yesterday. Mr Howard has accepted all 16 recommendations in a report on cutting police administrative burdens prepared for the Home Office by PA Consulting Group. Police service representatives welcomed Mr Howard's decision, but said substantial additional funds would be needed to implement the proposals. The report claims police paperwork after an arrest could be halved. It calls for action in three areas: better liaison between police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service; improved information technology; and better management of paperwork. Mr Howard said the recommendations were in keeping with the government's proposals in its recent police white paper to introduce a more management-based approach to policing. Nothing in them would detract from suspects' rights. Introducing the report's recommendations throughout England and Wales could cost about Pounds 40m. The consultants concluded that the most significant factor in reducing paperwork would be a rise in information technology support. Mr John Hoddinott, chief constable of Hampshire and chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers' crime committee, welcomed Mr Howard's endorsement of the report. But he said police information technology budgets were small and forces would be unable to finance the proposed changes from their resources alone. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, yesterday called for an urgent inquiry into a sharp fall in the number of criminal cases dealt with by crown courts in the past year. In the year to last August, 88,725 cases were dealt with by the crown court, a 15 per cent drop on the figure for the year to August 1992 of 103,702.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

When he left his son's condo Tuesday  morning to return home, he was struck by a tractor-trailer and killed.    Police said Rialto resident Leanne Fargon, 30, was driving the truck carrying  sand off a hill on Chapman Avenue just east of Crawford Canyon Road. Fadely,  70, was driving south on Crawford Canyon.    Police said both vehicles were in the intersection when the truck struck the  driver's side of Farley's white Thunderbird. Police could not determine who ran  the red light. No traffic tickets were issued, and Fargon was released at the  scene.    Fadely, a 17-year resident of Tustin and a retired advertising manager, was  pronounced dead about 20 minutes after the accident while still pinned in his  car. An official from the coroner's office said Fadely was wearing his seat  belt but that it didn't help since the truck smashed directly into the door on  the driver's side.    Several area residents gathered around the scene and spoke about the frequent  accidents that occur at the intersection, which is at the bottom of a hill  outside Santiago Canyon, where a lot of construction work has taken place in  the last few years, residents said.    Ron Roper, a driver's education teacher at Santa Ana High School, has lived in  a house about 100 feet from the intersection for about 10 years and said at  least one serious accident happens there every six months.    ""When you have the green arrow at that intersection, you don't assume the other  trucks are going to stop,"" he said, referring to facing traffic that is coming  down the hill. He said he has often waited at a green turn signal while  fast-moving vehicles, mostly trucks, ran red lights. He said that many car  drivers also speed down Crawford Canyon Road.    ""No amount of engineering is going to stop an accident if someone runs a red  light,"" said Chuck Glass, a traffic engineer with the city of Orange. He added  that all city equipment in the area, including the lights, was working  properly.    Glass would not comment on the safety of the intersection compared to that of  other intersections, but said that one fatal accident there every six months  was possible. The speed limit on the hill just east of the intersection is 45  m.p.h., he said.    The city installed a traffic light about halfway down the hill several months  ago, residents said, and the signal has helped slow traffic. Glass said the  light was installed to accommodate traffic from new housing developments, not  because of the truck traffic.

""When you have the green arrow at that intersection, you don't assume the other  trucks are going to stop,"" he said, referring to facing traffic that is coming  down the hill. He said he has often waited at a green turn signal while  fast-moving vehicles, mostly trucks, ran red lights. He said that many car  drivers also speed down Crawford Canyon Road.    ""No amount of engineering is going to stop an accident if someone runs a red  light,"" said Chuck Glass, a traffic engineer with the city of Orange. He added  that all city equipment in the area, including the lights, was working  properly.    Glass would not comment on the safety of the intersection compared to that of  other intersections, but said that one fatal accident there every six months  was possible. The speed limit on the hill just east of the intersection is 45  m.p.h., he said.    The city installed a traffic light about halfway down the hill several months  ago, residents said, and the signal has helped slow traffic. Glass said the  light was installed to accommodate traffic from new housing developments, not  because of the truck traffic.

The new batch surfaced in Camden, north London, and is twice  as strong as most heroin bought on the streets. Its discovery  comes amid growing concern about a rise in the quantity and  purity of heroin being sold around the country.    Last week, eight people died in Glasgow after using  unusually  pure forms of the drug. Nine have been killed in Bristol during  the past six months in similar circumstances, and seven died  last year in King's Cross, close to where the latest batch of  heroin was found.    The discovery was reported by Release, the drug advice  agency, which has been told by local counsellors that it is 64  percent pure--street heroin is usually 35-40 percent pure. ""The  users have not got the tolerance for such high strength, and we  see the tragic consequences,"" said Simon Kirkham, group  spokesman.    Powerful drugs interfere with the part of the brain that  controls breathing. Death arises from congestion in the lungs.    Police are trying to trace the source of the London batch,  and said they were taking the threat it poses very seriously. It  was found only three days after the latest death in Glasgow.    Police in Glasgow have offered an amnesty to people active  in  the drug world in an attempt to find the rest of the lethal  batch, which they believe to be as much as 74 percent pure.    But drug counsellors and relatives of those who died in  Glasgow dispute the official view that high-grade heroin is to  blame. They insist that drug cocktails and overdoses may have  killed many of the addicts. Two years ago Glasgow was the scene  of 20 unexplained deaths which were blamed on high-quality  heroin.    The National Criminal Intelligence Unit believes danger  arises when inept or inexperienced drug dealers fail to mix  heroin properly. ""Some young dealers may not be used to handling  the drug, which can be highly dangerous,"" a spokesman said.    In Bristol, laboratory tests last week showed that heroin  believed to have caused at least four of the nine abuser deaths  was 63 percent pure. Police fear the purity of the drug reflects  the large amount of heroin in the British market.    Inspector Peter Wills, of Avon police, said drug dealers  normally mixed the drug with similar looking substances such as  baking powder, talcum or dried baby milk to maximise profits.  ""Whereas a street dealer would mix the drug with other  substances if there is a drought--thus increasing his own  profit--when there is a lot of heroin on the streets, they do  not need to,"" he said.    Heroin seizures have increased dramatically throughout the  country in the past year, particularly in Avon, Manchester,  London and inner-city areas. In Gloucestershire there was a 400  percent increase, while seizures went up by 600 percent in  Northumbria and 1,000 percent in Nottinghamshire.     "

Hochenbichler, who is seriously ill [with cancer of the  throat], still denies that he spied for a GDR embassy secretary.  However, Interior Ministry investigators speak of a ""dense  network of evidence."" Investigations are now extending in the  direction of Libya. Hochenbichler reportedly had close contacts  with a Libyan intelligence service agent. For many years  al-Qadhdhafi's capital of Tripoli was considered the point of  departure for sensational attacks. This ranged from OPEC  terrorist ""Carlos"" to the jumbo crash in Lockerbie.    The Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [BKA] has a Stasi document in its possession. The  document, which is labeled ""top secret"" and has the file number  000898, lists Stasi measures to support Arab terrorists. A  brief excerpt:    -- creation of logistical bases in the GDR capital with the  inclusion of GDR citizens;    -- promotion of travel by liaison people of the Carlos group  to the FRG and other West European countries;    -- efforts to acquire weapons, explosives, money, and  information;    -- inspiration for acts of violence of armed struggle,  including individual actions, attacks, etc. against the  imperialist policy of the United States, the Zionists, and the  clique around al-Sadat.    Contact addresses were the embassies in Yemen, in Baghdad,  and in Tripoli.    Man in Vienna Became Very Interesting    To put it clearly: All terrorist attacks organized via  Tripoli were supported logistically by the Stasi. This makes a  Vienna State Police official interesting for the GDR foreign  espionage service ""HVA"" (Foreign Intelligence Collection Main  Administration), because the most important counterespionage  activities of western security authorities went across  Hochenbichler's desk.    The investigations also get a new dimension as a result of  the allegedly close contacts between Hochenbichler and former  GDR Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil and Rudolfine  Steindling, a Viennese businesswoman and the trustee of the  Communist Party of Austria. The Berlin public prosecutor's  office thinks that both played a central role in the ""Koko""  empire (Commercial Coordination) of GDR foreign currency  acquisitor Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. Multi-digit billion  sums were allegedly transferred illegally to other countries via  Koko. An arrest warrant has been issued for Steindling in  Germany.    The hunted woman enjoys Hochenbichler's sympathy. After all,  he was able to welcome ""Red Fini"" at his private party on his  50th birthday in the Vienna Police Directorate. ""Poor Fini,""  the official pitied her, must now ""invest millions in lawyers.""  Steindling's lawyer, Dr. Harry Neubauer, cannot say what links  Hochenbichler with the businesswoman. However, he rules out  that Hochenbichler's name turns up in the comprehensive Koko  trial files.    Beil, who is considered to be one of the architects of the  Koko empire, is reportedly an old, intimate friend of  Hochenbichler's. The state police official liked to boast of  this friendship. At the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations, State Protection Department, Koko Chief  Schalck-Golodkowski stated for the record that Beil had been an  ""unofficial employee"" of the HVA ""for decades."" ""In particular  in Austria"" he was working ""unofficially.""     "

A policeman, Police Officer  3 Leody Ray Lumibao, and a militia man, Alfredo Lorenzo, were  seriously wounded in the attack.    Political analysts considered the attack as significant  since  it was the first time that communist rebels mounted such an  operation after their retreat to their mountain sanctuaries  years ago. The communist-led New People's Army (NPA) was  founded in Cepa, Tarlac, in March 1969 and it opted to use the  Central Plains as a support base rather than a target for rebel  attacks.    The reports said the rebels, numbering about 35, attacked  the  police detachment in Iba, San Jose, Tarlac, at about 7:45 A.M.  At least four of the raiders were believed wounded in the  exchange of fire. The rebels raided the detachment using two  passenger jeepneys commandeered in San Jose, Tarlac, the reports  said. The drivers, Nicolas Apan and Pedro Balagtas, have been  held for ""tactical interrogation"" at the Tarlac PNP [Philippine  National Police] headquarters. Four M-14 assault rifles, one  M-16, four M-1 Garand rifles and one carbine were taken by the  rebels from the policemen.    The PNP's 181st Mobile Force Company (MFC) is pursuing the  withdrawing rebels, while the 185th MFC has set up a blocking  force at the Capas-San Jose and the San Jose-Mayantoc boundaries.    Earlier, defense and military officials said that the  government can achieve ""strategic victory"" within this year,  claiming that the military has already regained control over  several barangays [villages] formerly controlled by the CPP  [Communist Party of the Philippines]-NPA.    The communist movement has suffered major setbacks after the  popular revolt against the Marcos regime. It is currently being  wracked by a major internal crisis.

In closing arguments at the end of a six-week civil trial, attorney Browne  Greene asked jurors to hold the Torrance Police Department liable for the  cover-up to ""send a message that nobody in this city, in this state or in this  community is above the law.""    Greene represents John Rastello of San Pedro, who sued five years ago alleging  that his son, Kelly, was killed in an accident caused by off-duty Torrance  Police Sgt. Rollo Green. The lawsuit claims that Green was driving drunk and  made an illegal left turn, causing the accident, but that his police ""buddies""  covered up for him as part of a pattern of concealing police abuses.    Defense lawyers conceded that Green had been drinking, but said he was not  drunk. They said Rastello, 19, caused his own death by speeding on his  motorcycle and failing to apply both of his brakes. They also argued that an  unprecedented review of internal police files proved that Torrance investigates  and disciplines its officers properly.    The trial has has been closely watched for the unprecedented review that it has  provided of internal affairs files and discipline in the county's third-largest  police department.    On Tuesday, Rastello, his seven surviving children and supporters filled one  side of the cramped courtroom. Rastello's wife, Geraldine, died of cancer last  December. Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash, Sgt. Green and seven other  officers -- all defendants in the case -- sat across the aisle.    They heard attorney Greene focus on 14 acts of alleged misconduct for which he  said Torrance police received little or no discipline. ""What this department  did . . . encouraged more violence and more misconduct,"" Greene said.    Criminal charges were filed in only one of the cases and in that instance,  Greene said, the policeman was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser offense.    ""Would that have happened to you or I?"" Greene asked. ""If you are a police  officer in Torrance and you drink and drive, that's OK. You're going to get  away with it.""    Greene said the permissive attitude began when Chief Nash discontinued his  predecessor's policy of asking the California Highway Patrol to investigate  accidents involving Torrance police officers.    Nash's policy led the department to cover up Sgt. Green's culpability on the  night of the accident, Greene said. To prove that, Greene pointed out: Sgt.  Green was not given a blood-alcohol test despite the fact that several  witnesses smelled alcohol on his breath; a field supervisor used one of the  department's few untaped phone lines to report in from the scene; Green wasn't  arrested but was driven home by police, and Green did not seek medical care  because he knew emergency room personnel would take a blood sample.    Greene asked the jury to award Rastello more than $12 million in damages.    Defense attorneys argued that Torrance police conducted a thorough and  impartial investigation on the night of the crash. Casey Yim, the city's lead  attorney, pointed out the department called two supervising sergeants, an  accident investigation team and a drunk-driving specialist to investigate the  case.    The specialist, Officer Daniel Metzger, used an eye-gaze test to conclude Sgt.  Green was not driving under the influence, Yim said.      'Phantom Witness'    Police investigating the crash cannot be held liable because the law provides  that they are protected from civil claims if they act in good faith, Yim said.  He said Rastello failed to prove the officers acted with malice.    Sgt. Green's lawyer, Will Pirkey, said that only Tony Andrie of San Pedro  testified that Green was unsteady on his feet and clearly intoxicated just  after the crash.    But Pirkey called Andrie a ""phantom witness,"" who no one else saw at the scene  of the crash, or at the hospital, where Andrie testified that he went to check  on the crash victim.    Pirkey said Andrie should not be trusted because he was a high school  acquaintance of Kelly Rastello and because he did not come forward until four  years after the crash.    As to the allegation that Torrance police routinely conceal misconduct, Yim  argued that the Police Department had thoroughly investigated its own officers,  creating the mass of files on which the plaintiffs based their case.

In an emergency session attended by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,  the party named the republic's KGB head as Georgia's new party chief, a post  once held by Shevardnadze himself.    ""There is no way anyone or anything can justify the death of innocent people,""  Shevardnadze told the party meeting in a speech partially broadcast on Soviet  television. ""We have now one supreme duty: to figure out the truth and exclude  forever the possibility of such a tragedy happening again.""    The mood in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi remained tense. Troops patrolled  the streets, stopped cars at roadblocks for searches and cordoned off squares  with tanks and armored personnel carriers to prevent mass gatherings, residents  said. Foreign journalists were not permitted to visit.    Demonstrations in the republic's capital of 1.2 million people began last week  with protesters demanding independence from the Soviet Union. Soviet troops  invaded the republic in 1921 and it was then annexed. Georgian nationalists  contend their needs are not adequately met by the Russian-dominated government  in Moscow.      Deaths at Demonstration    The Tbilisi protests became bloody on Sunday when troops attempted to break up  a gathering in front of the republic's Government House. Sixteen people were  killed during the demonstration and three died later, according to official  figures, which listed 13 of the dead as women.    Most of those killed were bystanders, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman  Gennady I. Gerasimov. A government commission, which is to include members of  the public, has been appointed to investigate the tragedy.    Placards posted at Tbilisi State University after the clash said that Dzhumber  I. Patiashvili, the republic's Communist Party chief, was a ""murderer.""    Patiashvili, speaking on Soviet television Monday night, admitted that he  mishandled the protest, apparently by ordering troops to suppress the  demonstrators. Two days later, Patiashvili offered to resign.    The 49-year-old party leader was appointed in 1985 to succeed Shevardnadze. He  will be replaced by Givi G. Gumbaridze, Georgia's 45-year-old KGB chief,  Gerasimov told reporters.      Two Others Ousted    Also ousted from their party posts on the republic's ruling Politburo were  Zurab Chkheidze, chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers, and Otar Y.  Cherkezia, president of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Gerasimov said.    Gerasimov said that the decisions were made after a ""heated discussion"" but did  not elaborate except to say that the session was attended by Shevardnadze, who  postponed a visit to East Germany to try to defuse the crisis in his native  Georgia.    The spokesman said that nationalist rallies in Georgia and earlier this year in  the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan were damaging President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet society by permitting greater openness.    ""These events are like sticking a dagger in the back of perestroika,"" he said,  referring to Gorbachev's policies of reform.    Gerasimov also defended the government's ban on travel to Georgia by foreign  journalists, saying: ""My view is that we are providing you with enough  information so that your readers can judge the situation by themselves.""    Radio Moscow reported Friday that 328 people had been detained in Georgia over  the last 24 hours and handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Factories and public transportation were operating normally, but attendance was  down by about 50% at the city's secondary schools, the radio said.    A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect and the army continued to hold about  66,000 hunting rifles and privately owned guns collected earlier this week.    About 2,000 people, many carrying black flags, marched through a central  Tbilisi street Thursday for the first funeral of one of the victims, residents  said. Additional funerals were planned for the weekend.    The square outside the republic's Government House apparently has spontaneously  become a memorial to the victims.    ""There are mountains of flowers. Every day, people place fresh flowers,"" Leda  Archvadze, sister-in-law of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a jailed Georgian human rights  activist, said in a telephone interview.    The army newspaper Red Star said Friday that reports were circulating in  Tbilisi that troops who broke up the demonstration were drunk and ""butchered  women and girls with military shovels."" But the newspaper said doctors who had  examined some of the bodies of the victims found no signs of cuts. Gerasimov  has said that initial autopsies showed most of the victims were crushed by the  crowd.    Gorbachev, in a statement broadcast in Tbilisi two days ago, sharply rejected  demands that the republic be granted independence and called on the Georgians  to restore order to their republic.    Georgia declared independence in May, 1918, in the chaos following the 1917  Bolshevik Revolution.

In an emergency session attended by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,  the party named the republic's KGB head as Georgia's new party chief, a post  once held by Shevardnadze himself.    ""There is no way anyone or anything can justify the death of innocent people,""  Shevardnadze told the party meeting in a speech partially broadcast on Soviet  television. ""We have now one supreme duty: to figure out the truth and exclude  forever the possibility of such a tragedy happening again.""    The mood in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi remained tense. Troops patrolled  the streets, stopped cars at roadblocks for searches and cordoned off squares  with tanks and armored personnel carriers to prevent mass gatherings, residents  said. Foreign journalists were not permitted to visit.    Demonstrations in the republic's capital of 1.2 million people began last week  with protesters demanding independence from the Soviet Union. Soviet troops  invaded the republic in 1921 and it was then annexed. Georgian nationalists  contend their needs are not adequately met by the Russian-dominated government  in Moscow.      Deaths at Demonstration    The Tbilisi protests became bloody on Sunday when troops attempted to break up  a gathering in front of the republic's Government House. Sixteen people were  killed during the demonstration and three died later, according to official  figures, which listed 13 of the dead as women.    Most of those killed were bystanders, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman  Gennady I. Gerasimov. A government commission, which is to include members of  the public, has been appointed to investigate the tragedy.    Placards posted at Tbilisi State University after the clash said that Dzhumber  I. Patiashvili, the republic's Communist Party chief, was a ""murderer.""    Patiashvili, speaking on Soviet television Monday night, admitted that he  mishandled the protest, apparently by ordering troops to suppress the  demonstrators. Two days later, Patiashvili offered to resign.    The 49-year-old party leader was appointed in 1985 to succeed Shevardnadze. He  will be replaced by Givi G. Gumbaridze, Georgia's 45-year-old KGB chief,  Gerasimov told reporters.      Two Others Ousted    Also ousted from their party posts on the republic's ruling Politburo were  Zurab Chkheidze, chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers, and Otar Y.  Cherkezia, president of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Gerasimov said.    Gerasimov said that the decisions were made after a ""heated discussion"" but did  not elaborate except to say that the session was attended by Shevardnadze, who  postponed a visit to East Germany to try to defuse the crisis in his native  Georgia.    The spokesman said that nationalist rallies in Georgia and earlier this year in  the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan were damaging President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet society by permitting greater openness.    ""These events are like sticking a dagger in the back of perestroika,"" he said,  referring to Gorbachev's policies of reform.    Gerasimov also defended the government's ban on travel to Georgia by foreign  journalists, saying: ""My view is that we are providing you with enough  information so that your readers can judge the situation by themselves.""    Radio Moscow reported Friday that 328 people had been detained in Georgia over  the last 24 hours and handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Factories and public transportation were operating normally, but attendance was  down by about 50% at the city's secondary schools, the radio said.    A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect and the army continued to hold about  66,000 hunting rifles and privately owned guns collected earlier this week.    About 2,000 people, many carrying black flags, marched through a central  Tbilisi street Thursday for the first funeral of one of the victims, residents  said. Additional funerals were planned for the weekend.    The square outside the republic's Government House apparently has spontaneously  become a memorial to the victims.    ""There are mountains of flowers. Every day, people place fresh flowers,"" Leda  Archvadze, sister-in-law of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a jailed Georgian human rights  activist, said in a telephone interview.    The army newspaper Red Star said Friday that reports were circulating in  Tbilisi that troops who broke up the demonstration were drunk and ""butchered  women and girls with military shovels."" But the newspaper said doctors who had  examined some of the bodies of the victims found no signs of cuts. Gerasimov  has said that initial autopsies showed most of the victims were crushed by the  crowd.    Gorbachev, in a statement broadcast in Tbilisi two days ago, sharply rejected  demands that the republic be granted independence and called on the Georgians  to restore order to their republic.    Georgia declared independence in May, 1918, in the chaos following the 1917  Bolshevik Revolution. Moscow recognized that declaration in a treaty signed in  1920, but Soviet troops invaded in February, 1921, and took over the region.      Photo, Dzhumber I.

As of Thursday afternoon, police in Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and  Hawthorne reported seven separate attempts -- all of them unsuccessful -- to  abduct a total of nine children, ages 7 to 12.    ""Now they're coming more rapidly, and he's moving into other cities,"" said Sgt.  Jack Zea of Manhattan Beach, where the first incident took place Sept. 13.  ""It's almost like this guy just came out of nowhere.""      Reached Out    The most recent incident occurred Wednesday evening in Redondo Beach, where for  the first time, the man was reported trying to use force. Police said he  reached out to grab a 7-year-old girl after she refused to get in his blue  pickup truck, but the girl got away.    Police say the man used the same approach each time: He told children that  their parents have been injured and he would take them home or to school. In  each case, the children did as they had been taught: They ran away.    The latest attempt caused some police officers to worry that the suspect is  becoming more aggressive.    ""That's a very big concern,"" Hawthorne Detective Richard McCarroll said. ""We  don't care (which police department) gets him, as long as somebody gets him  before it gets to that point.""    In one typical attempt, the man pulled alongside a pair of Hawthorne children  and, according to McCarroll, said, ""Your parents were in an auto accident, and  you are to go with me to the counselor's office.""      Patrols Increased    In the wake of the attempted abductions, police in Hawthorne, Redondo Beach,  Manhattan Beach and Torrance -- where a similar but unrelated incident took  place Monday -- have increased their patrols around schools.    Parents say they are now driving their youngsters to school or walking with  them, rather than letting them go alone or with other youngsters.    ""Whenever parents are gathered, the subject does come up,"" said Linda Mack,  president of the Parent Teachers Assn. at Manhattan Beach Intermediate School.    Officials in several South Bay school districts reported that they have sent  flyers home to parents or have circulated information about the suspect to  teachers, who have been asked to reinforce the safety lessons their pupils have  already been taught.    ""We've put every teacher on notice,"" Sharon Andrade, assistant principal of  Hawthorne's York Elementary School, said Thursday.    According to police, children involved in five of the seven incidents reported  that the man who approached them drove a blue pickup truck with a white camper  shell. In the other two incidents, the children reported that the man drove a  blue vehicle -- in one case a Pontiac, in the other case a station wagon.    Police said these discrepancies do not change their theory that the incidents  are related. In each case, the description of the suspect was the same: a man  in his 30s, white or Latino, with a dark complexion, dark hair and a dark  mustache, sometimes wearing sunglasses.

0,FT934-974 ,"FT934-974 _AN-DLVCCABFFT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Bomb alerts hit London again      By RACHEL JOHNSON   Bomb alerts paralysed much of London's train and Underground systems yesterday as the IRA's campaign of disruption continued to punctuate the talks on Northern Ireland. Police searched 200 miles of track between London and Sevenoaks in Kent after receiving coded telephone calls from Dublin. Some 37 stations were closed, including the main London stations of Victoria, Blackfriars, London Bridge, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Waterloo East. The disruption was the latest in a series of random terrorist activity - either acknowledged by the IRA or attributed to it - that has provided an unsettling backdrop to the talks between London and Dublin. The anti-terrorist branch of the Metropolitan Police has joined forces with the British Transport Police to deal with the disruption, aimed at Christmas shoppers and retailers as much as commuters. Mr John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert with a security consultancy, said the latest campaign of disruption suggested a deep-rooted fragmentation within the IRA that reflected the allegiances of the small cells which made up the organisation. He said that the IRA's command structure did not have 'full control' of all the cells. Nor did Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, speak for the entire organisation. 'Part of the IRA wants to keep the pressure up because they do not think that the concessions offered go far enough,' Mr Wyatt said. 'But they don't want to do anything too radical. The latest disruption is not intended to lead to serious loss of life and doesn't pose much threat of injury either.' All British Rail lines except those between London and Sevenoaks were running normally by early afternoon.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This is a useful debate in a country such as  Portugal, which is the entryway for half of the cocaine consumed  in Europe. Exaggeration or not, this is the percentage cited by  several observers. At least it allows us to understand the  dimensions of the facilities enjoyed by the drug traffic on the  Portuguese coast. This situation is a result of the lack of  inspection facilities, but is also due to the corruption of  agents in certain forces supposedly existing to combat the drug  traffic.    There are over 100 agents from the defunct Customs Guard  [GF]  and the Maritime Police, with ranks as high as lieutenant and  captain, providing security for the unloading of drugs on the  Portuguese coast. This situation, which PUBLICO reported in  feature articles published on 21 and 22 December of last year,  has been described in various official documents. However, a  more detailed account is provided in a confidential survey  conducted by the Criminal Investigations Police nearly a year  ago, along the entire Portuguese coast.    This survey, based on information collected during various  drug trafficking proceedings, was reported to the justice  minister, Laborinho Lucio, early last year. On several  occasions, he referred to this situation at meetings of the  Council of Ministers.    PUBLICO has learned that the survey was being discussed by  the Criminal Investigations Police administration, which decided  to notify the minister of the facts. The seriousness of the  situation would entail options (regarding material resources  and, possibly, coordination among various police forces) on a  cabinet level. Hence, the decision was made to inform the  minister of the report's existence.    Country Divided Into Areas of Influence    The abolishment of the Customs Guard may have been hastened  owing to the situation described in the report. This is one of  the hypotheses accepted by several sources contacted by our  newspaper. They even admit the possibility that various measures  for coordinating the security forces in the drug area may have  been discussed in the context of the serious state of corruption  existing among the paramilitary forces.    The document, prepared by a brigade created especially for  this purpose, was written in order to identify the individuals  and logistical resources involved in the drug trafficking along  the Portuguese coast, for subsequent investigations of both the  trafficking and money laundering.    The work carried out made it possible to identify the groups  operating from the Algarve coast to Minho, with their leadership  structures and operational facilities; as well as the boats,  warehouses, vehicles, properties, and assets purchased with the  profits. Also identified were the accomplices ""contracted"" in  institutions such as the ex-Customs Guard and the Maritime  Police. There are nearly 50 names of individuals, including  civilians and agents of the security forces; as well as accounts  of millions of contos' worth of houses, vehicles, boats, and  warehouses.    The agents most directly involved with the traffickers are  of  low rank; nevertheless, in at least half a dozen cases the  situations involving collaboration with the unloading of drugs  are known to persons with high-level assignments in the chain of  command. A captain, lieutenants, and sergeants, as well as  scores of agents, have been identified.    In the survey, which has already prompted several individual  investigations, the country is divided into areas of influence  wielded by the groups most active in the unloadings. It is well  known that the main organizations are set up in the Viana do  Castelo district, in Foz do Douro, Matosinhos, Espinho, Figueira  da Foz, Peniche, Nazare, Cascais, Lisbon, Sesimbra, Setubal,  Sines, Vila do Bispo, and Portimao. In some of the cases  detected, entire outposts of the ex-Customs Guard were found to  be implicated with the Mafia engaged in unloading drugs.    Those localities along the Portuguese coast are the chief  reception sites for the drugs, which arrive on medium and  large-sized vessels as far as the boundaries of the national  waters. They are later transferred to smaller craft (in some  instances, to boats belonging to the GF itself), which carry  them to warehouses, some located on sites a little farther from  the coast.    Spaniards Know    The work done by the Portuguese police has updated some  information already contained in a report prepared by the DEA  [Drug Enforcement Administration] in 1989, following an  infiltration of the network run by the Galician drug trafficker,  Laureano Oubina (one of those with better contacts in Portugal),  and of the Spanish police.    During the investigation related to the proceedings that  culminated in Operation Necora, Judge Baltazar Garzon had in his  possession the names of all the contacts of some of the leading  Galician drug dealers in Portugal, particularly those in the  Algarve. There was even information detailing the names of bars,  restaurants, and coffee shops visited or owned by some of those  contacts, with telephone numbers, home addresses, etc.    This information was retained in the dossiers of the Spanish  police who, as several sources from Portuguese police circles  told PUBLICO, have ""highly detailed"" information on who's who in  the Portuguese drug trade. At least, they know who is providing  logistical support to the Spanish traffickers.    Much of this information may have been provided to the  Spanish authorities by the ""repentant subject,"" in the Necora  process, Ricardo Portabales, whose statement was heard by the  Portuguese police in Madrid last summer. Portabales' hearing was  prompted by the many references that he made, in interviews  published in the Spanish and Portuguese press, to a meeting held  in Cascais three years earlier, between Galician and Portuguese  drug traffickers. However, during the questioning to which he  was subjected by the Portuguese police, he did not give any  objective information possible to put in writing.    European Police Attentive    Certain police forces and intelligence services in some  European countries and in the United States may also have known  for some time the content of the report whose existence we are  revealing publicly today.    The British intelligence service, MI-5, and Scotland Yard,  the British police headquarters, are in this category. The same  may hold true of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), the U.S.  police department specializing in combating drugs, and of the  German police.    Portugal's role in the international drug trafficking  networks has warranted very special attention from those police  forces. Some of them have agents here on a full-time basis. The  drug traffic and matters associated with the (legal or illegal)  arms business are the focus of special attention.    Moreover, the DEA, which is currently monitoring Portugal  from its office in Madrid, is preparing to become installed in  Lisbon as well.    Despite the highly confidential nature of the information  revealed in the document, those agents working in close  proximity to the Portuguese investigators in the Criminal  Investigations Police have had access to it.

Zhirinovskiy yesterday sent a letter to Estonian Ambassador  to Russia Juri Kahn stating that ""coercive measures and  provocations against the well-known Russian defender of the law  and RLDP activist"" Pyotr Rozhok may bring about ""unforeseen  consequences"" in relations between Estonia and Russia.    ""Estonia's statehood, gained thanks to communists, may in  the  troubled times of the 20th century, if Russia's interests are  disregarded, become an ordeal for Estonia. Provocations and  pressure are not the right key in relations with a 150-million  nation. Let the organizers of such actions think deeply about  the possible consequences,"" Zhirinovskiy said in the letter.    The Estonian Security Police on March 24 seized Rozhok and  took him to psychiatric expertise. After that the police, in  the presence of the Russian vice consul, searched Rozhok's  apartment. They confiscated five brochures published by the RLDP  and a manuscript intended for publication ""in a Russian-language  newspaper,"" Rozhok told BNS.    Security Police Director General Juri Pihl told BNS  investigation of Rozhok's case will soon be completed and the  materials turned over to the court.    The Security Police on March 16 filed formal charges against  the 55-year-old Rozhok under Article 72 of the Criminal Code,  accusing him of ""fanning ethnic and political hatred.""  Addressing a meeting of the Russian Citizens' Union of Narva on  Jan. 18, Rozhok said Lennart Meri ""is, at best, the president  of Estonians, not of Estonia,"" since the Russian-speaking  population did not take part in the presidential elections. The  same applies to the parliament, he said. In an interview to the  Russian-language newspaper published in Sillamae, Rozhok claimed  Estonia is an ancient Russian territory. In Rozhok's opinion,  the retired Russian military living in Estonia should form armed  units ""to defend their honor and dignity"" in case the  authorities decide to deport them from Estonia.     "

Sporadic violence continued for a third day in eight of the  western state's 30 districts where arson and rioting snowballed  after the Maharashtra administration renamed a unversity after  the leader of low-caste Hindus.    High-caste Hindus outraged by the move on Monday set ablaze  an engineering workshop, a dam site and several schools in  Parbani district and torched a government veterinary hospital in  Jalna district, witnesses said.    The attackers hurled rocks at state buses and private cars,  forcing vehicles off the roads. Several Hindu and Buddhist  temples also came under attack as tension rose in the eight  districts torn by caste-strife, witnesses said.    Train and bus services remained disrupted because of attacks  by upper-caste Hindus protesting the renaming of Marathwada  university after Baba Sahib Ambedkar, leader of the  socially-oppressed low-caste Hindus.    Police stepped up patrols to prevent violence from spilling  into new areas.    Police also prepared to block a visit later Monday by Hindu  fundamentalist leader Bal Thackeray to the city of Aurangabad,  site of the rechristened university.    Thackeray is the leader of the Shiv Sena, whose members have  been at the forefront of the violence which erupted Friday [14  Jan] after Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar renamed the  university.    Police said they had blocked all entry points to Aurangabad  to ensure that Thackeray does not reach the city. They have  banned the visit by the firebrand Hindu leader, amid fears it  would spark large-scale unrest.    ""Nobody is above the law,"" senior police officer Mahesh  Narayan Singh said when asked whether Thackeray would be  arrested. He also asserted that there was no violence on Monday  in Marathwada district.    On Sunday, Shiv Sena militants and upper-caste Hindus  torched  a veterinary hospital, a police station, two schools and a Dalit  shanty town and attacked government buses and offices in  Marathwada.    No casualties were reported in the attacks.    Shiv Sena sources said Thackeray plans to lead a rally  Tuesday in Aurangabad to protest the renaming of Marathwada  university after the author of the Indian constitution.    Ambedkar is lionised by lower-caste Hindus, who are called  Dalits or ""downtrodden"" -- those at the lowest rung of the Hindu  caste ladder.    If Thackeray is arrested, Shiv Sena activists would fan out  into villages to carry out ""disruptive activities,"" sources in  his party said.    A journalist meanwhile swallowed poison and died in the town  of Yawat Mal on Sunday [16 Jan], leaving behind a suicide note  that said he was taking his life to protest at the renaming of  the university.    Vinod Gudge was the first person to commit suicide to  protest  the renaming.    Another protestor set himself on fire in Beed district but  survived with burns to 80 percent of his body, the MAHRASHTRA  TIMES said.    Five ""Dalits"" had committed suicide to force the renaming of  the university.    The outbreak of inter-caste violence is India's worst since  1990, when the then premier, V.P. Singh, hiked job quotas for  the lower castes.     "

Zinzun said police and city officials covered up an investigation of the  February incident, which ended with Police Chief Daryl F. Gates verbally  reprimanding Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon.    The claim alleges that Zinzun's privacy, his civil rights and the terms of a  previous court ruling barring police from spying on lawful citizens were  violated.      Prelude to Filing Suit    The claim, which also names Gates and Vernon, is a prelude to filing a lawsuit.  The city has 45 days to act after which a lawsuit can be filed under state law.    Asked about the claim, Gates insisted that Vernon did not take any sensitive  information about Zinzun from police intelligence files. Rather, he said, the  data came from a non-classified computer data base that consists mainly of  electronic versions of newspaper and magazine articles.    ""I don't blame Zinzun for not believing me because I would never believe  anything Zinzun ever had to say,"" Gates said.    He acknowledged, however, that the computer terminal through which Vernon  received the information has been moved from the anti-terrorist division and  will be relocated in the office of Cmdr. William Booth, Gates' spokesman.    In February, Vernon was rebuked by Gates after his use of the computer to  gather data on Zinzun, a former Black Panther who in March waged his third  unsuccessful campaign for Pasadena's Board of Directors. Zinzun blamed his  defeat partially on the incident.      Data for Rivals    Gates has said Vernon, a Pasadena resident, had printed out from the computer  156 pages of data for Zinzun's political rivals. Gates said he intervened  before Vernon could deliver the information. Department regulations prohibit  personnel from using police resources for anything but official business.    Zinzun, a member of the Coalition Against Police Abuse, was a key figure in the  1983 dismantling of the department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division,  which had illegally spied and kept intelligence files on hundreds of citizens.    Some of those files had been removed by a PDID detective who channeled the data  to an ultra-right-wing group. In 1983, the city settled the suit for $1.8  million, and the PDID was replaced by the Anti-Terrorist Division.    Zinzun and his attorney, Dan Stormer, said they believe the data Vernon  requested included police intelligence not in the public domain.    The City Council called for an investigation by the Police Commission, the  department's civilian review board.      Handled in Executive Session    Booth said the issue was handled by the commission in executive session ""to the  satisfaction of everyone involved,"" including the interested council members.    A spokesman for Councilman Robert Farrell, who originally called for the  investigation, said the council had asked for a report but had not set a  deadline.    Zinzun a year ago agreed to a $1.2-million settlement with the Pasadena police  over a 1986 incident at a housing complex in northwest Pasadena, which left him  permanently blind in one eye.

Authorities call it ""rat-packing"" and say it is a growing practice among gang  members in other areas of Los Angeles County. In Hollywood, they say, several  such robberies have occurred in recent weeks, sometimes targeting liquor and  convenience stores.

""They go in and completely  overwhelm the merchants, (who) are so intimidated they are afraid to take  action against any of them.""    Santa Monica stores are among the latest targets. But police said it is not  clear whether the practice has spread from other areas, or if the local  incidents have been isolated and the work of the same youths.    ""I don't think it is anything that is that well organized,"" said Thomas. ""But  it has happened enough for us to be concerned about it.""    Since July 23, at least two stores on Wilshire Boulevard have been hit, and  Thomas said there may have been others.    Police have arrested nine juveniles in two robberies of Athletic X-Press on  Wilshire Boulevard -- four in connection with a July 23 robbery, and five more  after a similar incident July 27. Some of the youths were caught as they  changed into stolen clothes and sneakers a few blocks away, according to police  reports.    Some suspects also may have participated in a similar robbery of Brooks Shoes  on Wilshire Boulevard, also on July 27, Thomas said.    During the Athletic X-Press robberies, at least 20 youths charged into the  store and headed for the clothing and sneakers, police said. Some of them had  been there the Saturday before, looking around before stealing one pair of  sneakers, said store owner Michael Dobbin.    ""They're just running in, picking stuff off the shelves and running out,""  Dobbin said.    One employee immediately called police but Dobbin said no effort was made to  stop the youths. ""Are you nuts? I'm not going to take on that many kids. Not a  chance,"" he said.    In the July 27 robbery at Athletic X-Press, one youth ripped a coatrack off its  bearings and walked out of the store with the entire rack, with six jackets on  it. Each jacket was worth about $100 and bore the insignia of the Los Angeles  Lakers, Raiders or other popular sports teams, according to a police report.    An unknown number of sneakers, apparently all Nike brand, also were stolen, and  authorities believe at least $2,000 in merchandise was taken altogether.    One Athletic X-Press employee said he ""did not see a single juvenile exit the  store without carrying store property in his hands"" during one of the  robberies, according to a police report.

The SFO director Mr George Staple said last night that he had asked the police 'to insure that no occurence of this type would occur in the future'. Mr Staple emphasised that 'no SFO lawyer or other member of the SFO' was involved in the forgery of a letter which was found to have been sent as an April's Fool joke last year. 'The letter was written and sent by an officer or officers of the City of London Police who had been working in conjunction with the SFO on the BCCI investigation,' Mr Staple added. The SFO confirmed that on April 1 1992, a senior lawyer working on the BCCI investigation received a faxed copy of the letter which appeared to come from Sir David. It was written on House of Commons paper and said that Sir David would be attending court later that day in relation to a defendant's bail application. According to Mr Staple's statement the senior SFO lawyer believed the letter to be genuine and showed it to the defendant's lawyers. The City of London Police said last night that the forged letter had been sent by one of its officers who was on secondment to the SFO. The force said its own inquiry 'did not result in any displinary proceedings'. Mr Alex Carlile, a Liberal Democrat MP, said he had evidence of a second forged letter relating to the same case, purporting to be from Mr David Freeman, a London solicitor.

By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      San Diego police said Friday they have several suspects under surveillance in  the slayings of five women in the Clairemont-University City area but have  brought none in for questioning.    Police also revealed that a man who admitted to the killings agreed to turn  himself in Thursday in Balboa Park. Police waited one hour but the man never  appeared.    Officials also have received a letter from someone claiming to be the killer  but police have dismissed it as the work of a prankster.    The new information came during the department's daily press briefings, which  began Monday.    Police have mounted the city's largest murder investigation to try to find a  man they believe has killed five women since January.    Since Sept. 13, when the last two women were found stabbed to death in  University City, 19 investigators have been assigned full-time to the case and  more might be added.    Homicide Capt. Dick Toneck, one of three police spokesmen assigned to the task  force investigating the murders, said Friday that police ""have a number of  people under surveillance"" but would not say on what basis, by what method, or  for how long.    ""We can't get into tactics as far as surveillance,"" he said. ""I can tell you my  concern and the department's concern is that this person will hit again,  period. If he was to quit and never do it again, it would be the greatest thing  that ever happened.""    Toneck also reluctantly confirmed a report that a man claiming to be the serial  killer called a local television station Thursday and said he would surrender  to police at 4 p.m. in Balboa Park. Toneck said police waited in the park until  5 p.m. and then gave up.    Earlier this week, he said, someone wrote the department to accept  responsibility for the murders.    Toneck said police believe both claims to be the work of one person. He said  that publicity about the letter and the promised Balboa Park rendezvous will  only encourage others to do the same.    ""My fear is that this kind of information, when it gets out, will wind up  causing us to go out to every place in San Diego to deal with these kinds of  people,"" he said.

By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      San Diego police said Friday they have several suspects under surveillance in  the slayings of five women in the Clairemont-University City area but have  brought none in for questioning.    Police also revealed that a man who admitted to the killings agreed to turn  himself in Thursday in Balboa Park. Police waited one hour but the man never  appeared.    Officials also have received a letter from someone claiming to be the killer  but police have dismissed it as the work of a prankster.    The new information came during the department's daily press briefings, which  began Monday.    Police have mounted the city's largest murder investigation to try to find a  man they believe has killed five women since January.    Since Sept. 13, when the last two women were found stabbed to death in  University City, 19 investigators have been assigned full-time to the case and  more might be added.    Homicide Capt. Dick Toneck, one of three police spokesmen assigned to the task  force investigating the murders, said Friday that police ""have a number of  people under surveillance"" but would not say on what basis, by what method, or  for how long.    ""We can't get into tactics as far as surveillance,"" he said. ""I can tell you my  concern and the department's concern is that this person will hit again,  period. If he was to quit and never do it again, it would be the greatest thing  that ever happened.""    Toneck also reluctantly confirmed a report that a man claiming to be the serial  killer called a local television station Thursday and said he would surrender  to police at 4 p.m. in Balboa Park. Toneck said police waited in the park until  5 p.m. and then gave up.    Earlier this week, he said, someone wrote the department to accept  responsibility for the murders.    Toneck said police believe both claims to be the work of one person. He said  that publicity about the letter and the promised Balboa Park rendezvous will  only encourage others to do the same.    ""My fear is that this kind of information, when it gets out, will wind up  causing us to go out to every place in San Diego to deal with these kinds of  people,"" he said.

By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WESTNET's first arrest nabbed more than $500,000 in cash and 30 kilos of  cocaine just as the suspected dealers tried to move to a new location by  concealing the cocaine in packages wrapped like birthday gifts.    Since that raid nearly 18 months ago, the Westside Narcotics Enforcement Team  has seized more than $3.5 million in cash, well over a ton of cocaine and other  drugs, and scores of vehicles and weapons, while arresting 57 suspected drug  traffickers. Ninety-five percent of the arrests have led to convictions,  according to the team's leader, Capt. Tim Grimmond of the El Segundo Police  Department.    The successes of the team -- initially created by the Inglewood, El Segundo,  Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Palos Verdes Estates police, with Redondo  Beach and Hawthorne quickly joining in -- have attracted the attention of  several other police departments.    This month, WESTNET will expand out of the South Bay as four new police  agencies come on board -- the Santa Monica Police Department, UCLA's police  force, the county Sheriff's Department and the Signal Hill Police Department.    With the expansion to 11 agencies, WESTNET's original team of nine officers  will be joined by a second team of nine, doubling its investigative capacity.

The city is putting up $100,000 to turn the  basement of City Hall into a new home for WESTNET.    Each police department assigns officers to WESTNET when it joins the team. The  agencies also provide equipment, such as cars, radios and computers.    Although Grimmond said he knew WESTNET would do well when it started in  January, 1989, its rapid growth has pleased police agencies throughout the  county.    ""We're a small community in Los Angeles, and we realize that criminals just  cross jurisdictional borders without even thinking about it,"" said Sgt. John  Miehle, assistant to the Santa Monica Police Department's chief.    ""We can't just close ourselves into our borders and think that criminals live  here and commit their crimes here and nothing else,"" he said. ""That's why we're  joining WESTNET. We're more than happy to pool our information and our  resources, because we know that always works out better.""    Before the team's creation, Grimmond said: ""South Bay police handled narcotics  on a very local level, with very little surveillance and very little effort put  into regional problems. We worked hand-to-hand sales and saw maybe two to three  kilos in a big bust.""    In 1987 and 1988, however, local narcotics officers began noticing a  proliferation of cocaine in the South Bay, at roughly the same time crack was  coming on the scene, Grimmond said.    Although larger police departments had the resources to create special drug  enforcement teams, smaller South Bay departments did not have that option.    WESTNET grew out of their frustration, Grimmond said.    Drug dealers ""operate all over. They know no boundaries,"" he said. ""They move  as fast and as far as cars and planes will take them. That's how we have to  move.""    Although the team's cases all begin with information gathered in the South Bay,  Grimmond said, most leads eventually take them out of this area.    Their biggest haul to date -- 491 kilos of cocaine hidden behind a false  partition in a 20-foot tractor-trailer rig -- was taken at a truck stop just  outside Barstow.    On some cases, Grimmond said, individual officers have spent weeks on  surveillance before making an arrest.    Police officials, however, say they are not concerned about the amount of time  the team spends outside its home area.    ""By pooling your resources, you can start to solve the problem. There are no  walls around this place,"" said Chief John Barber of the UCLA police agency.  ""One of the real benefits for us, too, is that an officer working on a  specialized task force is working with some of the best experts in the world. .  . . We get back a better officer.""    Officers assigned to WESTNET will rotate out every two or three years, Barber  said. Not least among the benefits, police chiefs say, is that federal drug  asset seizure laws allow local agencies to keep a large portion of the cash,  cars and other assets that have been used in drug transactions.    This means that at least $250,000 has gone to each WESTNET member agency so  far, more than covering the operation's cost.

In the past five months, from August to Dec. 22, there were six gang-related  murders compared to a single gang murder in all of 1988, according to Police  Department statistics.    There also have been 31 attempted murders, 31 drive-by shootings, 100 assaults  with a deadly weapon and 89 gang-related robberies since August.    Mayor William P. Cunningham said, ""It's something we're going to have to look  at next year. If we can find the money for more police, we'll definitely hire  them.""    The city's two-officer gang unit was formed last January. Ewing and his  partner, Detective George Hernandez, say there are eight to 10 hard-core gangs  in the city.    Most of the recent violence involves members from Florencia, one of Huntington  Park's oldest gangs, and the Bratz, a newer gang in the city. Ewing said he did  not know the incident that started the fighting, but ""they're killing each  other because of something one gang did to the other.""    In addition to the gangs based in Huntington Park, another 30 gangs have passed  through the city at one time or another and committed crimes, the detectives  said.    Some of the city's gang incidents this year:    * A teen-ager was shot in the groin Dec. 21 by someone in a car who yelled out  a gang name.    * Seven juveniles were arrested Dec. 12 after they surrounded a 33-year-old man  at a local park. One of the gang members slashed the man with a knife.    * A 15-year-old boy who was standing with friends was shot and killed Dec. 10  after an assailant claimed that the ""B"" on his hat stood for Bratz. The city is  offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case.    * A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed in front of his home Oct. 7 after a  carload of youths stopped to ask what gang he was from.    * On Oct. 8, a man died after he was beaten with bats and rocks. He had entered  a rival gang's neighborhood to drop off a friend.    The recent increase in violence apparently has gang members on edge. The  graffiti message ""RIP"" goes up in gang neighborhoods after fatal shootings.    ""They shot my dad's house,"" said one veteran Florencia gang member recently.  ""What's up?""    Graffiti markings stake out territory around the city. A mural of the Virgin  Mary with ""Florencia"" down one side, for example, adorns the wall of a building  on the corner of Florence and Holmes avenues just west of Huntington Park.  Ewing and Hernandez said some of the gang territories extend outside the city.    The gangs do not battle over drug profits, as do their better armed  counterparts in other areas of the county, Ewing said. Gang members in  Huntington Park mostly use pistols; automatic weapons are virtually unheard of  in the city's gang warfare.    Much of the violence in Huntington Park is centered on several areas, including  Arbutus Street, where Bratz gang members hang out just east of City Hall.  Another hot spot in recent months has been the bar and discotheque in the  Huntington Park Casino on the city's west side.    ""About five months ago we noticed more and more Florencia veteranos (older gang  members) were visiting this place,"" Ewing said.    The tension peaked Oct. 22, when a bar and parking lot fight broke out between  suspected gang members amid a crowd of more than 200 at the casino, Police  Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. About 30 law enforcement officers from  Huntington Park, Bell, Maywood and the Sheriff's Department made 11 arrests for  offenses that included assault to battery on a police officer, Connolly said.  No one was seriously injured in the melee, he said. Since then, security has  been increased at the casino.    The more violent gang members are in their late teens, but younger gang members  also can be dangerous, the gang-unit officers said.    ""It's not uncommon for us to (come across) a 12- or 14-year-old and find a gun  on him,"" Hernandez said.    Arrests and convictions for gang-related crimes are difficult to obtain.  Witnesses, who fear retaliation, are afraid to report the crimes, the  detectives said.    ""The people in this community understand the Bratz are killers,"" Ewing said.    And surviving gang members would rather avenge the attack themselves.    ""That's why we're seeing an increase,"" Ewing said. ""They're taking it into  their own hands.""    Police Chief Connolly said his department has stepped up its anti-gang efforts  by forming the two-man detail and by starting a boxing program to keep  potential gang members off the streets. But Connolly said he also hopes to meet  with police chiefs in neighboring cities to form a unified anti-gang unit.    On the streets, Ewing and Hernandez said they need help in their fight against  the gangs.    ""We don't want it to get worse and it's getting worse,"" Ewing said.      BACKGROUND Gang violence has increased in Huntington Park despite recent Police  Department efforts. In 1988, the department began a boxing program aimed at  keeping youths off the streets and out of gangs. More than 40 kids are now  enrolled, Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. In addition, Connolly formed a  two-officer, anti-gang detail last January. The chief had pinned his hopes on a  proposed utility tax to provide money to hire 15 additional officers to fight  gangs and crime in Huntington Park. But voters overwhelmingly rejected the  proposal in a special election last September.

A GUNMAN CHASES  DOWN A MAN RUNNING FOR HELP AND WOUNDS HIM IN THE BACK.      By MICHAEL CONNELLY and AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Two sisters were shot to death and a man was wounded when an ex-boyfriend of  one of the women allegedly invaded her Sepulveda home early Wednesday and began  firing a shotgun, Los Angeles police said.    Police said Dean Roger McGrath, 29, was arrested on suspicion of murder about  12 hours after the shootings, which took place at a duplex in the 8500 block of  Orion Avenue. Police said domestic problems motivated the shootings.    Sisters Marleene Evelyn Taylor, 32, and Kathleen Taylor Fien, 30, were hit with  shotgun blasts at 1:30 a.m. inside the small, two-bedroom house, Detective  Michael Brandt said. Anthony Deluca, 28, ran from the house calling for help,  but the gunman chased him down about six houses away and shot him in the back,  police said. He collapsed on a neighbor's front porch after he had knocked on  the door and called for help.    Police said Taylor's two young sons -- Tony, a 4-year-old fathered by Deluca,  and Jake, a 2-year-old    fathered by McGrath -- were asleep in the house when McGrath allegedly entered  through an unlocked door and began shooting, but they were unharmed.    Police said the boys awoke to find their mother dead in another room. They were  later taken into custody by juvenile authorities who were looking for relatives  they could stay with.    Two neighbors called police when shots and screams were heard in the  neighborhood of mostly single-family houses that back up to the San Diego  Freeway -- one block south of an area where streets were barricaded by police  this year in an effort to reduce drug dealing and related crimes.    ""I heard muffled shots and then shooting outside. Someone was screaming for  help,"" said Sonya Stanchfield, who lives in the duplex next to where the  shootings began. ""It was pretty wild for this neighborhood. We've had problems  around here, but nothing like this before.""    Taylor was dead when police arrived and Fien died while being transported to  Panorama Community Hospital in Panorama City. Deluca was in critical but stable  condition in an undisclosed hospital. Police said Deluca identified McGrath as  their attacker.    McGrath was arrested without a struggle at a house in North Hollywood after  police checked other locations where the suspect was known to have stayed. A  shotgun believed to be the murder weapon was found in the house.    Brandt said the shootings were apparently motivated by problems involving  McGrath, Taylor and Deluca.    Police and neighbors said McGrath and Taylor and her two sons moved into the  duplex four months ago along with Fien and her husband, David Fien. On April  21, McGrath was arrested at the duplex on a drunk driving warrant and served 66  days in the County Jail before being released June 29, authorities said.    While McGrath was in jail, Deluca either began visiting often or moved into the  small duplex, police and neighbors said. Since his release from jail, it was  not known if McGrath had contacted Taylor or visited the duplex before his  arrival early Wednesday. David Fien was not at the duplex at the time of the  shootings.    ""The motivation was domestic problems, but we are still trying to figure out  what the relationships were,"" Brandt said.    Neighbors knew little about the people living in the small, beige duplex,  surrounded by a neatly trimmed lawn and chain-link fence. ""They were very quiet  and stayed totally to themselves,"" said John Stanchfield, who lives next door.    Neighbors said the two sisters and the two children were seen playing on the  lawn early Tuesday evening and later Taylor sat on the front porch with Deluca.  ""There was no sign that anything was coming,"" Stanchfield said.    According to police and court records, Taylor had not reported any previous  problem with McGrath and had not sought a restraining order to keep him away.    Taylor worked as a clerk at a Northridge department store and wore the same  steel-gray dress so often that neighbors said they thought it was a uniform.  The dark-haired Taylor was described as ""very tall, very thin, very beautiful.""    Neighbors said Deluca worked in an auto-related business. Last week, he  approached a neighbor and offered to buy her car.    It was unknown by police and neighbors if Kathleen Fien and McGrath had been  employed. Some neighbors said Fien spent much of her time watching her sister's  children, rarely left the house and spoke to no one. Former neighbors said  McGrath spent a lot of time working on cars.    Before moving to the duplex, McGrath, the sisters and the two boys lived in a  two-bedroom apartment a few blocks away on Parthenia Avenue but were evicted  Feb. 6 for not paying their rent, the manager said.    Residents of that complex, many of whom declined to give their names because  they feared McGrath, said he was a burly man who drank heavily and lost his  temper frequently.    ""He was susceptible to blowing his top,"" said one neighbor. He said McGrath and  Taylor argued frequently.    Yet, many said, he doted on his 2-year-old son. ""He was crazy about him,"" one  resident said.    In addition to serving a jail sentence for drunk driving, court records show  that McGrath was arrested Sept. 21, 1988, in Los Angeles on suspicion of  possession and sale of 28.5 grams of cocaine. On Jan. 16, 1990, Van Nuys  Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber dismissed the charge at the request of  prosecutors. The people's motion said it was ""in the interests of justice""  because the defendant is ""factually innocent.""    Times staff writer Patricia Klein Lerner contributed to this story.

The dark-haired Taylor was described as ""very tall, very thin, very beautiful.""    Neighbors said Deluca worked in an auto-related business. Last week, he  approached a neighbor and offered to buy her car.    It was unknown by police and neighbors if Kathleen Fien and McGrath had been  employed. Some neighbors said Fien spent much of her time watching her sister's  children, rarely left the house and spoke to no one. Former neighbors said  McGrath spent a lot of time working on cars.    Before moving to the duplex, McGrath, the sisters and the two boys lived in a  two-bedroom apartment a few blocks away on Parthenia Avenue but were evicted  Feb. 6 for not paying their rent, the manager said.    Residents of that complex, many of whom declined to give their names because  they feared McGrath, said he was a burly man who drank heavily and lost his  temper frequently.    ""He was susceptible to blowing his top,"" said one neighbor. He said McGrath and  Taylor argued frequently.    Yet, many said, he doted on his 2-year-old son. ""He was crazy about him,"" one  resident said.    In addition to serving a jail sentence for drunk driving, court records show  that McGrath was arrested Sept. 21, 1988, in Los Angeles on suspicion of  possession and sale of 28.5 grams of cocaine. On Jan. 16, 1990, Van Nuys  Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber dismissed the charge at the request of  prosecutors. The people's motion said it was ""in the interests of justice""  because the defendant is ""factually innocent.""    Times staff writer Patricia Klein Lerner contributed to this story.

In order to do so, he was to have gained access to large  shipments of beef to be exported to Israel in order to poison  them with a powerful toxic substance.    This warning was sounded by the Israeli intelligence service  soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police that Ahmed  Al Mekdav, a fundamentalist Shi'ite, had arrived in our country  a month ago.    Police Superintendent Enrique De Jesus Martinetti, the  director of the National Police Intelligence Department,  confirmed this and pointed out that the information was provided  by the Israeli secret service.    The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export  meat to Israel, find a way to get access to the product to be  exported to Israel, and then poison it with a deadly toxic  substance.    The consequences would have been devastating. The objective  was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their  country.    The name of the meat-packing plants are: ""Frigobeef,""  located in Capitan Lombardo very close to Artigas, and ""San  Antonio"" in the city of the same name.    Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing  plants and warned their managers to take the necessary  precautions by not allowing strangers on their premises so as to  thwart any sabotage attempts.    Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private,  and  not government-owned, Israeli meat-packing plant.    He said: ""We were alerted by the Israelis and now are  conducting an inquiry. We have been informed that this Shi'ite,  Imadal Mekdav [name as published], intended to poison a large  shipment of beef that was going to be exported to Israel. We  have seemingly aborted this attempt with the help of the  Israelis. Mekdav has been spotted already in Lebanon."" [passage  omitted]     "

The cocaine, smuggled in on a boat from Colombia in a banana  cargo, was seized overnight Saturday. Police announced its  seizure on Monday.    The drugs, with a street value of about 300 million dollars,  were seized when a truck taking the cargo from the port of Genoa  to a warehouse in a village near here was stopped on a road in  northern Italy, police said.    In order to divert attention, the drugs traffickers had left  the cargo in the warehouse for two months from its arrival  before moving it, police said.    When the cargo was moved, the driver was joined in the cab  by  his three year old daughter and pet dog in order to allay the  police's suspicions, officials said.    The seizure, a record amount in Europe, followed months of  joint investigation by police in Milan and Genoa, Turin police  said.    Twelve people were arrested during the operation, including  several suspected Mafia members. Only two of the suspects were  identified--Adrea Lia, 22, and Maurizio Lo Russo, 28, who had  rented the warehouse where the cocaine was to have been  delivered.    The drug was probably destined for sale outside Italy, in  several other European countries. Inquiries are continuing in  Switzerland, Germany and Lichtenstein.    Police said that the recent increases in frontier controls  in  areas bordering on the former Yugoslavia had pushed the drugs  traffickers to use the Turin region as the major conduit for the  drugs trade out of Italy.    ""If the traffickers chose Turin as the base for the passage  of such a quantity of the drug, that means that the mafia has  the capacity in place to manage such a volume,"" a police source  said.    It shows their heavy implantation into northern Italy, he  added.     "

By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The San Diego police narcotics unit has a policy of allowing only three private  investigative firms with close ties to the department to do undercover drug  investigations, excluding other local agencies capable of doing the same work,  according to a lawsuit on file in federal court.    Kevin S. Hill, a retired Escondido officer, filed the lawsuit in February,  after he was purportedly told by San Diego Police Lt. Dan Berglund that he and  his firm, California Confidential Services, were unqualified to do an  undercover investigation at Sony Corp. of America.    Hill sued for $1.2 million in damages, naming as defendants Berglund, San Diego  Police Chief Bob Burgreen, Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, former Escondido  Chief James W. Connole, the cities of San Diego and Escondido, and several  other Escondido and San Diego officers.    Since it was filed, the case has traveled slowly through the federal court  system, with defendants filing motions asking to be dropped from the lawsuit.    According to the lawsuit, the officers and chiefs slandered Hill and engaged in  a conspiracy to prevent him from being hired by Sony for an undercover  investigation of some of the company's employees who were suspected of drug  use.    San Diego Deputy City. Atty. James Chapin said Tuesday that U.S District Judge  Earl Gilliam recently dropped the city of San Diego, Burgreen and Berglund as  defendants in the lawsuit, when he ruled that the complaint was insufficient as  it applied to the three. But Chapin said that Gilliam also allowed Hill's  attorney to update the lawsuit in order to include them as defendants again.    However, Hill's lawsuit once again raises an issue that has been vexing for San  Diego police and the city for several years. Other investigative firms, some of  them run by former police officers, have complained bitterly about Berglund's  decision to work mainly with Narcorp, Kennedy Consulting & Investigations  and Kraut & Snyder, a Los Angeles-area firm, in private, undercover drug  investigations at local work sites.    Usually, undercover drug investigations done by private investigators in San  Diego have to be cleared with police. San Diego narcotics officers insist on  supervising all drug transactions done in an investigation.    Until this week, Berglund led the police narcotics unit and supervised drug  investigations. On Monday, he began working as a supervisor in the homicide  unit. Berglund and Cmdr. Larry Gore referred all questions about the lawsuit to  Chapin.    Hill's lawsuit alleges that Berglund accused him of being ""mentally unbalanced  and a danger to the public"" at an April 17, 1989, meeting. Berglund also  allegedly told him that he was unauthorized to carry a concealed weapon, Hill  said. The Sheriff's Department revoked Hill's concealed weapon permit June 5,  1989, said the complaint.    Two days after meeting with Hill, Berglund notified Sony that Hill's firm was  unqualified to do the investigation and told the company that only Narcorp,  Kennedy Consulting & Investigations and Kraut & Snyder were approved by  San Diego police to do private, undercover drug investigations in the city, the  lawsuit contended.    A former police officer who runs a private investigative firm in San Diego  echoed Hill's complaint. The investigator, who did not want to be identified,  said he and employees of his firm had two meetings with Berglund to complain  about his refusal to work with the firm.    ""They favored Narcorp to a larger degree and were directing most of the  business to Narcorp. . . . The Police Department was acting in a capacity they  don't really belong in,"" said the investigator. ""My feeling is that basically  Berglund was out of his league. We get our license from the state of  California, not the city of San Diego.""    Narcorp owner Hal Phenix, a retired San Diego narcotics officer, said he did  not know Hill and denied that his company had received favorable treatment from  Berglund and San Diego police.    ""Cops just don't do that. Police administrators are so concerned about  appearances that they're very careful about what they do,"" Phenix said. ""I  don't get referrals from the department.""    Dave Macleod, new owner of Kennedy Consulting & Investigations, also denied  that his company gets referrals from San Diego police.    Chapin, the deputy city attorney, said his office has been meeting with police  officials to discuss the department's policy in working with private firms on  undercover drug investigations. He added that city officials have also talked  with the state about assuming responsibility for approving private  investigative firms that work on undercover drug investigations.    Private investigators are licensed by the state Department of Consumer Affairs.    ""On its face, I believe that the policy we have now is fair. These  investigations involve the buying and selling of drugs, and this is uniquely a  police function,"" said Chapin. ""The Police Deparment is currently in the  position of taking responsibility for supervising this function. State law  requires the police to supervise anybody they approve for these  investigations.""    Chapin said narcotics officers have to be very selective about the private  firms they approve for undercover drug investigations.    ""Investigations of this type would ultimately make the city liable if anything  went wrong. . . . We have to be very careful about who we approve and are  willing to supervise in these investigations,"" Chapin said.    Hill's problems extend beyond the San Diego and Escondido police departments.  Although the Sheriff's Department is not listed as a defendant, court records  show that sheriff's officials revoked Hill's permit to carry a concealed weapon  after learning he omitted information about his employment with Escondido  police.    Jean Snyder, manager of the sheriff's license division, said in a letter  included in the court file that Hill applied for a concealed weapon permit on  Nov. 25, 1986, without disclosing that he had formerly worked as an Escondido  police officer. The permit was renewed in 1988 and briefly in 1989 before it  was revoked in June, 1989.

According to  police, a new route is being used by the Colombian and Bolivian  cartels to transport the drug through Brazil. The drug enters  the country at Ponta Pora, then is transported to Dourados,  where it is hidden in spare parts of cars. The cocaine then  leaves Mato Grosso do Sul on the main highway to Sao Paulo.

The judgment was ordered in the highly publicized case in which a 19-year-old  San Pedro youth was killed in a 1984 traffic collision with off-duty Torrance  Police Sgt. Rollo Green. Jurors found that the Police Department covered up for  Green.    In its lawsuit, the city alleges that Protective National Insurance Co. of  Omaha, Neb., and its parent companies have cheated a number of California  cities and counties in recent years by refusing to make payments on legitimate  claims. The other municipalities include the cities of Fullerton and Hawthorne  and Sacramento County.    The company ""has engaged and continues to engage in a pattern and practice of  fraudulent and illegal activity . . . in order to retain for itself and its  members funds that are legitimately owing to its insureds,"" the suit contends.    The suit, which alleges fraud, breach of faith and breach of contract, also  cites federal anti-racketeering laws.    ""You have a financially strapped city that bought insurance against this very  thing,"" said David Pettit, one of the attorneys who filed the suit for the  city. ""Now Protective National has just walked away from their  responsibilities.    ""This is one of the worst bad-faith cases I've ever seen.""    The lawsuit charges that Protective National has acted deliberately to withhold  money from a number of agencies holding its policies.    Protective National vice president Jack Gaffigan, who signed a Sept. 27, 1989,  letter rejecting the city's claim, refused to comment and referred questions to  Los Angeles attorney Robert Baker. Baker's secretary said he was out of town  and unavailable for comment.    In the Rollo Green case, which went to trial last year, a Los Angeles Superior  Court jury found that the Police Department covered up for Green, who had been  drinking before the accident, by delaying a field sobriety test for more than  an hour and by failing to measure Green's blood-alcohol level. The jury also  concluded that the cover-up followed a Police Department ""custom and policy"" of  condoning misbehavior by officers.    The judge in the case later ordered the city to pay an additional $2.1 million  in fees and expenses to attorneys for John Rastello, whose 19-year-old son,  Kelly, died in the 1984 collision.    The city has been forced to set aside nearly $12 million of its own money --  the cost of the judgments plus any interest that might accrue -- while it  appeals the case, Pettit said. Protective National early this year reimbursed  the city for the $67,000 cost of the appeal bond.    Torrance officials charge that Protective National, which carried a $20-million  policy for the city from 1982 through 1984, selected and paid the attorneys who  defended the city and rejected numerous settlement offers before, during and  after the trial.    Immediately after the jury's decision, Rastello's attorneys offered to accept  $7.5 million, including all fees and expenses, to avoid the additional cost of  an appeal.    Torrance officials say they demanded that Protective National accept that  offer, but the insurance company refused.    Two weeks later, Gaffigan sent a letter to the city saying that Protective  National would not pay the judgments, alleging that the jury's verdict was  based on a finding that the Police Department and the officers had committed  intentional acts.    The letter said Torrance was insured only for accidents.    But Torrance's attorneys, who dispute the company's contention that the  incident was intentional, said the point is moot anyway, because Protective  National representatives in 1982 deleted a provision of the insurance policy  that would have barred payment for intentional acts.    ""They have made up this problem that doesn't even exist,"" Pettit said. ""What we  are alleging in this complaint is that they're putting their own financial  interests ahead of the interests of the insured.""    Shortly after the city received Gaffigan's letter, attorney Baker notified  Torrance attorneys that Protective National does not have enough money to pay  the judgment.    Protective National, Pettit said, ""has been pleading poverty . . . but we  believe they have enough money to pay this claim if they want to.""    The company has been under state supervision for nearly four years, according  to Nebraska insurance regulators, who have barred the company from writing any  new policies since 1986.    Dan Quine, assistant chief examiner in the Nebraska Department of Insurance,  said that as of March 31, the company reported net assets of $18.6 million.

Chawalit said after meeting with other senior officials  concerned that the U.S. government had only provided a copy of  its indictment against Thanong. That was not sufficient to  prosecute a case before a Thai court, he said.    At the meeting with Chawalit were Deputy Permanent Secretary  Ari Wong-araya, Interior Ministry legal adviser Chailoet  Ditsamnat, national Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop, Deputy  Police Chief Pol Gen Phot Bunyachinda, Assistant Police Chief  Thanu Homhuan and Chawalit's personal secretary, Sonchai  Montriwat.    ""The copy of the U.S. indictment cannot alone be used as  evidence to substantiate drug allegations against Thanong. The  police cannot do anything at present,"" Chawalit said.    The minister has ordered Prathin to ask the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) for more details relating to the charges.    Chawalit also said he wants more information from Washington  about Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's revelation that 17  other Thai MPs stand accused by the U.S. of being involved in  drug trafficking.    Chawalit has ordered the Office of Narcotics Control Board  to  gather evidence related to the Thanong issue. Prathin said he  is awaiting additional information from the Foreign Ministry.    Asked to confirm a Chat Thai Party statement that Thanong  faces only six months in jail if convicted here of drug  trafficking, Chawalit said he does not know the penalty involved.    Given adequate evidence, Prathin said, Thanong would not  escape prosecution on any drug charges just because of his  stature or influence.    Attorney General Ophat Arunin said yesterday the government  should decide quickly whether to extradite Chat Thai MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong to face drug trafficking charges in the United  States. Ophat will testify today before the House committee on  parliamentary affairs which is investigating the issue. He  would infomm the committee of all information he received from  U.S. officials.

The settlement, which involved 70 plaintiffs who claimed their rights had been  violated by the Hawthorne Police Department, brought an end to a civil trial  that had been under way for more than three months in Los Angeles County  Superior Court.    Attorneys for the Vagos said the settlement was a vindication of their clients'  claims that Hawthorne police officers had engaged in a campaign of harassment  against the bikers.    ""I don't think anybody expected a motorcycle club to achieve this kind of  victory,"" said Paul Hoffman of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead  attorney in the case. ""But we demonstrated that when anyone's rights are  violated, you can get full vindication in our system.""    Hoffman added that the hefty settlement should send a clear message to the  Hawthorne Police Department to change its ""abusive"" tactics which, he argued  during the trial, extended beyond the Vagos to other minority groups in the  community.    Representatives of the city had no comment on the settlement. Specifically  named as defendants in the suit were former Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R.  Stonebraker, three of his lieutenants and a sergeant. Numerous unnamed officers  who participated in the searches also were listed as defendants.    After attorney fees are paid, about $1.5 million of the money will be divided  among the plaintiffs. Some of the money is meant to compensate them for damage  to their homes sustained during police raids seven years ago.    Witnesseses testified during the trial that police broke down doors, ransacked  drawers and confiscated motorcycles and cars during searches of members' homes,  and even searches of neighbors' homes.    But the property damage was relatively minor, attorneys said, compared to the  violation of the plaintiffs' civil rights. Witnesses said that during the raids  police pointed guns at the heads of children, used obscene language against  women, used unnecessary force and made false arrests.    ""The money doesn't matter,"" said plaintiff Lenard Barela, 42, after the  settlement agreement hearing. ""All we wanted was for (police) to get the  message that we're people too and the law applies to everybody.""    Barela said that members of the Vagos, formed in the 1960s to fight off the  outlaw Hells Angels, have almost grown used to harassment from police. ""It's  part of the game and they have a job to do,"" he said. ""But when they terrorize  my kids, they're pushing too far.    Police said they launched the 1983 raids in a manhunt for a club member  suspected of stabbing three men in a bar fight. The plaintiff's lawyers,  however, argued that the homes were raided merely to harass the families in a  ploy to pressure the suspect to give himself up.    Club members charged that the raids were part of a pattern of harassment  against them that had lasted for years. Members were often stopped by police on  any excuse, including ""wearing green"" in the city, said Barela. The club's  emblem, which members wear on the backs of their sleeveless jackets, is green.    More than 80 witnesses were called during the trial before Judge Maurice Hogan  Jr.    But it was a former Hawthorne police officer who provided some of the key  testimony for the plaintiffs.    Dana Griffith, who now lives in Texas, testified that his colleagues made  unwarranted arrests, wrote false crime reports and roughed up suspects, all  with their superiors' approval. Griffith said that officers routinely referred  to incidents involving blacks, Latinos, motorcycle gangs or poor whites as  ""N.H.I."" or ""no human involvement.""    ACLU attorneys argued that the alleged harassment campaign against the  motorcycle club and other groups was a result of an overzealous get-tough  stance by city and police officials.    ""The best way to change the city's policy is to impose substantial damages,""  Hoffman said after the settlement agreement. ""This will cause the Police  Department to change as rapidly as anything anybody can do.""    Griffith, however, was not optimistic. The disgruntled former officer said he  has been unable to get another job in law enforcement. He contends that  Hawthorne police smeared his reputation by claiming he was the subject of a  murder investigation, although no charges have ever been filed.    Griffith predicted that Hawthorne police officers would escalate their  harassment of the Vagos because of the court settlement.

Leaked government documents suggest that Pounds 11m will be axed from forces throughout England and Wales. Lincolnshire would bear the heaviest blow with 'upwards of Pounds 6m' cut from its spending. Mr Barry Fippard, chairman of the Lincolnshire police committee, said the force appeared to be paying for success. Mr Bensley said the proposals were equivalent to closing police stations in seven towns. Lincolnshire police were being punished because of significant efficiency improvements.

Campbell, a Lancaster carpenter, went to a luncheon, accepted several framed  plaques and endured repeated handclasps with public officials -- all because he  stopped on his way to work last Jan. 30 and aided three people trapped in an  overturned car.    What Jim Campbell did not expect for his brief heroism was a lawsuit.    Campbell and Los Angeles Police Motorcycle Officer Loran Dale Turner -- awarded  the department's highest honor for his actions that morning -- are being sued  by one of the three crash victims, who was injured by a second car that veered  into the overturned vehicle.    ""I'm pretty calm about it now,"" Campbell said just before he was honored with  nine other men by the Mid-Valley Community Police Council. ""But when I first  heard about it, I was real upset.""    According to the Police Department and the citizens' group that presented  honors at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Van Nuys, Campbell, 31, and Turner, 42, are  heroes for coming to the aid of Ricardo Garcia, his wife, Norma -- who was in  labor -- and a cousin.    As gasoline gushed from the overturned car, the two men carried Garcia's  pregnant wife to safety and went to the aid of the cousin, who was struck by  another vehicle.    But in a lawsuit, filed Sept. 25 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the  cousin, Anzelma Sanchez-Sianez, 17, claimed that she was struck by the second  car because of negligence. According to her lawyer, Paul Jay Bershin,  Sanchez-Sianez alleges ""that the police officer failed to put up a flare  pattern to stop the vehicle"" that hit the Garcias' overturned car.    The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages and also names Ricardo Garcia and  the driver of the second car as defendants, claims that after helping  Sanchez-Sianez out of the car, Campbell put her ""in an unsafe place."" She  suffered a ruptured spleen, Bershin said.    Turner, awarded the Police Department's Medal of Valor in September, declined  to answer the specific allegations in the lawsuit against him. But he angrily  defended Campbell, claiming that the civilian was simply reacting with grace  under extreme pressure.    ""Had Jim Campbell not taken the actions he did that morning, there wouldn't be  a 10-month-old girl and a mom and a dad alive today,"" Turner said. ""I wish  there were more Jim Campbells out there.""    Turner said that he would not have noticed the overturned car if Campbell had  not already stopped to help. ""I saw his car parked next to the center divider,  and then I saw him jump over,"" Turner said. ""If he hadn't been there, I would  have kept on driving.""    Other cars passed by, but he stopped, Campbell said, because ""it was the right  thing to do.""    According to a police account, the car was northbound on the San Diego Freeway  near Roscoe Boulevard in Van Nuys, on its way to a hospital, when it turned  over in the fast lane of the freeway. Campbell parked his pickup truck on a  ""breakaway"" lane on the southbound side of the freeway and by the time Turner  made it to the divider, Campbell could hear the pregnant woman yelling: ""My  baby! My baby!""    ""Gas was pouring out of the car right by her head,"" Campbell said.    The two men assisted the expectant mother and the teen-ager from the car,  Turner said. Ricardo Garcia emerged from the vehicle on his own. Then the two  men, unaware that the frightened woman was referring to her unborn child, began  searching for an infant. Precious moments passed, both men said, before they  realized that the woman was in labor.    ""I could see headlights coming -- high beams, low beams,"" Turner said. ""I could  see the next vehicle coming and I told (Campbell) to grab the lady's legs and  we lifted her up onto the center median barrier.""    Turner and Campbell said that they turned back to help Sanchez-Sianez, but it  was too late.    ""A (second) car crashed into the overturned car, there was a fireball and the  second car veered hard left and took the teen-aged girl 180 feet down the  freeway,"" Turner said.    According to Turner, there was no time to even think about setting up flares.  Even if there had been time, he said, the gallons of gasoline spilling out over  the car and its occupants would have made using flares a fatal act.    ""This whole thing took maybe 80 seconds,"" Turner said. ""There was no time to  lay a flare pattern and you wouldn't want to do it with gasoline pouring out  all over the place.""    Since the incident, Turner has turned to City Councilman Joel Wachs for help in  devising state legislation that might protect good Samaritans from legal  liability when they help others as Campbell did.    ""It's the least we can do to thank people like Jim Campbell,"" he said.    Jim Campbell sought a more private gesture. After the accident, he went to the  hospital several times, he said, to check on Sanchez-Sianez's progress.    ""Last time I was there was on Valentine's Day,"" Campbell said. ""I just wanted  to see how she was doing. But I never heard from her.""

Gates to conduct random drug testing of sworn officers, setting  the stage for a likely court fight as the LAPD tries to begin such testing by  June 1.    The Los Angeles Police Protective League filed an unfair labor practices  complaint and formally notified LAPD officials that it is not willing to modify  its contract with the city, which now allows very limited drug testing.    ""What's the purpose of having a contract?"" asked Lt. George V. Aliano,  president of the 7,800-member union. He called Gates' drug testing proposal ""an  attempt to reopen an issue already negotiated.""    But LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the department will proceed with  the plan to have a computer select personnel, from Gates on down, for drug  testing each day.    ""We're going to do it as soon as we can,"" Booth said.    In declaring his unwillingness to negotiate on the issue, and promising  ""appropriate legal action,"" Aliano said two-thirds of union members responding  to a survey opposed any modification of their four-year contract ""in the middle  of its term.""    Under current policy, random drug testing is allowed only with officers in  their first 18 months of employment. Special urine tests can be ordered for  veteran officers only when there is some evidence of drug use.    In November, however, Gates submitted a formal proposal to begin negotiations  with the union to extend the random testing to all officers. Gates said  citizens should have the assurance that the people who respond to emergencies  are not on drugs.    Under his plan, the LAPD's medical liaison staff would collect urine samples  for testing in the department's lab. A positive reading would trigger a test by  an independent lab -- whose confirmation of the finding would result in  termination.    At the time Gates announced his plan, Aliano had said he expected members of  his union to support testing because ""they want to show they are drug-free just  like everybody else."" But Aliano said the survey of members showed their  apprehension on a variety of questions raised by Gates' proposal.    ""The real issue is reopening the contract,"" the union head said Friday. ""That  would be like us trying to reopen the contract with the city every six months  to ask for higher salaries. . . .    ""He (Gates) said, 'You don't know what they (members) want. Well, I found out  what they want. . . . I consider two-thirds a pretty good mandate.""    Aliano said the union is willing to ""put everything back on the table in March,  1992,"" when negotiations begin on a new contract.    Only a handful of police departments around the country now do random drug  testing of all officers.    But Gates, who has long sought such a program, was encouraged by a U.S. Supreme  Court decision late last year not to consider a union challenge to the Boston  Police Department's 3-year-old drug testing policy.    At issue is a state labor law requirement that management ""meet and confer"" in  good faith with a union before making significant changes in work conditions.    The Los Angeles Police Protective League's official refusal ""to meet and confer  on the issue of drug testing"" was included in a letter hand-delivered Friday to  Parker Center police headquarters.    Booth said that, under LAPD officials' interpretation of court rulings, the  department met its legal obligation merely ""by extending an offer to meet and  confer on the issue.""    ""This response is 'no,' to decline that request,"" he added. ""The offer and the  request for a meeting is still there, as are the plans to proceed with the  random testing. . . . We're going to go ahead, with an implementation date of  no later than June 1.""    In its second action Friday, the police union filed a complaint with the city's  Employee Relations Board. ""This is the official way for me to say I'm not  meeting and it's unfair for (Gates) to try to get me to that table,"" Aliano  said.    An attorney for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, Cecil Marr, said the  union also might seek arbitration to settle the question of whether expanded  drug testing constitutes a reopening of the officers' contract.    ""If we can't resolve this administratively by June 1, we'll have to go to  court,"" he said.    The union's survey of officers asked six questions, including whether any drug  testing should be done by the LAPD's Scientific Investigative Division or by an  outside lab, whether officers who admit to a drug problem should be allowed to  return to work after completing a rehabilitation program, and even whether any  testing should look for traces of steroids.    Aliano said he would not disclose the results of five of the six questions --  including the one seeking officers' general attitude toward random drug testing  -- because of their potential use in future contract negotiations.    ""If you reveal how your membership feels, the other side knows if you're weak  or strong. I can't do that,"" he said.    In a statement released Friday, the union said: ""The decision to not reopen our  contract in no way detracts from the sensitive nature of drug testing or the  Los Angeles police officers' concern about the drug problem in this city and  country. However, we are not part of that problem. . . . On this particular  issue we must protect ourselves and our legitimate right to negotiate. . . .""      Photo, Lt. George V.

The Drug Control Police arrested three of the group's leaders,  a Costa Rican and two Colombians, on 18 March.    The group had a workshop to manufacture suitcases and  backpacks with double bottoms. The workshop operated from the  Invu [National Institute of Housing and City Planning] project  in Las Canas, Alajuela Province. The mafiosi covered the drug  packages with sulfur, to avoid detection by trained dogs, and  then hid the the drugs in the double bottoms.    During the last three years they were able to send, via the  ""mules,"" about two 10-kilo shipments per week to different  European countries.    The individuals who participated in the group's activities  include at least eight of the 10 Costa Ricans arrested within  the last 18 months in Spain when they tried to smuggle cocaine  into the country.    During the operation, carried out on Friday, police arrested  Carlos Alvarado Alvarado, a Costa Rican, and Moises Nader Vargas  and Luis Carlos Diez Diez, Colombians. Diez has been identified  as the group's leader, an emissary of the Pereira Cartel who was  responsible for organizing the group's different connections.    Reports on the presence of Diez, who had ties with the  Pereira Cartel, in Costa Rica led the narcotics police to a  large-scale operation. At least 10 narcotics agents settled for  almost a week next door to the Colombian mafioso's room at a  local hotel in San Jose.    They tailed Diez, and this allowed them to locate Alvarado's  house at the Invu Las Canas housing project, where they noticed  a series of suspicious activities; on Friday they proceeded to  raid the house.    The authorities seized 10 kg of cocaine stashed in a double  bottom suitcase, as well as a considerable amount of implements  to prepare the illegal merchandise for transportation--glue,  foam, sewing machines, sulfur, thread, backpacks, and suitcases.

By WENDY PAULSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SANTA ANA      A freeway chase from Huntington Beach to Compton ended with the arrests of  three men who allegedly robbed a department store jewelry counter at gunpoint,  the latest in a series of Southland jewel heists, police said Thursday.    And although Orange County police were tight-lipped about investigations of two  similar robberies in the last month, Los Angeles police said the incidents fit  a pattern of nearly 100 similar thefts in the western United States since 1989  that may stem from a criminal network in southwest Los Angeles County.

On Wednesday, Virgil Kirkland Mahoney, 19, Jesse James Kirkland, 25, and  Michael Taylor, 33, all of Los Angeles, were arrested Wednesday night at the  Alondra Boulevard off-ramp of the Long Beach Freeway. Police said the car in  which the men were riding crashed during a chase that reached speeds in excess  of 100 m.p.h.    The three men were being held in Orange County Jail on $50,000 bail each on  charges of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.    Police said the suspects entered a Best Products Co. store on the 2800 block of  Bristol Street in Santa Ana at 8:40 p.m., brandished a .38-caliber revolver and  ordered employees not to move.    After failed attempts at breaking into plexiglass jewelry cases, the men kicked  in the backs of three cabinets and removed pieces set with precious gems, along  with gold and silver jewelry, said Ed Medina, district loss prevention manager  for Best Products Co. He did not know the value of the stolen merchandise.    The gun and an undisclosed amount of jewelry were found in the suspects' car,  which had been reported stolen, police said.    Huntington Beach police began the chase at 9 p.m. on the San Diego Freeway near  Beach Boulevard after an officer spotted a car traveling north that matched a  description of the suspects' vehicle.    Officers from Seal Beach and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department  assisted in the arrest, and the suspects were turned over to Santa Ana police.    ""We're talking to other agencies that have had similar robberies,"" said Santa  Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. ""It's not that often that the suspects  are arrested in these cases, so it's a break for us.""    Hawthorne Police Detective Don Shrum, however, was not as optimistic that the  capture would help crack the growing number of jewelry store holdups.    Hawthorne has had three such thefts in the last six weeks, Shrum said. Two  nights ago, a Zales Jeweler in the Cerritos Mall was robbed in a similar  fashion, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said, and others have occurred  since November in Torrance and Manhattan Beach.    In Orange County, three men escaped last Friday afternoon with $450,000 in  diamond jewelry from Black, Starr & Frost jewelers in South Coast Plaza.  Last month, two men were arrested for a robbery at another Best Products store  in Huntington Beach, and in the last two years, more than a dozen jewel  robberies were reported.    ""These people might have done this 25 times by the time they are caught,"" Shrum  said, adding that Los Angeles County police agencies have file photographs of  about 30 suspects arrested in jewel thefts, but that the charges against them  are often dropped because witnesses are unable to positively identify the  robbers.    Boozell said operators of the alleged criminal network hire thieves off the  streets in certain parts of Los Angeles. In most cases they hire men who wear  nondescript clothing and drive stolen cars, he said. ""It's like day workers who  hang out waiting for somebody to come by and hire them to do landscaping or  work construction,"" Boozell explained. ""Except these people do robberies. Most  don't know what job they are doing until 10 minutes before they do it.""    Agreed Shrum: ""They're subcontractors who get paid for doing a job and  delivering the take.""    Costa Mesa Police Detective Sgt. Ron Smith said authorities are investigating  the possibility that the suspects in the South Coast Plaza incident could be  the same as those in other robberies, or from the same ring of people.

By WENDY PAULSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SANTA ANA      A freeway chase from Huntington Beach to Compton ended with the arrests of  three men who allegedly robbed a department store jewelry counter at gunpoint,  the latest in a series of Southland jewel heists, police said Thursday.    And although Orange County police were tight-lipped about investigations of two  similar robberies in the last month, Los Angeles police said the incidents fit  a pattern of nearly 100 similar thefts in the western United States since 1989  that may stem from a criminal network in southwest Los Angeles County.

Five drug smugglers of this kind have been  arrested so far this year.    Half a Kilogram of Heroin    The latest arrived in Stockholm by ferry via Russia and  Finland. The Finnish police thought they knew what was going on,  but instead of arresting the Tanzanian, they shadowed him on the  trip to Sweden. When he reached Stockholm the Swedish police  took over.    The suspect took a taxi to a residential address in southern  Stockholm where a fellow countryman was waiting. At that point  the police moved in. It eventually turned out that the suspect  was indeed smuggling heroin. He was carrying about half a kg in  his stomach.    Traffic Gains New Momentum    Superintendent Lars-Erik Karlsson, chief of the narcotics  division in Stockholm, revealed that this African smuggling  activity started two summers ago. Since then around 40 couriers  have been caught when they came to the Nordic region. Last year  the traffic seemed to die down somewhat, but after the arrest of  five people in the first two months of this year alone, Karlsson  fears that a new wave is on the way.    The smuggling routes have varied. Some have come by plane,  others by boat. Karlsson is convinced that the smuggling is  organized. A common feature is that the drugs involved are brown  smokable heroin from Pakistan. Some of the couriers were loaded  up, as Karlsson puts it, in Africa while others swallowed their  smuggled cargo in Istanbul, Turkey.    Two Already Sentenced    Two of the five people who have been arrested so far this  year have already been sentenced. One, who smuggled in 587  grams, was sentenced to five years in jail plus lifetime  expulsion. The other, who was carrying a record 667 grams,  received a sentence of 5.5 years plus lifetime expulsion.     "

This  announcement was made unofficially yesterday.    Although the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic] did not publicize the appointment of the new director,  Lagunes Lopez held a long meeting yesterday with Jorge Tello  Peon, commissioner of the National Institute To Combat Drugs.  Upon its conclusion, he refused to make any statement.    The National Institute To Combat Drugs was created at the  president's proposal on 17 June of this year. Its purpose is to  curb drug use effectively, and to prevent Mexico from serving as  the site of drug production or trafficking.    The agency replaced the Drug Control Planning Center created  by the ex-attorney general, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, in June of  last year.    Commander Emilio Islas Rangel was named as Santibanez  Ramos's  substitute at Interpol of Mexico, an appointment made official  by the Attorney General's Office yesterday.    At the instruction of the attorney general of the republic,  Jorge Carpizo, the assistant attorney for local offices and  inspections, Mario Ruiz Massieu, administered the oath for the  Interpol post to Islas Rangel. He had previously served as  director of the PGR's Kidnapping Investigations Unit, a position  now to be filled by Juan Jose Valdemar Escalona.    A PGR communique states: ""Commander Islas Rangel's new  appointment is an acknowledgment of his considerable merits in  his previous position as director of the same institution's  Kidnapping Investigations Unit, where he achieved great success  in solving these crimes.""    Islas Rangel previously served as security chief for the  United States Ambassador to Mexico, and representative of the  Secretariat of Government in Guanajuato.    The PGR reported that he was also deputy director of  operations for the Judicial Police in Guanajuato, and  coordinator of the Federal District Judicial Police northern  zone.     "

""Party,"" it announced in letters scrawled above a drawing of beer  being poured into the gaping mouth of Garfield, the cartoon cat. ""Four kegs.""    The accompanying map, however, did not lead to a park or to a house of  teen-agers whose parents were out of town for the weekend. Instead, it led to a  dead-end street in a Fountain Valley industrial park, where high school  students set up beer kegs and blasting stereos in a fenced parking lot.    Such gatherings -- known as ""drop parties"" because organizers drop into an  industrial area and start partying -- are the latest twist in high school  drinking, according to police in several Orange County cities. Hundreds of  teen-agers flock to the gatherings, eager to pay an admission charge of $2 to  $5 to party beside deserted warehouses and office buildings.    ""I've never seen as many kids at a party as I did this particular evening.  There was an unbelievable amount of beer,"" said Huntington Beach Police Sgt.  Luis Ochoa, describing a recent drop party that drew about 900 people. ""The  street was blocked with kids and their cars, and the area was totally littered  with trash.""    Just this weekend, Huntington Beach police were hit by yet another drop party  -- this one at the fenced-in site of a tool manufacturing company in the  industrialized north end of the city.    This time, police were ready: Tipped off in advance about the party, patrol  units raided the area around 8 p.m. Saturday -- long before the beer blast was  to have hit its peak -- and arrested five juveniles who police said had cut  through gate locks on the Business Drive premises.    In a scene that local law enforcement officials say has become all too  familiar, the Huntington Beach police also confiscated alcohol from the many  carloads of youths that had flooded the area, and warned the estimated 200 to  300 party-goers to stay away from the site.    Though high school beer parties are hardly unusual, police say drop parties  pose problems beyond drinking and driving. It takes a lot of police officers to  persuade hundreds of tipsy teen-agers to leave a party scene peacefully, Ochoa  said.    There have been no drop party riots so far, Ochoa said, ""but the potential for  problems is much greater in these situations.""      Patrolling Industrial Parks    Police departments have responded by patrolling industrial parks on weekend  nights and by sometimes making arrests when they find the parties.    Fountain Valley police also had heard about the April 29 party advertised in  the flyer and arrested 28 young people, 20 of whom were younger than 18. The  adults were cited for trespassing.    Huntington Beach police, alerted to a March 31 drop party in the northwest part  of the city, sent undercover officers to infiltrate it. Seven people were  arrested, including 19-year-old James Burnett, believed to be the party's  organizer. Burnett was charged with six misdemeanor counts including  trespassing and providing alcohol to minors, Ochoa said, and the other six  arrested were turned over to juvenile authorities.    Police have broken up six or seven other drop parties in Huntington Beach this  year, he added.    In Santa Ana, police began being noticing drop parties about 3 years ago,  Police Department spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Police break up two or three  of the parties a year without arresting anyone, Thomas said. The last drop  party spotted by police was in early April, she said.      Younger Party-Goers    But unlike this year's drop parties in Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach,  Thomas said, Santa Ana's gatherings have been attended by college-age rather  than high school students.    Fountain Valley High School Principal Mike Kasler, whose staff told police  about the party flyer, said he is troubled by the increasing sophistication of  those who publicize and organize the parties.    ""You used to hear about things like this primarily at the college level,""  Kasler said. ""Now it's surfacing more and more at high schools.""    Authorities believe young people pay to party at industrial parks because the  parks are deserted after dark and far from homeowners, who are known to summon  police at the first shriek of a stereo.    But police say industrial parks also serve the interests of party organizers,  who post themselves at the parking lot gate to make sure everyone pays an  admission fee.    ""There was no need to trespass"" in a deserted industrial area, said Fountain  Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold. ""The only reason they needed the fenced area  was so they could charge. . . . The kids are the ones being set up, not just  for the loss of their money, but for their arrest.""    When Huntington Beach undercover officers arrested Burnett, he had about $450  in his pockets, Ochoa said. ""It's just a new gimmick to make money at someone  else's expense,"" Ochoa said of the drop parties.      Owners Pay Price    Among those who pay the price for the parties are the owners of the party  sites. A drop party organizer in Huntington Beach decided the fenced parking  lot of Kingston Machine Tool Manufacturing was the perfect place to gather,  leaving owner Stan Lin with the trash from four drop parties in the last 3  months.    ""It was a mess,"" Lin said. ""Cups, papers, beer bottles all over the place.""    Drop party organizers repeatedly cut the lock on Lin's gate, and Burnett even  told police he had Lin's permission to hold a party there, Ochoa said.    Company employees cleaned up after the first three parties, then Huntington  Beach police sent officers to infiltrate the fourth, Lin said. And the city  sent a five-person crew to clean up afterward, Lin said. The drop parties  stopped after the arrests.

So, before police stormed  the Sylmar warehouse that in September yielded the biggest drug bust in  history, they turned to the best nose in town.    It just happened to be dark and moist and attached to the snout of Dandy Vom  Sargau, a graying, 9-year-old German shepherd who works nights for the Monrovia  Police Department.    When the dog was asked to sniff a tattered cardboard box that had been  discovered outside the warehouse, he exploded in a snarling fury that police  said could only mean he had detected a trace of narcotics.    ""One of the officers knew that Monrovia had a great dog,"" said Drug Enforcement  Administration spokesman Ralph Lochridge. ""His alert on that box was a part of  the overall probable cause that led to the search warrant.""    While another well-trained hound probably could have also followed his nose to  the same conclusion, those who know Dandy say that his experience and  consistency have made him top dog in the drug-sniffing department.    Virtually every San Gabriel Valley law enforcement agency -- even those with  their own canine units -- have asked Dandy for help. He has also performed  searches for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department, California Highway Patrol, the Postal Service, Secret Service and  FBI.    ""I don't think he's ever made a mistake,"" said Jake Jahelka of Canine K-9  Scents Inc., whose academy in Canyon Country has provided narcotics training  for Dandy and about 50 other dogs in police departments across the western  United States. ""His heart and intensity stand way out.""    For the 85-pound shepherd, who understands commands only in German, it is all  just one big game.    In his youth, Dandy was trained to search for a terry-cloth towel that officers  would lace with the scent of cocaine, heroin or marijuana. When he found the  towel, it was his to chew on.    Now, when he is asked to find the real thing, the dog thinks it's another  version of hide-the-towel, says his handler, Monrovia Police Officer Rick  Miglia.    In his six years of duty -- which will end in January when the dog retires --  Dandy has played the game at least 450 times, leading to seizures of cash and  narcotics valued at more than $1 billion, Miglia said. The Sylmar bust alone is  expected to earn the Monrovia department $55,000 as its cut of the drug cash  that was seized.    ""He thinks it's fun,"" said Miglia, a 10-year veteran. ""He doesn't know what  coke or heroin or marijuana is. All he knows is that towel.""    Not that his training hasn't had its rigors. Dandy isn't allowed to eat  anything other than the dry dog food Miglia feeds him, a rule that helped keep  him under control when he was once asked to search a meat market.    Sex is strictly prohibited, thus limiting distractions in the event that a  female dog in heat should cross his path while on the job.    ""I'm in awe when I watch him work,"" said Monrovia Police Officer Scott Wiese,  who handles Deister Vom Derbickelwiese, the department's other police dog. ""It  just freaks me out; he's so smart.""    Back in 1982, when Dandy was just a pup in his native West Germany, the Kiwanis  Club of Monrovia launched a fund-raising drive to bring a canine patrol to  their small city east of Los Angeles.    A local junkyard chipped in, a restaurant held a benefit dinner, and dozens of  five-gallon water bottles at businesses around town were filled with the spare  change of shoppers.    The $20,000 raised was enough to purchase Dandy and a canine partner, Arko, who  retired a year ago after putting the bite on a rapist.    Despite such occasional incidents, the dogs are not vicious, their handlers  say. They merely respond to the aggressiveness of the suspect, and then only  when given a command to attack.    Miglia, who takes Dandy home with him every day and will get to keep him when  the dog retires, describes Dandy as a hard-working, well-mannered animal --  even if he does occasionally slobber on the windshield of their patrol car.

The title-conferring ceremony was presided over by Zhou  Qishun, vice chairman of the autonomous regional committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and  secretary of the party committee of the autonomous regional  public security department.    Guo Jinlong, Yang Chuantang, and Gyamco, leaders of the  autonomous region; leaders of the TRPAPC; and principal leaders  of the Tibet-based units at and above the regimental level  participated in the ceremony.    Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional people's  government, read out a promotion order signed by State Council  Premier Li Peng and Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang  Zemin, and delivered a speech on behalf of the autonomous  regional party committee and the autonomous regional people's  government.    Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said that Comrade Zhang Zhu's  promotion to the police title of major general was an honor not  only to himself but also to the TRPAPC. On behalf of the  autonomous regional party committee and the autonomous regional  people's government, he offered warm congratulations to Comrade  Zhang Zhu.    In his speech Chairman Gyaincain Norbu spoke highly of  Political Commissar Zhang Zhu as well as all the officers and  men of the TRPAPC. He said: As a political commissar of the  TRPAPC and as a leader of units construction, Comrade Zhang Zhu  resolutely implemented the party's line, principles, and  policies; carried out various instructions and orders issued by  the TRPAPC and the regional party committee; always placed the  units under the absolute leadership of the party; united and led  members of the party committee to vigorously tackle various  construction jobs of the units; and did an outstanding job  fulfilling the various tasks entrusted by the party and people.  In particular, in the struggle to quell the riots in Lhasa and  to stabilize Tibet's situation, Comrade Zhang Zhu led all the  officers and men in taking a clear-cut stand, standing in the  forefront of the fight against splittism, and waging a resolute  struggle against splittist forces, thereby making remarkable  contributions to safeguarding the unification of the motherland  and to stabilizing Tibet's situation. The autonomous regional  party committee, the autonomous regional people's government,  and the people of all nationalities in Tibet are satisfied with  the work done by the TRPAPC and Comrade Zhang Zhu. He urged  Comrade Zhang Zhu to live up to the ardent expectations of the  party and people, to turn honor into a driving force, to better  unite and lead all the officers and men of the TRPAPC to conduct  intensive study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to seek unity of thinking  among officers and men, and to persist in using Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period to guide  the construction of the units so as to make new contributions to  protecting Tibet's economic construction, reform, and opening  up.

Chawalit said after meeting with other senior officials  concerned that the U.S. government had only provided a copy of  its indictment against Thanong. That was not sufficient to  prosecute a case before a Thai court, he said.    At the meeting with Chawalit were Deputy Permanent Secretary  Ari Wong-araya, Interior Ministry legal adviser Chailoet  Ditsamnat, national Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop, Deputy  Police Chief Pol Gen Phot Bunyachinda, Assistant Police Chief  Thanu Homhuan and Chawalit's personal secretary, Sonchai  Montriwat.    ""The copy of the U.S. indictment cannot alone be used as  evidence to substantiate drug allegations against Thanong. The  police cannot do anything at present,"" Chawalit said.    The minister has ordered Prathin to ask the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) for more details relating to the charges.    Chawalit also said he wants more information from Washington  about Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's revelation that 17  other Thai MP's stand accused by the U.S. of being involved in  drug trafficking.    Chawalit has ordered the Office of Narcotics Control Board  to  gather evidence related to the Thanong issue. Prathin said he  is awaiting additional information from the Foreign Ministry.    Asked to confirm a Chat Thai Party statement that Thanong  faces only six months in jail if convicted here of drug  trafficking, Chawalit said he does not know the penalty involved.    Given adequate evidence, Prathin said, Thanong would not  escape prosecution on any drug charges just because of his  stature or influence.    Attorney General Ophat Arunin said yesterday the government  should decide quickly whether to extradite Chat Thai MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong to face drug trafficking charges in the United  States.    Ophat will testify today before the House committee on  parliamentary affairs which is investigating the issue. He  would infomm the committee of all information he received from  U.S. officials.

0,FT932-10516 ,"FT932-10516 _AN-DEIATAA6FT 930508   FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Police believe trial sabotage was planned      By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent   THE POSSIBILITY that a serious attempt to bribe the judge in charge of the trial of Mr Asil Nadir was ever contemplated was again dismissed yesterday by informed sources. However, police investigating the original theories of a Pounds 3.5m 'slush fund' to bribe Mr Justice Tucker believe that some attempt was planned to sabotage the trial of the Polly Peck chairman. The investigation began last October after police obtained a copy of a document relating to the apparent payment of Pounds 3.5m by an acquaintance of Mr Nadir into a bank account. That acquaintance is in northern Cyprus. Mr Nadir was initially suspected of involvement in the apparent plan. However, although he was re-arrested and questioned about the alleged payment, no evidence linking him to it was ever discovered. Doubts remain about whether the copy is of a genuine document or a forgery designed to mislead. Exactly what was intended - and who was behind it - remains unknown. The Metropolitan police said yesterday that the investigation by its International and Organised Crime Squad into the apparent payment was continuing. However, it is widely believed that the inquiries have effectively finished and that charges are highly unlikely. Police suspected the payment could have been part of an attempt to influence the course of Mr Nadir's trial, although they dismiss any suggestion that the apparent payment was to be used to bribe Mr Justice Tucker. He was never subject to any illegal approach and has remained the trial judge throughout. It is generally believed that the copy of the document referring to the payment was intended to destabilise Mr Nadir's trial in some way - but how, to what purpose and to whose benefit remains uncertain. Had such allegations surfaced once Mr Nadir's trial had started, the legal proceedings would undoubtedly be thrown into considerable confusion.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Los Angeles police reported Friday that wearers of pricey Rolex watches fell  victim to robbery at the rate of one each day during August and warned that the  thieves may be carefully studying the daily routines of their intended victims.    Police said the crimes follow a familiar pattern in which thieves target those  who wear the most expensive Rolex timepieces -- preferably top-of-the-line  models such as the President, which sells for $10,000 and more.    ""There are several cases in which, clearly, the robbers knew a lot about their  victims,"" Wilshire Division Police Detective Aaron Martin said. ""Victims who  wear Rolex Presidents have been approached on days when they happened to have  left their watches at home. They were asked to give up watches they weren't  wearing.""    Police on Friday also released composite sketches of two suspects in a recent  killing in West Los Angeles that occurred during a Rolex robbery attempt.    Detectives are looking for two men who went to a popular nursery on La Cienega  Boulevard and shot owner Donald McKinsey after he fended off the would-be  robbers' attempts to wrest away his $13,000 Rolex President.    According to the detectives, the men had gone to the nursery the day before the  Aug. 3 shooting and told employees that they had an appointment with the owner.  Employees told the men that they were not scheduled to meet McKinsey and that  the owner was unavailable.    The gunmen returned on Aug. 3 and met McKinsey in a secluded part of the  nursery, police said. While discussing a floral wedding arrangement, the men  attempted to take McKinsey's Rolex, then fired on the owner. Fatally wounded,  McKinsey reportedly staggered toward his office and collapsed, still clutching  his watch. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.    On Friday, police also announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to  the capture of the killers, who fled the shooting scene in a yellow Lincoln  Town Car.    Five other Rolex robberies were reported in the Wilshire Division area this  month. Authorities in Hollywood, West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Beverly  Hills also reported multiple watch thefts in August. This year, there have been  three murders connected with the Rolex robberies.    While detectives were careful not to advise against purchasing expensive  watches, they warned of the violence that the watches can attract.    ""We are not in the position to recommend what kind of jewelry people can wear  or not wear,"" Martin said. ""The issue that has been raised is that (potential)  victims need to decide how important it is to wear that watch.""    Detectives said the watches have been a symbol of luxury for years, and it is  difficult to isolate what has spurred the recent wave of thefts. The relative  ease with which stolen Rolexes are resold may be one explanation, police said.    ""There is so much demand from legitimate citizens who want to pay half-price  for used watches,"" Wilshire Division Detective John McCarley said. ""As long as  there is a demand, there will be a supply.""    McCarley said a stolen watch with an original retail price of $10,000 is  typically resold for about $2,000.    ""Let's be honest . . . they are nice watches,"" Martin said.

Detectives are looking for two men who went to a popular nursery on La Cienega  Boulevard and shot owner Donald McKinsey after he fended off the would-be  robbers' attempts to wrest away his $13,000 Rolex President.    According to the detectives, the men had gone to the nursery the day before the  Aug. 3 shooting and told employees that they had an appointment with the owner.  Employees told the men that they were not scheduled to meet McKinsey and that  the owner was unavailable.    The gunmen returned on Aug. 3 and met McKinsey in a secluded part of the  nursery, police said. While discussing a floral wedding arrangement, the men  attempted to take McKinsey's Rolex, then fired on the owner. Fatally wounded,  McKinsey reportedly staggered toward his office and collapsed, still clutching  his watch. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.    On Friday, police also announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to  the capture of the killers, who fled the shooting scene in a yellow Lincoln  Town Car.    Five other Rolex robberies were reported in the Wilshire Division area this  month. Authorities in Hollywood, West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Beverly  Hills also reported multiple watch thefts in August. This year, there have been  three murders connected with the Rolex robberies.    While detectives were careful not to advise against purchasing expensive  watches, they warned of the violence that the watches can attract.    ""We are not in the position to recommend what kind of jewelry people can wear  or not wear,"" Martin said. ""The issue that has been raised is that (potential)  victims need to decide how important it is to wear that watch.""    Detectives said the watches have been a symbol of luxury for years, and it is  difficult to isolate what has spurred the recent wave of thefts. The relative  ease with which stolen Rolexes are resold may be one explanation, police said.    ""There is so much demand from legitimate citizens who want to pay half-price  for used watches,"" Wilshire Division Detective John McCarley said. ""As long as  there is a demand, there will be a supply.""    McCarley said a stolen watch with an original retail price of $10,000 is  typically resold for about $2,000.    ""Let's be honest . . . they are nice watches,"" Martin said.

0,FT941-4429 ,"FT941-4429 _AN-ECKD9AB6FT 940311   FT  11 MAR 94 / Pilots' union hits out at Heathrow closure delay      By MOTOKO RICH   Balpa, the pilots' union, yesterday demanded a full-scale inquiry into why there was a 40-minute delay in closing the northern runway of London's Heathrow airport after Wednesday's mortar-bomb attack. The IRA yesterday admitted responsibility for the mortars, fired from the car-park of the Excelsior Hotel, as police and BAA, which owns the airport, launched a review of security and evacuation procedures. Mr Chris Darke, general secretary of Balpa, said he was 'alarmed' that 24 aircraft took off during that time. 'It is intolerable that this incident put the lives of pilots, their flight and cabin crews and their passengers at risk,' he said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon and Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, defended the police decision to keep the runway open. They refused to discuss the nature and extent of the investigation into security procedures. Commander Tucker said the decision to keep the runway open was made in consultation between the police and BAA, based on an assessment of the probable direction of the mortar bombs and the fact that at the time of the car-park fire police had received no reports on impacts of any of the mortars. Police heard first reports of a fire in the Excelsior car-park just before 6pm, less than an hour after six coded messages warning of bombs at Heathrow were received. Within 10 minutes of the fire, police discovered the Nissan Micra car from which the devices were fired. After the runway was cleared, police found two mortars on it and two more nearby. Police said they did not know why none of the mortars detonated. The mortars, which travelled 700 yards from the car-park, did not land on the part of the runway normally used by aircraft. Commander Tucker said 'there was no danger at any time of an aircraft running over the debris before the runway was closed'. Commander Tucker said IRA warning calls tended to be 'dishonest', and there was a danger that if police had evacuated the runway sooner up to 20,000 people may have been in the Excelsior car-park when the car carrying the mortars exploded. The commissioner said: 'We all share the responsibility for risk assessment. We can minimise risk but we can never totally neutralise it.' Mr Mike Roberts, managing director of Heathrow airport, supported the decision not to close the runway immediately. He said: 'Safety and security are our highest priority, I can assure you. When entering into the decision-making process we take advice from the police and take a decision to make sure everything is safe.' Police said the airport was fully operational by 9.30am yesterday.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4581 Airports, Flying Fields, and Services.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

In the sprawling city within a city that is one of Southern California's  largest shopping malls, the typical bad guys are shoplifters, credit card  hucksters and the occasional smooth-talking jewelry thief. Police officers  patrolling the mall know that figuring out a crime has occurred is half the  battle.    So when two robbery suspects tried to lose themselves in the mall last week  after leading police from three departments on a 45-minute, high-speed chase  from Long Beach, the chain of events they set off was more than a bit unusual.      Routine Patrol Interrupted    Glendale Police Officers Stephan Poulter and William Maupin were walking their  routine patrol in the mall when an excited man approached them Aug. 9, alerting  them that two men were wandering the mall carrying a large plastic trash bag.  The bag, the man said, was filled with cash.    When Poulter and Maupin caught up to the pair, the men took off at a run and  the officers dashed after them. Poulter, a marathon runner, caught one suspect  as he tried to slip out a mall entrance. He pushed the suspect to the ground  and drew his baton, according to a police report.    The other suspect, standing behind Poulter, drew a .38-caliber pistol, pushed  it against Poulter's ribs and ordered Poulter to freeze, according to the  report.    With a reaction he later said was almost purely reflex, Poulter knocked the  pistol out of the suspect's hands as Maupin rushed in and helped Poulter  apprehend both men.      Robbery Suspects    The officers arrested Michael Bourne, 21, of Long Beach and Miguel Gigliano,  21, of Alhambra, on suspicion of committing a robbery in Long Beach. Poulter  and Maupin said they were unaware that outside, helicopters were circling,  police and sheriff's cars had surrounded the mall and a crowd of 300 had  gathered.    ""Wednesday was the Super Bowl here,"" Poulter said. ""We didn't know we were  invited to play.""    The high-profile arrest has thrown a spotlight this week on the seven-person  Glendale Police Department substation in the Glendale Galleria. But usually,  the police who patrol the Galleria work more quietly, tracking crimes they say  are intriguing but hardly the stuff of police drama.    ""By its very nature, retail crime is hard to identify because it looks  innocent,"" said Sgt. Mark Distaso, the station's commander. ""Nobody's getting  beaten up, nobody's getting held up with a gun, there's no purse snatched, but  that credit card that's just been used to buy $1,000 worth of stuff might not  be good. You just don't know.""    The substation, established in 1982, was the first permanent police station in  a mall in Southern California. The station, a small wood-paneled office near a  mall entrance, has a small-town sheriff's station feel. And the officers  assigned there say they function as the police force for a small, enclosed  city, where making people feel safe is almost as important as actually catching  thieves.      120 Arrests a Month    That is not to say the substation is not busy. The police in the mall make  about 120 arrests a month, and shopping center thefts total between $7 million  and $14 million annually, said Distaso, who has been in charge of the  substation for 18 months. With an average of 16,000 people visiting the  Galleria's 169 stores daily, at least a few end up being booked at the  substation and held in its cells each week, Distaso said.    In addition to the police substation, the Galleria maintains its own security  force. But the mall's security officers are not armed and do not have arrest  powers. Security officers patrol parking structures to watch for car break-ins  and walk the corridors of the mall to discourage shoplifting, Distaso said.      Donated Space    The Galleria substation operates on a $500,000 yearly budget. The mall's owners  donated the office space and designed and furnished the station. The Glendale  Police Department built three temporary holding cells and supplied the station  with office equipment, including sophisticated computers used to track criminal  records of suspects almost instantly.    But much of the time, police in the Galleria investigate misdemeanors. The  Glendale Galleria is one of the safest malls in the Los Angeles area, Distaso  said. So far this year, only two people have been arrested there on suspicion  of robbery. No one has ever been murdered in the mall and aggravated assaults  are rare, Distaso said.    In the absence of violent crime, police who work in the Galleria spend much of  their time fielding questions from lost shoppers and concerned shopkeepers,  running crime prevention seminars for store owners, and roaming the mall's 30  acres in plainclothes and in uniform watching for suspicious people.      8 Years Ago    The substation had its genesis in discussions eight years ago between the  Galleria management and the city of Glendale, said Sgt. Dean Durand, the  substation's first commanding officer who is now the spokesman for the Glendale  Police Department.    Merchants in the Galleria requested a stronger police presence in the mall, but  Distaso said that was almost impossible to provide without a permanent office  in the mall itself. By the time Glendale police responded to a call from inside  the Galleria, parked and found the store they were looking for, suspected  criminals were invariably long gone, Distaso said.    In contrast, the average response time to crimes in the Galleria now is 30  seconds, Distaso said. ""You're not going to beat that anywhere,"" he said.    Occasionally, the small crimes that are a part of Galleria life are found to be  part of a larger pattern.    For example, three men were arrested last year on suspicion of retail burglary  after they stole $2,600 in clothing from a Galleria store. The thieves were  part of a Colombian ring that had been under investigation by a Los Angeles  Police Department task force for months.      Men Followed to Freeway    In October, a plainclothes officer noticed two suspicious-acting men browsing  in a jewelry store. The officers did not see the men commit a crime, but,  acting on a hunch, officers from the substation followed the men until they got  on the freeway.    The next day, the jewelry store's manager reported that $13,000 worth of  jewelry was missing. Using information and descriptions gathered during the  previous day's surveillance, Glendale police sent squad cars to the same  freeway on-ramp used by the men. The suspects took the same route they had  taken the day before. Now they are in state prison serving sentences for  robbery.    Mall crime, at times, is ""like putting your hand into a black hole,"" Poulter  said. ""You have no idea how far you'll go. You may arrest the guy for petty  theft, and it turns out the guy is wanted for murder in Wisconsin. We run into  a very sophisticated type of criminal here.""    Police encountered just such a criminal one recent Friday, when the Disney  Store reported that a customer had left the store wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt  that clerks were sure he was stealing.    Working from the substation, Distaso used a hand-held radio to dispatch a  plainclothes officer to follow the man and a uniformed officer to back up the  surveillance.    Murmuring into radios in clipped, excited voices that at times seemed almost  silly, the officers kept in contact while the man wandered in and out of  several stores. The police officers followed the man up escalators and down an  elevator as Distaso fired questions at Disney Store clerks over the phone.      'Strings Hanging Out'    ""His shirt is newly creased. I can see the strings hanging out,"" came the voice  of the plainclothes detective over the radio.    ""He's at the sale rack. He's picking up a pair of shoes,"" came another voice in  a conspiratorial tone worthy of James Bond.    When the man reached his car, police officers appeared suddenly as Distaso  questioned him about the shirt.    The attention to the shoplifter seemed almost comical -- until police started  asking questions.    The man's driver's license was suspended. He was carrying plane tickets to  Medallin, Colombia, a drug-trade hot spot. A search of his car found two other  driver's licenses, both with the man's picture, but bearing different names. A  beeper inside the glove compartment was keyed to multiple phone numbers.    Distaso called the Glendale Police Department's narcotics squad. They knew the  man. They had found a kilo of cocaine in his house last year.      Photo, Officers Stephan Poulter, left, and Maurice Bunzey patrol Glendale  Galleria on a busy day. Below, Sgt.

The Arhus police four months ago arrested three  Egyptians and charged them with attempted arson and purchasing  chemicals for fabricating bombs. [see item 94WT0004B in 7  January Terrorism Report] In searching their residence, the  police found telephone lists with names and addresses of some of  those charged with attempted murder in the United States.    ""Therefore, we asked the FBI for help in clearing up our  case. FBI colleagues have been in Denmark, and we have developed  information.

He confirmed,  however, that those being held in Arhus and those charged in the  U.S. bombing attack are members of the same Islamic  fundamentalist organization.    According to the deputy police chief, there is nothing to  indicate that the individuals being held in Arhus were in New  York when the bomb exploded in the WTC basement.    Nor have U.S. authorities requested that the jailed  individuals be handed over for prosecution in the United States.    Two of those charged in Arhus -- ages 30 and 36 -- are  asylum-seekers, while the third, a 41-year-old man, has  permanent residence in Denmark after having lived here for 10  years. The two asylum-seekers have told Danish authorities they  are applying for asylum in Denmark because they are being sought  in Egypt.     "

0," LA042889-0096   50031    April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition      View; Part 5; Page 1; Column 1; View Desk      3336 words      A GAY OFFICER'S LONELY PATROL;    FORMER POLICEMAN MITCHELL GROBESON'S SUIT AGAINST LAPD RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT  WHAT MAKES A GOOD COP      By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer      In the summer of 1985, police officer Mitchell Grobeson responded to a silent  alarm at a jewelry store on Sunset Boulevard.    Normally, black-and-whites would converge from all over the Rampart division to  back up an officer answering a reported robbery in progress, Grobeson said. But  that day, despite the dispatcher's repeated pleas, no one showed.    At the Los Angeles Police Academy four years earlier, Grobeson's fellow cadets  had elected him class president. Now he stood alone, crouched in the street  behind his squad car with his shotgun aimed across the hood, wondering why an  entire watch was disregarding the cardinal rule of police work: Back up your  brother officer.    At least that's how Grobeson tells the story, and he's been telling it often in  the last few months.      One of the Best    Because of that and similar alleged incidents, Grobeson, by all objective  criteria one of the best officers on the force, resigned from the Police  Department on June 13, 1988. On Sept. 28, he filed a 22-claim lawsuit against  the city of Los Angeles, Police Chief Daryl Gates, the Los Angeles Police  Commission, 15 named police officers and 100 John Doe officers, charging that  they effectively forced him to resign from the force because he was suspected  of being homosexual.    With the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and law enforcement agencies  nationwide under pressure to recruit gay officers, Grobeson's story is stirring  up considerable interest in the homosexual community.    But his story goes beyond one group's concerns about the issue of how  thoroughly a police agency represents the diversity of the community it  protects; even those who don't believe his charges are likely to find  themselves pondering more basic concerns, such as, ""What makes a good police  officer?"" and ""What makes a good police force?""    The Police Department and Police Commission refer all questions about  Grobeson's suit to the City Attorney's office. In its written response to what  Grobeson said is the first suit of its kind, the office argued that his claims  are unfounded or are stated so vaguely that a response requires more  information.    ""Let me be frank,"" Deputy City Atty. Arthur Walsh said this week. ""The city and  the Police Department don't like this lawsuit. We don't have a policy of  discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation -- as a  matter of fact there are city laws and ordinances (mandating) directly the  opposite.    ""We don't think (Grobeson's claims of systematic harassment and endangerment)  took place, and we'd like to do something to make Mr. Grobeson, who was a good  cop, feel better about the treatment he received when he was a police officer.  On the other hand, we're not about to give away millions of dollars of city  money.    "". . . The city's position has been that we didn't do the things Mr. Grobeson  said. If we did, if it can be established that there was an official policy,  albeit a secret one, there will be some serious changes made throughout the  Police Department and city government,"" Walsh said. "". . . If it turns out that  individual members in fact acted inappropriately toward Mr. Grobeson or anyone  else, disciplinary measures will be taken.""    Grobeson says he's heard that before.    Ten months after he turned in his badge, Grobeson still looks and acts like a  television cop. His posture exudes confidence. His voice projects authority --  even as he tells audiences that he still is being ""harassed"" by Police  Department internal affairs investigators and that he fears his lawsuit may  have put his life in danger.    A moment later, though, he sounds more like a police recruiter than a  dissident.    Police officers, he says, are the only real altruists.    ""When it comes down to it, there's only one class of people that risk their  lives to help others. . . . There's only one profession that truly saves lives.  That's police work.    ""And LAPD,"" he maintains, ""is the finest force in the country.""    Grobeson doesn't recall playing cops 'n' robbers much as a kid. But he did know  early on that he wanted to help people, he said. When he got the chance at age  15 to join the first Explorer Scout Law Enforcement unit in his hometown of  Culver City, he signed up.    Not that he was lacking in activities.    ""I kind of broke all the records in high school,"" he said, rattling off an  adolescent vita worth a million Brownie points.    Twice he was elected student body president at Culver City High. He edited the  school newspaper, wrestled on the junior varsity team, served on the YMCA  board; he was appointed to a seat on the Culver City Board of Education; and he  pressed for and received a student seat on the Culver City human relations  commission.    ""I graduated with more honors than any other person,"" he said with his standard  ""just the facts, ma'am"" delivery.    At Chapman College, he earned a degree in criminal justice, graduating ""with  more honors than anyone -- at least with more honors than anyone I knew.""    His father drove a catering truck. His mother was an executive secretary, and  Grobeson worked to help support himself from age 15 as a camp counselor, a meat  cutter, a stock boy, a security guard at Bullock's, and an appliance salesman  at J.C. Penney.    Given that schedule, he never had time to socialize, let alone date; in  retrospect, he thinks his hyper-achieving was in part a smoke screen to  distract his peers -- and himself -- from his growing uncertainty about his  sexuality.    From age 8, Grobeson knew he was ""physically and emotionally"" attracted to men.  It didn't take an anthropologist, though, to know such attractions were taboo.    So Grobeson kept his feelings buried.    For years, he figured they would go away. By high school, though, he began to  suspect otherwise. So he worked even harder in other areas of his life.    On Sept. 9, 1981, he arrived for his first day at the Police Academy with a new  haircut and a new suit. Immediately, instructors ordered the cadets to drop to  the floor and do push-ups for an hour.    It bothered Grobeson that cadets ""were treated like dirt,"" but he decided, ""I'm  going to beat them at their own game."" And when he graduated as the ""honor  cadet,"" with the highest scores overall, Chief Gates shook his hand and  presented him with awards in academics, physical fitness, self-defense and  shooting.    To top things off, Grobeson put on the academy graduation dance at the  California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey. ""The guy who puts on the dance doesn't  need to have a date,"" he said.    No one suspected he was gay, and, in fact, ""I didn't have any gay identity  yet,"" he said. ""So outside of being lonely, it wasn't awkward for me.""    Grobeson had his first sexual experience after he left the academy, he said.  But there was nothing in the way he lived to draw attention to his sexuality,  he said.    ""I gave up my social life to be the best police officer I could. . . . I know  you're supposed to have a life that's separate (from your work). I'm just not  sure I did.""    Digging though a cardboard box filled with Lions Club and YMCA awards and  stacks of documents about his career, Grobeson pulled out a letter of  commendation from his probationary year in Central Division, which covers some  of the city's meanest streets, from Skid Row to the corridors of City Hall.    Dated Jan. 24, 1983, the letter describes how he and another officer responded  to a call about an assault with a deadly weapon in a downtown apartment. A man  had gone on a rampage with a steak knife, slashing and stabbing his 5-year-old  child and an infant.    As his partner drove to the hospital, Grobeson placed his notebook on the  baby's bloody chest and began two-finger CPR. According to the commendation,  signed by a deputy chief, ""throughout the Code Three run to the hospital,  Grobeson cuddled the wounded child and continued artificial respiration."" The  child died at the hospital. But the letter commended both officers for their  compassion.    Like most new officers, Grobeson was unprepared for his sudden exposure to the  full spectrum of human behavior. He sensed the protective layers of cynicism  building. But an old training officer at Central showed him the wisdom in  treating everyone ""as if they were a member of your family,"" he said.    That approach served Grobeson well. In late '84, he was promoted to training  officer himself, and was to transfer to the Rampart Station, which oversees Los  Angeles' Silver Lake district.    Just before his transfer, he was stopped in West Hollywood by a Los Angeles  County Sheriff's sergeant. Because he was with another man in a predominantly  gay area, the sergeant assumed they were lovers, Grobeson said.    Discovering a police ID, he immediately called the Police Department. Grobeson  said he remembers the sergeant's message well: ""Send a supervisor, your man's a  fruit.""    In the next days, Grobeson charges in his suit, officer J. J. Williams at  Pacific division called officers at Rampart and told them ""a faggot"" was  transferring in. Sgt. Jake DeLeon then announced that accusation to the entire  Rampart watch, Grobeson said -- charges that both officers deny in a response  filed by the City Attorney's office.    Grobeson said that when he arrived at Rampart, a supervisor took him aside in a  police car and asked him if he were gay. Grobeson said no, to which the  supervisor reportedly replied: ""Good. Because there are two types of people who  can't do the job -- gays and women. They're too emotional.""    ""The macho mystique of cops has never appealed to me,"" Grobeson said. ""I think  it's probably the greatest problem that the Los Angeles Police Department has  going against it. . . . If you're macho, you're not supposed to have feelings,  and if you don't have feelings, you can't empathize -- with criminals, victims  or the community you're hired to serve.""    Which is not to say that Grobeson doesn't have a Dirty Harry streak, as  revealed when he recently spun his favorite war story -- with more than a touch  of melodrama -- to a gay and lesbian student group at California State  University, Northridge.    A Latino gang called Aztlan had, in effect, been holding hostage an apartment  building in Rampart division, he said. The gang was so brazen, its leaders  placed a placard over the building and signed their names to it.      No Partners    By then, Grobeson said, he was having a difficult time finding partners, so he  took it upon himself to rout the gang. ""Every day I'd go put a new one in jail,  a new one in jail, until finally . . . I got the leader.""    He climbed a ladder and took down the sign. As he walked through the building  courtyard, a mother with two young children stepped out of her apartment for  ""the first time ever,"" and thanked him: ""Gracias, official.""    Even as that gang bust was unfolding, though, word continued to circulate among  officers at the Rampart station that a homosexual was in their midst. Few  suspected him at first, because they knew he was a sharpshooter, which would  have been impossible for ""someone with a limp wrist,"" he said sarcastically.    But slowly the station house graffiti began to focus on Grobeson; it followed  him as he was promoted and transferred to other stations.    Someone glued his locker shut. Someone taped a picture of Rock Hudson to it,  with the inscription ""To Mitch -- Love, Rock Baby."" He received a package  marked ""AIDS Survival Kit,"" and someone wrote ""BEWARE"" in the dust on his squad  car. Moreover, Grobeson contends in his suit, several supervisors encouraged  the harassment.    His problems intensified in summer 1985, when he decided to break the legendary  police ""code of silence"" after a confrontation between police and a crowd of  revelers at an outdoor fair.    An officer had clubbed unconscious a man involved in a fight, and a near-riot  resulted, Grobeson said. He chose to testify to internal affairs investigators,  he said, because he believes in telling the truth and because as an instructor  in baton technique, he felt that the officer's repeated ""head shots"" could have  killed the suspect.    But the main reason he testified is because he watched the accused officer ""get  so caught up in his emotions, that he risked the lives of his fellow officers.  The point wasn't to burn him. He endangered the lives of his fellow officers by  turning the crowd on us. . . .    ""There are people who became police officers because they like bullying people,  beating up on people,"" Grobeson said. ""The good cops became cops because they  care about people.""    But skewed notions of machismo have engendered a process for selecting law  officers that systematically eliminates a whole segment of the population --  including some who are drawn to police work for all the right reasons, Grobeson  said.    Los Angeles Police Department candidates, for instance, must take the Minnesota  Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory test, which he and gay activists contend is  designed to rate people on a scale of heterosexuality and homosexuality based  on antiquated notions of masculinity and femininity.    Grobeson took the test in college, and ""I didn't come out as high as I would  have liked in the masculine categories,"" he said. ""Consequently, when I took it  for the Police Department, when there came a question like, 'Do you want to be  a florist?' I answered no. . . . Literally, the way they eliminate people who  are homosexual is by eliminating people who want to be florists.""    When answers are suspicious or when candidates raise suspicions about sexual  orientation during the background investigation, the department invariably  finds an unrelated reason to reject them, Grobeson charges.      No Open Homosexuals    The result, he said, is that there is not a single openly gay or lesbian  officer among the 7,000 officers in Los Angeles department, nor is there one  among the 20,000 peace officers in more than 100 Southern California agencies.    ""To the best of my knowledge . . there is not an openly gay (officer) on the  force, and as a matter of sheer statistics, there certainly must be a  significantly large number of them,"" said Walsh of the City Attorney's office.  ""Why they choose not to be open is another matter. Whether it is because of  fear of the treatment they would receive, as Mr. Grobeson seems to think, or  simply because they wish to keep it as part of their personal life and not  advertise it, I don't know.""    Grobeson said gays and lesbians hide their identities for one reason: ""They  live in absolute fear for their lives and careers."" And anyone who is found  out, he said, is driven from the force.    He decided that wouldn't happen to him. But things ""got worse and worse every  day."" At one station, officers posted his photo with the caption: ""Would you  buy a used (sexual device) from this man?"" Someone put up a sign reading  ""Faggot Get Out!"" at another, he said. And more than once he found himself  chasing bad guys with the supposed good guys refusing to back him up, he said.    For a while, ""I considered eating my gun,"" he said. But finally, ""I decided  this is completely wrong, and started documenting the harassment.""    In 1986, Grobeson transferred back to the Pacific division, where he was put in  charge of a controversial effort to address the Venice Beach homeless problem.  As the situation improved, Grobeson began showing up on national telecasts and  in newspaper stories. Commendations and more than 100 citizen letters poured  in.    In one case, lawyer Stephen Yagman, the police gadfly who recently won a  judgment against Chief Gates, witnessed an arrest Grobeson and other officers  made on the Venice boardwalk and wrote a rare letter of praise. The letter is  in Grobeson's file, with a note from Gates: ""You have impressed the  unimpressible.""    But even as the praise rolled in, Grobeson alleges, several officers,  encouraged by supervisors, stepped up efforts to undermine his ""perfect  package.""    In 1987, a habitue of the Venice Beach drug scene filed a complaint against  him. A letter signed by Capt. Vance Proctor states that on Nov. 12, 1987,  Grobeson ""failed to take appropriate action"" in detaining the suspect and he  caused him ""to partially disrobe.""    Grobeson denied the charges and demanded that the case go to a trial board. At  the trial, his accuser testified under oath that eight officers had told him  Grobeson was ""a faggot,"" and that he was granted preferential treatment for  filing the complaint, Grobeson said.    Acquitted, Grobeson asked the trial board to investigate the officers who  allegedly had solicited false testimony. The investigation never occurred, and  evidence was destroyed, he said.    On June 13, 1988, Grobeson turned in his resignation and a complaint demanding  that Lt. Al Corella be investigated and punished for allegedly asking officers  to solicit complaints against him; for following Grobeson when he was off duty,  and for repeatedly taking him into an interrogation room and grilling him about  his sexuality -- charges Corella has denied in a formal response to Grobeson's  suit.    Instead of punishment, ""every supervisor that was assigned to harass me, every  single one with the exception of one, has been promoted,"" Grobeson alleges.    He went to the Police Commission, Chief Gates and the mayor but he could not  get anyone to investigate his charges that his civil rights had been violated  by 3 1/2 years of harassment, he said.    In September, with the backing of a group called National Gay Rights Advocates,  he filed his lawsuit and began speaking out about his case, which is becoming a  cause celebre in the gay community. (Tonight, for instance, he will participate  in a UCLA panel discussion on constitutional protections for gays and lesbians  with three homosexual men and women who have filed suit against branches of the  U.S. military.)    Virtually everyone agrees, apparently, that Grobeson was an excellent  policeman.    ""When he resigned, everyone who commanded him recommended that he be rehired,""  attorney Walsh said. But the city maintains it has yet to find any credible  evidence to suggest that Grobeson was hounded off the force.    ""There's a big gap between perceiving yourself to be discriminated against and  proving that specific individuals did bad things to you or the city had a  policy of doing bad things to you,"" Walsh said. "". . . One thing we need to  resolve is, how much (of the alleged harassment) was just the sort of broad  humor that would take place in any predominantly male organization like a  police force?""    A large photograph of Mitch Grobeson at his bar mitzvah hangs on one wall of  Grobeson's mother's home. Over a bookcase is a large framed photograph of  Marilyn Grobeson seated on the hood of a squad car, as her uniformed son stands  proudly behind the ""Serve and Protect"" emblem on the door.    To transform himself from the boy in the first photo to the policeman in the  other, Grobeson ""worked hard, he sacrificed,"" his mother said.    As a child, she recalled, he watched the Sheriff John show on television and  told her that's what he wanted to be. ""He couldn't say 'policeman,' so he said  'peace man.' I remember that, 'peace man.' ""    His mother learned that her son was gay two weeks before he resigned. That  wasn't easy to hear, she said, but ""him being gay was not as difficult to deal  with as the fact that his life's dream was shattered.    ""In our religion, there's a book called 'The Ethics of the Fathers,' "" she  said. ""In it, there's a saying: 'Where there is no man, be one.' Mitchell has  always stepped out to fill that role. The fact that he is gay makes him no less  a man.""    If other gay and lesbian Los Angeles officers stepped forward and supported  Grobeson in his litigation, there's a chance the case, which is now expected to  take roughly four years to resolve, could be expedited through the courts as a  class-action suit, his lawyers have said.    As it stands now, Grobeson is still on his own, squared off against those he  perceives as bad guys, with no backup in sight.

A Latino gang called Aztlan had, in effect, been holding hostage an apartment  building in Rampart division, he said. The gang was so brazen, its leaders  placed a placard over the building and signed their names to it.      No Partners    By then, Grobeson said, he was having a difficult time finding partners, so he  took it upon himself to rout the gang. ""Every day I'd go put a new one in jail,  a new one in jail, until finally . . . I got the leader.""    He climbed a ladder and took down the sign. As he walked through the building  courtyard, a mother with two young children stepped out of her apartment for  ""the first time ever,"" and thanked him: ""Gracias, official.""    Even as that gang bust was unfolding, though, word continued to circulate among  officers at the Rampart station that a homosexual was in their midst. Few  suspected him at first, because they knew he was a sharpshooter, which would  have been impossible for ""someone with a limp wrist,"" he said sarcastically.    But slowly the station house graffiti began to focus on Grobeson; it followed  him as he was promoted and transferred to other stations.    Someone glued his locker shut. Someone taped a picture of Rock Hudson to it,  with the inscription ""To Mitch -- Love, Rock Baby."" He received a package  marked ""AIDS Survival Kit,"" and someone wrote ""BEWARE"" in the dust on his squad  car. Moreover, Grobeson contends in his suit, several supervisors encouraged  the harassment.    His problems intensified in summer 1985, when he decided to break the legendary  police ""code of silence"" after a confrontation between police and a crowd of  revelers at an outdoor fair.    An officer had clubbed unconscious a man involved in a fight, and a near-riot  resulted, Grobeson said. He chose to testify to internal affairs investigators,  he said, because he believes in telling the truth and because as an instructor  in baton technique, he felt that the officer's repeated ""head shots"" could have  killed the suspect.    But the main reason he testified is because he watched the accused officer ""get  so caught up in his emotions, that he risked the lives of his fellow officers.  The point wasn't to burn him. He endangered the lives of his fellow officers by  turning the crowd on us. . . .    ""There are people who became police officers because they like bullying people,  beating up on people,"" Grobeson said. ""The good cops became cops because they  care about people.""    But skewed notions of machismo have engendered a process for selecting law  officers that systematically eliminates a whole segment of the population --  including some who are drawn to police work for all the right reasons, Grobeson  said.    Los Angeles Police Department candidates, for instance, must take the Minnesota  Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory test, which he and gay activists contend is  designed to rate people on a scale of heterosexuality and homosexuality based  on antiquated notions of masculinity and femininity.    Grobeson took the test in college, and ""I didn't come out as high as I would  have liked in the masculine categories,"" he said. ""Consequently, when I took it  for the Police Department, when there came a question like, 'Do you want to be  a florist?' I answered no. . . . Literally, the way they eliminate people who  are homosexual is by eliminating people who want to be florists.""    When answers are suspicious or when candidates raise suspicions about sexual  orientation during the background investigation, the department invariably  finds an unrelated reason to reject them, Grobeson charges.      No Open Homosexuals    The result, he said, is that there is not a single openly gay or lesbian  officer among the 7,000 officers in Los Angeles department, nor is there one  among the 20,000 peace officers in more than 100 Southern California agencies.    ""To the best of my knowledge . . there is not an openly gay (officer) on the  force, and as a matter of sheer statistics, there certainly must be a  significantly large number of them,"" said Walsh of the City Attorney's office.  ""Why they choose not to be open is another matter. Whether it is because of  fear of the treatment they would receive, as Mr. Grobeson seems to think, or  simply because they wish to keep it as part of their personal life and not  advertise it, I don't know.""    Grobeson said gays and lesbians hide their identities for one reason: ""They  live in absolute fear for their lives and careers."" And anyone who is found  out, he said, is driven from the force.    He decided that wouldn't happen to him. But things ""got worse and worse every  day."" At one station, officers posted his photo with the caption: ""Would you  buy a used (sexual device) from this man?"" Someone put up a sign reading  ""Faggot Get Out!"" at another, he said. And more than once he found himself  chasing bad guys with the supposed good guys refusing to back him up, he said.    For a while, ""I considered eating my gun,"" he said. But finally, ""I decided  this is completely wrong, and started documenting the harassment.""    In 1986, Grobeson transferred back to the Pacific division, where he was put in  charge of a controversial effort to address the Venice Beach homeless problem.  As the situation improved, Grobeson began showing up on national telecasts and  in newspaper stories. Commendations and more than 100 citizen letters poured  in.    In one case, lawyer Stephen Yagman, the police gadfly who recently won a  judgment against Chief Gates, witnessed an arrest Grobeson and other officers  made on the Venice boardwalk and wrote a rare letter of praise. The letter is  in Grobeson's file, with a note from Gates: ""You have impressed the  unimpressible.""    But even as the praise rolled in, Grobeson alleges, several officers,  encouraged by supervisors, stepped up efforts to undermine his ""perfect  package.""    In 1987, a habitue of the Venice Beach drug scene filed a complaint against  him. A letter signed by Capt. Vance Proctor states that on Nov. 12, 1987,  Grobeson ""failed to take appropriate action"" in detaining the suspect and he  caused him ""to partially disrobe.""    Grobeson denied the charges and demanded that the case go to a trial board. At  the trial, his accuser testified under oath that eight officers had told him  Grobeson was ""a faggot,"" and that he was granted preferential treatment for  filing the complaint, Grobeson said.    Acquitted, Grobeson asked the trial board to investigate the officers who  allegedly had solicited false testimony. The investigation never occurred, and  evidence was destroyed, he said.    On June 13, 1988, Grobeson turned in his resignation and a complaint demanding  that Lt. Al Corella be investigated and punished for allegedly asking officers  to solicit complaints against him; for following Grobeson when he was off duty,  and for repeatedly taking him into an interrogation room and grilling him about  his sexuality -- charges Corella has denied in a formal response to Grobeson's  suit.    Instead of punishment, ""every supervisor that was assigned to harass me, every  single one with the exception of one, has been promoted,"" Grobeson alleges.    He went to the Police Commission, Chief Gates and the mayor but he could not  get anyone to investigate his charges that his civil rights had been violated  by 3 1/2 years of harassment, he said.    In September, with the backing of a group called National Gay Rights Advocates,  he filed his lawsuit and began speaking out about his case, which is becoming a  cause celebre in the gay community. (Tonight, for instance, he will participate  in a UCLA panel discussion on constitutional protections for gays and lesbians  with three homosexual men and women who have filed suit against branches of the  U.S. military.)    Virtually everyone agrees, apparently, that Grobeson was an excellent  policeman.    ""When he resigned, everyone who commanded him recommended that he be rehired,""  attorney Walsh said. But the city maintains it has yet to find any credible  evidence to suggest that Grobeson was hounded off the force.    ""There's a big gap between perceiving yourself to be discriminated against and  proving that specific individuals did bad things to you or the city had a  policy of doing bad things to you,"" Walsh said. "". . . One thing we need to  resolve is, how much (of the alleged harassment) was just the sort of broad  humor that would take place in any predominantly male organization like a  police force?""    A large photograph of Mitch Grobeson at his bar mitzvah hangs on one wall of  Grobeson's mother's home. Over a bookcase is a large framed photograph of  Marilyn Grobeson seated on the hood of a squad car, as her uniformed son stands  proudly behind the ""Serve and Protect"" emblem on the door.    To transform himself from the boy in the first photo to the policeman in the  other, Grobeson ""worked hard, he sacrificed,"" his mother said.    As a child, she recalled, he watched the Sheriff John show on television and  told her that's what he wanted to be. ""He couldn't say 'policeman,' so he said  'peace man.' I remember that, 'peace man.' ""    His mother learned that her son was gay two weeks before he resigned. That  wasn't easy to hear, she said, but ""him being gay was not as difficult to deal  with as the fact that his life's dream was shattered.    ""In our religion, there's a book called 'The Ethics of the Fathers,' "" she  said. ""In it, there's a saying: 'Where there is no man, be one.' Mitchell has  always stepped out to fill that role. The fact that he is gay makes him no less  a man.""    If other gay and lesbian Los Angeles officers stepped forward and supported  Grobeson in his litigation, there's a chance the case, which is now expected to  take roughly four years to resolve, could be expedited through the courts as a  class-action suit, his lawyers have said.    As it stands now, Grobeson is still on his own, squared off against those he  perceives as bad guys, with no backup in sight.

S. Border Patrol for return to their home countries and  possible federal prosecution under a new policy unveiled Wednesday by Police  Chief Bob Burgreen.    The new procedures, details of which are under study by the Police Department  and the city's Citizens' Advisory Board on Police Community Relations, are  aimed at perhaps ""thousands"" of undocumented arrestees who are cited for  misdemeanors and released to the streets because there is no space for them in  county jails, Burgreen said in an interview.    ""We see this as a real deterrent to aliens who are coming into our country  simply to rip us off,"" Burgreen said.      Assistance From Agents    The policy change will bring Border Patrol agents into police headquarters to  aid in the identification of undocumented immigrants after initial screening by  arresting officers and the police lieutenant in charge of a shift. If the  Border Patrol agent determines that a person scheduled for release is  undocumented, agents would take him into custody for return to his home country  or deportation, Border Patrol spokesman Mike Gregg said.    An undocumented person arrested by police a second time who has previously been  deported could face felony charges of illegal entry into the United States,  Gregg said. The crime is punishable by a year in jail.    The new policy, proposed to the Citizens Advisory Board on Wednesday, received  cautious support from some Latino activists and City Councilman Bob Filner,  whose district covers the city's border region.      'Reasonable Policy'    Filner believes the plan ""is a reasonable policy for the city to pursue,"" said  Allen Jones, a Filner aide. ""If people are committing crimes, it makes no  difference what their country of origin is.""    Roberto Martinez, co-chairman of the Coalition for Law and Justice, a Latino  advocacy group, said that ""we know there is a problem with certain numbers of  undocumented people coming into this town who are involved in illegal activity,  criminal activity. We can't ignore that.""    Martinez, who was briefed by Burgreen on the new proposal last week, said that  ""on the surface we don't have a problem"" with the new plan. He said, however,  that there must be safeguards against arbitrary application of the policy  against undocumented immigrants not accused of crimes.    Martinez added that his organization is still studying details of the plan.      Opposition Voiced    But Herman Baca, chairperson of the Committee on Chicano Rights, said, ""I think  (the policy) is going to be used as an excuse to harass and violate the rights  of any person of Mexican-American ancestry in the Chicano community.""    Burgreen, who said he is still taking advice from city officials and Latino  groups on details of the policy, promised that the policy will not be used as a  pretext for rounding up undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes.    ""My direction will be that no games are to be played,"" Burgreen said.    Since August, 1986, the Police Department has declined to aid the Border Patrol  by detaining undocumented immigrants who are not charged with crimes. That  policy will not change under the new procedures. (A number of other county law  enforcement agencies, including the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, do  hold suspected undocumented immigrants for the Border Patrol).      Will Be Handed Over    However, undocumented immigrants accused of crimes such as assault and battery,  trespass, carrying a concealed weapon or breaking into an automobile will be  turned over to the Border Patrol when the policy takes effect, which hasn't  been decided.    American citizens arrested for the same crimes still will be cited and released  in most cases. The difference, Burgreen said, is that police keep addresses of  those people and are able to locate them if they fail to appear in court.  Undocumented immigrants are often impossible to find, he said.    The county's packed jails cause police to release more than 100 arrestees  daily, some of them for crimes involving violence and drug possession.    No records are kept on how many misdemeanor arrestees are undocumented,  according to Kimberly Glenn, supervising administrative analyst in the Police  Department's crime analysis division. However, Burgreen estimated that perhaps  thousands of people, many of them repeat offenders, would be affected by the  new rules.      Same People Over and Over    ""We are seeing the same people over and over,"" he said.    Burgreen said he will take into account the advice of activists, city officials  and the Citizens Advisory Board about details of implementing the new policy  but intends to institute ""either this policy or something similar to it."" He  has the authority to adopt the plan.    Andrea Skorepa, chairman of the Citizens Advisory Board, said a subcommittee of  that panel will review the policy proposal and report back with recommendations  next month.

Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two  other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of  Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol  Lt-Gen Chaisit said.    Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi  Lotfollah, who is still at large, were sought under arrest  warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring  to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of  others, and making and possessing explosives. [background  passage omitted] [see item BK0306124894 in previous Terrorism  Report]    Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the  Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck  driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit.    Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and  Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra  Hotel in Hat Yai.    A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao  district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran  under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the  immigration checkpoint on Thursday.    Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked  similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and  distributed to immigration offices across the country, an  immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch  on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday.    The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand  through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok  districts more than 10 times under different names.    The immigration officers, however, earlier could not  identify  him because they did not have his photograph.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left  the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy,  came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat  Yai.    The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had  called off their investigation.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the  other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot.    He said the police found the gang had its command centre in  Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by  Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents.    The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional  witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and  southern provinces.    Investigations will be completed in seven days and the  suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen  Chaisit said.    Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon  Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to  kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem under stress.    Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted  the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am  yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some  ""Thai people in Bangkok.""    ""I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something  strange would happen,"" Gen. Chawalit said. He did not elaborate.    He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy  that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.     "

(The prosecutor, who is heading an investigation into  illegal  activities by certain free mason lodges in Calabria, refused to  confirm or deny the request while another assistant prosecutor,  Carlo Macri, said in Palmi that he knew nothing of a request for  the Forza Italia document and ""if this is true, then it is very  serious that I don't know anything"".)    Previti, who is also a candidate for the upcoming vote, told  the press how the requested list had ""naturally"" been given to  the Digos police ""...but I must add how it had also been  registered with the Ministry of the Interior and so, if one  wanted to avoid such a spectacular scene, they (Digos) needed  only file a request with the ministry.""

Asked whether he thought the sending of the Digos to Forza  Italia headquarters was part of a ""single design"" against the  party, Previti said ""this is a maneuver orchestrated by the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left], if Violante is a member of the  PDS leadership, against us.""

When police searched an apartment in the Pratu Nam area,  they  were shocked when they opened the door. Inside the apartment,  they found 5-6 blacks in each room. The police searched almost  10 rooms and found 40-50 people. Thus, it's not surprising why  so many of these people can be seen walking around the Pratu Nam  area in the day.    From examining their passports, it was found that all had  entered the country legally as tourists and businessmen. Thus,  the police had to release them. Police Colonel Khongdet Chusi,  the deputy commander of the Northern Bangkok Metropolitan Police  and a former police superintendent known for suppressing  godfathers, said that ``we are very suspicious about what they  are doing here.''    Police files show that many blacks from African countries  work as heroin couriers. They use Thailand as a transit point  for smuggling heroin to a third country, including the United  States and countries in Europe. In those countries, heroin is  worth 10 times as much as it is here, that is, it increases from  200,000 baht per kg to 2 million baht per kg.    The data matches that of narcotics control units. It was  also  discovered that traffickers were using the parking lot of a  well-known shop in the Pratu Nam area as a narcotics delivery  point. ``Those who are caught red-handed usually ask if they  will be sentenced to death. After they are told that they won't  be, they feel better. They have said that there is much poverty  in their native country and so they have to take this risk. If  they can get away with this, their lives will improve greatly.  And even if they are caught, their families won't suffer,  because the agents who hired them will take care of their  families as agreed on beforehand,'' said Police Colonel Khongdet.    During the past 2-3 years, many blacks have been arrested on  charges of trying to smuggle narcotics out of the country. Most  have been arrested while waiting to board an airplane to a third  country. They use a variety of techniques for smuggling drugs.  In the past, they used to pack heroin in condoms and ingest the  packets. One person could smuggle out only about 1 kg this way,  which meant that many people had to be used each trip. This  brought them to the attention of narcotics units. Also, this was  very dangerous. Some of the couriers died because the  heroin-filled packets burst in their stomachs.    Thus, traffickers changed their method by concealing the  heroin in bottles of sauce, cans of flour, cosmetic bottles, and  secret compartments in their suitcases. This made it difficult  for officials to find the narcotics because the containers had  to be torn apart to find the drugs. It is thought that the  amount of heroin seized is much less than the amount that slips  by Thai officials.    Statistics on heroin seizures nationwide show that in 1992,  officials seized a total of 1,062 kg. During the first six  months of 1993, officials seized 988.6 kg with a domestic value  of more than 197 million baht, or 1,970 million baht in Europe  or the United States.    The statistics show that seizures have increased this year.  Considering the amount of heroin successfully smuggled out of  the country, the amount of money involved is staggering and  seems worth the risk. In particular, officials have not been  able to get at the chief culprits behind the heroin smuggling.  This is because the heroin smuggling routes are divided into  sections.    In 1992, officials arrested 536 suspected couriers in 169  cases. Most, 242, were Burmese, who were caught smuggling 43 kg  of heroin. Twelve blacks from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana were  arrested with 19 kg of heroin. Altogether, officials seized 239  kg. During the first six months of 1993, officials arrested 489  suspects and seized 418 kg of heroin. Most were Burmese, who  were caught with 32 kg of heroin. Also arrested were two  Taiwanese with 114 kg, 10 blacks with 25 kg, and six Hong Kong  Chinese with 15 kg.    Even though the number of arrests has increased, a large  number have managed to avoid being arrested and smuggle the  heroin out of the country. The methods used to smuggle heroin,  including both methods of concealment and the selection of  couriers, have improved.    When the heroin traffickers learned that narcotics units  were  keeping close watch on blacks, they started to hire others to  work as couriers, particularly people from poor Asian countries.  Today, officials have been told to keep a close watch on Burmese.     "

A passing stranger found the two toddlers wet and crying Dec. 14 in the women's  restroom at Colonia Park in Oxnard.    Oxnard Police Detective Mike Palmieri said that by all appearances the parents  or guardians do not want to be found.    ""It's just one of those baffling cases,"" Palmieri said. ""We just don't know  where to go from here.""    A witness told police that she saw two men and a woman visit the park carrying  the two girls. She said they left in a black pickup truck without the.    Later, a man passing the park restroom told police that he heard the sound of  crying inside the building and asked a woman to check. The woman found the  girls lying in a pool of water and urine bundled in a blanket.    Police have ruled out kidnaping, Palmieri said. No one has reported missing  children matching their descriptions. The girls may have been left at the  restroom by parents who wanted them to be discovered by workers at a nearby  day-care center, he said.    Ventura County Children's Services, an agency that handles abused and abandoned  children, has had no luck in tracking down the children's parents.    Frank Ferratta, a program manager at the agency that oversees about 900  children who are dependents of the court, said only one or two babies are  abandoned each year in Ventura County, usually by parents who cannot afford to  care for them.    ""In the 17 years of doing this work, I have not encountered such complete  mystery,"" Ferratta said. ""We don't have very many of these situations.""

A passing stranger found the two toddlers wet and crying Dec. 14 in the women's  restroom at Colonia Park in Oxnard.    Oxnard Police Detective Mike Palmieri said that by all appearances the parents  or guardians do not want to be found.    ""It's just one of those baffling cases,"" Palmieri said. ""We just don't know  where to go from here.""    A witness told police that she saw two men and a woman visit the park carrying  the two girls. She said they left in a black pickup truck without the.    Later, a man passing the park restroom told police that he heard the sound of  crying inside the building and asked a woman to check. The woman found the  girls lying in a pool of water and urine bundled in a blanket.    Police have ruled out kidnaping, Palmieri said. No one has reported missing  children matching their descriptions. The girls may have been left at the  restroom by parents who wanted them to be discovered by workers at a nearby  day-care center, he said.    Ventura County Children's Services, an agency that handles abused and abandoned  children, has had no luck in tracking down the children's parents.    Frank Ferratta, a program manager at the agency that oversees about 900  children who are dependents of the court, said only one or two babies are  abandoned each year in Ventura County, usually by parents who cannot afford to  care for them.    ""In the 17 years of doing this work, I have not encountered such complete  mystery,"" Ferratta said. ""We don't have very many of these situations.""    If no one comes forward to claim the two girls, a Ventura County Superior Court  judge in June will decide their fate, Ferratta said, adding that the agency  will recommend that parental rights be legally terminated so that the girls can  be adopted.

Police broke up several protests in Jerusalem following the announcement on Wednesday night of the death of Mr Hussein Nimr Assad, 26. Prison authorities said he died of a heart attack. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, called the death 'very tragic' and said it could undermine US-backed Middle East peace negotiations.

They want ministers to consider a  controversial scheme to allow all 25,000 registered drug addicts  to receive heroin and other drugs free on the national service.    They are also demanding a royal commission on drug control  and an American-style national drugs task force to spearhead a  new anti-drugs campaign.    ""We've won several battles but we've lost the war,"" Keith  Hellawell, chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs,  said yesterday. ""The current policy has not stopped young people  turning to drugs.    ""It has not stopped the violence and other crime related to  drugs. We need to win the hearts and minds of a generation and  turn them around.""    Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and the favourite to  become  Labour party leader, last night supported the police initiative.  ""It is desperately important that the government recognises the  scale and urgency of the drugs problem,"" he said. ""It must put  together a comprehensive programme which cuts demand as well as  supply.""    Police alarm at the rising drugs menace follows new evidence  that Britain is caught up in a drugs explosion. Chief constables  say existing policy has failed to stop the emergence of a ""drugs  generation"" made up of tens of thousands of youngsters who have  turned to crime to meet their drugs bills.    Hellawell will unveil fresh evidence of the crisis when he  chairs the chief constables' drugs conference at Wakefield next  week. ""It's extremely serious. It's not just confined to the big  cities. This affects every city and town in the country. It's  right across society, it's right across our youth. I will  guarantee your children have been offered drugs or at least know  about drugs in their school.    ""Headmasters are keeping it under wraps. This is a cancer in  our society that has to be excised. Otherwise I don't know where  it will lead.""    Richard Browne, Britain's chief customs drugs investigator,  told THE SUNDAY TIMES: ""I can stem the flow. I can make it more  difficult for them and restrict the amount that comes in. But we  can't link arms around the coastline and stop it. It's a  bottomless pit.""    Chief Superintendent Paul Cook, head of community affairs  and  drugs in Greater Manchester, admitted that police and Customs  had failed to halt the drugs explosion. ""The entire police  effort over the last 25 years has had no discernible effect on  the availability of drugs on the streets,"" he said. ""I've talked  to ministers until I'm blue in the bloody face. We have got to  address this problem.""    A cabinet sub-committee set up last year under Tony Newton,  leader of the Commons, is considering switching resources from  policing to reducing drugs demand among the young. The review,  due to report to John Major this summer, is likely to propose  giving the police a greater role in educating the public about  drugs.    Police chiefs warn, however, that Britain is facing a drugs  crisis matching the worst affected cities in the United States.  Philip Thomas, West Midlands assistant chief constable and head  of crime operations, said: ""Drug dealers are protecting a trade  which is causing more social disruption than anything else in  our society.""    ""There have been drug-related shootings in Liverpool,  Manchester and eight in Birmingham in the last 12 months,"" says  Thomas. Last year there were 31 drug-related murders and  attempted murders in London alone.    New research shows the black market in heroin, cocaine,  cannabis and other illegal drugs is now worth 5 billion a  year. Police, fearful of the ""knock-on"" effect on burglaries,  car thefts, credit card fraud and street robberies, point to new  figures showing that Britain has overtaken the United States in  car crime, previously the record holder.    Customs chiefs revealed last week that Britain is now the  most lucrative market in the world for heroin and cocaine  traffickers, giving international drugs syndicates a profits  ""premium"" of more than 30 percent.    Crack, the highly addictive cocaine derivative, is a growing  source of concern. ""We're seeing huge amounts being targeted at  Britain and Europe,"" said Browne.    Large quantities of pure cocaine are being shipped to ""crack  factories"" in the inner cities including Tottenham, Stoke  Newington and Brixton in London, Moss Side in Manchester and  parts of Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh.    Manchester police estimates that the average heroin addict  consumes nearly 30,000 worth of the drug each year, paying  for their habit by street dealing, prostitution and theft.

He also confirmed the existence of  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerrillas in the  border region with Darien.    Fundora indicated that, given the pressures the National  Police are exerting on international drug traffickers, the  traffickers are looking for new areas to bring drugs into the  nation, thereby continuing the trafficking process. Fundora  said this is the reason authorities often refuse to disclose  information on operations to eradicate and to prevent drug  trafficking activities.    According to the SAN director, the traffickers work around  the clock and they relocate very easily to other sites to  continue their trafficking. Fundora made these statements  during a meeting with directors of various state security  organizations. The objective of the meeting was to discuss new  strategies to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and  crime.    Fundora confirmed the presence of FARC guerrillas in the  Darien territory, and he stressed that more vigilance in this  zone is needed because of the FARC presence. Fundora added that  the National Government must increase the number of Border  Police units and it must supply them with better equipment to  conduct their work.    The government must make efforts to combat piracy on the  seas, drug trafficking activities, and crime in the capital,  Fundora noted. He added that the ghost of militarism should  disappear and that members of the National Police should be  properly equipped to perform their duties more effectively.    Fundora also suggested more drastic measures to combat crime  and international drug trafficking, such as 30-year sentences.  He also suggested that guards whose participation is proven in  the escape of drug traffickers should be forced to pay for the  pending sentence. If this were implemented, the system would  change, he noted.    Citizens must cooperate by informing the police when they  know about the location of drug sales, otherwise, youths will  continue to be caught in the drug net, Fundora reiterated.     "

The volume of drugs seized between January  and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the  big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine  seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by  the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the  drug out of circulation.    According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase  in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become  the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and  Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide  range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports  pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug  in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many  ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats  or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be  sold on the U.S. or European market.    Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest  producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and  Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack  of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon  Region, to transport the coca base.    In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with  international organizations and foreign governments for the  purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany,  Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have  been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign  experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the  results are visible in the considerable number of  ""mules""--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they  boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro  and Sao Paulo.    Operations Cover Entire Country    Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not  restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted  in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two  metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato  Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in  Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia.    And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu  (Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice  of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the  region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which  makes access and policing difficult.    The various operations taking place in 1993 included the  destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco  Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a  little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known  as ""Monte Santo,"" ""Ouricuri,"" and ""Independence,"" took place  with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate  the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region.    Amphetamines Gaining Ground    A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the  appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market.  Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the  country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of  laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more  than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two  illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the  other in Florianopolis.    The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA,  whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured  on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the  laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang  with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande  do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new  escalation of drugs in our country.    Battle Against Illegal Prospecting    The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action  in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug  traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation ""Catrimani""  arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a  survey for the purpose of beginning Operation ""Free Forest,""  which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations  beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three  aircraft and a large quantity of fuel.    The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency  stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara  Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the  protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and  cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were  seized.    In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the  year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the  drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving  underage girls forced into prostitution.

Police said the explosives, found during a routine check, were believed to have been destined for a mainland bombing campaign. The discovery raised fears of a new wave of violence by the Irish Republican Army as it considers last December's Downing Street Declaration. It coincided with the annual Orange Day march by Northern Ireland's Protestants and a missile attack in Belfast on a British Army helicopter, which was forced to make an emergency landing.

Arike maintained Estonia is in the clutches of a confidence  crisis which involves also the Interior Ministry and the police.    ""The specific functions of some departments have not been  defined clearly enough,"" the minister claimed. ""This often gives  rise to situations where a department, to establish its  superiority to others, withholds vital information.""    Arike said the Estonian police currently employs about 1,000  detectives and only 600 officers; that is, more men are engaged  in investigating crimes than in preventing them.    The interior minister pointed out the need for setting up  economic security structures. The Estonian economic police so  far works on an elementary level, he claimed.    Italy and Finland have offered Estonia assistance in  training  policemen investigating economic crimes. Italian experts are  now in Estonia to prepare study plans for a seminar in March.    Arike said the authorities are also considering the  formation  of a special police unit to trace illegal aliens in Estonia.    The interior minister regarded policemen's knowledge of the  Estonian language as a major problem. Under a government  decree, all policemen who haven't by Feb. 1 passed the language  exam are to be dismissed. Only those non-Estonian-speaking  policemen's labor contracts may be extended who have a higher or  a special police education.    ""The dismissal of a great number of policemen at once is  very  dangerous,"" Arike said. ""Those people know well the structure,  the equipment and capacity of the police; if they should go over  to crime, it would have terrible consequences.""    The minister said the new head of the Police Department will  be appointed within a month. At present Chancellor of the  Interior Ministry Gero Kartau is the acting director general of  the Police Department. Former director Igor Amann was dismissed  on Jan. 14.    Arike said his ministry pays much attention also to  regulating the relations between the ministry leadership and  departments, and defining the functions of the ministry's  subdivisions.     "

The volume of drugs seized between January  and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the  big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine  seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by  the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the  drug out of circulation.    According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase  in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become  the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and  Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide  range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports  pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug  in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many  ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats  or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be  sold on the U.S. or European market.    Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest  producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and  Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack  of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon  Region, to transport the coca base.    In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with  international organizations and foreign governments for the  purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany,  Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have  been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign  experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the  results are visible in the considerable number of  ""mules""--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they  boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro  and Sao Paulo.    Operations Cover Entire Country    Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not  restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted  in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two  metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato  Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in  Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia.    And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu  (Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice  of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the  region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which  makes access and policing difficult.    The various operations taking place in 1993 included the  destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco  Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a  little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known  as ""Monte Santo,"" ""Ouricuri,"" and ""Independence,"" took place  with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate  the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region.    Amphetamines Gaining Ground    A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the  appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market.  Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the  country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of  laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more  than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two  illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the  other in Florianopolis.    The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA,  whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured  on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the  laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang  with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande  do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new  escalation of drugs in our country.    Battle Against Illegal Prospecting    The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action  in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug  traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation ""Catrimani""  arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a  survey for the purpose of beginning Operation ""Free Forest,""  which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations  beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three  aircraft and a large quantity of fuel.    The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency  stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara  Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the  protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and  cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were  seized.    In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the  year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the  drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving  underage girls forced into prostitution.

The radioactive material, kept in a lead casing in a bag in the boot of a Mercedes car, was confiscated. Police said the suspects, both immigrants who had been under surveillance for some time, had planned to sell the uranium for DM1.9m (Pounds 650m). Police said the origin of the uranium was not known. A spokesman for Atomforum, an association of German nuclear power producers, said the enriched uranium-235 would not have been enough to produce an atomic bomb. He added that the radioactive material, could not have come from Germany.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
0,FT944-17882 ,"FT944-17882 _AN-EJFD1ACAFT 941006   FT  06 OCT 94 / Howard seeks to reassure police      By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent   Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday sought to reassure senior police officers over proposals they fear may lead to greater private-sector involvement in policing. He told the Police Superintendents' Association conference in Leicestershire it was 'simply not true' that a Home Office review of police tasks was considering encouraging companies or local authorities to patrol the streets and deal with traffic. The review aimed to ensure the money devoted to policing achieved the best results. 'It is about getting highly trained officers out of time-wasting duties and into productive ones where their training will be used to full effect,' he said. It was not about looking for ways to cut the number of police constables. But the Police Federation of England and Wales said yesterday that the privatisation of prisoner escort services had not released one extra police officer to fight street crime. Mr Fred Broughton, the federation chairman, told a Labour conference fringe meeting in Blackpool that police numbers had instead been cut in line with the number of officers relieved of the task. He said: 'There is a bit of a myth about transferring police duties to civilians because it does not lead to those thousands of extra police officers on the streets that the government suggests it does.' A speech to the Leicester conference by Chief Superintendent David Golding, association president, was thought by some observers to have been watered down. A hard-hitting draft had been available to journalists earlier this week but Mr Golding omitted some passages when he delivered the speech. Later Mr Howard denied that he or his department put any pressure on Mr Golding to amend the speech. Mr Golding said he had changed his script after it became clear that some of his fears and concerns were being addressed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Saudi forces are heavily armed and equipped with machine  guns, armoured personnel carriers, tear gas cannisters and water  cannons.    The battalions have arrayed themselves in the form of a  triangle in the northeastern side of holy Mecca. One battalion  has taken up position at al-Aziz street at the site of the  Iranian pilgrim headquarters. This battalion forms the point of  the invasion triangle of the Saudi commandos. The main part of  the equipments and personnel of this batallaion are seen in the  al-Azizieh school which is precisely in front of the Iranian  pilgrim headquarters.    In the Azizieh street there is another battalion that is  completely ready.    In addition to these forces, dozens of private cars are seen  on different sides of the triangle stopping and interrogating  unsuspecting pilgirms to the holiest sanctuary of Islam.    Many pilgrims who pass this region interpret the abnormal  movements of the Saudi police as disrespect of the divine  sanctuary. The insulting behaviour of the Saudi police with  pilgrims from various countries in many cases has met stong  objection.    In view of the provocative behaviour of the Saudis, Hojat  ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader of the Islamic  revolution's representative for the Hajj, was forced to call off  the annual rally which was planned for Tuesday May 17.    The rally in accordance with the spirit of the Hajj aims to  promote Islamic unity and awaken the ummah to the plots of  enemies against them.    Quite strangely the Saudis are averse to this all-important  rally and on one such occasion in 1987, Saudi security forces  massacred over 400 Iranian pilgrims near the most inviolable of  sanctuaries where the shedding of even an animal's blood is  divinely prohibited.

The American journalists and their Chinese driver were taken  to a police station for an identity check and questioning after  filming on the square ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June  4, 1989 crushing of the pro-democracy movement.    All their videotape was confiscated, the journalist told  AFP,  adding that police had accused the CBS team of working without  authorization and having filmed the heavy security deployments  on the square.

He also confirmed the existence of  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerrillas in the  border region with Darien.    Fundora indicated that, given the pressures the National  Police are exerting on international drug traffickers, the  traffickers are looking for new areas to bring drugs into the  nation, thereby continuing the trafficking process. Fundora  said this is the reason authorities often refuse to disclose  information on operations to eradicate and to prevent drug  trafficking activities.    According to the SAN director, the traffickers work around  the clock and they relocate very easily to other sites to  continue their trafficking. Fundora made these statements  during a meeting with directors of various state security  organizations. The objective of the meeting was to discuss new  strategies to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and  crime.    Fundora confirmed the presence of FARC guerrillas in the  Darien territory, and he stressed that more vigilance in this  zone is needed because of the FARC presence. Fundora added that  the National Government must increase the number of Border  Police units and it must supply them with better equipment to  conduct their work.    The government must make efforts to combat piracy on the  seas, drug trafficking activities, and crime in the capital,  Fundora noted. He added that the ghost of militarism should  disappear and that members of the National Police should be  properly equipped to perform their duties more effectively.    Fundora also suggested more drastic measures to combat crime  and international drug trafficking, such as 30-year sentences.  He also suggested that guards whose participation is proven in  the escape of drug traffickers should be forced to pay for the  pending sentence. If this were implemented, the system would  change, he noted.    Citizens must cooperate by informing the police when they  know about the location of drug sales, otherwise, youths will  continue to be caught in the drug net, Fundora reiterated.     "

Final      Part A; Page 1; Column 6; Metro Desk      797 words      DISGRUNTLED POSTMAN GOES ON SHOOTING SPREE; 3 SLAIN;    ESCONDIDO GUNMAN IS BRAIN DEAD      By ROBERT WELKOS and TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writers      A disgruntled mailman today shot his wife to death, then drove to a nearby post  office in Escondido and opened fire on fellow employees, killing two and  wounding a third before putting the gun to his head and shooting himself.    The rampage, which began at 7:30 a.m. on East Valley Parkway on the eastern  edge of the northern San Diego County city, left postal workers scrambling for  safety. When the gunfire subsided, survivors were seen exchanging hugs and  crying quietly.    Police said the gunman, identified as John Merlin Taylor, 52, of Escondido,  apparently was prepared for a siege of the postal facility, but there was no  indication that he was looking for a specific person or a target.    ""He fired well over a dozen rounds, and there are expended cases all over the  floor there,"" Escondido Police Lt. Earl Callander said. ""There is also a box of  about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be used for reloading.""    Taylor was taken to nearby Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was placed on a  life support system and declared brain-dead shortly after 10 a.m.    U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Taylor had been a letter carrier  for 25 years and was nearing retirement. Taylor's boss described him as a model  employee, ""as mellow and      Increasing Pressure    Police said they knew of no motive for the shootings and believed that the  victims were shot randomly, but co-workers said Taylor had succumbed to  increasing pressure at work.    Two days ago, co-worker Johnny Sims recalled having a discussion with Taylor in  which the mailman mentioned the 1986 shooting rampage at the post office in  Edmond, Okla.    ""I think what may have happened is that we were talking about that thing that  happened at the Oklahoma post office,"" said Sims, who was not at work when the  Escondido shooting erupted.    ""We were talking about something and got around to saying, 'What if something  happened to one of the employees that would have gotten him mad and to go  berserk?' "" Sims added. ""We were just joking around.""    The Edmond shootings, which stunned the nation and is still much talked about  by postal workers who feel that the U.S. Postal Service is insensitive to its  employees, occurred when part-time mail carrier Patrick Sherrill massacred 14  co-workers, wounded six others and then committed suicide. Sherrill apparently  had been seeking revenge on his bosses.    Another co-worker, who declined to be identified, said he saw Taylor leave work  Wednesday night. He said Taylor seemed upset at the huge volume of mail he was  supposed to process.    ""He said he was going home early because 'there's not enough mail here,' "" the  co-worker said, adding that Taylor's remark was clearly facetious because  ""there was a ton of mail there.""    The same co-worker described Taylor was a ""mellow, easygoing guy"" who would  routinely get to work half an hour early and join two other employees on a  picnic table next to the loading dock for coffee each morning.    At 7:35 a.m., however, Taylor arrived at work and approached the same picnic  table and shot the two co-workers with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun,  killing both, police said. The names of the victims were not immediately  released by police.    Escondido Police Sgt. Blaine Bennett said Taylor then walked inside the back of  the post office and shot a co-worker through the arm. The victim, identified as  Paul Michael DeRisi, was taken to Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was  listed in stable condition.    Bennett said another co-worker, Phyllis DeVito, injured herself when she fell  during a mad scramble to flee the building. DeVito also was taken to the  hospital but was expected to be released this afternoon.

Final      Part A; Page 1; Column 6; Metro Desk      797 words      DISGRUNTLED POSTMAN GOES ON SHOOTING SPREE; 3 SLAIN;    ESCONDIDO GUNMAN IS BRAIN DEAD      By ROBERT WELKOS and TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writers      A disgruntled mailman today shot his wife to death, then drove to a nearby post  office in Escondido and opened fire on fellow employees, killing two and  wounding a third before putting the gun to his head and shooting himself.    The rampage, which began at 7:30 a.m. on East Valley Parkway on the eastern  edge of the northern San Diego County city, left postal workers scrambling for  safety. When the gunfire subsided, survivors were seen exchanging hugs and  crying quietly.    Police said the gunman, identified as John Merlin Taylor, 52, of Escondido,  apparently was prepared for a siege of the postal facility, but there was no  indication that he was looking for a specific person or a target.    ""He fired well over a dozen rounds, and there are expended cases all over the  floor there,"" Escondido Police Lt. Earl Callander said. ""There is also a box of  about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be used for reloading.""    Taylor was taken to nearby Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was placed on a  life support system and declared brain-dead shortly after 10 a.m.    U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Taylor had been a letter carrier  for 25 years and was nearing retirement. Taylor's boss described him as a model  employee, ""as mellow and      Increasing Pressure    Police said they knew of no motive for the shootings and believed that the  victims were shot randomly, but co-workers said Taylor had succumbed to  increasing pressure at work.    Two days ago, co-worker Johnny Sims recalled having a discussion with Taylor in  which the mailman mentioned the 1986 shooting rampage at the post office in  Edmond, Okla.    ""I think what may have happened is that we were talking about that thing that  happened at the Oklahoma post office,"" said Sims, who was not at work when the  Escondido shooting erupted.    ""We were talking about something and got around to saying, 'What if something  happened to one of the employees that would have gotten him mad and to go  berserk?' "" Sims added. ""We were just joking around.""    The Edmond shootings, which stunned the nation and is still much talked about  by postal workers who feel that the U.S. Postal Service is insensitive to its  employees, occurred when part-time mail carrier Patrick Sherrill massacred 14  co-workers, wounded six others and then committed suicide. Sherrill apparently  had been seeking revenge on his bosses.    Another co-worker, who declined to be identified, said he saw Taylor leave work  Wednesday night. He said Taylor seemed upset at the huge volume of mail he was  supposed to process.    ""He said he was going home early because 'there's not enough mail here,' "" the  co-worker said, adding that Taylor's remark was clearly facetious because  ""there was a ton of mail there.""    The same co-worker described Taylor was a ""mellow, easygoing guy"" who would  routinely get to work half an hour early and join two other employees on a  picnic table next to the loading dock for coffee each morning.    At 7:35 a.m., however, Taylor arrived at work and approached the same picnic  table and shot the two co-workers with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun,  killing both, police said. The names of the victims were not immediately  released by police.    Escondido Police Sgt. Blaine Bennett said Taylor then walked inside the back of  the post office and shot a co-worker through the arm. The victim, identified as  Paul Michael DeRisi, was taken to Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was  listed in stable condition.    Bennett said another co-worker, Phyllis DeVito, injured herself when she fell  during a mad scramble to flee the building. DeVito also was taken to the  hospital but was expected to be released this afternoon.    Post office manager Bob Henley said he was in his office when he heard shots  and saw one employee bleeding from the shoulder.    Henly said he saw Taylor walk toward him and then point a gun his way.    He said Taylor told him: ""I'm not going to shoot you"" and then fired in another  direction. Henley said he ""went back in and closed my office door, and I called  911.""    Postal worker Reginald Keith said he was in a custodial room when he heard the  shots.

Police also seized assault-style weapons and $250,000 in cash suspected of  being linked to drugs at homes in Artesia, Bell and Paramount.    The police agencies were led to the contraband by people suspected of being  drug dealers whom the officers first observed in the Fullerton area early  Tuesday during a separate drug investigation, Fullerton Police Capt. Lee DeVore  said.    ""Through the day we saw enough activity in transferring of drugs into cars and  switching cars that we were able to get search warrants for three residences,""  said DeVore, whose department headed the investigation.    After obtaining search warrants from a Downey Municipal Court judge on Tuesday  night, DeVore said 23 police officers conducted the raids in teams without  incident.    Most of the cocaine was discovered in the Artesia residence, as were the money  and weapons, DeVore said. Police seized two AK-47 assault rifles and several  semiautomatic handguns. Three of the four suspects were also arrested at the  Artesia residence. A fourth was detained at the Bell residence.    Booked into the Fullerton City Jail on suspicion of sale of cocaine were: Jorge  Cano, 27, of Artesia; his wife, Maria, 21; Jose Lopez, 21, of Los Angeles, and  Jose Heras, 28, of Bell. All four were being held under $1-million bonds for  each.    Fullerton police estimated the street value of the cocaine at $22 million. They  said the seizure ranked as their second largest, behind the March, 1988,  confiscation of 330 pounds of cocaine. The drugs will be held as evidence and  then destroyed, DeVore said. The $250,000 suspected of being drug money may be  returned to local police for their use in future drug investigations, he added.    DeVore said the cocaine seized this week apparently originated in Colombia, as  ""Republic of Colombia"" was stamped on sacks containing the powdery white drug.

By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 16-year-old Long Beach boy is being sought as the gunman who shot two deaf  brothers, killing one and wounding the other, in a scuffle in Granada Hills  that witnesses said escalated from a stare-down contest between strangers at a  traffic light, Los Angeles police said Thursday.    Police said the suspect was identified by two other teen-agers who came forward  Wednesday and told detectives they were among a carload of youths involved in  the confrontation that led to the shooting.    Cesar Vieira, 30, and Edward Vieira, 25, both of Palmdale, were shot Sunday  night in a parking lot at the intersection of Devonshire Street and Balboa  Boulevard. The older brother died early Monday of chest wounds. Edward Vieira  was treated for hip and shoulder wounds at a hospital and released.    Edward Vieira told police he and his brother were riding on a motorcycle when  they were forced off the road and into the parking lot by a car containing five  teen-agers, police said.    During the ensuing confrontation, the brothers -- who had limited speaking  skills and normally communicated through sign language -- were apparently  unable to understand what was happening, police said. One of the teen-agers  then opened fire with a handgun.    Police described the suspected gunman as an associate of members of a Skinhead  gang based in West Los Angeles. However, detectives said the shooting of the  Latino brothers apparently was not racially motivated.    The suspect's name and other details of his background were not released  because he is a juvenile, Detective Michael Brandt said.    Police said the boy has fled his home in Long Beach. Two other teen-age boys  who were in the car during the incident were still being sought for questioning  Thursday.    On Wednesday night, the two witnesses, a 16-year-old girl and a 17-year-old  boy, went with their parents to the Devonshire police station. Lt. Harvie  Eubank said the teen-agers were ""upset"" by the shooting, particularly after  learning that the brothers were deaf and may have not understood what was  happening during the confrontation.    The boy and girl, who are not gang members, are not expected to be charged,  Eubank said. However, their version of events differs from Edward Vieira's  account, he said.    According to Eubank, the two teen-agers said the shooting incident began when  the teen-agers in the car and the men on the motorcycle started staring at each  other at a traffic light. ""They said it started as a stare-down contest and  then somebody spit at the others and then they spit back,"" Eubank said.    Police said it was unclear who spit first or, in fact, if any spitting  occurred. Edward Vieira has told investigators he and his brother did nothing  that would have brought on the attack.    After the car followed the motorcycle into the parking lot, at least two of the  teen-agers got out, including the boy with the gun, police said.    ""It was the kind of traffic dispute that are a dime a dozen,"" Brandt said. ""But  in this case, one kid started shooting. The brothers did nothing to provoke  that.""    The teen-agers who came forward told police they had no idea the incident would  escalate into a shooting, Eubank said.    ""These kids thought it was going to be a fight,"" Eubank said. ""They said they  heard the first bang and saw Cesar was grazed with a bullet. They yelled, 'No,  don't shoot!' but this other kid kept firing.""

Clark, whose mother had reported him missing the day after the quake, was found  last Tuesday when he appeared in court for arraignment on burglary charges.    ""We crossed our fingers he would show for his court date,"" said Oakland Police  Officer Gary Foppiano, one of the main investigators searching for the missing.  ""He did.""    And so the missing were accounted for, gradually, methodically. A list of names  that once topped 280 -- and fanned fears that the quake's death toll would  reach a number four times what it now appears to be -- had dwindled to two by  week's end.    Some of the missing would turn up on a coroner's list, their bodies pulled from  the wreckage of the fallen Nimitz Freeway.    But many others, the majority in fact, would be accounted for through more  mundane circumstances: They were in jail, they were spending a night away from  home and had neglected to tell anybody, they were out of town.    The task of whittling down the missing persons list, fed by worried calls from  as far away as Spain and Finland, involved basic detective work coupled with a  large dose of common sense, persistent phone-checking and knocking on doors.    ""We were surprised we could get through it (the list) so fast,"" Foppiano said.    Most names on the list came out of telephone calls from friends, family members  or co-workers reporting someone had dropped out of sight. Other names were  added when crumpled cars were recovered from the Nimitz wreckage and the  drivers, whose names usually could be traced from the license plates, could not  be found at home or in hospitals.    Investigators worked from two ends: Oakland police tracked people; the  California Highway Patrol tracked vehicles.    From the first hours after the Oct. 17 quake, 20 police officers and support  personnel staffed a dozen telephone lines around the clock to take missing  persons reports. The phone number went out nationwide, and more than 1,000  calls poured in.    The calls were screened. Did the possible victim have reason to be in Oakland?  What was the likelihood he or she would have been on the Nimitz Freeway? Some  reports were vague -- people who said they had relatives ""visiting California.""  Others were more specific, signaling the Nimitz Freeway as the missing person's  normal route home.    The most remote, unlikely reports were discounted out of hand. The rest were  recorded and investigated. First, officers would call back the person who filed  the report every four hours to check whether the missing person had returned.    That process eliminated scores of names. Through the early days, the numbers on  the list fluctuated wildly -- up as high as 281 one day, down to fewer than 100  and then back up.    ""The names were constantly changing, the numbers were constantly changing,""  recalled Oakland Police Capt. Jim Hahn. ""You'd locate four people, five more  would be called in. . . . ""I guess we're going to have one heck of a phone  bill,"" Hahn continued. ""We were calling all over the place.""    Police also received a fax every six hours from hospitals updating their lists  of injured. This, too, helped to weed out names from the list of the missing.    As calls were being made, Highway Patrol and Fire Department rescue teams were  recovering cars and license plates from the Nimitz wreckage. Owners were being  traced through the plates, and investigators began matching those names with  names on the missing persons list.    By last Sunday, police believed that most cars on the freeway had been located,  and 38 bodies had been recovered. Forty-seven people remained unaccounted for,  according to Sgt. Greg Hughes, head of the Police Protective Services unit that  includes the missing persons bureau.    At that point, Hughes assigned two investigators to each name. Officers began  knocking on doors, visiting family and friends, leaving notices on vacant  houses asking residents to check with authorities, talking to neighbors.    Police from as far as Coral Gables, Fla., the listed address for one of those  reported missing, were called on to help track down people.    A Bakersfield man was reported missing by a friend and could not be located for  days because he and his wife were out of town on vacation. Another man,  reported missing by his wife in Washington, was AWOL from the Navy and claimed  to be suffering from a concussion that had left him disoriented, police said.    In addition to checking car and license registrations with the Department of  Motor Vehicles, police were also researching criminal ""rap sheets"" to find  arrest records. Some of the missing, at that point, were located in county  jails. Others had court dates -- like Elliot Clark -- for which they eventually  surfaced.    At the same time that police were making their checks, the California Highway  Patrol was tracing the plates on cars found at the site. In several cases, they  had to pursue a twisted paper trail because registrations were out of date or  improperly recorded.    The shells of 56 vehicles and two truck trailers remained trapped in the Nimitz  Freeway rubble as of Friday, their drivers accounted for in all but two cases.  Those last two cases were the only names left on the missing persons list  Friday, Hahn said, and police believe the two died on the freeway and their  bodies are entombed in concrete.    Many cars were found empty, their drivers having fled in the panicked moments  when the highway overpass they were traveling on began to shake violently. Some  made it, others did not.    One woman who survived the Nimitz disaster abandoned her car in the mangled  concrete, but did not report her whereabouts to authorities because she was so  traumatized, California Highway Patrol Officer Randy Price said.    For four days, until she finally came forward, she was another name on the  missing persons list because her empty car had been retrieved in rescue  operations.    ""She just couldn't deal with it,"" Price said. ""If you get out of something like  that unscathed, you are jubilant. Your first priority is not to contact the  police and tell them you survived.""    One name on the missing persons list was that of Buck Helm, the longshoreman  pulled from his crushed car Oct. 21, four days after the quake. As soon as Helm  was discovered, but before he was identified and rescued, a homicide detective  at the scene called Sgt. Hughes on a cellular phone with the license plate  number. Hughes matched it to Helm's name on the missing persons list.    Because so many of the names on the list could be easily accounted for, some  question has arisen about whether the Police Department should have released  what turned out to be an inflated number of missing.    Hahn said he repeatedly tried to caution journalists not to read too much into  initial numbers of missing.    But, in the early chaos that engulfed recovery operations at the Nimitz Freeway  disaster scene, Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer added to fears that the  toll was much higher by announcing that 250 people were believed killed in the  collapse. Plummer has since been quoted as saying his department was ""shooting  from the hip.""    Hahn said that although the number of missing first announced now seems  exaggerated, police were acting as responsibly as they could in difficult  circumstances.

By PAUL LIEBERMAN and JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      The problem drugs were heroin and powder cocaine in January, 1984, when the New  York Police Department tried a new tactic in an area of Manhattan's Lower East  Side that was considered the city's worst narcotics ""supermarket.""    In what was dubbed ""Operation Pressure Point,"" a four-block by eight-block area  was saturated with more than 200 officers, some working undercover but most  still in uniform -- enough to station an officer at virtually every corner.  ""They made car stops, strictly enforced traffic laws and conducted 'stop and  frisks' where appropriate,"" Sgt. Peter Sweeney said.    And they stayed for eight months.    The New York crackdown is the closest thing to a precedent for a law  enforcement campaign begun Thursday in Los Angeles, the ""Neighborhood Rescue  Operation"" in which police took the extra step of erecting barricades at  entrances to a square-mile area near MacArthur Park. Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates said 60 officers would patrol the area indefinitely.    Looking back at Operation Pressure Point, New York police view it as a  long-term success on the Lower East Side, but of far lesser value in other  neighborhoods where it was later tried. The key factor in long-term success,  they said, went beyond police work -- it was the ability of a community to  transform itself.    In the Lower East Side, Inspector Alfred James recalled, ""the area was ripe for  gentrification. There was a lot of money to rebuild.""    A year after the police influx began, business rents had doubled, artists had  discovered the area and real estate brokers were interested in once worthless  properties -- a dilapidated 16-story building formerly used as a ""shooting  gallery"" by addicts sold for $3.5 million.    But police hardly pretended that they had eliminated drug dealing. Although  there were more than 2,000 arrests the first month of Operation Pressure Point,  many dealers had simply moved elsewhere, gone indoors or developed new tactics  to avoid detection. Police did claim more success, through arrests and car  seizures, in deterring suburbanites from driving to the area to buy drugs -- a  problem Los Angeles officials say is severe near MacArthur Park.    ""People would drive in from Queens, (New) Jersey,"" James said. ""We gave out a  message to those people.""    But the conditions were different, he said, in an area of Harlem where  Operation Pressure Point II was conducted from March, 1984, through April 1985.    ""We made 12,000 arrests up there, but we didn't have the same impact,"" James  said, explaining that the drug buyers tended to be local and could walk two  blocks outside the police zone to find their drugs. In addition, there was no  gentrification to displace the ""bad elements"" once the massive police presence  ended.

By PAUL LIEBERMAN and JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      The problem drugs were heroin and powder cocaine in January, 1984, when the New  York Police Department tried a new tactic in an area of Manhattan's Lower East  Side that was considered the city's worst narcotics ""supermarket.""    In what was dubbed ""Operation Pressure Point,"" a four-block by eight-block area  was saturated with more than 200 officers, some working undercover but most  still in uniform -- enough to station an officer at virtually every corner.  ""They made car stops, strictly enforced traffic laws and conducted 'stop and  frisks' where appropriate,"" Sgt. Peter Sweeney said.    And they stayed for eight months.    The New York crackdown is the closest thing to a precedent for a law  enforcement campaign begun Thursday in Los Angeles, the ""Neighborhood Rescue  Operation"" in which police took the extra step of erecting barricades at  entrances to a square-mile area near MacArthur Park. Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates said 60 officers would patrol the area indefinitely.    Looking back at Operation Pressure Point, New York police view it as a  long-term success on the Lower East Side, but of far lesser value in other  neighborhoods where it was later tried. The key factor in long-term success,  they said, went beyond police work -- it was the ability of a community to  transform itself.    In the Lower East Side, Inspector Alfred James recalled, ""the area was ripe for  gentrification. There was a lot of money to rebuild.""    A year after the police influx began, business rents had doubled, artists had  discovered the area and real estate brokers were interested in once worthless  properties -- a dilapidated 16-story building formerly used as a ""shooting  gallery"" by addicts sold for $3.5 million.    But police hardly pretended that they had eliminated drug dealing. Although  there were more than 2,000 arrests the first month of Operation Pressure Point,  many dealers had simply moved elsewhere, gone indoors or developed new tactics  to avoid detection. Police did claim more success, through arrests and car  seizures, in deterring suburbanites from driving to the area to buy drugs -- a  problem Los Angeles officials say is severe near MacArthur Park.    ""People would drive in from Queens, (New) Jersey,"" James said. ""We gave out a  message to those people.""    But the conditions were different, he said, in an area of Harlem where  Operation Pressure Point II was conducted from March, 1984, through April 1985.    ""We made 12,000 arrests up there, but we didn't have the same impact,"" James  said, explaining that the drug buyers tended to be local and could walk two  blocks outside the police zone to find their drugs. In addition, there was no  gentrification to displace the ""bad elements"" once the massive police presence  ended.    In New York, the strategy of flooding an area with uniformed officers ended  when the nature of the drug problem changed in 1986 with the arrival of  low-priced ""crack"" cocaine.    Police decided to put their drug-fighting resources instead into ""T.N.T.,""  Tactical Narcotics Teams, which are essentially undercover operations to make  buys from, and arrest, pushers in selected violence-plagued neighborhoods.

It's not that the meetings don't involve serious work. But fun is a big factor  when the group rides horseback, patrolling streets in east Newhall, keeping  motorcyclists off private ranches or ensuring that big community events don't  get out of hand.    They are among the 38 members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's  Mounted Posse in the Santa Clarita Valley -- one of 14 sheriff's posses in the  county. Riding their own horses, members of the posse combine a love for horses  with law enforcement. And they do it for free, said Warford, the group's  coordinator for the last 11 years.    ""We're just a bunch of cowboys at heart,"" said Powell, who is a Los Angeles  County firefighter at the Sand Canyon station. ""It's nice to get away from the  rat race, to go out on the horse and take it easy.""    They go on training rides at least once a month and are called out for special  assignments an average of five or six times a year, Warford said. More than  anything else, the posse provides a highly visible law-enforcement presence  when large groups of people gather at parks and on streets for special events,  he said.    Half of the posse's riders are Los Angeles police officers who own horses and  live in the area, Warford said. For them, volunteering for the posse is a  refreshing break from filling out crime reports, checking for gang activity or  making drug busts. It's also an alternative to joining the Los Angeles Police  Department's own Mounted Unit, which recently stopped accepting part-time and  volunteer riders to become a full-time, professional detail.    Though they sometimes get grim assignments, such as looking for the remains of  lost hikers or searching for missing children, members say that most of the  time they are living it up while putting down crime from the saddle.    ""I enjoy doing this. My other job is work,"" said Harris, a detective in the  Police Department's robbery and homicide division at Parker Center in downtown  Los Angeles. ""It pretty much started out as a hobby with everybody. We just all  enjoy it.""    Los Angeles Police Officer Jean Posner, a horse lover since she was 3, said she  thought about joining her department's Mounted Unit but was concerned that she  might not qualify because of on-the-job injuries she suffered several years  ago. So she joined the sheriff's posse, which she said is not only easier on  her but also is better for her horse.    ""Sometimes in riots in L.A., my friends have had horses slashed by razor blades  or hit in the head with bottles,"" said Posner, who patrols low-income housing  projects in the Police Department's northeast valley Foothill Division. In the  Santa Clarita Valley, she said, ""the heavy-duty stuff is only in Newhall, off  Market Street and San Fernando Road, with people drinking in public.""    Of those posse members who aren't Los Angeles police officers, most are Level 2  sheriff's reservists, meaning they have had 13 weeks of Police Academy training  and are permitted to carry a service revolver on patrol, as long as they are  under the direct supervision of a full-time deputy, Warford said. All posse  members must complete a 40-hour horseback training course before joining the  unit.    Among the posse's assignments last year was the search in March for 7-year-old  Sara Nan Hodges, a Newhall girl whose body was later found in the bedroom of a  14-year-old neighbor, who has pleaded guilty to her murder. They also helped  authorities try to determine the location from which three horses escaped and  ran onto the Golden State Freeway in April, killing a 19-year-old motorist and  injuring another man when they collided with cars.    Reservist Rita Vanatter, a school nurse for the Westside Union School District  in the Antelope Valley, said the most gratifying part of being on the posse is  the attention the horses get from children.    ""They just want to touch your horse,"" she said. ""It's like the highlight of  their lives.""    Indeed, many posse members say, enforcing the law from the back of a horse is  kinder and gentler than doing it from a black-and-white patrol car or a  motorcycle.    When two park rangers were surrounded by a group of angry, intoxicated men last  year at the Castaic Lake State Recreation Area, the presence of mounted  deputies had an instant calming effect when the men saw their children's  fascination with the horses, a posse member said.    ""The kids see the horses, and the parents see the kids are happy,"" he said. ""It  calms everybody down.""    As far as major crime goes, posse members don't see much of that, and neither  do they really want to, Warford said.    ""We really haven't had exciting shoot-'em-up type things,"" he said. ""It seems  routine, but it's a chance to get out into the open and ride our horses.""

0,FT943-13051 ,"FT943-13051 _AN-EGVBQAFBFT 940721   FT  21 JUL 94 / Police to get 3% pay rise under Sheehy formula      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor   The 120,000 police officers in England and Wales will get a pay rise of 3 per cent from September 1 under a new pay formula recommended in the Sheehy report on police reorganisation. The rise is at the top end of public-sector groups - most civil servants and local-government employees will get just over 2 per cent - but below the 3.75 per cent that the police officers would have received under their old pay formula. The old pay formula linked the pay rise to the average earnings figure in May. The new formula links the pay rise to the median of private-sector non-manual pay settlements. The pay rise is accompanied by an overhaul of police pay and the agreement to introduce a new appraisal system in 1996. The new grading system will give many officers a substantial increase in their basic pay. The starting salary for a constable, for example, will rise from Pounds 12,744 to Pounds 13,585 and the lowest level for a sergeant will rise from Pounds 20,343 to Pounds 20,750. The total cost of the re-grading is about Pounds 65m but that will be covered by savings from other aspects of the restructuring. The most radical is an abolition of the housing allowance - about Pounds 4,000 per year - for new entrants, and a less frequent up-rating of the present allowance. There will also be a change in the way that police overtime is paid for, with some overtime no longer being paid for at all. The Police Federation said that the overall effect of the restructuring will be to reduce the pay of a new recruit by up to 20 per cent. Although many of the restructuring plans draw on proposals made in the Sheehy report the most radical Sheehy proposal - to abolish incremental scales - was rejected.

The  Philippine National Police is undertaking several security  measures to prevent the repetition of yesterday's bombings.    President Ramos has also ordered more police visibility in  strategic locations following the bombings by communist rebels.  He appealed to the people to stay calm as the national police  and the Armed Forces of the Philippines are tracking down the  bombers. The president was airborne on his way to Calaban,  Mindoro, when the three bombs exploded. The taxi driver hired  by the suspects was picked up by the police shortly after the  explosions in Makati. He is now undergoing interrogation to  help probers identify the bombers.    Press Secretary Jess [Jesus] Sison said the violence being  perpetrated by the ABB will worsen the situation and may affect  the peace process. Sison urged the people to remain calm and to  bring their complaints to the proper authorities and through  legal means. Earlier, the ABB claimed responsibility for the  bombings of the oil companies' offices.    Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief General Lisandro  Abadia  said that the military will fully support the national police in  its efforts to capture the bombers. Abadia said the armed  forces will not tolerate and allow these lawless elements to sow  terror among the public. The armed forces chief said that the  public should not be unduly alarmed by these attacks as the  military is conducting normal security measures to prevent its  repetition.    Meantime, Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro has assured that  adequate military measures are in place on vital facilities of  National Power Corporation, Philippine National Oil Company and  the Energy Regulatory Board. Lazaro said strict security is  being implemented in all energy offices to ensure adequate  protection for every official.    Police and the military are now under red alert following  yesterday's bombings of the offices of three oil companies. The  Philippine National Police has put into effect Oplan [operation  plan] Lawaan, in anticipation of several unrests over the oil  price increase. [Interior Secretary] Alunan said the violence  could send wrong signals to foreign investors.     "

There are about 110 teachers and administrators and 2,400 students at  Polytechnic High, school officials said.    Merritt said the investigation began in early December, when an unidentified  student told school police that Hammond was taking bets. School police asked  the Los Angeles Police Department to investigate.    Officers determined that Hammond took bets at the school during lunch breaks  and after school, recording each transaction in a notebook, Merritt said. ""He  never did it during classes,"" the police official said.    Under state education code and board policies, any teacher found guilty of  gambling either with students or on school grounds would be subject to  discipline ranging from a letter of reprimand to dismissal, said Ada Treiger,  an attorney for the school district.

Merritt said the investigation began in early December, when an unidentified  student told school police that Hammond was taking bets. School police asked  the Los Angeles Police Department to investigate.    Officers determined that Hammond took bets at the school during lunch breaks  and after school, recording each transaction in a notebook, Merritt said. ""He  never did it during classes,"" the police official said.    Under state education code and board policies, any teacher found guilty of  gambling either with students or on school grounds would be subject to  discipline ranging from a letter of reprimand to dismissal, said Ada Treiger,  an attorney for the school district.

The candidates, all of them police chiefs in smaller cities, are Richard M.  Tefank of Pomona, William E. Eastman of Pleasanton and Ronald E. Lowenberg of  Cypress. Each would get a raise by winning the Huntington Beach job, which pays  about $85,000 a year.    ""It's the second- or third-highest chief salary in the county,"" said Huntington  Beach City Administrator Paul Cook, for whom the police chief works. ""I still  have a little more work to do but I plan to make my recommendation before the  council meeting and hopefully they will decide that night.""    The new chief will succeed Grover (Bill) Payne, who retired Aug. 4 as the  department's most veteran officer. Payne, 54, who began his law enforcement  career in Huntington Beach in 1958, became chief in 1987, intending to retire  within a few years.    Capt. Donald Jenkins, who was not a candidate for the job, has been acting  chief for the past two weeks.    Cook said his final pick will be ""a team player, which is very important to  me.""    ""A lot of chiefs don't get involved (in the city's management team) and  basically run the police department as though it is a fiefdom of their own,"" he  said.

He will inherit a department of 213 sworn  officers who police a city of 187,000 residents plus thousands of visitors who  flock to the city's eight-mile shoreline.    Payne took the reins of the department when it was being sued for alleged  brutality in its use of stun guns on jailed men. The excessive-force  allegations and the lawsuits, which were settled before trial when the city  paid five defendants $60,000 each, represent the most controversial episode of  Payne's tenure.    In February, 1987, Eastman and Lowenberg were both candidates for the  Huntington Beach job. Cook said all three finalists have strong leadership and  management skills.    Eastman, 48, has been Pleasanton's police chief since July, 1981. He was a  captain with the West Covina police force before that. His 66 sworn officers  patrol a city of 52,000, according to Pleasanton Lt. Dave Freeman.    In July, Eastman, president of the California Police Chiefs Assn., wrote an  ""open letter"" to baseball player Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics and sent  it to the ballclub management. He chided Canseco for citations for driving with  a loaded gun in his car and for five speeding tickets, including one in  Pleasanton, a 45-minute drive from Oakland.    ""Your sniveling was quite profound when you bemoaned the fact that your  teammate, who was following you, was not ticketed,"" Eastman wrote toward the  end of the two-page letter. ""That's really class!""    Pleasanton Lt. Dave Freeman said Eastman, who could not be reached for comment,  is well-liked among the department's rank-and-file. ""Our officers association  -- he's always gotten along well with them,"" Freeman added.    Lowenberg, 43, has been Cypress police chief since December, 1981. He started  his law enforcement career as a patrol officer in Cypress in July, 1967, and  rose to sergeant in July, 1972. Lowenberg left Cypress in March, 1977, to  become a lieutenant for the Baldwin Park Police Department. He left two years  later and became a police captain in Tustin, where he remained until 1981.    He leads a department of 52 sworn officers that patrol a city of 45,000.    Cook praised Lowenberg's handling of the arrest and conviction of his son,  Robert E. Lowenberg, 21. The younger Lowenberg was sentenced to two years in  prison for starting two forest fires two summers ago.    The fires destroyed 7,100 acres of Cleveland National Forest and caused $2.7  million in damage. The younger Lowenberg went through voluntary drug and  alcohol rehabilitation. His father was supportive and open about the family  ordeal.    ""He is very well-liked here,"" said Nancy Leonard, the city personnel director.    Tefank, 44, has been with the Pomona Police Department for 16 1/2 years, the  past three as chief. Before that he spent four years with the Montclair Police  Department.

Thefts of the staple are increasing throughout Japan, traditionally known for an absence of petty crime beneath the big financial corruption scandals of the past few years. The agency said rice worth Y34m (Pounds 212,000) had been stolen in 208 incidents in the first nine months of the year, almost the same as for the whole of 1992. Police expect the number of thefts to rise as the harvest progresses from southern to northern regions. Police are worried by the spread in rice-stealing from criminals to ordinary workers, which they take to be a mark of the seriousness of the recession.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

0," LA020589-0130   14561    February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      San Gabriel Valley; Part 9; Page 1; Column 1      1914 words      BRACING FOR THE PAYBACK;    POLICE FEAR NEW ROUND OF GANG-RELATED BLOODSHED      By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer      POMONA      The car cruised through a dimly lit north Pomona neighborhood known as ""the  Islands"" on a recent Sunday night. A young gang member aimed a semi-automatic  military assault rifle through an open window and pulled the trigger.    By the time the shooting stopped, five people had been injured and a sixth,  19-year-old Guadalupe Carrillo Garcia, was dead from a bullet wound to the  stomach. Police don't believe that any of the victims were gang members. They  were just unlucky enough to be on the streets when a gang from elsewhere in the  city came to settle a score.    The night before, Charles Bradford Thomas, 30, a suspected gang member, was  killed in a drive-by shooting as he stood on the street in a northwest Pomona  neighborhood known as ""Sintown."" Police said the shooting was apparently the  result of a dispute between two rival gangs over drug-dealing territory.    A 17-year-old suspected gang member, whose name was not released because of his  age, was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the retaliatory  shooting spree. Police said they have not identified any suspects in the  shooting that triggered the violence.      Bloods or Crips    Police refused to name the gangs involved because they did not want to glorify  their exploits. However, they said most black gangs are affiliated with either  the Bloods or Crips, two Los Angeles-based gangs marked by their display of the  colors red or blue, their involvement in the drug trade, and their violent  antipathy for each other.    According to residents of northern Pomona, the Islands belong to a gang  affiliated with the Bloods, while Sintown is Crips territory. And either  neighborhood can be the site of bloodshed at anytime.    Both areas have been relatively peaceful since the shooting spree on Jan. 22,  but police and residents are bracing for the next round of confrontations and  pay-backs.    ""It's been quiet since then,"" said Sgt. Gary Elofson, who heads the Pomona  Police Department's Crimes Against Persons Unit. ""We don't expect it to stay  that way.""    Last month's shootings started the year off ominously in Pomona, which had only  two homicides involving black street gangs last year. Police are reluctant to  describe the incidents as symptomatic of increased activity by gangs affiliated  with Bloods and Crips, but others who monitor youth crime in the city are not.    ""It's really gotten out of hand,"" said Joe Barbosa, a deputy probation officer  with the Los Angeles County Probation Department. ""They're more aggressive  right now, the Crips in particular. I have a lot of juveniles, a lot of Crips,  getting busted left and right. A lot of it has to do with the dealing of crack  cocaine.""    In areas where Bloods and Crips are active, residents have grown accustomed to  the sound of gunfire and routinely keep children indoors when they hear rumors  of an incident brewing.    ""When I hear shooting, I stay in the house,"" said a resident of the Islands who  asked not to be quoted by name.    ""What's making it worse is all these drugs and (the gangs) trying to take over  each other's territories. . . . Don't print my name in the newspaper. I don't  want nobody shooting us up.""    Unlike the Latino gangs that have waged turf wars in Pomona for decades, gangs  in predominantly black areas are less prone to territorial violence. Instead,  they are more likely to be fighting for a share of the market in the booming  crack cocaine trade, police said.    And while police, working in conjunction with Catholic churches, have had some  success in cooling tensions among Latino gangs through summit meetings, no such  avenue to peace exists with black gangs.      'More Traditional Gangs'    ""The Hispanic gangs are the more traditional gangs, protective of turf and  territory,"" said Police Chief Richard Tefank. ""The black gangs are also  protective of turf and territory, but mainly as it relates to areas in which  they sell drugs.""    The intense rivalry among drug traffickers has been exacerbated, police said,  by the easy availability of semi-automatic assault rifles. Originally designed  for use by the armies of the United States, Israel and the Soviet Union, the  rifles have become the weapons of choice in street warfare.    ""The thing that makes this violence so much more critical to a community is the  weaponry that these people, who have no regard for human life, have access to,""  Tefank said. ""The last incident was tragic because it was an example of the  firepower these individuals possess as they drive through a neighborhood.""    In light of a shooting incident last month in which a gunman fired into a  crowded playground at a Stockton elementary school with an AK-47 assault rifle,  killing several children, bills have been introduced in the state Legislature  to restrict the sale of such weapons or ban them outright.    The Pomona City Council has drafted resolutions urging the Legislature to  prohibit semi-automatic rifles and asking members of Congress to cut off  foreign aid to countries in which illegal drugs are produced. However, not  everyone on the council approves of a ban on assault rifles.    ""I'm against that,"" said Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant. ""It's like the  (National Rifle Assn.) says: 'Guns don't kill people -- people kill people.' .  . . The bad guys love to see the good guys being disarmed.""      Weapons Ban    Tefank argued that a ban of such weapons is a crucial first step toward  controlling gang violence in Pomona.    ""The ridiculousness of letting someone purchase a weapon like that across the  counter immediately needs to be addressed,"" Tefank said. ""Then, simply the mere  possession of the weapon would be an arrestable offense. You wouldn't have to  wait for someone to use it.""    But until -- or if -- the Legislature takes action, the weapons are readily  available at gun stores. Purchasers may take assault rifles home immediately,  unlike handguns, for which there is a 15-day waiting period during which  authorities check the buyer's background. And police fear some of those  customers are gang members.    ""It definitely makes us out-gunned,"" Elofson said.    Pomona police are also overmatched. There are an estimated 1,300 gang members  in the city, but the police force has only 152 sworn officers, Tefank said.  Because of budget constraints, the department has increased its size by eight  officers over the last 10 years. During the same time, Pomona's population  jumped from 85,000 to 119,000.      Arrest Rate Rising    Last year, Pomona police arrested 9,672 people, an increase of 26.4% over the  number arrested in 1987. More than 30% of those arrests were related to gang  activity or drug dealing. Police said 135 gang members were arrested for  drug-related offenses last year. Arrests of juvenile offenders suspected of  felonies rose 61%.    Police last weekend mounted an intensive ""sweep"" in an attempt to stifle gang  activity in north Pomona. Officers in the department's Major Crimes Task Force  arrested 30 suspected gang members for offenses ranging from parole violation,  which can include simply associating with gang members or sporting gang colors,  to drug dealing and gun possession.    ""The pressure's going to continue,"" said Lt. Charles Heilman, one of two  detectives specializing in gang activity. ""One of (the gangs') primary  functions is cocaine dealing, and the more heat we put on them, the more  difficult it is for them to sell their drugs.""    Tefank has asked the City Council for funds to hire an additional 25 sworn  officers and 10 ""paraprofessional"" officers who would fill out accident reports  and perform other routine duties to free police to spend more time on the  street.    However, City Administrator A. J. Wilson has advised the City Council that the  expansion, with an expected cost of more than $1.4 million a year, is not  feasible given Pomona's lean budget. Wilson had suggested that the council  could add some officers if it delayed a cut in the city's unpopular 11% payroll  tax, but the council declined to take this politically dangerous step.    Smith said that in light of the most recent spate of shootings, council members  may now have to ""bite the bullet"" and take whatever measures are necessary to  provide more police. But, she said, even a major increase in the number of  officers would not bring gang violence to an end.      Solution Is Education    ""We could put 30, 40, 50 more officers on the street and throw a lot of money  at the problem and still not stop it,"" Smith said. ""The problem is larger than  Pomona.""    Tefank agrees.    ""More officers are part of the solution, but the reality is you can't have  officers everywhere 24 hours a day,"" he said. ""The long-term solution is  education for the young people not to be involved in gangs and a job level  where they won't have to get involved with drug-dealing.""    City officials and community leaders agree that education and economics are at  the root of the city's gang and drug problems.    Gang members are often dropouts or poor students who are unqualified to work at  anything but minimum-wage jobs. They are attracted to gang life by the easy  money to be made selling crack.    ""As long as they're making $500 a day dealing drugs, there's no way they're  going to take a $3.65-an-hour job,"" Bryant said, repeating a truism. ""There has  to be more in life for them than standing on the streets dealing drugs. That's  a hell of an environment. And we're providing that kind of environment.""    Smith said the city is working with civic organizations to provide recreation  programs for younger teen-agers and is receiving help from local companies to  give gang members job skills and opportunities.      'Out of Gangs, Into Jobs'    ""We're trying to get these people out of gangs and into jobs,"" she said. ""We're  trying to show people that belonging to a gang is not glamorous, and if you get  involved in that way of life, you're going to pay the consequences.""    Willie White, outreach director for the Pomona YMCA, is among those who must  try to persuade gang members to give up their lucrative but dangerous life  styles. The proliferation of single-parent households subsisting on welfare and  the dearth of job opportunities make that task all the more difficult.    ""Some of the kids are supporting their families by selling drugs,"" White said.  ""I don't blame the kids for a lot these things. I blame the parents, I blame  the elected officials and I blame the educators. Until our leaders make up  their minds that they really want to do something about these drugs and  weapons, we're still going to have them.""    The task of correcting large-scale social problems of poverty and poor  education, like efforts to stem the flow of drugs and arms, seem beyond the  scope of community organizations, city councils and local law enforcement.      'Fighting for Our Lives'    ""As cities, we're fighting for our lives and we're just not getting the help  and support from the higher levels of government,"" Smith said. ""We cannot do it  alone.""    Until the answer to the gang dilemma is found, White will keep trying his sales  pitch on the jaded teen-agers who earn their livelihoods while risking death on  the streets of north Pomona.    Said White: ""A lot of these young people try to tell me how well they're doing  and how much money they've got in their pockets. I turn around and tell them:  'The guy who's taken the minimum-wage job may be struggling, but at least he  doesn't have to look over his shoulder every time he hears a car backfire. A  lot of people in your line of work don't live past 35.' ""      Photo, Sgt. Gary Elofson of the Pomona Police Dept. holds an AK-47 with  bayonet. LOU MACK / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Jose Sanchez sits in the  bullet-pocked car on Adler Street in Pomona where his wife's cousin, Guadalupe  Carrillo Garcia, was killed when a young gang member driving by fired a  semi-automatic assault rifle at him.    "," LA020589-0130   14561    February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      San Gabriel Valley; Part 9; Page 1; Column 1      1914 words      BRACING FOR THE PAYBACK;    POLICE FEAR NEW ROUND OF GANG-RELATED BLOODSHED      By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer      POMONA      The car cruised through a dimly lit north Pomona neighborhood known as ""the  Islands"" on a recent Sunday night. A young gang member aimed a semi-automatic  military assault rifle through an open window and pulled the trigger.    By the time the shooting stopped, five people had been injured and a sixth,  19-year-old Guadalupe Carrillo Garcia, was dead from a bullet wound to the  stomach. Police don't believe that any of the victims were gang members. They  were just unlucky enough to be on the streets when a gang from elsewhere in the  city came to settle a score.    The night before, Charles Bradford Thomas, 30, a suspected gang member, was  killed in a drive-by shooting as he stood on the street in a northwest Pomona  neighborhood known as ""Sintown."" Police said the shooting was apparently the  result of a dispute between two rival gangs over drug-dealing territory.    A 17-year-old suspected gang member, whose name was not released because of his  age, was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the retaliatory  shooting spree. Police said they have not identified any suspects in the  shooting that triggered the violence.      Bloods or Crips    Police refused to name the gangs involved because they did not want to glorify  their exploits. However, they said most black gangs are affiliated with either  the Bloods or Crips, two Los Angeles-based gangs marked by their display of the  colors red or blue, their involvement in the drug trade, and their violent  antipathy for each other.    According to residents of northern Pomona, the Islands belong to a gang  affiliated with the Bloods, while Sintown is Crips territory. And either  neighborhood can be the site of bloodshed at anytime.    Both areas have been relatively peaceful since the shooting spree on Jan. 22,  but police and residents are bracing for the next round of confrontations and  pay-backs.    ""It's been quiet since then,"" said Sgt. Gary Elofson, who heads the Pomona  Police Department's Crimes Against Persons Unit. ""We don't expect it to stay  that way.""    Last month's shootings started the year off ominously in Pomona, which had only  two homicides involving black street gangs last year. Police are reluctant to  describe the incidents as symptomatic of increased activity by gangs affiliated  with Bloods and Crips, but others who monitor youth crime in the city are not.    ""It's really gotten out of hand,"" said Joe Barbosa, a deputy probation officer  with the Los Angeles County Probation Department. ""They're more aggressive  right now, the Crips in particular. I have a lot of juveniles, a lot of Crips,  getting busted left and right. A lot of it has to do with the dealing of crack  cocaine.""    In areas where Bloods and Crips are active, residents have grown accustomed to  the sound of gunfire and routinely keep children indoors when they hear rumors  of an incident brewing.    ""When I hear shooting, I stay in the house,"" said a resident of the Islands who  asked not to be quoted by name.    ""What's making it worse is all these drugs and (the gangs) trying to take over  each other's territories. . . . Don't print my name in the newspaper. I don't  want nobody shooting us up.""    Unlike the Latino gangs that have waged turf wars in Pomona for decades, gangs  in predominantly black areas are less prone to territorial violence. Instead,  they are more likely to be fighting for a share of the market in the booming  crack cocaine trade, police said.    And while police, working in conjunction with Catholic churches, have had some  success in cooling tensions among Latino gangs through summit meetings, no such  avenue to peace exists with black gangs.      'More Traditional Gangs'    ""The Hispanic gangs are the more traditional gangs, protective of turf and  territory,"" said Police Chief Richard Tefank. ""The black gangs are also  protective of turf and territory, but mainly as it relates to areas in which  they sell drugs.""    The intense rivalry among drug traffickers has been exacerbated, police said,  by the easy availability of semi-automatic assault rifles. Originally designed  for use by the armies of the United States, Israel and the Soviet Union, the  rifles have become the weapons of choice in street warfare.    ""The thing that makes this violence so much more critical to a community is the  weaponry that these people, who have no regard for human life, have access to,""  Tefank said. ""The last incident was tragic because it was an example of the  firepower these individuals possess as they drive through a neighborhood.""    In light of a shooting incident last month in which a gunman fired into a  crowded playground at a Stockton elementary school with an AK-47 assault rifle,  killing several children, bills have been introduced in the state Legislature  to restrict the sale of such weapons or ban them outright.    The Pomona City Council has drafted resolutions urging the Legislature to  prohibit semi-automatic rifles and asking members of Congress to cut off  foreign aid to countries in which illegal drugs are produced. However, not  everyone on the council approves of a ban on assault rifles.    ""I'm against that,"" said Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant. ""It's like the  (National Rifle Assn.) says: 'Guns don't kill people -- people kill people.' .  . . The bad guys love to see the good guys being disarmed.""      Weapons Ban    Tefank argued that a ban of such weapons is a crucial first step toward  controlling gang violence in Pomona.    ""The ridiculousness of letting someone purchase a weapon like that across the  counter immediately needs to be addressed,"" Tefank said.

The police have  declared war on these gangs, on illegal drugs and on drug  trafficking, he said.    ""I cannot say much about the police plans, but we have  identified some 27 gangs linked to drugs and who are operating  in the Corporate Area, the Commissioner told THE GLEANER.    Metropolitan Crime Officer, Senior Superintendent Forbes,  said the thrust in apprehending the drug ""lords"" will be  intelligence-driven. This was in keeping with the recent  statement by Minister of National Security and Justice, K.D.  Knight, that the new type of policing will depend mostly on  intelligence.    Some of the communities identified by the police where the  drug gangs operate out of are: Central Kingston, Tivoli Gardens,  Upper Oxford Street, Hannah Town, Jones Town, Waterhouse and  McIntyre Villa in the Kingston 16 area.    Information reaching THE GLEANER is that some of these  communities are now being probed by the police.    Mr. Forbes said in the past there have been speculations as  to the link between drugs and guns, but the police have now  positively established that there is a link, as in some cases  drug money is used to purchase guns.    The Anti-Narcotic Department of the Force will play a major  role in the drive against these drug gangs. The Division was the  recipient of 18 new motor vehicles and some communication  equipment yesterday.    The vehicles include eight Toyota Corollas, four Isuzu  Troopers, two Isuzu double-cab pick-ups, one Isuzu single cab  pick-up, one Hiace 15 seater bus, one Toyota panel van and one  Isuzu five-ton truck. They were donated to the Ministry of  National Security and Justice by the United Nations  International Drug Control Programme.    Mr. Knight said the police have been working hard and wanted  to double their efforts to combat the drug problem.    Last year, the police recovered 80.79 kilograms of cocaine,  673 pieces of crack, one kilogram of heroin and 123.93 kilograms  of hash oil; and a total of 6,915 persons were arrested by the  police for breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.

General Zaikidze, an ally of President Eduard Shevardnadze,  was sacked late Thursday, the ministry said.    Hours earlier hundreds of police, many armed with automatic  weapons, stormed the parliament building to protest the  nomination of a new interior minister they charged was unfit for  the job.    Shevardnadze, who was present in the legislature at the time  of the incident, persuaded Zaikidze to withdraw his men.    The police chief then blockaded himself in his office at  service headquarters, demanding the dismissal of new Interior  Minister Shota Kviraya, whose nomination was confirmed Thursday.    Zaikidze, whose dismissal was ordered by Georgia's military  court and the Interior and Security Ministries, remained  barricaded in his office Friday morning.     "

The four-day weekend, which was marked by excellent weather, also saw thousands  of arrests and citations for violations such as drunk driving and disturbing  the peace. All this came as beach city police geared up to handle anticipated  overflow crowds along the coast. And their predictions were correct.      'First Good Weather All Summer'    ""We started to get nice weather on Friday, and it was the first good weather  we've had all summer,"" said Huntington Beach Police Lt. Mike Biggs, who  reported that 110,000 people crowded onto the city beach on Tuesday in the  biggest attendance of the weekend.    ""Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday we had terrific weather,"" he said. ""Today  (Wednesday) we have fog and wind. We would have preferred to have this the rest  of the weekend. It would have made the crowds a lot smaller.""    The Santa Ana office of the California Highway Patrol reported that two adults  and an unborn child were victims of traffic accidents in Orange County during  the period that began at 6 p.m. Friday and ended at midnight Tuesday. In all,  said Leslie Lazo, a spokeswoman for the CHP in Westminster, there were 78  traffic-related fatalities statewide.    The motorcycle death in Newport Beach came at 9:20 p.m. Tuesday when Dietrich  Charles Long, heading south on MacArthur Boulevard near San Joaquin Hills Road,  was hit by a pickup truck. The truck was driven by Ira Louis Radstone, 21, of  Lancaster, said Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman.    A preliminary investigation showed that Radstone apparently was trying to make  a U-turn over a painted center divider when his truck collided with the  motorcycle. Long was not wearing a helmet, Newman said. Long was treated by  paramedics and then taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, where he died,  Newman said.    Police did not cite or arrest Radstone, Newman said, but an investigation is  continuing.    Another fatality occurred Monday in Huntington Beach when Jewel Gray, 86, of  Huntington Beach was struck by a car as she was trying to cross Brookhurst  Street near Kamuela Drive. Gray died Tuesday at UCI Medical Center in Orange.    Huntington Beach Police Lt. Ed McErlain said there was no traffic light at the  intersection, and no marked crosswalk. He said there was no evidence that the  driver of the car, Susan Kane, 23, of Bellflower, was speeding and she was not  charged. An investigation is continuing, he said.    On Sunday, a 29-year-old woman who was 7 months pregnant was struck in a  hit-and-run accident in Santa Ana, killing the unborn child.    The holiday problems in Orange County were not confined to the streets.    Police arrested six youths in connection with a stabbing Tuesday night after a  brawl at the Huntington Beach Pier.    The six, from Los Angeles and Duarte and ranging in age from 14 to 17, were  taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall and arrested on suspicion of attempted  murder in connection with the stabbing.    The 17-year-old Los Angeles youth, whose name was withheld, was stabbed as he  and some friends were fighting with another group of six boys Tuesday in a  parking lot near Pacific Coast Highway, just south of the pier at Huntington  Street, McErlain said. The victim was reported in serious condition at Fountain  Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, he said.    Huntington Beach's Lt. Biggs said officers issued 190 citations on Tuesday  alone. He did not have a tally of the weekend's citations, but said, ""As Fourth  of Julys go, it was about average.""    Most of citations were for alcohol-related infractions, he said. ""There were a  few assaults. The rest fell into the normal run-of-the-mill drinking and  possession-of-drug charges,"" he said. ""It's our biggest problem -- people  drinking on the beach.""    In Newport Beach, a special two-day operation Monday and Tuesday placed 150  officers on the street at one time, a contrast to the usual 30 to 40 on a  regular day, Lt. Newman said.    Newman said there were 172 arrests made during the two days, compared to 224  from the year before. On a regular, non-holiday night, there might be only 30  arrests, he said.    ""They were predominantly alcohol-related offenses, drunk driving, drunk in  public, assault, disturbing the peace -- a wide variety of things,"" he said.  But the penalty was a bit stiffer this year.    ""If you broke the law on the Fourth of July in Newport Beach, you probably went  to jail,"" he said.    He also said a lifeguard stand at 40th Street was torched on Tuesday night.    Three males were seen running from the scene, but there are no suspects in  custody, he said.

0,FT932-8882 ,"FT932-8882 _AN-DEQB4ABCFT 930517   FT  17 MAY 93 / Home Office to come under police fire over spending curbs      By ALISON SMITH and ALAN PIKE   THE HOME OFFICE is likely to come under fire today over plans to limit government spending on the police service. Police authorities and chief constables are to press senior Home Office officials for further details. The change away from the current arrangement, under which the Home Office provides 51 per cent of local authority spending on policing, will come as part of the reorganisation announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, in March. Mr Clarke will address the Police Federation conference this week. At last year's conference he used his first big speech as home secretary to announce a wide-ranging inquiry into the structure of the police service. While his announcement was welcomed at the time for giving chief constables greater authority over their budgets, the police and local authorities have since become more cautious about the proposals. When Mr Clarke appears at the Blackpool conference on Wednesday he will see that the service's instinct for suspicion has heightened over the past 12 months. He will face heavy criticism for failing to involve police representatives in advance consultations on what are likely to prove the biggest changes in modern times. The inquiry, chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, will report by the end of next month. It will almost certainly lead to a flatter management structure, the abolition of some senior ranks above inspector level, and a form of performance or task-related pay. Mr Clarke, while awaiting Sir Patrick's report, has done his own detective work in areas outside the inquiry's scope. As a result he has started plans to restructure police authorities into smaller, more businesslike bodies with national objectives and fewer local authority representatives. Police officers of all ranks, worried that a giant programme for change will gather pace before they have had formal opportunities to influence it, have launched a campaign to win public support. In an attempt to present the service's case widely, the Association of Chief Police Officers has taken the unusual step of publishing a fact sheet designed to 'unravel some of the mythology about the role of the police'. The document, issued with the support of the Superintendents' Association and the federation - which represents all other ranks - is being sent to influential people in local communities. The changes proposed by Mr Clarke also worry local authorities. Some senior local government figures fear that, in practice, the move could lead to a cash limit on all current police spending. The proportion of police spending met by local authorities will be brought under even tighter control. There are also concerns about how central government grant will be allocated, now that the Home Office is abandoning the system of recommended levels for police forces. The representatives at today's meeting with Home Office officials are likely to seek assurances about levels of police funding under the new arrangement. One Whitehall official described the change as a 'Faustian' deal in which the Home Office won Treasury agreement to its plan only because it is seen as a way of imposing a ceiling on the Pounds 6bn-a-year police budget. The change is not due until 1995-96 because it requires legislation which will not be introduced until the autumn at the earliest. A study carried out for the Sheehy inquiry last month by Ernst  Young and Towers Perrin, management consultants, showed that, while many forces have reformed their management structures there has been little reduction in management costs over the past two years. Mr Clarke has kept his pledge to await the Sheehy inquiry's report rather than charging into change; but this is just the sort of evidence he will use when, in about a month's time, he dons his riot gear and gives himself the signal to charge.

OFFICIAL SAYS      By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and DAVID TREADWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NEW YORK      Authorities said Tuesday that the alleged assassin of controversial Jewish  activist Rabbi Meir Kahane was an Egyptian-born municipal maintenance worker in  New York City's criminal courts building who apparently acted alone.    Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said that initial indications were that  34-year-old El-Sayyid A. Nosair, who arrived in the United States from Egypt in  1981 and became a naturalized citizen last year, was not part of any conspiracy  with other individuals or groups.    ""Right now, what we have is a lone gunman who committed a homicide in New  York,"" Borrelli told reporters at a late afternoon news conference.    Nosair, who remained at Bellevue Hospital in critical but stable condition, was  formally charged with murder and related charges on Tuesday. Nosair was wounded  by a U.S. Postal Service guard as he fled the hotel were Kahane was killed.  Authorities said that it might be several days until Nosair would be capable of  responding to intensive questioning.    Kahane, 58, a founder of the Jewish Defense League and former member of the  Israeli Parliament who advocated expelling Arabs from Israel and its  territories, was shot Monday night. He had just finished addressing a group of  his supporters known as Jewish Idea at the New York Marriott East Side Hotel  when a gunman identified as Nosair approached and began shooting.    Police were seeking a search warrant to enter the New Jersey residence where  Nosair is believed to have lived with his wife, Caren, and three young  children.    Borrelli said that detectives had questioned Nosair's wife, but that she  claimed to have no prior knowledge of her husband's whereabouts on the night of  Kahane's murder or of any possible motive Nosair might have had for the  shooting.    ""In her words, she's a good Muslim wife and never questions her husband,"" he  said.    Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said that, despite no signs of a conspiracy,  authorities were taking extensive precautions to guard both Jewish and Arab  institutions in the city, including the Israeli and Egyptian missions to the  United Nations, the offices of El Al Israel Airlines and New York's local  Jewish publications.    ""We're working very closely with the FBI and the State Department and all  relevant international agencies to determine where the suspect came from and if  he had any connection with any other individuals . . . or any connection with  any particular group or organization,"" Brown said at the news conference.    The commissioner said that the police investigation was being conducted with a  view toward the problems in the Middle East and ""how those problems may affect  the safety of residents here in the city of New York.""    However, he said, police were unaware of any threats against Kahane prior to  the shooting and were not providing him with protection.    As police delivered the status report on their investigation, thousands of  mourners -- some holding signs vowing ""Revenge"" and ""Never Again"" -- packed a  small, yellow-brick Brooklyn synagogue and the street outside during funeral  services for Kahane.    The controversial Jewish activist was lauded as ""a talented leader . . . a  giant and a sword"" during the militant but emotional afternoon ceremony.    Security was heavy as police closed the block in front of the synagogue to all  vehicular traffic. The crowd was so thick that many who wished to pay tribute  to Kahane were unable to enter the synagogue. After the service, Kahane's body  was flown from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Israel for burial.    Police and immigration officials said Tuesday that Nosair was born in Port  Said, Egypt, in 1955 and arrived in the United States from Egypt in 1981. Two  years later, while residing in Pittsburgh, Pa., he received permanent alien  status and in 1989, in Newark, N.J., he became a naturalized American citizen.    He met and married his wife, an American who practices the Islamic faith, in  Pittsburgh. They have two boys and a girl, the oldest of whom is 8.    The family resided at several addresses in New Jersey. However, Nosair listed  the address of a relative in Brooklyn when he applied for his job with the city  government.    He has worked as an air-conditioning maintenance man since April, 1988, at the  criminal courts building in Manhattan, according to a spokesman for the city  Department of General Services.    At one point, his children attended an Islamic school in Jersey City, just  across the Hudson River from Manhattan.    Borrelli said that Nosair's co-workers at the criminal courts building had been  questioned but they reported ""nothing unusual"" about Nosair.    ""We have not as yet determined and gotten a true motive in this case,"" Borrelli  said. ""There were no shouts . . . no conversation between the assailant and  Rabbi Kahane before the shooting.""    Kahane was shot just after he delivered a lecture about Israel and the Persian  Gulf crisis to about 100 people in the hotel. Police said he was struck by at  least one bullet, possibly two, fired from a .357-caliber Ruger revolver.    Swathed in anti-shock garb by paramedics, Kahane was rushed to Bellevue  Hospital, where physicians pronounced him dead at 9:57 p.m.    Soon afterward, Kahane's supporters arrived at the hospital and held a prayer  vigil.    Police said that after shooting Kahane, Nosair fled from the floral-carpeted  meeting room and fled down a hallway, where he encountered Irving Franklin, 73,  who was selling literature about the meeting. Nosair shot Franklin in the leg  and continued his flight.    Franklin was in stable condition at Bellevue.    Police said that Nosair commandeered a taxi at gunpoint outside the hotel but  jumped out after the cab had driven only about 75 feet at East 48th Street and  Lexington Avenue. There were conflicting reports on why Nosair exited the cab.  One version said the driver had fled; the other said the cab got stuck in heavy  traffic.    Upon leaving the taxi, Nosair was confronted by a uniformed U.S. Postal Service  police officer, Carlos Acosta, 55. Borrelli said that Nosair fired at Acosta,  striking him in the chest.    ""Fortunately, he was wearing his bulletproof vest,"" the chief of detectives  said.    Acosta wounded Nosair in the chin during a brief exchange of gunfire.    Nosair was charged with second-degree murder, first-degree attempted murder,  second-degree assault, criminal possession of a weapon and unlawful  imprisonment for holding the cabdriver hostage briefly.    Police said the serial number had been obliterated from the revolver Nosair  allegedly used to slay Kahane.    For more than two decades, Kahane has been a controversial figure, both in the  United States and Israel, where he was expelled from the parliament after his  extremist party was banned.    Most mainstream Jewish organizations condemned his philosophy and tactics.    Kahane founded the militant Jewish Defense League in 1968 because of what he  described as the growing anti-Semitism of black militant groups.    Kahane was arrested many times in New York on charges of participating in  disorderly protests. In July, 1971, two months before he moved to Israel, he  was given a five-year suspended sentence and fined $5,000 after being convicted  of conspiring to manufacture explosives.

By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Los Angeles Police Lt. Alan B. Kerstein had taken a day off from his usual  duties at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when the unthinkable happened and  stadium security completely collapsed.    The calamitous event did not occur during a heavy-metal rock concert or an  international soccer match. It was a Los Angeles Raiders football game.    As the clock ticked down on the Raiders' 1984 AFC championship victory over the  Seattle Seahawks, police and private security officers ""lost"" the playing field  to an onslaught of several thousand celebrating fans.    Petite Raiderette cheerleaders and 275-pound linebackers scrambled for safety  while police officers launched several unsuccessful baton-wielding sorties  against the unruly fans. Reinforcements, including 10 officers on horseback --  a cavalry charge of sorts -- finally succeeded in restoring order.    For Kerstein, who has policed Coliseum events since 1973, the crowd surge was a  grim reminder that controlling fans at professional football games is perhaps  the toughest challenge he and other stadium security officials face.    Police officials who monitor crowd safety at the Coliseum, at Anaheim Stadium  and at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego agree that keeping the peace at a  baseball game or even a tractor pull is child's play compared to Sunday  afternoon pro football.    ""This is not the opera, it's the NFL,"" observed Kerstein, who supervises Los  Angeles police officers at Coliseum events. 'You can't expect people to just  sit there and politely clap and say 'jolly good, jolly good.' ""    How to prevent the most violent incidents at football games has become a  subject of debate since the beating of a 35-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers'  supporter during a Raiders game last month. The man was briefly in a coma as  the result of his injuries, but has since been released from a hospital.    Although it was not the first time a fan had been injured at a Raiders game,  the severity of the beating led to calls for beefed-up security at the  Coliseum.    Some have advocated a ban on the sale of beer at the stadium, arguing that  drunken fans are responsible for the rowdiest behavior.    Last week, Coliseum officials announced that they would no longer sell beer in  20-ounce cups, opting instead for 16-ounce containers. The Coliseum Commission  is now considering implementing a temporary ban on beer sales at Raiders games  as part of a plan to reduce stadium violence.    An average of 20,000 cups of beer are sold at Raiders games.    While police officials agree that drunkenness is a major contributor to stadium  violence during football games, they disagree on whether banning alcohol sales  would solve the problem.    ""It's true that our most frequent contacts are with people who have had too  much to drink,"" said San Diego Police Lt. Bill Skinner, who is responsible for  security at Jack Murphy Stadium. ""But I can't say the problems are caused by  people who buy beer inside the stadium. There's tailgate parties in the parking  lot.""    Richard Beam, director of operations for the Los Angeles Rams, said, ""Football  has always (appealed) to people who want to transfer their hostilities, and  alcohol increases that urge and cuts down their inhibitions.""    For Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim Flammini, who supervises security at Anaheim  Stadium, home of the Rams, the problems are linked to the nature of  professional football itself.    When 80,000 people of various temperaments and income levels pack a stadium to  watch grown men beat each other into the ground for three hours, he said, a few  slugfests in the stands are inevitable.    ""You're in an environment that is very high in emotions,"" Flammini said.  ""Professional football is a rough-and-tumble contact sport. It seems to have a  way of exciting people. . . . If someone says the wrong thing at the wrong  time, (other fans) might want to defend their team, either verbally or  sometimes with their fists.""    By contrast, Flammini said, California Angels' baseball games are relatively  placid events.    ""The baseball behavior has been fantastic,"" Flammini said. ""We've had very few  incidents as compared to last year.""    Anaheim Stadium manager Greg Smith said to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages  would require an agreement among the city of Anaheim, the Los Angeles Rams and  the California Angels because the teams and the city split the revenue. No such  ban has been considered, he said.    For police officials, the best defense against ugly incidents at football games  is to teach officers basic crowd-control strategies and the elements of mass  psychology.    At the Coliseum, Lt. Kerstein commands about 80 to 100 Los Angeles police  officers for most events, although the number of assigned officers has  increased significantly for Raiders games after last month's incident.    Kerstein said his officers play close attention to sections 1 through 4 and 26  through 29 because those seats are sold to fans who do not have season tickets.    ""Season ticket holders tend to be much more focused on the game and less  aggressive,"" Kerstein said. ""For every one fight I'll have within the confines  of the season ticket area, I'll have 25 or 50 fights outside of those areas.""    Another fundamental rule Kerstein teaches his officers is that they should  avoid plunging alone into the stands to break up a fight. Instead, he said,  they should work in teams of six.    Ideally, four officers break up the fight itself, separating troublemakers as  quickly as possible from the rest of the crowd in ""commando-like strikes,""  Kerstein said. All the while, two other officers guard the rear to ensure that  the officers are not hit from behind by fans throwing bottles or other objects.    If necessary, the unruly fans are then handcuffed in the relative safety of the  stadium tunnel.    ""You can't go too far into the crowd alone because it really presents an  officer-safety issue,"" Kerstein said. ""Sometimes I've had to go in alone  because of the situation.""    Besides the near-riot that occured when the Raiders beat the Seahawks and the  fans converged on the field in 1984, the worst day Kerstein can remember was in  1988, when the Raiders played host to the Rams, who won the game 22-17.    ""If sections 1 through 15 had been all Raiders fans and 15 to 31 had been all  Rams fans, I could have done the whole thing with five cops -- piece of cake,""  Kerstein said.

Kerstein said that just moments before the incident, he had called for officers  deployed outside the stadium to help reinforce security in the stands.

STADIUMS: ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND ARRESTS The relationship between fan violence  and alcohol sales at Southern California stadiums has been a subject of debate  since the Sept. 23 incident in which a Pittsburgh Steelers fan was severely  beaten while cheering his team at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Following  are figures comparing alcohol consumption by fans and arrest rates at four  major Southern California stadiums.

By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Los Angeles Police Lt. Alan B. Kerstein had taken a day off from his usual  duties at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when the unthinkable happened and  stadium security completely collapsed.    The calamitous event did not occur during a heavy-metal rock concert or an  international soccer match. It was a Los Angeles Raiders football game.    As the clock ticked down on the Raiders' 1984 AFC championship victory over the  Seattle Seahawks, police and private security officers ""lost"" the playing field  to an onslaught of several thousand celebrating fans.    Petite Raiderette cheerleaders and 275-pound linebackers scrambled for safety  while police officers launched several unsuccessful baton-wielding sorties  against the unruly fans. Reinforcements, including 10 officers on horseback --  a cavalry charge of sorts -- finally succeeded in restoring order.    For Kerstein, who has policed Coliseum events since 1973, the crowd surge was a  grim reminder that controlling fans at professional football games is perhaps  the toughest challenge he and other stadium security officials face.    Police officials who monitor crowd safety at the Coliseum, at Anaheim Stadium  and at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego agree that keeping the peace at a  baseball game or even a tractor pull is child's play compared to Sunday  afternoon pro football.    ""This is not the opera, it's the NFL,"" observed Kerstein, who supervises Los  Angeles police officers at Coliseum events. 'You can't expect people to just  sit there and politely clap and say 'jolly good, jolly good.' ""    How to prevent the most violent incidents at football games has become a  subject of debate since the beating of a 35-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers'  supporter during a Raiders game last month. The man was briefly in a coma as  the result of his injuries, but has since been released from a hospital.    Although it was not the first time a fan had been injured at a Raiders game,  the severity of the beating led to calls for beefed-up security at the  Coliseum.    Some have advocated a ban on the sale of beer at the stadium, arguing that  drunken fans are responsible for the rowdiest behavior.    Last week, Coliseum officials announced that they would no longer sell beer in  20-ounce cups, opting instead for 16-ounce containers. The Coliseum Commission  is now considering implementing a temporary ban on beer sales at Raiders games  as part of a plan to reduce stadium violence.    An average of 20,000 cups of beer are sold at Raiders games.    While police officials agree that drunkenness is a major contributor to stadium  violence during football games, they disagree on whether banning alcohol sales  would solve the problem.    ""It's true that our most frequent contacts are with people who have had too  much to drink,"" said San Diego Police Lt. Bill Skinner, who is responsible for  security at Jack Murphy Stadium. ""But I can't say the problems are caused by  people who buy beer inside the stadium. There's tailgate parties in the parking  lot.""    Richard Beam, director of operations for the Los Angeles Rams, said, ""Football  has always (appealed) to people who want to transfer their hostilities, and  alcohol increases that urge and cuts down their inhibitions.""    For Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim Flammini, who supervises security at Anaheim  Stadium, home of the Rams, the problems are linked to the nature of  professional football itself.    When 80,000 people of various temperaments and income levels pack a stadium to  watch grown men beat each other into the ground for three hours, he said, a few  slugfests in the stands are inevitable.    ""You're in an environment that is very high in emotions,"" Flammini said.  ""Professional football is a rough-and-tumble contact sport. It seems to have a  way of exciting people. . . . If someone says the wrong thing at the wrong  time, (other fans) might want to defend their team, either verbally or  sometimes with their fists.""    By contrast, Flammini said, California Angels' baseball games are relatively  placid events.    ""The baseball behavior has been fantastic,"" Flammini said. ""We've had very few  incidents as compared to last year.""    Anaheim Stadium manager Greg Smith said to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages  would require an agreement among the city of Anaheim, the Los Angeles Rams and  the California Angels because the teams and the city split the revenue. No such  ban has been considered, he said.    For police officials, the best defense against ugly incidents at football games  is to teach officers basic crowd-control strategies and the elements of mass  psychology.    At the Coliseum, Lt. Kerstein commands about 80 to 100 Los Angeles police  officers for most events, although the number of assigned officers has  increased significantly for Raiders games after last month's incident.    Kerstein said his officers play close attention to sections 1 through 4 and 26  through 29 because those seats are sold to fans who do not have season tickets.    ""Season ticket holders tend to be much more focused on the game and less  aggressive,"" Kerstein said. ""For every one fight I'll have within the confines  of the season ticket area, I'll have 25 or 50 fights outside of those areas.""    Another fundamental rule Kerstein teaches his officers is that they should  avoid plunging alone into the stands to break up a fight. Instead, he said,  they should work in teams of six.    Ideally, four officers break up the fight itself, separating troublemakers as  quickly as possible from the rest of the crowd in ""commando-like strikes,""  Kerstein said. All the while, two other officers guard the rear to ensure that  the officers are not hit from behind by fans throwing bottles or other objects.    If necessary, the unruly fans are then handcuffed in the relative safety of the  stadium tunnel.    ""You can't go too far into the crowd alone because it really presents an  officer-safety issue,"" Kerstein said. ""Sometimes I've had to go in alone  because of the situation.""    Besides the near-riot that occured when the Raiders beat the Seahawks and the  fans converged on the field in 1984, the worst day Kerstein can remember was in  1988, when the Raiders played host to the Rams, who won the game 22-17.    ""If sections 1 through 15 had been all Raiders fans and 15 to 31 had been all  Rams fans, I could have done the whole thing with five cops -- piece of cake,""  Kerstein said. ""Unfortunately, every other seat was a Ram fan and the next one  was a Raider fan. They started fighting 30 minutes before kickoff and were  fighting an hour after the game ended. It was our worst game.""    The situation was also becoming ugly on Sept. 23, when the Pittsburgh Steelers  fan was injured.    Kerstein said that just moments before the incident, he had called for officers  deployed outside the stadium to help reinforce security in the stands. Several  fights had erupted throughout the stadium -- they were small ""spot fires"" that  could have become a full-fledged conflagration if action wasn't taken.    ""It was getting very agitated,"" he said. ""We had a number of problems and a  number of ejections. A couple of people threw bottles. That's just deadly. That  could kill an officer.""

Speaking on Thursday at the annual Association of Chief Police Officers' drugs conference, Commander John Grieve of Scotland Yard said it was time for police and government to 'think the unthinkable'. Mr Grieve said the aim would be to cut crime against the elderly and vulnerable. He also called for a national system of cautioning for a wide range of drugs offences. ''However, it does mean research that might mean licensing some people to possess, some people to use and some people to supply some, several or many drugs,' he said. His controversial proposals come after chairing a working group of 31 police chiefs during the conference, nearly half of whom, he said, favoured at least some research.

LOZANO, Times Staff Writer      A North Hollywood makeup artist was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison  without the possibility of parole in the 1986 deaths of two Los Angeles Police  Department explosives experts.    Donald Morse, 39, was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H.  Major. Morse was convicted April 3 of two counts of first-degree murder and one  count of possessing explosives in the deaths of the officers, who were killed  while trying to dismantle a pipe bomb at his home.    Morse also was convicted of special-circumstance allegations that would have  qualified him for the death penalty. But the district attorney's office decided  not to seek such a sentence.    Killed in the explosion Feb. 8, 1986, were Detective Arleigh McCree, 46,  commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and Officer Ronald  Ball, 43. The officers were the first Los Angeles bomb squad members to be  killed in the line of duty.    Before his sentencing Wednesday, Morse was allowed to make a brief statement to  the court.      Statement to Court    ""I have been accused and convicted of something I have not done,"" Morse said,  holding up a Bible. ""I can't think of any reason I would hurt anyone. In my  heart and conscience, I am clear that I am not a murderer.""    Morse, dressed in a dark gray suit, said he brought the Bible to court because  ""this is the book I try to live by, to respect others by."" Morse appeared calm  moments later when Major pronounced the sentence.    Afterward, Edie McCree, the detective's widow, said she is comfortable with the  penalty imposed on Morse. She said she was not surprised by Morse's statement  in court. ""What else can he say? The evidence showed that he did it.""    Morse's attorney, Bernard J. Rosen, said his client will appeal. Rosen said  Major erred when he refused to allow the introduction of evidence suggesting  that the officers were negligent and caused their own deaths.    Major ruled that because the bomb was an illegal and deadly device, its  possession was at least a contributing factor in the officers' deaths.

Alvin Morse said he and his brother had no knowledge of the bombs found in the  garage of the North Hollywood home they shared.

LOZANO, Times Staff Writer      A North Hollywood makeup artist was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison  without the possibility of parole in the 1986 deaths of two Los Angeles Police  Department explosives experts.    Donald Morse, 39, was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H.  Major. Morse was convicted April 3 of two counts of first-degree murder and one  count of possessing explosives in the deaths of the officers, who were killed  while trying to dismantle a pipe bomb at his home.    Morse also was convicted of special-circumstance allegations that would have  qualified him for the death penalty. But the district attorney's office decided  not to seek such a sentence.    Killed in the explosion Feb. 8, 1986, were Detective Arleigh McCree, 46,  commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and Officer Ronald  Ball, 43. The officers were the first Los Angeles bomb squad members to be  killed in the line of duty.    Before his sentencing Wednesday, Morse was allowed to make a brief statement to  the court.      Statement to Court    ""I have been accused and convicted of something I have not done,"" Morse said,  holding up a Bible. ""I can't think of any reason I would hurt anyone. In my  heart and conscience, I am clear that I am not a murderer.""    Morse, dressed in a dark gray suit, said he brought the Bible to court because  ""this is the book I try to live by, to respect others by."" Morse appeared calm  moments later when Major pronounced the sentence.    Afterward, Edie McCree, the detective's widow, said she is comfortable with the  penalty imposed on Morse. She said she was not surprised by Morse's statement  in court. ""What else can he say? The evidence showed that he did it.""    Morse's attorney, Bernard J. Rosen, said his client will appeal. Rosen said  Major erred when he refused to allow the introduction of evidence suggesting  that the officers were negligent and caused their own deaths.    Major ruled that because the bomb was an illegal and deadly device, its  possession was at least a contributing factor in the officers' deaths.    Alvin Morse, the defendant's 38-year-old brother, who lived with him at the  time of the blast, said his brother could not get a fair trial because the  ""judge led the jury in the direction he wanted them to go.""    Alvin Morse said he and his brother had no knowledge of the bombs found in the  garage of the North Hollywood home they shared.

No arrests were made in the ambush killing of 40-year-old Lucille Marie Warren  at Montcalm Avenue and Woodrow Wilson Drive in an exclusive neighborhood of  hillside homes.    Warren was shot at 6:45 a.m. while on her way home to Inglewood, police said.  She had left a house on Montcalm where she worked as a night nurse.    Investigators said there were indications that she was the specific target of  the fatal attack and may even have known her killer. Detectives are  investigating whether Warren, who was divorced and lived with her two teen-age  children, was involved in any personal disputes that could have led to the  shooting.    ""This doesn't appear to be a random encounter,"" said homicide Detective Mike  Coffey.      Motive Unknown    While the motive for the shooting was unknown, police said, the killer may have  been in the street because he knew that Warren was approaching and would stop  if she thought someone needed help.    ""She was a nurse,"" said Lt. Ron LaRue. ""If you knew she was a nurse, you could  find a way to make her stop. The suspect was lying in the street and she  stopped.""    Warren had been working at the home in the Montcalm cul-de-sac at least two  months, police said. Officials of a Van Nuys-based registry of nurses, through  which police said Warren was referred to jobs, declined to comment.    Detectives would not name the person for whom Warren worked.

After finishing her night's work, Warren was leaving the cul-de-sac when she  stopped at Woodrow Wilson Drive after seeing the man in the middle of the  street, police said.      Gun Pulled From Clothing    When Warren got out and walked toward the front of the car, the man stood up  and pulled a handgun out of his clothing. Police said they do not know whether  the pair spoke before the man fired several times at Warren.    Warren was hit by gunfire at least twice, including once in the head, and fell  mortally wounded in the street, police said. One other shot hit the windshield  of her car, which eventually rolled into an embankment on the other side of the  street. Police said the gunman ran to a car parked nearby and sped away. The  victim was not robbed.    A resident called police on a car phone after seeing the woman in the street.  Coffey said several residents saw parts of the crime and provided police with  descriptions of the gunman, his car and the sequence of events.    Warren was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where she died at  10:48 a.m., police said.    As police cordoned off the area, residents gathered nearby or watched from  their windows.

SERRANO, Times Staff Writer      Bob Burgreen recently visited the police Communications Division to watch  dispatchers field calls for service. It was a Thursday afternoon, about 5:30, a  quiet time, when workers are headed home and the biggest police emergency you  would expect would be a traffic jam on Interstate 8.    The police chief asked the dispatchers to ""bring up all of the available units""  -- in other words, to tell him exactly how many officers were free at that  moment to handle emergencies.    With perhaps 120 units on duty on a typical weekday afternoon, Burgreen  expected quite a few to be available to respond. To his dismay, the computer  showed that the vast majority of them would have to be pulled from other calls  to respond immediately.    When Burgreen looked at the screen, only four available units lit up.      Sharp Drop in Service    The level of service provided by the San Diego Police Department has dropped  sharply over the past decade, police say.    It is the result of a dramatic change in the amount and kind of crime in San  Diego, a city that has grown so fast that it now faces many of the same urban  pathologies of other major cities in the United States. Although the number of  officers in the department has increased with the explosive population growth  of the city, each officer is responding to more calls than ever.    The problem has prompted top commanders to begin meeting to consider shifting  more officers back onto the streets. Next month, the police, the city manager  and the City Council are expected to open formal discussions on a proposed tax  increase to pay for more street cops.    ""We need more police officers in this city,"" Burgreen said. ""I am not satisfied  with the kind of job we're doing.""    He and other police experts from around the country agree that increasing the  number of officers will not automatically reduce the crime rate or solve the  problems of urban crime, whose roots may be in drugs and deeply embedded social  ills.    Burgreen also maintains that there is no crisis in police manpower in San  Diego. Homicides and other major crimes are still being investigated. Officers  are almost always available to respond to top-priority emergencies.    But police say there has been a demonstrable decline in police service, and it  can be seen in these key areas:    * Officers in the seven patrol divisions are spending well over half to  two-thirds of their day responding to calls for service and writing reports.  Police administrators in San Diego would like to see officers spend an even 50%  of their day responding to calls, and the other half investigating crimes and  performing prevention duties. That level of service has not been provided in  San Diego in a dozen years, officials said.    * Response times have risen to the point where the average officer last year  needed more than seven minutes to arrive at a high-priority emergency call -- a  situation where even a few seconds can mean the difference between life and  death.    In some of the northern patrol areas, the response time hit well over eight  minutes. A citywide, five-minute response time average is the eventual goal of  the department, but that figure has not been met in 10 years.    * Each month, more than 1,000 reported crimes, particularly burglary and grand  theft, which affect the most victims, are shelved because detectives simply do  not have the time to work the cases.    That means countless police calls for home burglaries, car vandalism and other  routine crimes are not being investigated. Instead, light-duty officers sitting  at telephone banks are merely taking reports whose only real purpose is for  insurance claims.    Police would like to see a 50% clearance rate on these crimes. But, as in the  other categories, that expectation hasn't been met in 10 years.      Waiting Outside Jail    Other major problems drain police manpower. Officers on all three shifts spend  long periods lined up outside the crowded County Jail downtown, waiting to book  prisoners. The false-alarm rate is continuing to rise, and officers are losing  thousands of man-hours each year responding to bogus calls. And the ranks in  the Police Reserve program, once a dependable source of backup help, are  dwindling.    To many in the Police Department and on the City Council, the solution lies in  hiring more officers and trying to saturate the streets by putting the new  recruits out in the community.    But law enforcement experts outside San Diego caution that merely adding police  won't automatically reduce the crime rate.    ""The way I see it, adding more police may in fact overload the criminal justice  system and cause judges to let more people out faster,"" said Hubert Williams,  president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based, nonprofit organization  that supports innovation and improvement in police work.    ""That can happen if you think police are the end-all to reducing crime.""    Still, the manpower shortcomings can be felt on the streets of San Diego, where  many of the laws that were being enforced 10 years ago are passed over by  police today.    Patrol Sgt. Mark T. Dallezotte worries about prostitution on El Cajon  Boulevard, but he can't spare the men to help the undercover detectives in the  vice unit.    ""They tell us that they'll do all the paper work on the arrests if we just  transport the prostitutes to jail,"" he said. ""But I have to tell them no. I  don't have the manpower.""    Sgt. Jack Lilly sees signs that black and Latino gangs are warring over a new  battleground downtown. Yet he recently had to turn loose 12 young Latino gang  members after they were stopped at Horton Plaza and questioned about a rash of  stabbings.    ""There's nothing we can do with them,"" he said. ""They'll stay out into the wee  hours, but what can we do? I guess we could enforce the curfew, but that would  take too many officers out of service.""    And Officer Charles Belletti, like most of his colleagues, knows that whenever  he drives out of the police station, the dispatcher will have a list of old  calls waiting.    ""I'll tell you how shorthanded we are,"" he said. ""Go over to the dispatch  center and look at the stack of unanswered calls. She'll have two pages' worth,  and as soon as we report in-service, she's asking us how many we can take.""    The rise in crime in San Diego over the past 10 years is startling.    There were 1.7 million calls for service last year, almost double the number a  decade ago. Homicides have risen 112%. Aggravated assaults are up 238%, auto  thefts 248%.    Those kinds of increases can be felt at all levels, even in the dispatchers'  room. Where 10 years ago emergency calls were answered within 2.4 seconds, the  average citizen calling for help today will have to wait while the phone rings  for 22 seconds.    To be sure, the number of police officers in San Diego has risen as well. There  are 1,705 sworn officers, an increase of almost 600 from a decade ago. The  police budget has gone from $35.2 million 10 years ago to $128 million today.    Under a plan approved by the City Council, the formula for obtaining new  officers is tagged to the population. For the past several years, the  department has been allowed to hire 1.62 officers for every 1,000 new city  residents.    The council has talked about raising that level to 2.0 officers per 1,000,  which would mean 440 new officers. Next month police administrators and City  Manager John Lockwood will present to the council a detailed financial plan for  a tax proposal to raise the money for more officers.      May Be Obsolete Already    But many police administrators are already concerned that the 2.0 figure is  obsolete and that 2.5 is a more realistic goal if the department truly wants to  return to its level of service 10 years ago.    City projections show that raising the level to 2.0 would cost $62 million. And  to get to 2.5 officers, the cost would be about $130 million the first year and  $110 million for each year after that, all on top of the department's current  operating expenses, Burgreen said.    ""I don't see that kind of money lying around,"" he said.    Experts caution that voters may be fooling themselves if they think the answer  to their problems is to raise taxes and hire more officers. Police response  times may come down, and more officers may be freed to conduct crime-prevention  duties, but a real decrease in the raw numbers of reported crimes would be  unlikely.    Williams, of the Police Foundation, noted that New York added 5,000 officers  some years ago, yet saw no reduction in the number of reported crimes. ""Arrests  increased significantly, but so did the crime rate,"" he said.    He said police administrators should instead identify their specific problems,  such as gangs and drugs, and then move large numbers of existing and new  officers into those hot spots.    ""It needs to be made emphatically clear to the public that the police are out  there controlling the streets,"" he said.    Malcolm Feeley of the Center for Study of Law and Society at the University of  California, Berkeley, said it may be unwise to predicate police staffing needs  merely on the number of local residents.    ""It's not unreasonable to say we want to have a good number of officers per  capita,"" he said. ""But I would urge the City Council to study other cities and  see how they get by.""    San Diego is the seventh-largest city in the nation and ranks ninth in the  number of officers per capita. Traditional high-crime cities have much higher  ratios, with Detroit at 4.51 per 1,000 and New York at 3.91.    San Diego is the second-largest city in California, but ranks sixth in the  number of officers per 1,000.    Critics of the Police Department's management say part of the problem is that  too many sworn officers have been taken out of uniform over the past 10 years  and put into desk jobs. Cmdr. Cal Krosch declined to provide figures on the  number of officers in uniform as opposed to handling administrative duties.    But, in an attempt to reverse the decline in service, Burgreen and the top  members of his staff have been meeting recently to consider ways to move some  desk officers out of their suits and ties and back into uniform.    Already, Burgreen has disbanded the 24-hour front-counter operation. Beyond  that step, administrators don't always agree on which other units should be  sacrificed.    Deputy Chief Ken Fortier has suggested freeing up some officers by thinning out  the Crime Stoppers, gun desk, public affairs, video-graphics, training,  personnel and inspection and control units.    Krosch suggested eliminating the Horse Patrol instead. ""If I had my way,"" he  said, ""I'd do away with it.""    Yet the Horse Patrol is a favorite of the City Council, and, whenever council  members discuss police priorities, they often speak in glowing terms about  officers riding through Balboa Park.    Burgreen declined to say which units he favors scrapping or thinning, but he  did say that major changes will be made within the next month. ""We're going  through every position within the department,"" he said.      50-50 Ratio Sought    One of the chief's greatest concerns is that officers in each patrol division  are spending well over 50% of their day simply responding to calls for service,  and much less time on pro-active work -- activities not in response to calls,  including follow-up and crime-prevention duties.    In the high-crime areas, officers assigned to the Eastern Division spent 69% of  their time in the last four months of 1988 ""out of service,"" which means  handling calls or paper work and unavailable to respond, and in the  Southeastern Division the ratio was 67%.    Officials would like to hit a 50-50 goal, which Fortier said was last reached  about 1977.    Burgreen said the average officer responds to 10 to 15 calls during every  10-hour shift. ""But you don't solve outstanding crimes by running from radio  call to radio call,"" he said. ""The only way you prevent crime is through  pro-active police work.""    Feeley, of UC Berkeley, agreed. ""It's a terrific objective,"" he said. ""A lot of  police work is being responsive to the community.""    San Diego police also would like to shave three minutes off their overall  emergency response times, and begin arriving at crime scenes within an average  of five minutes.      'Couldn't Do That Now'    Capt. Kenneth Moller of Field Operations recalled a time in the late 1950s when  every type of call was answered promptly. ""If an elderly man fell out of bed,  and his wife called, we went by and helped him back up,"" Moller said. ""But we  couldn't do that now. We don't have the time.""    In some cases, police aren't even coming close. Denise Lavell, a member of the  Civilian Advisory Panel on Police Practices, has ridden with officers in every  section of the city. She said that overworked officers routinely arrive late to  some medium-priority calls.    ""I have literally been in the car when there have been calls that were half an  hour old,"" she said. ""Even 40 minutes old.""    With each officer handling more crimes, more follow-up investigations are being  shelved. Robbery and burglarly detectives are inundated with cases.    Police statistics show there were 974 residential robberies in September, 67%  of which were shelved or received little investigative attention. There were  375 commercial burglaries, 53% of which were shelved, and 533 cases of grand  theft, 74% of which were shelved.    ""It used to be a detective came out when your car was vandalized,"" said Lt. Lou  Scanlon, who heads the investigations in the Southeastern station. ""That never  happens anymore.""      Too Many False Alarms    Police are concerned about other issues affecting manpower as well.    During the first 11 months of 1988, there were nearly 27,000 false-alarm  dispatches. The average time required for each alarm call is 26 minutes, which  means 11,557 man-hours were lost.    Burgreen said he plans to present several recommendations to the city manager  within the next couple of months, including not responding to burglar alarms  unless a private security guard has first determined that a crime occurred, and  levying a user fee on alarm owners.    Meanwhile, reserve officer strength is dwindling, mostly because new training  requirements have turned off many would-be volunteers. Sgt. Charles Woodruff  said there are only 114 active police reserves today, down from about 300 in  the mid-1970s.    Burgreen, although conceding that the reserves have been a source of support in  the past, said he is reconsidering whether the program is still worthwhile,  especially since police work today ""has become a very, very specialized field.""    With more calls coming in every day, dispatchers are sending more crime victims  to the Telephone Report Unit. That means victims give information to light-duty  officers over the phone, and seldom see any follow-up investigation. Last year,  more than 40,000 reports were taken by phone. Police say that's a far cry from  the old days, when officers tried to answer all types of calls.    ""Right now, if somebody steals your garden hose, you're going to call and talk  to an officer who will make a report,"" Burgreen said. ""But you'll never see an  officer.

DAVE GATLEY / Los  Angeles Times      Main Story    "," LA021289-0151   17673    February 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 1; Column 1; Metro Desk      2614 words      THE THIN BLUE LINE;    POLICE BLAME EXPLOSION IN CRIME, POPULATION FOR DROP IN SERVICE      By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer      Bob Burgreen recently visited the police Communications Division to watch  dispatchers field calls for service. It was a Thursday afternoon, about 5:30, a  quiet time, when workers are headed home and the biggest police emergency you  would expect would be a traffic jam on Interstate 8.    The police chief asked the dispatchers to ""bring up all of the available units""  -- in other words, to tell him exactly how many officers were free at that  moment to handle emergencies.    With perhaps 120 units on duty on a typical weekday afternoon, Burgreen  expected quite a few to be available to respond. To his dismay, the computer  showed that the vast majority of them would have to be pulled from other calls  to respond immediately.    When Burgreen looked at the screen, only four available units lit up.      Sharp Drop in Service    The level of service provided by the San Diego Police Department has dropped  sharply over the past decade, police say.    It is the result of a dramatic change in the amount and kind of crime in San  Diego, a city that has grown so fast that it now faces many of the same urban  pathologies of other major cities in the United States. Although the number of  officers in the department has increased with the explosive population growth  of the city, each officer is responding to more calls than ever.    The problem has prompted top commanders to begin meeting to consider shifting  more officers back onto the streets. Next month, the police, the city manager  and the City Council are expected to open formal discussions on a proposed tax  increase to pay for more street cops.    ""We need more police officers in this city,"" Burgreen said. ""I am not satisfied  with the kind of job we're doing.""    He and other police experts from around the country agree that increasing the  number of officers will not automatically reduce the crime rate or solve the  problems of urban crime, whose roots may be in drugs and deeply embedded social  ills.    Burgreen also maintains that there is no crisis in police manpower in San  Diego. Homicides and other major crimes are still being investigated. Officers  are almost always available to respond to top-priority emergencies.    But police say there has been a demonstrable decline in police service, and it  can be seen in these key areas:    * Officers in the seven patrol divisions are spending well over half to  two-thirds of their day responding to calls for service and writing reports.  Police administrators in San Diego would like to see officers spend an even 50%  of their day responding to calls, and the other half investigating crimes and  performing prevention duties. That level of service has not been provided in  San Diego in a dozen years, officials said.    * Response times have risen to the point where the average officer last year  needed more than seven minutes to arrive at a high-priority emergency call -- a  situation where even a few seconds can mean the difference between life and  death.    In some of the northern patrol areas, the response time hit well over eight  minutes. A citywide, five-minute response time average is the eventual goal of  the department, but that figure has not been met in 10 years.    * Each month, more than 1,000 reported crimes, particularly burglary and grand  theft, which affect the most victims, are shelved because detectives simply do  not have the time to work the cases.    That means countless police calls for home burglaries, car vandalism and other  routine crimes are not being investigated. Instead, light-duty officers sitting  at telephone banks are merely taking reports whose only real purpose is for  insurance claims.    Police would like to see a 50% clearance rate on these crimes. But, as in the  other categories, that expectation hasn't been met in 10 years.      Waiting Outside Jail    Other major problems drain police manpower. Officers on all three shifts spend  long periods lined up outside the crowded County Jail downtown, waiting to book  prisoners. The false-alarm rate is continuing to rise, and officers are losing  thousands of man-hours each year responding to bogus calls. And the ranks in  the Police Reserve program, once a dependable source of backup help, are  dwindling.    To many in the Police Department and on the City Council, the solution lies in  hiring more officers and trying to saturate the streets by putting the new  recruits out in the community.    But law enforcement experts outside San Diego caution that merely adding police  won't automatically reduce the crime rate.    ""The way I see it, adding more police may in fact overload the criminal justice  system and cause judges to let more people out faster,"" said Hubert Williams,  president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based, nonprofit organization  that supports innovation and improvement in police work.    ""That can happen if you think police are the end-all to reducing crime.""    Still, the manpower shortcomings can be felt on the streets of San Diego, where  many of the laws that were being enforced 10 years ago are passed over by  police today.    Patrol Sgt. Mark T. Dallezotte worries about prostitution on El Cajon  Boulevard, but he can't spare the men to help the undercover detectives in the  vice unit.    ""They tell us that they'll do all the paper work on the arrests if we just  transport the prostitutes to jail,"" he said. ""But I have to tell them no. I  don't have the manpower.""    Sgt. Jack Lilly sees signs that black and Latino gangs are warring over a new  battleground downtown. Yet he recently had to turn loose 12 young Latino gang  members after they were stopped at Horton Plaza and questioned about a rash of  stabbings.    ""There's nothing we can do with them,"" he said. ""They'll stay out into the wee  hours, but what can we do? I guess we could enforce the curfew, but that would  take too many officers out of service.""    And Officer Charles Belletti, like most of his colleagues, knows that whenever  he drives out of the police station, the dispatcher will have a list of old  calls waiting.    ""I'll tell you how shorthanded we are,"" he said. ""Go over to the dispatch  center and look at the stack of unanswered calls. She'll have two pages' worth,  and as soon as we report in-service, she's asking us how many we can take.""    The rise in crime in San Diego over the past 10 years is startling.    There were 1.7 million calls for service last year, almost double the number a  decade ago. Homicides have risen 112%. Aggravated assaults are up 238%, auto  thefts 248%.    Those kinds of increases can be felt at all levels, even in the dispatchers'  room. Where 10 years ago emergency calls were answered within 2.4 seconds, the  average citizen calling for help today will have to wait while the phone rings  for 22 seconds.    To be sure, the number of police officers in San Diego has risen as well. There  are 1,705 sworn officers, an increase of almost 600 from a decade ago. The  police budget has gone from $35.2 million 10 years ago to $128 million today.    Under a plan approved by the City Council, the formula for obtaining new  officers is tagged to the population. For the past several years, the  department has been allowed to hire 1.62 officers for every 1,000 new city  residents.    The council has talked about raising that level to 2.0 officers per 1,000,  which would mean 440 new officers. Next month police administrators and City  Manager John Lockwood will present to the council a detailed financial plan for  a tax proposal to raise the money for more officers.      May Be Obsolete Already    But many police administrators are already concerned that the 2.0 figure is  obsolete and that 2.5 is a more realistic goal if the department truly wants to  return to its level of service 10 years ago.    City projections show that raising the level to 2.0 would cost $62 million. And  to get to 2.5 officers, the cost would be about $130 million the first year and  $110 million for each year after that, all on top of the department's current  operating expenses, Burgreen said.    ""I don't see that kind of money lying around,"" he said.    Experts caution that voters may be fooling themselves if they think the answer  to their problems is to raise taxes and hire more officers. Police response  times may come down, and more officers may be freed to conduct crime-prevention  duties, but a real decrease in the raw numbers of reported crimes would be  unlikely.    Williams, of the Police Foundation, noted that New York added 5,000 officers  some years ago, yet saw no reduction in the number of reported crimes. ""Arrests  increased significantly, but so did the crime rate,"" he said.    He said police administrators should instead identify their specific problems,  such as gangs and drugs, and then move large numbers of existing and new  officers into those hot spots.    ""It needs to be made emphatically clear to the public that the police are out  there controlling the streets,"" he said.    Malcolm Feeley of the Center for Study of Law and Society at the University of  California, Berkeley, said it may be unwise to predicate police staffing needs  merely on the number of local residents.    ""It's not unreasonable to say we want to have a good number of officers per  capita,"" he said. ""But I would urge the City Council to study other cities and  see how they get by.""    San Diego is the seventh-largest city in the nation and ranks ninth in the  number of officers per capita. Traditional high-crime cities have much higher  ratios, with Detroit at 4.51 per 1,000 and New York at 3.91.    San Diego is the second-largest city in California, but ranks sixth in the  number of officers per 1,000.    Critics of the Police Department's management say part of the problem is that  too many sworn officers have been taken out of uniform over the past 10 years  and put into desk jobs. Cmdr. Cal Krosch declined to provide figures on the  number of officers in uniform as opposed to handling administrative duties.    But, in an attempt to reverse the decline in service, Burgreen and the top  members of his staff have been meeting recently to consider ways to move some  desk officers out of their suits and ties and back into uniform.    Already, Burgreen has disbanded the 24-hour front-counter operation. Beyond  that step, administrators don't always agree on which other units should be  sacrificed.    Deputy Chief Ken Fortier has suggested freeing up some officers by thinning out  the Crime Stoppers, gun desk, public affairs, video-graphics, training,  personnel and inspection and control units.    Krosch suggested eliminating the Horse Patrol instead. ""If I had my way,"" he  said, ""I'd do away with it.""    Yet the Horse Patrol is a favorite of the City Council, and, whenever council  members discuss police priorities, they often speak in glowing terms about  officers riding through Balboa Park.    Burgreen declined to say which units he favors scrapping or thinning, but he  did say that major changes will be made within the next month. ""We're going  through every position within the department,"" he said.      50-50 Ratio Sought    One of the chief's greatest concerns is that officers in each patrol division  are spending well over 50% of their day simply responding to calls for service,  and much less time on pro-active work -- activities not in response to calls,  including follow-up and crime-prevention duties.    In the high-crime areas, officers assigned to the Eastern Division spent 69% of  their time in the last four months of 1988 ""out of service,"" which means  handling calls or paper work and unavailable to respond, and in the  Southeastern Division the ratio was 67%.    Officials would like to hit a 50-50 goal, which Fortier said was last reached  about 1977.    Burgreen said the average officer responds to 10 to 15 calls during every  10-hour shift. ""But you don't solve outstanding crimes by running from radio  call to radio call,"" he said. ""The only way you prevent crime is through  pro-active police work.""    Feeley, of UC Berkeley, agreed. ""It's a terrific objective,"" he said. ""A lot of  police work is being responsive to the community.""    San Diego police also would like to shave three minutes off their overall  emergency response times, and begin arriving at crime scenes within an average  of five minutes.      'Couldn't Do That Now'    Capt. Kenneth Moller of Field Operations recalled a time in the late 1950s when  every type of call was answered promptly. ""If an elderly man fell out of bed,  and his wife called, we went by and helped him back up,"" Moller said. ""But we  couldn't do that now. We don't have the time.""    In some cases, police aren't even coming close. Denise Lavell, a member of the  Civilian Advisory Panel on Police Practices, has ridden with officers in every  section of the city. She said that overworked officers routinely arrive late to  some medium-priority calls.    ""I have literally been in the car when there have been calls that were half an  hour old,"" she said. ""Even 40 minutes old.""    With each officer handling more crimes, more follow-up investigations are being  shelved. Robbery and burglarly detectives are inundated with cases.    Police statistics show there were 974 residential robberies in September, 67%  of which were shelved or received little investigative attention. There were  375 commercial burglaries, 53% of which were shelved, and 533 cases of grand  theft, 74% of which were shelved.    ""It used to be a detective came out when your car was vandalized,"" said Lt. Lou  Scanlon, who heads the investigations in the Southeastern station. ""That never  happens anymore.""      Too Many False Alarms    Police are concerned about other issues affecting manpower as well.    During the first 11 months of 1988, there were nearly 27,000 false-alarm  dispatches. The average time required for each alarm call is 26 minutes, which  means 11,557 man-hours were lost.    Burgreen said he plans to present several recommendations to the city manager  within the next couple of months, including not responding to burglar alarms  unless a private security guard has first determined that a crime occurred, and  levying a user fee on alarm owners.    Meanwhile, reserve officer strength is dwindling, mostly because new training  requirements have turned off many would-be volunteers. Sgt. Charles Woodruff  said there are only 114 active police reserves today, down from about 300 in  the mid-1970s.    Burgreen, although conceding that the reserves have been a source of support in  the past, said he is reconsidering whether the program is still worthwhile,  especially since police work today ""has become a very, very specialized field.""    With more calls coming in every day, dispatchers are sending more crime victims  to the Telephone Report Unit. That means victims give information to light-duty  officers over the phone, and seldom see any follow-up investigation. Last year,  more than 40,000 reports were taken by phone. Police say that's a far cry from  the old days, when officers tried to answer all types of calls.    ""Right now, if somebody steals your garden hose, you're going to call and talk  to an officer who will make a report,"" Burgreen said. ""But you'll never see an  officer. And that's a deterioration in the level of service.""      OFFICERS PER 1,000 POPULATION    10 most populous California cities.

Attila Fekete: ""It Was an Accident,  According to the Police""]    [Text] Police Lieutenant General Sandor Pinter, national  police commissioner, announced at his news conference that Gyula  Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, suffered a  traffic accident on 5 May, between Nyekladhaza and Emod on  Highway 3. The police investigation has been unable to confirm  rumors of foul play. After the news conference the defense  attorney for Horn's driver said that the police had not ruled  out foul play definitely.    As we have reported several times earlier, a Saab 9000 car  (registration number DFG-070) transporting Gyula Horn from  Miskolc to Budapest collided with a disabled IFA  [Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau] truck that was parked in the left  lane of the 159.7-km section of Highway 3, between Nyekladhaza  and Emod. The occupants of the Saab were: Gyula Horn, chairman  of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]; his driver Istvan  Mosolygo; and Horn's bodyguard, retired Police Major Jeno  Zsidei. All three suffered serious, but not life-threatening,  injuries.    According to the official police report on the inspection of  the scene of the accident, the disabled IFA truck had been  parked in the left lane--relative to the direction in which  Horn's car was heading--between 0.7 and 1.2 meters from the  road's center line.    In his statement to the police, the truck driver said he had  not parked at the side of the road to change tires because the  truck was hauling 80 quintals of canned food, and he was afraid  that the vehicle might overturn. In addition, it would not have  been possible to change tires on the road's soft shoulder. The  technical experts confirmed the truck driver's arguments. They  established that the truck did have a flat tire. In other words,  the truck had not been positioned there intentionally for the  subsequent accident. The tire on the right rear wheel of the  truck's trailer had a 46-cm rip that had been caused by fatigue.  By the weak light of a flashlight, the truck driver was just  loosening the nuts on the wheel when the Saab crashed into the  truck.    Two technical experts presented their findings at the news  conference. They had established beforehand, in agreement with  the Saab factory's experts, that the structural deformations of  the car's body and frame indicated an absorption of kinetic  energy equal to the energy generated by the car at a speed of 55  to 60 km per hour [kph], which in practice means that the damage  was what would have occurred had Horn's car crashed into a  concrete wall at a speed of 55 to 60 kph.    Of course, the truck's body likewise suffered serious damage  in the accident, and the Saab's kinetic energy slowed down  significantly also during the breakup of the truck's body. After  impact, the car kept skidding for about 40 meters and then  stopped. Technical expert Gabor Meleg concluded from all this  that, at the time of impact, the car's speed must have been  between 98 and 102 kph. Laszlo Vincze, the other expert,  estimates that the car's speed must have been between 85 and 109  kph. The car was equipped with an automatic braking system;  therefore it was impossible to determine at what speed the car  had been traveling before impact, and whether and when the  brakes had been applied before impact. However, reconstruction  of the accident on a computer excludes the possibility that the  Saab might have been traveling substantially faster than 100  kph. At a speed of 140 kph, the car would have landed in the  ditch on the right side of the highway, relative to the  direction in which it was heading. The investigation determined  that the Saab had just been returning from the left lane when a  third of its front end crashed into the truck. The police were  unable to explain why the Saab had been in the left lane. The  highway along the given section was straight, and the  possibility of drifting was ruled out. The police likewise found  no clue indicating that somebody on the side of the road might  have startled the car's driver, and that might have been the  reason why he wrenched the steering wheel to the left and  crashed the car. The police established that the flashes of  light Jeno Zsidei mentioned in his statement may probably have  been the glittering street lights in Emod.    The defense attorney for Istvan Mosolygo, who in the  meantime  has become a defendant, attended the news conference and  listened to the reports. Afterwards, with Police Lt. General  Pinter's consent, he outlined the line of defense his client  would offer. The gist of it is that from the very beginning the  police had regarded the crash as an accident and had not  investigated the possibility of foul play.    The police have recommended that the public prosecutor  charge  Mosolygo with causing a traffic accident through negligence. At  the end of the news conference, Sandor Pinter announced that,  until the end of the second round in the elections, he would  maintain his offer to provide a Mercedes--complete with  communications equipment, a driver and a bodyguard--for each  major political party, upon their request.

However, the Chinese Government also welcomes  those underworld elements who have turned over a new leaf with  actual good conduct.    Zhu Entao also told the association that the Chinese  Government will not under any circumstances send public security  police to work in the police force of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] or recruit personnel from the  mainland after 1997.    At the meeting, Zhu exchanged views with the visiting group  on police affairs in Hong Kong and the mainland. Touching on  the underworld problem, Zhu reiterated that it is the Chinese  Government's consistent stand to strike resolutely at underworld  crimes and to prevent underworld elements from developing their  organizations on the mainland. They will be resolutely banned  the moment they are unearthed. If underworld elements from Hong  Kong commit crimes on the mainland, they will certainly be  handled according to the law. It is absolutely impossible for  them to seek refuge on the mainland after committing crimes in  Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Zhu Entao said that if they have corrected  their conduct with good concrete performances, the Chinese  Government definitely welcomes them.    As to the recent cooperation between the two sides regarding  the crackdown on crimes, such as the yachts stolen in Hong Kong,  Zhu said the mainland side has paid close attention to the  problem and is now studying countermeasures for that.    In addition, Zhu Entao also explained to the association  that  the Hong Kong Police will still be accountable to the SAR  government after 1997. If there is a police manpower shortage,  this is also an affair for the SAR government and the police  commissioner. The Chinese Government will under no  circumstances send public security personnel or recruit  policemen to work in Hong Kong. He maintained that this is a  major Chinese Government principle to realize Hong Kong being  ruled by the Hong Kong people.     "

An armed teen-ager stalked into a high school classroom and took 11 classmates  hostage Monday, police and witnesses said. After a daylong standoff, he  released them all and surrendered.    No one was injured in the confrontation, which lasted about 8 1/2 hours, police  said. The youth fired two shots, one at the ceiling of the classroom and  another at a window, state police said.    Upon entering the classroom, the teen-ager ordered the teacher and the first  two rows of students to leave. The youth, who asked police to contact his  father, told his hostages that he did not want to hurt anyone. The youth gave  up an hour and a half after releasing his last two hostages.    The hostage-taker was identified by police as Dustin Pierce, a 17-year-old  Jackson County High School senior, who was described as a good student.    Police said they were unsure what charges would be lodged against Pierce. He  was taken to a juvenile holding center in the Clay County Jail in nearby  Manchester. McKee is a town of 250 people about 50 miles southeast of Lexington  in the Appalachian foothills.    ""He was unbalanced,"" said state police Detective Bob Stephens, who negotiated  with Pierce throughout the day. ""He was a confused young man. He was a young  man looking for somebody to help him.""    Throughout the negotiations, Stephens said he feared that Pierce would try to  kill himself since he seemed to be carrying out the scenario of the Stephen  King thriller ""Rage,"" which he had been reading.    During a search of Pierce's room at home, police found a paperback copy of the  book, in which the lead character is shot by police. The book's plot deals with  a youth who holds a classroom of students hostage.    Police also found papers Pierce had written that made references to dying at 9  o'clock.    Pierce's father, who was not identified, was on his way to McKee from Delray  Beach, Fla., when the student released his last two hostages and surrendered.    Pierce released his hostages throughout the day in exchange for items such as  food, soft drinks and cigarettes.    Police Trooper Ed Robinson said the hostage-taker was armed with a shotgun, a  .357-caliber magnum revolver and ""some type of automatic pistol.""

The youth, who asked police to contact his  father, told his hostages that he did not want to hurt anyone. The youth gave  up an hour and a half after releasing his last two hostages.    The hostage-taker was identified by police as Dustin Pierce, a 17-year-old  Jackson County High School senior, who was described as a good student.    Police said they were unsure what charges would be lodged against Pierce. He  was taken to a juvenile holding center in the Clay County Jail in nearby  Manchester. McKee is a town of 250 people about 50 miles southeast of Lexington  in the Appalachian foothills.    ""He was unbalanced,"" said state police Detective Bob Stephens, who negotiated  with Pierce throughout the day. ""He was a confused young man. He was a young  man looking for somebody to help him.""    Throughout the negotiations, Stephens said he feared that Pierce would try to  kill himself since he seemed to be carrying out the scenario of the Stephen  King thriller ""Rage,"" which he had been reading.    During a search of Pierce's room at home, police found a paperback copy of the  book, in which the lead character is shot by police. The book's plot deals with  a youth who holds a classroom of students hostage.    Police also found papers Pierce had written that made references to dying at 9  o'clock.    Pierce's father, who was not identified, was on his way to McKee from Delray  Beach, Fla., when the student released his last two hostages and surrendered.    Pierce released his hostages throughout the day in exchange for items such as  food, soft drinks and cigarettes.    Police Trooper Ed Robinson said the hostage-taker was armed with a shotgun, a  .357-caliber magnum revolver and ""some type of automatic pistol.""

POLICE NET      By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer      TIJUANA      A group of 60 Baja California State Judicial Police swooped down Friday evening  on a major illegal crossing zone along the U.S.-Mexican border, arresting about  200 people as they waited to enter the United States illegally.    The operation was coordinated with the U.S. Border Patrol and San Diego Police  Department, said Jose Encinas Filatoff, chief of a homicide squad of the state  police in Tijuana. The raid, he said, was an attempt to cut down on violent  crime along the border.    The hourlong operation, involving 60 state police agents and more than 3 dozen  vehicles, occurred along a milelong slough of the international border near the  banks of the Tijuana River. The area -- believed to be the largest single  crossing zone for undocumented immigrants along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican  border -- has also been the site of many violent attacks on migrants.      'Going After Thieves...'    ""We're going after the thieves and the murderers and rapists,"" said Encinas,  who spoke at state police headquarters in Tijuana as the 200 arrestees were  being questioned in a nearby conference room.    Friday's operation was not the first such joint operation but it was by far the  largest one involving state police, and the most thoroughly planned. There has  been at least one similar operation earlier this year involving federal police.    Police said they were checking those detained to see if they had any weapons or  criminal records. Those who did not appear to be violent were to be released,  Encinas said.    ""We're not going after people because they're immigrants,"" Encinas said.    However, several people who were arrested maintained that they were committing  no crime under Mexican law but only wished to enter the United States to work.    ""I just came here to cross, and I found this,"" said one arrestee, as he headed  down from the Tijuana River levee into a waiting police truck that would take  him downtown.    At the scene, U.S. Border Patrol officers standing on the U.S. side of the  tattered border fence occasionally pointed out suspects to Mexican police  officers. But Border Patrol agents at the scene declined to comment on the  operation.      Operation El Bordo    Mexican police dubbed the joint crackdown Operation El Bordo. In Tijuana, the  area is known as El Bordo -- literally, the edge.    Such joint operations between U. S. and Mexican authorities have drawn  considerable criticism in Mexico, where U. S. police agencies, particularly the  Border Patrol, are viewed as violators of the rights of undocumented Mexicans  in the United States. U. S. officials have disputed this characterization.    Despite such criticism, state police plan to continue raids. Chief Encinas said  he would like to see similar raids every two weeks or so, to dissuade criminals  from frequenting the Tijuana River area.    ""We want that place cleaned up,"" Encinas said. He shrugged off criticism of  working jointly with U.S. authorities, contending that both sides were working  for the safety of the undocumented migrants who are preyed upon along the  border zone.      Converged on Levee    The operation began at about 7:30 p.m., when state judicial police cars, mostly  unmarked, converged on the river levee area from several directions. Dozens of  judicial police officers, armed with semi-automatic pistols, mounted the  elevated levee and began rounding up everyone in sight -- including women and  children. Many tried to scurry -- some successfully -- for the nearby Tijuana  neighborhood known as the Zona Norte, across the street from the levee.    Police said all women with children were later released.    Migrants say they have learned to avoid state and local police, who they  contend frequently shake down the undocumented border crossers. But Encinas  denied that his officers would attempt to extort any migrants, saying all of  their belongings would be returned to them.

By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER      PASADENA      Community outrage over the death of Robert Earl Holloway, who died Jan. 18  after a struggle with security employees at the King's Villages housing  project, prompted the Pasadena Board of Directors to call Tuesday for state and  federal investigations into his death and the security guard company involved.    Although the district attorney's office declined last week to file charges  against five Gold Security Patrol employees involved in the incident, city  directors unanimously approved requesting further investigation by the district  attorney's office, the county grand jury, the state attorney general and  federal authorities.    In addition, the city will request that the state Department of Consumer  Affairs investigate the security company to determine whether it should be  fined or lose its license.    ""This is an opportunity to face one of the deepest social cleavages in our  community today,"" Director Rick Cole said, referring to the unrest that  Holloway's death has sparked among many of the city's black residents.    The death also sparked calls for changes in Pasadena Police Department  practices, although its officers were not accused of any wrongdoing in  connection with the incident.    But the board stopped short of banning police use of the carotid control hold,  as some black activists had requested. Acting Pasadena Police Chief Bruce  Philpott told the board that no deaths have occurred at police hands as a  result the hold since 1981 and that no complaints about the hold were lodged  with the department last year.    The carotid hold is used hundreds of times each year by Pasadena officers to  subdue combative people, Philpott said. It is applied in three levels of  increasing force. He said the third level, which renders a person unconscious,  was not used at all last year.    He also credited the hold with saving his own life in an alley fight while on  duty in 1972.    ""There are very little other options available to an officer who is fighting a  combative subject who doesn't want to be taken into custody,"" Philpott said.    The board also took no action to limit the police practice of requiring some  individuals stopped by police to sit on the curb or lie prone on the ground.  However, the board directed Philpott to meet with community activist Eugene  Pickett about the matter.    Pickett and other black community representatives said Tuesday that Pasadena  police use the practice more frequently in dealing with blacks than whites.  They also said young black males find the practice demeaning and will resist in  the future.    ""The fact of the matter is, I don't see white people on the ground being  demoralized. I see black people,"" a young black man, who identified himself as  J. C., told the board. ""If you treat us like animals, we're going to act like  caged animals, violently.""    The board also asked city staff to prepare a report on the use of Nation of  Islam members as security guards in housing projects. Members of the religious  order have asked to replace Gold Security Patrol at the 313-unit housing  complex along Fair Oaks Avenue. However, the complex is privately owned by  Goldrich, Kest & Associates, which hires the security company, and the  board has no standing in the matter.    Tuesday's actions arose from recommendations made by Directors John Crowley and  Chris Holden, who met Friday with about 40 residents of the city's  predominantly minority Northwest section, where King's Villages is located.    Tenants have for some time been troubled by conditions at the complex and have  blamed management practices, but Holloway's death and subsequent community  protest forced the board to take action.    Holloway, 28, well-known and liked in the Northwest area, was stopped for  allegedly trespassing at the complex Jan. 18, and refused to leave. He  struggled with four security guards and a security dispatcher, who chased him  off the property and wrestled him to the ground. When police were summoned,  they noticed that Holloway had stopped breathing. He was taken to Huntington  Memorial Hospital, where he died about 1 1/2 hours later.    The coroner's office determined that Holloway's blood alcohol level was 0.17%  and that he died of ""compression of the neck."" However, the district attorney's  office declined to file charges against the dispatcher, Steve Goldbaum, who  allegedly administered the neck hold, after determining that Goldbaum held an  expired security guard license.    Because that gave him the status of a private citizen, not a trained guard, he  could not be legally held responsible for Holloway's death, the district  attorney reasoned.

The seven were trying to sell the nuclear material for Dollars 400,000 and had been arrested in Vrancea, central Romania, following a tip off from security services. It is the second uranium smuggling incident in Romania in the past 10 days. Police said last week they had arrested six Romanians, including two army officers, who were attempting to sell 4.5kg of uranium 235 and 238 at a villa near Bucharest. Officials said they believed the uranium had come from abroad. The arrests follow a recent spate of cases of uranium smuggling in eastern Europe. Most have involved uranium from nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union. Romania, which borders the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Moldova, is close to completing its first nuclear plant.

The smugglers target especially, the COPA flight from  Panama,  ALM from Curacao, and SAM from Colombia.    The female cocaine smugglers, who hide the drug in body  cavities, are reported to be paid US$200 each when they deliver  the drug intact. On the average, each packet recovered from  vaginal searches weigh 14 ounces. The search is always done by a  doctor.    A Customs Department spokesman explains: ""Once we target  them  and take them down to the search room, the doctor does all the  searching. And we have all the equipment, forceps and boxes and  boxes of sterilized gloves."" The spokesman pointed out that  although the law states that a female customs officer could  search a female patient, the internal searches are done by  female doctors only.    On being recruited here as couriers, most of the women,  first-time travellers, claim they are higglers going to buy  goods abroad. Their airfares are paid and they are provided with  accommodation, food and ground transport in the country where  they go to pick up the cocaine. Usually, they go and return on  SAM, COPA or ALM. Usually, the recruiter travels to Jamaica on  the return flight with them, having supplied them with the drug  in the source country. Once they arrive here safely with the  drug--that is they clear Customs and the Narcotics Police  without the cocaine being discovered--they are paid.    Men are recruited as couriers too, their method of choice  being swallowing balls of cocaine in condoms. Men and women  couriers smuggle the cocaine in autoparts, and other  merchandise, in bath soaps, in hollowed-out custom-built clothes  hangers, in wig and sneakers or submerging it in cooking oil.    Of nine women targeted by Customs in September as ""mules,""  six were held. But three escaped. In September, four men  suspected of having swallowed cocaine balls in condoms escaped  from the Cornwall Regional Hospital, Montego Bay, by jumping  through a window. A man who arrived at Sangster International  Airport, Montego Bay, on the SAM flight from Colombia, the same  month, was found to have swallowed 63 pieces of crack cocaine.    Estimated street value of cocaine in Jamaica now is $200,000  to $230,000 a kilo. In 1992 when cocaine was more plentiful, the  price was $180,000 a kilo.    Wily cocaine smugglers change their techniques frequently,  but the Customs Department and the Narcotics Police catch on  just as fast.    Women smugglers started another trend recently--smuggling  cocaine in lotion bottles having liquefied it. The result is  that Customs is now giving these lotion bottles a more-than  cursory check.    Then there is the ""internal conspiracy"" at the island's two  international airports, the Norman Manley in Kingston, and the  Sangster, Montego Bay, whereby the courier, by prior  arrangement, deposits the cocaine in the female toilet or in  flower pots, and employees there pick it up.    And ganja trafficking continues to be a problem, showing up  more frequently these days in mailbags bound for the U.S.A.,  especially from the Norman Manley International Airport. Random  probes with sharp instruments of ""normally wrapped parcels"" in  mailbags have been turning up ganja.    Drug smuggling continues on other fronts too, targeting in  particular legitimate exports such as ground provisions.    ""The ganja is smuggled in every section of an empty  container  that you can think of--the ceiling, the floor, the walls,"" the  Customs spokesman said.    ""Then they are put in drums, labelled something else and  shipped. But the smuggler's choice these days for getting out  the ganja, is in scrap metal, because it is so difficult to  handle.""     "

Jiang Peikun, professor at the prestigious People's  University, sent a letter to the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress demanding that plainclothes police  end a 10-day vigil outside his apartment.    In the letter, Jiang and his wife said they would stage a  hunger strike from Thursday if police surveillance was not  stopped.    Jiang Jielian was killed by a bullet in the back on the eve  of June 3, 1989, a day after his 17th birthday.    His death was one of what could have been thousands of  people  killed by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army which was  ordered by the Chinese Government to quell six weeks of  pro-democracy protests.    ""We demand a little human sympathy, we demand to know what  humanity is. Who cannot understand the significance that a day  like this holds for us? The love parents have for their son is  known by all,"" the letter said.    ""This year marks the fifth anniversary of the death of our  son, his ashes and other belongings still remain in the house.  Is there not even one peaceful place where his spirit can rest?  Cannot his parents have even a little peace?"" It said.    Jiang said the police harass everyone who visits their house  and that even his son-in-law was followed and then searched by  police who suspected him of smuggling papers or information  concerning the names and addresses of other victims of the  killings out of the house.    Ding Ziling, Jiang's wife, is believed to have made efforts  to find out who and how many people were killed in those fateful  June days, press reports said.    The government has said some 300 people were killed,  including police and soldiers torn apart by angry citizens, but  five years after the killings a name list has yet to be  published.    Police presence in Beijing has been tight since March and is  expected to increase this week as the anniversary of the June  event falls on Friday and Saturday with government fears of  renewed protests mounting.

It emerged on Wednesday that there were  some overlaps in violence reports from the kwaZulu Police, SA  Police [SAP] and the SA Defence Force [SADF].    The latest confirmed deaths, however, put the toll at 101  since last Thursday.    Among the overlapping reports was one of six deaths in  Ndwedwe at the weekend, reported by the SAP on Wednesday.    The kwaZulu Police on Tuesday reported 10 weekend killings  in  Ndwedwe and it emerged that this included the SAP's report of  six murders there.    The Natal Security Committee -- comprising the SAP and SADF  -- said 11 more people had been killed in the region since  Tuesday morning. After investigation, however, it emerged that  four of these deaths had already been reported.    The latest deaths included the fatal shooting of a man at  Batania mission, near Port Shepstone.    In war-torn Bhambayi, north of Durban, a woman was shot dead  and another injured.    In kwaMbonambi, on the North Coast, a man was shot dead. In  the nearby Masekane area, a school child was fatally shot.    In the Northern Natal area of Newcastle, two people were  killed and seven were injured in an attack at the Mfolozi  reserve.    At the Mashenga reserve, also near Newcastle, a man was shot  dead.    The committee said three houses were burnt down in the  Drycott area of Estcourt, in the Midlands, and two houses were  petrol bombed in the Northern Natal area of Dundee.    At kwaKhoza, near the North Coast area of Eshowe, security  forces confiscated sticks, spears, and a firearm from a group of  20 men.    In Wembezi, outside Estcourt, participants of an Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] march were searched and a revolver and  homemade gun were confiscated along with a quantity of  ammunition.    IFP supporters en route to Tuesday's march in Empangeni were  stopped in two buses and a shotgun, ammunition, and three  homemade guns were confiscated.    Meanwhile, Wednesday's toll includes six deaths reported  earlier in Nongoma, Zululand, where three people were shot dead  in a car, and another three were murdered in a minibus in a  suspected taxi feud.

Pihl said the current trend is that weapons from the former  East European countries, a remarkable part of them manufactured  in Western countries, are taken through Estonia to Russia. This  is a reversal of the earlier situation when the arms traffic was  directed from Russia through Estonia to third countries, the  director said.    In recent weeks both Estonian and Russian officials have  seized great amounts of arms being illegally taken into Russia.    In the course of a joint operation of the Security Police  and  the Defense Forces on Feb. 21, for example, over 500 TT  [Tokarev] pistols were discovered in south Estonia near the  Luhamaa border crossing. Another illegal arms consignment was  discovered on the same day by Russian customs officials.     "

[Chawalit] Thailand and the United Nations, whose UNDCP  office is located in Thailand, talked about the problem in Laos  and Burma. A master plan for tackling the problem in Laos is  already completed. A plan for Burma is next, because most of  the illicit opium cultivation is in that country. It will be  difficult due to the political issue involving the ethnic  monorities, which have been waging resistance against the  Burmese Government. Some areas will not be accessible to  control by the government. We will have to cooperate with the  United Nations on this issue.    [Correspondent] How much heroin is produced annually in the  Golden Triangle?    [Chawalit] It is estimated at 40-60 tons; no more than 60  tons at most. These figures are derived from estimated  cultivation and refining capacities. No one knows the real  production figures.    [Correspondent] How much marijuana is produced in Thailand?    [Chawalit] It is estimated at 100-200 tons a year. There  was a lot of cultivation in the northeast. After the  eradication efforts were launched, however, cultivation has been  moved to the mountains and jungles in about 20 provinces in  various parts of the country. The growers themselves do not own  the land where marijuana is cultivated. In this way, the  growers hope they can better avoid detection by the police.    [Correspondent] The narcotics traffickers have been able to  transport their products rather effectively. What has your  office done to deal with this?    [Chawalit] It is not possible for us to inspect every  container. Therefore, we will have to rely on good intelligence  to inspect suspected containers. Information must come from the  end destination. For example, we will follow up if there is  information that a consignment is destined for a certain  location. Several units are involved in following up such  information, including my office, the police, the customs  offices, and foreign units. The practice is to perform some  inspections, but we must ensure that such inspection does not  create unnecessary trouble for honest businessmen. [passage  omitted]     "

Capping more than a year of debate on the future of the 65-year-old building,  the Los Angeles City Council last week unanimously directed the city attorney  to prepare an agreement leasing the station to the Los Angeles Police  Historical Society for 30 years at $1 per year. The station, at 6045 York  Blvd., has not been used by the Los Angeles Police Department since 1983.    Boasting a distinctive Renaissance Revival architecture, the station is a city  and federal landmark that has often been used as a backdrop by Hollywood  filmmakers. Last year, a group of police officers proposed turning it into a  police museum.    In recent months, city officials have considered incorporating the police  museum project into one of two rival proposals calling for construction of  housing, offices and a restaurant in and around the historic station. City  Councilman Richard Alatorre had said merging the museum with a commercial  project would have provided private funding to renovate the building.    But last week's decision will allow the museum to proceed without ties to a  commercial project.    ""It was the only right thing you could use that building for,"" said Officer  Richard Ledesma, a member of the historical society's board of directors who  works at the Police Department's Northeast station on San Fernando Road.    Museum boosters, who earlier said the project would cost about $4.5 million,  now have raised their cost estimates to $6 million for renovation, construction  of exhibits and staffing.    A fund-raising consultant for the society has also recommended that an  additional $1.5 million be raised as an endowment to offset some of the  museum's operating costs.    Ledesma said the historical society board is also considering construction of a  youth recreation center on the grounds, which could cost another $1.5 million  to $2 million.    In his motion endorsing the museum lease, Alatorre stipulated that the  organizers must provide a progress report in two years regarding their  finances.    Sgt. Richard Kalk, president of the society and the museum's most vocal  supporter, said the group has raised little money thus far because it has not  had possession of the station. Now that the society has been given permission  to use the building, he said, it will be easier to solicit donations.    ""Everything has fallen into place,"" Kalk said. ""The tentative response we're  getting regarding donations is so positive. We're not going to have any trouble  showing the city we can build the museum.""    He said the society would seek funding from major corporate foundations and  then launch a public donation drive.    The historical society has hired a professional fund-raising consultant, Culver  City-based Netzel/Steinhaus and Associates. Jeff Conway, the firm's vice  president, said the group will spend months preparing a more detailed budget  and fund-raising strategy before launching a donation drive in 1991.    Organizers believe the museum could open in about five years.    ""We are convinced it is a very popular project,"" Conway said. ""We're confident  of its success.""    He said a key first step will be to expand the society's board from nine to 19  to include members who have more expertise in construction and fund-raising and  to make it representative of the community's ethnic and cultural diversity.  Current board members are all active or retired police officers.    The museum received a boost in April when Los Angeles voters approved a bond  measure, sponsored by Alatorre, to pay for earthquake-safety repairs in  city-owned structures. It included $1.2 million for the station.    Before the measure was approved, friction developed between Kalk and Alatorre  because of the councilman's concern that the museum's backers had insufficient  funds to build the project without working with a commercial developer.    But Robin Cramer, Alatorre's chief of staff, said a spirit of cooperation now  prevails. She said the councilman's staff plans to shepherd the museum through  the complex city planning approval process.    ""What we're trying to do is work as a team from the get-go,"" she said.    Tentatively, the museum will display police guns and vehicles, a tribute to  slain and injured officers, exhibits on famous arrests and unsolved cases and a  comparison of actual law enforcement versus its depiction on television.    Al Fiori, whose Venice firm is the museum's design consultant, said the  exhibits will have a strong educational component, showing youngsters the  consequences of drug dealing and drunk driving. They will also focus on such  crime-solving techniques as fingerprints, autopsies and fiber analysis.    Fiori said the museum will have many high-tech interactive exhibits such as a  police car simulator that would allow visitors to experience participating in a  street patrol and a device for creating a composite sketch of a crime suspect.    ""It's not just going to be a static collection of police chiefs' pictures and  badges,"" he said. ""It's going to be a hands-on museum. This is a showcase for  the state-of-the-art in police science.""      Photo, The Highland Park station was last used by the police in 1983.

[Vasquez] I can give you an up-to-the-minute evaluation of  how the strike is progressing. Regarding the police actions, we  may say that everything is under control. The roads have been  cleared, including the Panamerican Highway.    The five provinces comprising the third district, such as  Azuay, Loja, Canar, Zamora, and Morona, are also clear;  consequently, commercial and administrative activities in those  provinces are being carried out normally. There are  demonstrations and street protests, which have been definitely  brought under control.    Police are carrying out a very specific task of prevention,  avoiding direct contact with demonstrators, who sometimes become  aggressive. To avoid additional problems, the police are taking  precautions to avoid confrontations.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] reports that police have  attacked a youth; this has caused resentment from [words  indistinct] citizens. What is the police version of this case?    [Vasquez] I think citizens and the media are well aware of  our duty. If one of these demonstrators attack and hurl Molotov  cocktails at policemen, the police must react. We cannot let  ourselves be attacked physically. We were forced to act, but  this youngster was never treated with brutality. He was simply  overpowered and arrested and was submitted to authorities.    We are examining our policemen's injuries to report them to  the media. Medical examinations are being taken now.    [Reporter] What happened to General [words indistinct]  developed the strike decreed by the FUT in this city. Colonel  Carlos Trujillo is also here. He will analyze [words  indistinct] regarding police measures.    [Trujillo] We will continue to implement the same provisions  issued by the General Command and the [words indistinct]. Our  police duty will be to prevent crimes. We hope citizens  understand what are our duty and responsibility. We did not  come out to hurt anyone. We must be viewed as representatives  of public order and peace. We will come out and exercise  control over the city and demonstrations. We will not move  against demonstrators as long as they do not attack other  individuals or public and private property.     "

Nikki Amorosino, 39, was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail on suspicion of  felony sexual battery, said Sgt. Don Goldberg. Arraignment is scheduled Monday  in Burbank Municipal Court, he said.    The 39-year-old victim, who is married to a California Highway Patrol officer,  was treated for bruises and scratches at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank  following the 8 a.m. Wednesday attack, Goldberg said.    The woman wrote down the license plate number of the van that pulled her over,  and police traced it to Amorosino's Arleta home, where he was arrested,  Goldberg said.    Sheriff's Deputy Pat Hunter said Amorosino, a self-employed fireworks  technician, was a volunteer in the department's media resources office in  Whittier, which produces training films for deputies and recruits. Officials in  the office could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Goldberg said  sheriff's officials told him that they had ended Amorosino's connection with  the department because of his arrest.      Pulled in Front of Car    Police said the assault occurred after Amorosino repeatedly pulled in front of  the woman's car as she drove south on Buena Vista Street. When the woman  attempted several times to pass Amorosino's slow-moving van, he caught up with  her and again pulled in front of her car, Goldberg said.    Amorosino then pulled alongside the woman's car, put a flashing red light atop  his van and motioned for the woman to stop, Goldberg said. The woman, thinking  that the man was a police officer, stopped and got out of her car at Buena  Vista and Victory Boulevard, Goldberg said. Amorosino, enraged and shouting  obscenities, ran up to the woman, identified himself as a sheriff's deputy,  grabbed her arms and slapped her head, Goldberg said.    Amorosino then allegedly threw the woman against the side of his van, reached  under her blouse and grabbed her right breast, Goldberg said. When the woman  yelled ""Rape!,"" Amorosino returned to his van and drove off, Goldberg said.    Police searching the van after Amorosino's arrest found a red light believed to  be the one used to stop the woman's car, a sheriff's deputy's cap with badge, a  pair of handcuffs and several explosive devices, Goldberg said.

The ship, carrying a Cuban flag and named Primer Congreso  del  Partido, arrived in Chile on 26 April from Chimbote, Peru, with  a 29-member crew. This ship anchored in Lirquen to load 3,000  tons of fishmeal.    [Begin Lirquen Customs Official Rene Lobos recording] The  ship left at 0130 and is now sailing around Lirquen Bay. [end  recording]    The two sailors who defected have been identified as Orlando  Mayo Lopez, physician, and Wilfredo Falaro Escandon, cook. They  both come from Havana and arrived last night, at approximately  2200, at the Investigative Police station in Concepcion.    [Begin Concepcion Investigative Police Official Oscar Barra  recording] What they want is for Chilean authorities to help  them travel to Miami, where they have some relatives and job  opportunities.

They  are awaiting the decision of administrative authorities.    [Begin Regional Ministry Secretariat General of the  Government Ariel Duffan recording] According to preliminary  investigations and to what they are requesting, they are not  entitled to political asylum because they are not being  persecuted for political reasons, and they have not committed  any crime that would entitle them to be granted political  asylum.

It is uncertain, however, when the Cuban ship will leave the  port of Lirquen, because in addition to the two sailors that  have defected, it has engine problems.    A third Cuban citizen also defected from his ship anchored  in  Iquique. The sailor from the Cuban ship Olguin, who has been  identified as Alay Gimenez, escaped in Iquique and requested  asylum.    Interior Under Secretary Belisario Velasco said that the  situation of the three Cubans who have requested political  asylum in Chile is being assessed.

Alan B. Kerstein had taken a day off from his usual  duties at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when the unthinkable happened and  stadium security completely collapsed.    The calamitous event did not occur during a heavy-metal rock concert or an  international soccer match. It was a Los Angeles Raiders football game.    As the clock ticked down on the Raiders' 1984 AFC championship victory over the  Seattle Seahawks, police and private security officers ""lost"" the playing field  to an onslaught of several thousand celebrating fans.    Petite Raiderette cheerleaders and 275-pound linemen scrambled for safety while  police officers launched several unsuccessful baton-wielding sorties against  the unruly fans. Reinforcements, including 10 officers on horseback -- a  cavalry charge of sorts -- finally succeeded in restoring order.    For Kerstein, who has policed Coliseum events since 1973, the crowd surge was a  grim reminder that controlling fans at professional football games is perhaps  the toughest challenge he and other stadium security officials face.    Police officials who monitor crowd safety at the Coliseum, at Anaheim Stadium  and at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego agree that keeping the peace at a  baseball game or even a tractor pull is child's play compared to Sunday  afternoon pro football.    ""This is not the opera, it's the NFL,"" observed Kerstein, who supervises Los  Angeles police officers at Coliseum events. ""You can't expect people to just  sit there and politely clap and say 'jolly good, jolly good.' ""    How to prevent the most violent incidents at football games has become a  subject of debate since the beating of a 35-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers  supporter during a Raiders game last month. The man was briefly in a coma as  the result of his injuries, but has since been released from a hospital.    Although it was not the first time a fan had been injured at a Raiders game,  the severity of the beating led to calls for beefed-up security at the  Coliseum.    Some have advocated a ban on the sale of beer at the stadium, arguing that  drunken fans are responsible for the rowdiest behavior.    Last week, Coliseum officials announced they would no longer sell beer in  20-ounce cups, opting instead for 16-ounce containers. The Coliseum Commission  is now considering implementing a temporary ban on beer sales at Raiders games  as part of a plan to reduce stadium violence.    Approximately 16,000 to 26,000 cups of beer are sold at Raiders games.    While police officials agree that drunkenness is a major contributor to stadium  violence during football games, they disagree on whether banning alcohol sales  would solve the problem.    ""It's true that our most frequent contacts are with people who have had too  much to drink,"" said San Diego Police Lt. Bill Skinner, who is responsible for  security at Jack Murphy Stadium. ""But I can't say the problems are caused by  people who buy beer inside the stadium. There's tailgate parties in the parking  lot.""    For Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim Flammini, who supervises security at Anaheim  Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Rams, the problems are linked to the nature of  professional football itself.    When 80,000 people of various temperaments and income levels pack a stadium to  watch grown men beat each other into the ground for three hours, he said, a few  slugfests in the stands are inevitable.    ""You're in an environment that is very high in emotions,"" Flammini said.  ""Professional football is a rough-and-tumble contact sport. It seems to have a  way of exciting people. . . . If someone says the wrong thing at the wrong  time, (other fans) might want to defend their team, either verbally or  sometimes with their fists.""    By contrast, Flammini said, California Angels baseball games are relatively  placid events.    ""The baseball behavior has been fantastic,"" Flammini said. ""We've had very few  incidents as compared to last year.""    For police officials, the best defense against ugly incidents at football games  is to teach officers basic crowd-control strategies and the elements of mass  psychology.    At the Coliseum, Lt. Kerstein commands about 80 to 100 Los Angeles police  officers for most events, although the number of assigned officers has  increased significantly for Raiders games after last month's incident.    Kerstein said his officers play close attention to sections 1 through 4 and 26  through 29 because those seats are sold to fans who do not have season tickets.    ""Season ticket holders tend to be much more focused on the game and less  aggressive,"" Kerstein said. ""For every one fight I'll have within the confines  of the season ticket area, I'll have 25 or 50 fights outside of those areas.""    Another fundamental rule Kerstein teaches his officers is that they should  avoid plunging alone into the stands to break up a fight. Instead, he said,  they should work in teams of six.    Ideally, four officers break up the fight itself, separating troublemakers as  quickly as possible from the rest of the crowd in ""commando-like strikes,""  Kerstein said. All the while, two other officers guard the rear to ensure the  officers are not hit from behind by fans throwing bottles or other objects.    If necessary, the unruly fans are then handcuffed in the relative safety of the  stadium tunnel.    ""You can't go too far into the crowd alone because it really presents an  officer-safety issue,"" Kerstein said. ""Sometimes I've had to go in alone  because of the situation. . . . There's been times I've been knocked on my  butt. It comes with the territory.""    Besides the near-riot that occured when the Raiders beat the Seahawks and the  fans converged on the field in 1984, the worst day Kerstein can remember was in  1988, when the Raiders played host to the Rams, who won the game 22-17.    ""If sections 1 through 15 had been all Raiders fans and 15 to 31 had been all  Rams fans, I could have done the whole thing with five cops -- piece of cake,""  Kerstein said. ""Unfortunately, every other seat was a Ram fan and the next one  was a Raider fan. They started fighting 30 minutes before kickoff and were  fighting an hour after the game ended. It was our worst game.""    The situation was also becoming ugly on Sept. 23, when the Pittsburgh Steelers  fan was injured.    Kerstein said that just moments before the incident, he had called for officers  deployed outside the stadium to help reinforce security in the stands. Several  fights had erupted throughout the stadium -- they were small ""spot fires"" that  could have become a full-fledged conflagration if action wasn't taken.    ""It was getting very agitated,"" he said. ""We had a number of problems and a  number of ejections. A couple of people threw bottles. That's just deadly. That  could kill an officer.""    Officers who work in the Coliseum said flying bottles are only one of the  problems they face patrolling the stands during Raiders games.    They complain of fans who make them the butt of derisive jokes and who openly  insult them when they break up fights. When their backs are turned, fans pelt  them with cups, paper airplanes and other items.    ""It feels I'm like a walking target for every half-empty glass of beer,"" said  one youngish-looking officer who declined to be identified.    His partner, a 10-year veteran, added: ""It's like letting all the animals loose  inside a cage and walking in.""      STADIUMS: ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND ARRESTS    The relationship between fan violence and alcohol sales at Southern California  stadiums has been a subject of debate since the Sept. 23 incident in which a  Pittsburgh Steelers fan was severely beaten while cheering his team at the Los  Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

SLAYINGS      By JIM NEWTON and SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      COSTA MESA      The murder of a pregnant Vietnamese woman, her two young children and a  30-year-old friend on Wednesday has mystified neighbors, horrified the local  Vietnamese community and so far puzzled police, who say they lack both a motive  and a suspect.    ""We don't have enough information that will send us in any one direction,""  Costa Mesa Police Capt. Thomas Lazar said Thursday, adding that the killings do  not appear to be the work of gangs or robbers. ""We have not ruled out murder or  murder-suicide.""    Hanh Thi Duong, 25; her son, Thang Quoc Nguyen, 7, and her daughter, Lan Ngoc  Nguyen, 4, were found Wednesday evening on the floor of their two-bedroom Baker  Street apartment, dead of gunshot wounds, authorities said. The fourth victim,  also Vietnamese, was identified late Thursday as Oanh Van Le, 30, of  Westminster.    Police responded to a call Wednesday evening from a man, thought to be a friend  of the family, who had arrived to help the family move. Getting no answer to  his shouts, the man peered in a broken window and saw only the woman's legs as  she lay on the floor of the apartment, located in an ethnically diverse section  of town.    Police were on the scene at 7:34 p.m. and entered the apartment briefly,  determining that the victims were dead. After cordoning off the area for hours  Wednesday night while waiting for a search warrant to investigate the crime  scene, police re-entered shortly before dawn Thursday, authorities said.    Inside, police found no evidence of a struggle. Nothing had apparently been  taken, and the apartment, though mostly bare of furniture, was not in disarray.  Without any sign of forced entry, police believe that Duong or Le may have  known the assailant -- if the deaths were not the result of a murder-suicide.    ""There was nothing to show that there was a struggle,"" Lazar said. ""Normally,  you would see ransacking.""    The bodies of the two children were discovered on the floor of their empty  bedroom, the beds already removed. The two adults were in the living room.    Neighbors said the 30-year-old Le was living with the family, but police said  he is not the children's father. Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack described Le  as a friend of the other victims.    The children's father, police believe, is either dead or in Vietnam. ""We don't  believe him to be in the area,"" Lazar said.    Police would not say how many times the victims were shot, whether the murder  weapon had been found, how the assailant had entered the apartment or other  details of the crime.    The bodies of the victims were removed at 11 a.m. Thursday and taken to the  coroner's office, where autopsies were performed. No results were released  immediately.    Neighbors were not able to provide many details about the family, saying only  that the young mother had arrived from Vietnam within the past few years, spoke  little English and kept mostly to herself.    Christine Tilley, who lives in the same apartment complex, said she had had  little contact with Duong because of her limited English. Tilley, who said that  she thought Duong was married, had noticed her neighbor's swelling waistline --  Duong was in the first trimester of her pregnancy, police said. Tilley also  said she was aware that the family was moving.    ""She was sitting on the lawn one day with her kids and I walked up and said,  'Hi,' "" Tilley said, adding that she had wished Duong and her family well in  their new home but did not know where they planned to go.    Although the mother was not well-known by many of her neighbors, 7-year-old  Thang -- a spirited young boy born in Vietnam whose school photo shows him in a  Batman shirt -- was settling into Killybrooke Elementary School and making  friends. After overcoming language problems last year, Thang was quickly  learning English and doing better in school, according to his teacher.    ""I just feel so horrible,"" said Thang's teacher, who asked not to be named. ""He  was such a sweet little boy, very cooperative, a nice little student.""    Because all four victims were Vietnamese, early speculation focused on whether  the crimes were an example of ""home-invasion"" robberies, in which bandits  typically break into homes in Asian neighborhoods, tie up, and often beat or  threaten their victims.    Neighbors said there had been several such robberies in the area recently, as  well as other break-ins, street crimes and car thefts. But the fact that  nothing appeared missing from the apartment and that no struggle appears to  have occurred squelched the home-invasion theory, police said.    That brought little comfort to those who live in the community, however, as  many fretted over what they say is a recent escalation in area crime. Those  crimes, some neighbors said, frightened them out of taking action when they  heard a commotion -- pounding on walls and running footsteps -- in and around  the apartment late Wednesday afternoon.    The murders stunned the local Vietnamese community, and local leaders groped  for a theory that could explain the brutal killings.    ""Most of the people think it's either love or money,"" said Mai Cong, chairman  of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a social service agency.  ""But one thing that no one has any explanation for is why they killed two  children. That puzzles everyone.    ""I don't remember any similar case where they shoot the whole family,"" Cong  said.    Nghi Duong, a Costa Mesa resident who is not related to the mother, agreed.    ""How could such a shocking tragedy happen to a family like that?"" Nghi Duong  asked. ""The killer should be sent back to Vietnam.""    Times staff writers James M. Gomez and Eric Lichtblau contributed to this  report.

Steven Paul Harston's arraignment was continued for two weeks, but prosecutors  filed a criminal complaint charging him with kidnaping the    baby and her mother and assaulting the baby and the officer, who was identified  in court documents Friday as Leonard Rivera.    Anaheim Police Capt. Randall Gaston would only identify the officer as 36 years  old and a 15-year veteran of the Police Department. Gaston said this was the  first shooting of Rivera's law-enforcement career.    The officer declined through supervisors to be interviewed but was said to be  concerned for the baby's welfare. As is routine in shootings by officers,  Rivera is on paid leave and has seen the police psychiatrist, who will decide  when he is ready to return to duty.    The baby, Michelle Olmos, was released Thursday from the hospital with a  wounded buttock and is expected to heal with only the faintest of scars. She  was wounded once in the    right buttock as she sat strapped in the front passenger seat beside her  mother.    As Jody Olmos, 31, idled Wednesday morning in traffic on State College  Boulevard, a man climbed into her car, pointed a gun at her head and reportedly  said, ""Drive, or I'll shoot you."" Police say the gunman abandoned his rental  car and was fleeing officers who chased him for running a stop sign.    Rivera, a motorcycle officer, ordered the gunman to surrender. Police say the  gunman did not. Seeing the intruder pointing a semiautomatic handgun at Olmos  and then Rivera, the officer fired from 10 feet behind Olmos' Mercury, and two  shots shattered her rear windshield, authorities said. One slug lodged in a car  seat, the other pierced the passenger seat and struck the infant, who was in  front because she constantly climbed out of her safety seat.    The Olmos family criticized the officer for firing at the gunman when, they  said, he should have seen the child safety seat in the rear of the car. They  said it is frightening that Rivera could fire twice from ""so close"" and miss  his target.    But Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael W. Nunn said Friday that results  so far of his department's investigation of the shooting show that Rivera  ""acted properly and according to procedure.""    Gaston said the Anaheim Police Department's policy on use of deadly force holds  that an officer may use a gun to protect himself or others from what the  officer ""reasonably believes is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily  injury."" Such force is also considered justified in order to ""prevent the  escape or arrest of a fleeing felon if the officer has reasonable cause to  believe the crime"" caused serious harm to someone.    Rivera's actions, Gaston and Nunn said, were within those guidelines.    Gaston said there is a variety of hostage scenarios to which an officer might  react differently, depending on his position in relation to a suspect and his  ability to seek cover. Because the intruder pointed his gun at Rivera, police  said, he did not have that luxury.    ""It is to our advantage not to rush the situation or create an immediate need  to use a gun,"" Gaston said. ""However, there are some situations where an  officer is vulnerable and has to decide . . . 'Do I stand there and let them  drive off or try to shoot and stop them?'    ""It's a millisecond of a decision,"" Gaston said, ""and it's the longest  millisecond of your life.""    On Friday, Harston, 24, was charged in Municipal Court in Fullerton with seven  felonies. They were one count each of evading arrest, being a felon in  possession of a gun, assault on an officer, assault with a firearm on an  officer, assault -- for the baby's shooting -- and two counts of kidnaping.    If convicted of the kidnaping charges alone, Harston, an unemployed drifter  with a history of drug use, could be sentenced to life in prison without the  possibility of parole, authorities said.    Because Harston violated his parole on a federal bank robbery conviction,  Municipal Judge Kazuharu Makino ordered him held without bail in Orange County  Jail pending his arraignment Sept. 29. He was assigned a public defender.    Nunn said he charged Harston with assaulting the child with a deadly weapon  because ""the child got hurt as a result of his actions.""    The shooting would never have occurred had Harston not threatened people with  his own gun after bolting from traffic officers Wednesday morning, Nunn said.    ""If the guy had driven off with the mother and baby, everyone would be saying  he should have shot the guy,"" Nunn said. Rivera ""did the best he could do. Any  way around it, that (officer) is going to lose. But the officer is not on trial  here. Mr. Harston is. And I would like to get him sent to jail for the rest of  his life.""

Allegations included planting drugs on suspects, assault,  theft, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and criminal  damage. More than 50 allegations related to just five of the 45  officers.    The Police Complaints Authority, who supervised the  investigation, said a report had been sent to the Crown  Prosecution Service.    It would be up to them to determine if officers would be  prosecuted, after which Scotland Yard would decide on  disciplinary charges.    Operation Jackpot, which began in April, 1991, was prompted  by the claims of Pearl Cameron, a convicted drug dealer, who  said she had evidence that certain Stoke Newington officers were  dealing in drugs.    In the following months, dozens of people arrested for  dealing drugs, including crack cocaine, came forward to claim  they had drugs planted on them by detectives from the station.    By early 1992, three officers had been suspended and eight  transferred.    One officer central to many allegations was Det-Con Roy  Lewandowski, who was eventually charged with stealing valuables  from the home of a man who died after a burglary at his home.    He was also accused of planting evidence from the burglary  scene on two men, who were later convicted. Lewandowski was  jailed for 18 months in November, 1992, and the two men  convicted on his evidence were freed last February.    Since then another nine people, almost all imprisoned for  drug offences on evidence by Lewandowski and some of his  colleagues, have had their convictions quashed.    After the most recent appeal in December, Lord Taylor, Lord  Chief Justice, described police evidence as ""tainted evidence  from a source which ought to be reliable and in which the courts  should have confidence.""    In all, Jackpot investigated 22 separate cases. Two others  were dropped, one because the complainant decided to take out a  civil action and the other because allegations were withdrawn.  One officer featured in eight cases, another in seven and three  in six, while two officers had 11 specific allegations against  them.    During the investigation, the inquiry team took 376  statements and examined transcripts of police interviews,  custody records and court proceedings.    The complaints authority said a difficulty facing the  inquiry  was the ""limited co-operation"" given by complainants.    The first complaint was in September, 1991, and the last in  August last year, which is why the inquiry was so protracted.  Three complaints were made two years after incidents to which  they related.    ""Whatever the reason for these delays, they did not assist  the investigation,"" said an authority spokesman.    An organisation calling itself the Hackney Community Defence  Association has given advice and support to many complainants  and has built up its own dossier against officers at Stoke  Newington and Hackney.    The association had dealt with 381 complaints against  officers from the two stations since January, 1989, and was  supporting 83 civil actions against Metropolitan Police  Commissioner Paul Condon.    Sir John Smith, deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan  Police, said the Jackpot allegations were serious and involved a  ""significant number of police officers""--but only a tiny  minority in the force.    In Stoke Newington, there were ""over 300 police officers  doing a difficult and sometimes dangerous job in that difficult  policing environment. The majority are untouched by the  allegations.""    Sir John said Stoke Newington police had recorded some  remarkable successes in the battle against local drug dealing.     "

By Hugo Martin      The Torrance Police Department has a problem that every police force would love  to have.    It has busted so many drug buyers and dealers in recent years that it has no  place to put all the confiscated drugs.    The police property room is overflowing with marijuana, heroin, amphetamines  and other assorted drugs. But most of the bounty is cocaine, according police  officials.    In order to accommodate the huge stash, the Police Department asked the City  Council this week to allocate $14,890 to enlarge the property room by 1,650  square feet. (For security reasons police officials would not give the property  room's current size.)    The heavily reinforced room will be completed in about five weeks, city  officials said.    ""When they designed this place years ago it never entered anyone's mind that we  would confiscate so many drugs,"" said police spokesman Sgt. Ron Traber.    The source of these illicit drugs is an emerging wave of international drug  traffickers who have made Torrance and surrounding cities a national  distribution center for their multibillion-dollar industry, according to Lt.  David Marsden, the head of the narcotics detail. Major drug dealers choose to  operate in these cities because of their proximity to freeways, the Port of Los  Angeles and to Los Angeles International Airport, he said.    Not satisfied with simply arresting drug dealers in the city, Torrance  detectives began in late 1984 to work with federal agents in tracing the  international drug supply line as it branched out from the airport and the  port. As a result, Torrance police have made busts and confiscated dope and  money as far away as Santa Ana, East Los Angeles and Orange.    ""We just began following the organization and we started crossing paths with  federal investigators,"" Marsden said.    One benefit for the city is that the Police Department gets a portion of the  seized money. From 1985 to 1988, Torrance detectives impounded more than $3  million in cash, receiving back $350,000 from federal officials.    Proof of just how badly the department needs a bigger drug storage room is in  the figures: from 1984 to 1986 police say they grabbed cocaine worth $28.4  million. Last year the department confiscated about 1,700 pounds of cocaine,  worth about $170 million, Marsden said. During the first three months of 1989,  the department has already matched that amount.

This is  what he said:    [Begin Rios recording] In 15 days, we will totally  reorganize  the state's Judicial Police. When I say totally, I mean the  absolute and complete reorganization relating to the actions and  conduct of Judicial Police members. [end recording]    At a news conference, the state attorney general said that  bad policemen will be dismissed immediately, especially those  who took part in Thursday's shoot-out, here in Tijuana, where  Federal Judicial Police Commander Salvador Miramontes Torres  died, federal policeman Juan Jesus Hernandez Tejeda was  seriously wounded, and a state policeman was also killed.    Franco Rios reiterated that the investigation continues so  as  to supply the judge handling the case with the most evidence so  he can best ascertain the responsibility of the policemen  involved as well as the involvement of Tijuana Assistant  Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara and the group leaders named  by the Attorney General's Office.    The attorney general said that many of these policemen went  to the scene of the shoot-out to do their duty but their names  are listed in the case. He also said that on Monday two agents  from the Attorney General's Office in Ensenada and Mexicali  arrived here in Tijuana to continue the case and to clarify  which agents are involved in drug trafficking. Finally, Deputy  Alejandro Monraz called for the creation of a special  Prosecutor's Office, with no connection with the state Attorney  General's Office, to investigate Thursday night's shoot-out in  La Mesa area, where four people were killed and eight, wounded.    Announcer: I asked you if this is in response to  the Thursday shoot-out?    Flores: Yes, of course. The Attorney General's  Office held a news conference on Sunday here in Tijuana. It was  learned that there is a direct connection between the shoot-out  and State Judicial Police. Many of them are at the state  Attorney General's Office right now. No arrests warrants have  been issued yet, even though many were detained. At least three  group leaders are accused of being involved in the shoot-out,  especially as bodyguards of a lieutenant working for the  Arellano Felix brothers.

But after a few weeks of watching the area up close as part of the Anaheim  Police Department's new Community Action Policing team, the two officers soon  realized that some card parties actually were ploys to conceal drug  transactions.    ""The card games and the drinking are fronts,"" Schroepfer said recently as she  broke up one such congregation, dispersing the crowd and emptying beer bottles.  ""This is where the contacts are made. A guy walks up to the table like he's  part of the game and a (drug) deal is made.""    Whether it's breaking up clandestine narcotics operations or knocking on  residents' doors to ask them about the problems in their neighborhoods, Anaheim  police are trying a personal and concentrated approach of policing the city's  10 worst crime areas.    ""I like it,"" said Leopoldo Gonzalez, a nine-year resident of Sabina Street. ""We  really need their help.""    Gonzalez watched from his yard as Wylie and Schroepfer detained a convicted  drug user who they suspected was trying to buy drugs.    ""I'm glad the police are making an effort to come around here more,"" said the  37-year-old father of two. ""There's a lot of drinking, drugs, and fighting  around here. It's very unsafe.""    For years, similar programs have been used by other departments in the county  with varying degrees of success.    ""It's a very vogue form of policing right now,"" said James Lasley, an assistant  professor of criminal justice at Cal State Fullerton who helped the Los Angeles  Police Department form a community policing program called Operation  Cul-de-sac. ""It's the wave of the future . . . it can be very effective.""    Anaheim's $360,000, two-year program is staffed by four officers, a sergeant  and a lieutenant. It is modeled after a successful pilot program in the  Jeffrey-Lynne area earlier this year which incorporated several city  departments, including code enforcement, community services and other sections  within the Police Department.    The unit uses foot, bike and vehicle patrols to comb through certain parts of  the city to make their presence known to residents as well as miscreants.    After breaking up the card game, Wylie and Schroepfer continued to walk around  the predominantly Latino neighborhood, greeting residents and asking them if  anybody was out to sell drogas.    Schroepfer, who was followed around by several barefoot children as she walked  toward an alley on Sabina Street, found a discarded hypodermic needle lying on  the ground near some trash cans.    ""This is why parents around here are afraid to let their children out,"" she  said as she picked up the needle and threw it away.    A short distance away, she stopped and questioned a suspected drunk who had  just urinated in an alley in a spot where it appeared others had done the same.  Using a neighborhood teen-ager to translate in Spanish, she told the man to go  home or face being arrested.    He left.    Throughout the night, the officers walked and drove through Sabina, Rose and  Bush streets, stopping suspected gang members, drug dealers and users and beer  drinkers.    ""Instead of going from one call to another across the city like regular patrol  officers, we're afforded the opportunity to really take the time and talk with  the people,"" Wylie said. ""It goes a long way toward getting them to trust us.""    Developing a good relationship with the business owners, community groups and  residents will determine the success of the program, according to Lt. Ray Welch  and Sgt. Mike Hannah, the two men who run the month-old unit.    Once residents begin to trust the officers, they will be more likely to call  the police when problems develop, they said.    ""We want to go from crisis management to a long-range proactive service,"" Welch  said. ""We need to educate them on the system so they can use us to help them  better.""    The trust the officers are seeking may be tough to develop because of cultural  and language barriers, Welch and Hannah admit. All four officers in the unit  have some working knowledge of Spanish, but only one is fluent.    One recent weekend night, Wylie and Schroepfer went door to door with the other  two officers in the unit, Hank Fantes and Fred Pittington, and did some good  old-fashioned handshaking with residents and listened to their concerns.    ""Many of the families told us they don't let their children go outside to play,  or want their wives to go by the stores themselves"" because of drug dealers and  gang members loitering in the neighborhood, Pittington said.    After talking with the residents, Pittington said he felt ""a certain  indignation and outrage"" at their plight that he didn't get while ""working  regular patrol.""    ""You simply don't have that same reaction, the same feelings, because you can't  allow yourself the time to do that,"" he said. ""I think we're finally talking to  people and finding some way to get a link across between the Police Department  and the citizens that just wasn't here before.""    In the Jeffrey-Lynne pilot program, crime dropped significantly as police made  230 arrests for such crimes as drug possession, drunkenness and urinating in  public. The police are hoping to see the same results in the target areas.    Crime in Jeffrey-Lynne has increased somewhat since the program was stopped,  but not to the level it was before the community policing began, police  officials said. No comparative statistics were available.    Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said the program should work, but results  won't occur overnight. ""I think we can have an impact in all (10) of the  (target) areas,"" he said.    The concept of community policing is an old idea that ""got lost somewhere"" when  officers became more mobilized and more demands were made on their time, Molloy  said.    ""We kind of lost touch,"" he said. ""We're revisiting these programs . . . we  want to show the people they can take control of their neighborhoods.""

But after a few weeks of watching the area up close as part of the Anaheim  Police Department's new Community Action Policing team, the two officers soon  realized that some card parties actually were ploys to conceal drug  transactions.    ""The card games and the drinking are fronts,"" Schroepfer said recently as she  broke up one such congregation, dispersing the crowd and emptying beer bottles.  ""This is where the contacts are made. A guy walks up to the table like he's  part of the game and a (drug) deal is made.""    Whether it's breaking up clandestine narcotics operations or knocking on  residents' doors to ask them about the problems in their neighborhoods, Anaheim  police are trying a personal and concentrated approach of policing the city's  10 worst crime areas.    ""I like it,"" said Leopoldo Gonzalez, a nine-year resident of Sabina Street. ""We  really need their help.""    Gonzalez watched from his yard as Wylie and Schroepfer detained a convicted  drug user who they suspected was trying to buy drugs.    ""I'm glad the police are making an effort to come around here more,"" said the  37-year-old father of two. ""There's a lot of drinking, drugs, and fighting  around here. It's very unsafe.""    For years, similar programs have been used by other departments in the county  with varying degrees of success.    ""It's a very vogue form of policing right now,"" said James Lasley, an assistant  professor of criminal justice at Cal State Fullerton who helped the Los Angeles  Police Department form a community policing program called Operation  Cul-de-sac. ""It's the wave of the future . . . it can be very effective.""    Anaheim's $360,000, two-year program is staffed by four officers, a sergeant  and a lieutenant. It is modeled after a successful pilot program in the  Jeffrey-Lynne area earlier this year which incorporated several city  departments, including code enforcement, community services and other sections  within the Police Department.    The unit uses foot, bike and vehicle patrols to comb through certain parts of  the city to make their presence known to residents as well as miscreants.    After breaking up the card game, Wylie and Schroepfer continued to walk around  the predominantly Latino neighborhood, greeting residents and asking them if  anybody was out to sell drogas.    Schroepfer, who was followed around by several barefoot children as she walked  toward an alley on Sabina Street, found a discarded hypodermic needle lying on  the ground near some trash cans.    ""This is why parents around here are afraid to let their children out,"" she  said as she picked up the needle and threw it away.    A short distance away, she stopped and questioned a suspected drunk who had  just urinated in an alley in a spot where it appeared others had done the same.  Using a neighborhood teen-ager to translate in Spanish, she told the man to go  home or face being arrested.    He left.    Throughout the night, the officers walked and drove through Sabina, Rose and  Bush streets, stopping suspected gang members, drug dealers and users and beer  drinkers.    ""Instead of going from one call to another across the city like regular patrol  officers, we're afforded the opportunity to really take the time and talk with  the people,"" Wylie said.

There is no doubt that the police have  failed. For many hours they did not turn up at all,  preservation of evidence and cooperation with the Federal Public  Prosecutor did not work. What is the point of having a ""Police  Concept for Fighting Political Extremism and Xenophobic Crimes,""  which the interior minister sent to police stations in January,  if it does not produce any results in practice?    What happened in Magdeburg is nothing new, though. Police  have made mistakes in the old laender as well. We still  remember the picture of a police officer being chased through  the streets of West Berlin by rampaging leftist gangs on 1 May  1989 -- before reunification.    In the new laender, the situation is aggravated by manpower  shortages and a lack of motivation. People say that in Dresden  you have to report a murder to get a policeman to the scene of a  crime. In Saxony-Anhalt, police vehicles are said to be  reluctant to go to the scenes of crimes, but they would rather  go as far away from it as quickly as possible -- after all, you  do not want to risk your life because of some criminal. Such  reports are certainly exaggerated, and one should be careful not  to make sweeping judgments. But there is no harm in knowing  what the difficulties are that police authorities are facing.    The Federal President made a welcome statement, saying that  it is hard to grasp how hooligans and right-wing extremists  could hunt down people in the middle of a big city and be  released after having been detained. Such a clear statement had  been long overdue. As long as the perpetrators came from the  left-wing scene, appeasement was the order of the day. Only  since right-wing extremists have started imitating and outdoing  the other end of the spectrum and since -- last but not least --  effective solutions have been demanded abroad, the mood has  changed.    Political signals for a more severe fight against extremist  violence can, however, not be put into practice without  problems. The existing laws especially prevent this.  Admittedly, criminals that are caught red-handed can be  detained by police officers without an arrest warrant -- but  this is only possible if they are suspected of escaping, if  their identity cannot be established, or if there is imminent  danger providing sufficient cause for an arrest warrant. In the  interest of the freedom of the individual, the limits of the  latter have been set out very narrowly, also, and especially, as  far as the danger of recurrence is concerned. The judiciary is  meticulously monitoring the observance of these limits, and  police officers have been told to follow them strictly. In  addition, there is the possibility of protective detention to  avert danger (up to two days in Saxony-Anhalt).    Police are bound by these laws. Before criticizing police  actions, one should be aware of this situation. Otherwise, one  might get the impression that the police are accused of obeying  the law.    On the other hand, the Magdeburg events once again underline  that the laws urgently need to be adapted to the changing  circumstances. The coalition's 1994 Crime Prevention Act, which  is meeting with resistance in the Bundesrat, will improve this  situation considerably. It is high time that the police and  judicial authorities are provided with instruments that are more  suitable for fighting violence -- especially right-wing  extremist violence -- than the existing ones. Further delays  would be irresponsible. The given law has become a test case  that will show whether politicians are willing to fight violence  effectively, doing something beyond expressing dismay.     "

The drug was contained in one kg bags hidden in a  special container inside a bus driving on the Turkey-Germany  route.

The applicants must  be under 25 years of age and physically fit, and must not have  any criminal record. They also must have completed their  military service.

The PDP  representatives demanded the employment of more Albanians in  these organizations. ""Albanians in the northern part of Kercovo  are not at all satisfied with the service of the Macedonian  employees in the internal affairs offices of the country.  Citizens must wait for days to get ordinary documents or  certificates, while Macedonians are able to get them with just a  telephone call,"" the PDP representatives are cited as saying.  Because of such delays, the representatives asked that the  offices in Osllome (Oslomej) and Zajas be staffed by Albanians,  as more than 9O percent of the residents of these areas are of  Albanian nationality. Even though the new passports are written  in the Latin alphabet, some letters are replaced by Cyrillic  letters, causing some ethnic Albanians employed outside the  country to demand new passports, the article notes. It goes on  to point out that the representatives of the Directorate General  and of the Sector for Internal Affairs declared that the  appropriate ministries would be informed of these controversies,  but they also asked that citizens not request documents that are  not needed, pointing out, for example, that new identification  cards are not required because the existing ones will be valid  until the law is approved. There was also a discussion of the  need to train Albanian youths for the police force, the article  concludes.

They also  called for the proportional employment of Albanians in the  Interior Ministry unit in Struga, for the acceptance of  Albanians into the police force in proportion to their  percentage of the population, and for more Albanian students to  be admitted to the Interior Ministry secondary school, the  report notes.

The pamphlet, the first of its kind, is also a result of modified state codes  more clearly defining hate crimes.    Police documented 126 hate crimes in San Diego and 147 countywide since  November, according to John Graham, a Police Department crime prevention  specialist and co-author of the hate crime pamphlet.    The four-page pamphlet, released this week and available at any of the city's  10 community relations offices, tells how to identify and report a hate crime.    A hate crime, as defined by the California attorney general's office, ""is any  act or attempted act to cause physical injury, emotional suffering or property  damage, which is or appears to be motivated, all or in part, by race,  ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.""    When reporting a hate crime, the pamphlet says, try to report the crime from  the scene and get a detailed description of the assailant.    Documentation of hate crimes began shortly after the California Penal Code was  revised early last year to include guidelines on crimes committed on the basis  of race, ethnicity, religious and sexual orientation of the victim, Graham  said.    Before the code was updated, Graham said police documented hate crimes under a  different category, typically vandalism or battery. With a more clear  definition of hate crimes now on the books, law enforcement agencies expect to  keep better tabs on their degree and frequency, he said.    In addition, those convicted of hate crimes may face extra charges, said  Graham, who constructed a scenario to illustrate his point:    ""Say one person is swinging a baseball bat and verbally abusing another person  because of race, ethnicity or sexual orientation -- that used to be (only)  battery. Now it is a hate crime and can amount to additional charges,"" Graham  said. A hate crime carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $5,000  fine.    Graham cautioned, however, that verbal affronts alone do not constitute a hate  crime unless they are backed up with the threat of violence.    ""Hopefully with educating the public on what hate crimes are and how to report  them, we can improve on the percentage of people caught,"" Graham said, adding  that most hate-related crimes go unsolved.

And security officials in  the east China city are trying to track down the identities of  the 54 signatories to a petition on political reform that was  sent to the National People's Congress (NPC) on Friday [25  March]. Sources in the dissident community said Zhu, who is in  his early 30s, was detained early this month following a spate  of run-ins with local security agents.    A college graduate and an employee in a company that  provides  information for citizens seeking to go abroad, Zhu is loosely  associated with the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights.  Before his detention, he was hauled in for brief questioning at  least twice this year. The first time was after police found  Zhu had secretly taped their conversation with him. The second  was at a Shanghai disco after Zhu shouted on the dance floor  slogans calling for overturning the verdict on the Tiananmen  Square crackdown.    Zhu's relatives indicated yesterday they had not been told  by  local police where he was being held or for what reason. Out of  fear of the authorities, however, the relatives have not taken  any action.    Meanwhile, Shanghai sources said police were investigating  the ""background"" behind last Friday's 19-point petition, which  called for constitutional amendments to introduce a multi-party  system. It is understood that, while the petition to the NPC  stated 54 people had signed it, only seven names appeared on the  document. ""Police are trying to find out who the 47 unnamed  signatories are,"" a source said. ""They also want to check if an  `anti-government' organisation is behind it.""    The source said the local procuratorate yesterday tried to  get into contact with Dai Xuezhong, an activist who spent two  years in a reeducation through labour camp after the June 4,  1989, crackdown. It is understood that Mr Dai, now a private  entrepreneur, yesterday refused to respond when officers tried  to contact him through his pager.    Dissidents in Shanghai said the authorities were alarmed by  the petition because it was more radical than similar ones  organised this month by Beijing-based intellectuals such as Xu  Liangying, Wang Dan or Liu Nianchun. They said copies of the  petition had been sent by mail to intellectuals in the big  cities.     "

Four gunmen opened fire on a  group of mainly youths preparing for an African National  Congress [ANC] voter education workshop in rural Mahehle,  south-west of Pietermaritzburg. Fourteen people were killed at  the scene and two were seriously wounded. Police said 11 people  were killed inside a hut while three died trying to flee their  attackers in the early hours of Saturday morning.    Midlands ANC Chairman Harry Gwala said those killed were  preparing for an ANC voter education workshop in the area at  noon. South African Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said a  group of about 16 youths had spent the night at an abandoned  house, where they came under attack by four men. The attackers  opened fire on the group, while some victims were stabbed to  death. Maj Naidoo confirmed a voter education programme was  being planned in the area.    A Creighton police spokesman said the attack occurred about  14km from the rural town, south-west of Pietermaritzburg. He  said the attackers used automatic weapons and homemade guns.    Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said he  suspected ""those who don't want people to vote,"" were  responsible for the massacre. He said the area had been  relatively stable with no recent incidents of political violence.    Nearby Ixopo and Richmond have, however, been wracked by  intense political fighting since 1990 with a massacre at  Masanagazane, outside Richmond, two weeks ago when 12 people  were killed.    The ANC was investigating the attack, said Chief Mlaba.    The ANC's Natal premier election candidate, Jacob Zuma, on  Sunday told reporters he feared rural supporters would face  increasing violence in the run up to elections.    Maj Naidoo said police were offering a substantial reward  for  information leading to arrests and convictions of those  responsible for the Mahehle massacre. He named the dead as:  Mdeni Malunga, 15; Mbuso Nxasane, 17; Dumisani Duzela, 13;  Thamsanqa Ngcobe, 15; Sokelazwa Mbanjwa, 16; Bongwela Mbanjwa,  16; Tholozami Cyril Shobo, 12; Mandlenkosi Mbhele, 26; Sifiso  Ndlovu, 13; Givi Ndlovu, 13; Sibusiso Dusuzi Maphumulo, 15;  Siyabonga Ngubo, 17; Duduzi Mia, 28; and Kulama Madlala, 16.

By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CUDAHY      Amid a political feud with the Bell City Council and a faltering recall effort,  the Cudahy City Council this week turned over the responsibility for law  enforcement services in the city to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department.    Sheriff's deputies Wednesday began patrolling Cudahy streets that for 15 years  have been considered the back-yard territory of the Bell Police Department.    In addition to the switch, Cudahy Councilman John Robertson has called for the  formation of a public safety commission to oversee community crime abatement  programs and act as a liaison between the residents and the Sheriff's  Department.    Robertson denied accusations that the commission is merely an attempt to  placate angry Cudahy residents who launched a recall effort in September in  response to the decision to change to the Sheriff's Department in mid-contract.  The contract for police services with the city of Bell was not scheduled to  expire until July, 1990, but under a 90-day notice clause, either party can be  released.    ""This is not just tossing a bone to the community,"" Robertson said.    The recall effort, started in mid-September by residents who were angry that  they were not allowed to vote on the contract switch, is the fifth such move  against Robertson over the years, he said. City officials rejected the first  set of papers filed by the Committee for Good Government because they were  improperly served. Georgia Scrivner, a member of the committee, said another  set of recall petitions has been submitted to the city clerk. The petitions  must be certified before the group can begin collecting signatures.    The new $1.6-million contract with the Sheriff's Department calls for 17  deputies to be assigned to Cudahy full time, said Capt. Lynne Poos. With  staggered shifts, Poos said, there will be three patrol cars on the streets all  but four hours. For four hours, he said, there will be two cars on patrol. The  additional manpower, plus anti-drug and anti-gang programs, and liability  insurance carried by the county, persuaded a majority of the council that a  switch to the Sheriff's Department would be best for the community, Robertson  said.    The transfer in mid-contract has left some Bell city officials dumbfounded and  angry. ""We had been working closer together,"" Bell Councilman George Cole said.  ""That's why this was such a shock. There was not one complaint, not a letter,  nothing.""    Robertson maintained that the decision to switch was ""not a question of  friendship. It was a matter of service.""    Officials from the Sheriff's Department and the Bell Police Department say Bell  and Cudahy have been bickering over which city should have control over the  Police Department for much of the 15 years they had been working together.    ""What happened now is that Bell and Cudahy got a divorce and Bell got custody  of the Police Department,"" one officer said.    Left without the added responsibility of serving Cudahy, the Bell City Council  this week unveiled a plan for more extensive police protection in its city.    Among the changes will be more park patrols, a business watch program,  increased anti-gang and anti-drug programs in the elementary schools and high  schools, and special enforcement activities, such as drug stings and  anti-prostitution programs.    ""Cudahy put some limitations on our service,"" Mayor Ray Johnson said. ""The  bottom line is that police protection in (Bell) will be greater than it has  been up to now.""    Johnson said the department had 47 officers handling both cities and had  budgeted for seven more. But without Cudahy and its $1.3-million annual  contract, the department would have been left with too many officers and not  enough money, Johnson said. By the end of next June, he said, the force will be  reduced to 40 officers through attrition and transfers.    Although there will be fewer officers, Johnson said, Bell residents will be  getting more protection and programs because police services will no longer be  spread so thin. The number of officers per one thousand residents will jump  from .9 to 1.4, he said.

The drugs were smuggled to Greece through the river Evros by  a 39-year-old Turkish casino owner, Deniz Ozkan, and were handed  over to his compatriot, escaped from a Patras prison last  February. ""He was on a five-day leave, as the law provides, but  he never returned to the jail,"" Khristos Keramidas, Attiki's  security police chief, told reporters.    A few days ago, officers of the drug squad spotted the  escaped prisoner in Passalimani, Piraeus. They followed him and  found out that he was being hidden by a Greek convicted drug  dealer Khristos Peroutseas, aged 36. The police stormed his  apartment yesterday and arrested the two men, discovering one  and a half kilos of heroin.     "

0,FT944-6687 ,"FT944-6687 _AN-EK2CXAAXFT 941129   FT  29 NOV 94 / Italian terror suspects arrested      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   Italian police claim to have made a breakthrough in unmasking Falange Armata, a right-wing group that has claimed responsibility for numerous acts of terrorism over the past five years. This follows the arrest over the past week of three policeman, two of them brothers, stationed in Bologna and the Emilia Romagna region. All three are believed to be linked to some 15 unexplained killings and a series of violent robberies dating back to 1988. A pistol found in the possession of one of the arrested policeman has been matched by firearms experts to the killing of a carabiniere and the murder of a prison educationalist. Police are now checking whether the group was protected within the service and allowed to carry out activities to destabilise Emilia Romagna, the region controlled by the former Communist party. The inquiry could also clarify still unexplained aspects of terrorist attacks in Bologna, including the bombing of Bologna station in 1980 that killed 80 people and left 200 injured.

Spokesman Maj Burger van Rooyen said Eskom informed the South  African Police on Friday [1 April] that the weapons were its  property, and that it had cancelled the transaction.

With his  application was an official letter from the kwaZulu commissioner  of police, giving authority for the receipt of the weapons.

By LUCY CHABOT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      YORBA LINDA      Police are looking for a man who raped a 15-year-old jogger Saturday afternoon  off the bike trail behind her apartment complex in a east Yorba Linda  neighborhood.    The girl, whose name was not released because of her age and the nature of the  crime, was jogging on the trail about 4:20 p.m. when a man emerged from the  bushes, grabbed her and dragged her back to the underbrush, Brea Police Sgt.

The girl, who attends an area high school, walked back to her residence near La  Palma Avenue and Camino de Bryant after the attack and was taken to St. Jude  Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton where she was treated and  released, Dickerson said.    Residents in the relatively new housing development next to the apartment  complex were shaken and surprised to hear of the attack Sunday.

RELATIVES SAY HE WAS  DRINKING AT HOME BUT WAS NOT ARMED WHEN HE WENT OUTSIDE.      By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 60-year-old Oxnard man standing in the bushes outside his La Colonia house  was shot three times after aiming a gun at a police officer, Oxnard police said  Friday.    Police shot Ubertino O. Ayala in the arm, chest and leg as a horrified family  member watched. Although police say they recovered a gun at the scene, Ayala's  family contends that he was unarmed.    Ayala was reported in critical condition at St. John's Regional Medical Center  on Friday evening after surgery, a nursing supervisor said.    According to a statement by the Oxnard Police Department, the shooting is being  investigated by the department and by the Ventura County district attorney's  office.    Sgt. John Crombach, who was on duty Thursday night, said five police officers  responded after receiving a report on the 911 emergency line about 9:45 p.m.  from an unidentified woman about a man with a weapon.    When police arrived at Ayala's house in the 100 block of Featherstone Street,  Ayala pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Officer Ken Dellinger,  police said. Dellinger warned Ayala in English, ""Police! Drop the gun!"" but  Ayala walked toward the officer, police said. Dellinger then fired his weapon  at Ayala.    Police refused to elaborate further on the statement and deferred all other  questions to the investigating officials, who were not available Friday.  Crombach said investigators may examine the tape of the 911 call.    According to family members, Ayala, who was slightly drunk after a Thanksgiving  Day celebration with his family, retreated to a corner of his front yard to  urinate behind a bush when he was surprised by the officer.    Ayala, who speaks only Spanish, could not have understood the officer, said  Ramon Ayala, Ubertino Ayala's 30-year-old son.    ""He doesn't speak a word of English,"" he said.    It was the second time in two months that Oxnard police have been involved in a  shooting in the mostly Spanish-speaking La Colonia neighborhood. On Oct. 6,  Oxnard police officers shot and killed a man who had reportedly made threats  against a family.    Heliodoro Rodriguez Montero, 47, was shot by officers after he pointed a gun at  police at least three times, police said. Three officers, who were placed on  leave while the shooting was investigated, have been cleared and have returned  to duty, Crombach said.    Police officials also placed Dellinger on administrative leave.    Crombach described the 50-year-old Dellinger as a veteran officer ""with a broad  base of experience,"" including nearly 20 years on the Oxnard force.    ""If Officer Dellinger fired that weapon in self-defense, he certainly felt like  he was being threatened,"" Crombach said. He acknowledged that communication ""is  an inherent problem where you're dealing with an ethnic group with language  barriers.""    The shooting triggered an angry response from other family members and several  neighbors who said they knew Ayala as a quiet man who had never had problems  with police.    Ayala's wife, Alicia, said her husband had been drinking and was still slightly  drunk at the time of the shooting. She and her daughter, Celia Zavala, denied  contacting police.    One family member who saw the shooting said police also threatened to shoot  him, even though he was unarmed.    Carlos Zavala, Ayala's son-in-law, said he was at Ayala's house to seek advice  regarding a recent marital separation with Ayala's daughter. He said they had  been talking outside when Ayala excused himself to go to the bathroom and began  walking behind a large bush.    Ayala had just rounded a corner of the house when a police officer appeared on  the other side of a wire fence and began to fire, Zavala said.    Zavala, who said he did not hear any warnings by the officer, said he was  frightened by the gunfire and ran to hide, but the same police officer who shot  Ayala approached him and yelled at Zavala to disarm himself. During the whole  incident, Ayala had nothing in his hands, he said.    ""I'm sure he didn't have a pistol in his hands,"" said Zavala, 30. ""They were  about to shoot at me because I had my hand hidden in my shirt."" Zavala said he  was unarmed, but his injured right wrist is wrapped in a bulky brace.    On Friday, about 15 family members gathered outside Ayala's hospital room where  he lay unconscious after undergoing six hours of surgery. Some sat in a nearby  waiting room, saying the shooting was unjust.    Jose Ayala, 40, said his father was employed at a mushroom farm and had lived  in California for decades. He said family members are considering legal action  against the Oxnard Police Department.    ""We didn't know a thing like this could happen,"" Jose Ayala said. ""We don't  even know why the police were there.""    Jose Villasenor, 67, Ayala's next-door neighbor, said he was watching  television when he heard four or five shots outside. When he stepped out to see  what was going on, he found the neighborhood ringed with police officers.    Villasenor, who has lived next to Ayala for 16 years, said he was surprised  that his next-door neighbor had been shot.    ""He's a quiet guy. The police have never been to his house,"" Villasenor said.  ""He's never bothered anyone.""      Photo, Jose Ayala stands beside the hospital bed of his father, Ubertino Ayala.

Carlos Zavala, Ayala's son-in-law, said he was at Ayala's house to seek advice  regarding a recent marital separation with Ayala's daughter. He said they had  been talking outside when Ayala excused himself to go to the bathroom and began  walking behind a large bush.    Ayala had just rounded a corner of the house when a police officer appeared on  the other side of a wire fence and began to fire, Zavala said.    Zavala, who said he did not hear any warnings by the officer, said he was  frightened by the gunfire and ran to hide, but the same police officer who shot  Ayala approached him and yelled at Zavala to disarm himself. During the whole  incident, Ayala had nothing in his hands, he said.    ""I'm sure he didn't have a pistol in his hands,"" said Zavala, 30. ""They were  about to shoot at me because I had my hand hidden in my shirt."" Zavala said he  was unarmed, but his injured right wrist is wrapped in a bulky brace.    On Friday, about 15 family members gathered outside Ayala's hospital room where  he lay unconscious after undergoing six hours of surgery. Some sat in a nearby  waiting room, saying the shooting was unjust.    Jose Ayala, 40, said his father was employed at a mushroom farm and had lived  in California for decades. He said family members are considering legal action  against the Oxnard Police Department.    ""We didn't know a thing like this could happen,"" Jose Ayala said. ""We don't  even know why the police were there.""    Jose Villasenor, 67, Ayala's next-door neighbor, said he was watching  television when he heard four or five shots outside. When he stepped out to see  what was going on, he found the neighborhood ringed with police officers.    Villasenor, who has lived next to Ayala for 16 years, said he was surprised  that his next-door neighbor had been shot.    ""He's a quiet guy. The police have never been to his house,"" Villasenor said.  ""He's never bothered anyone.""      Photo, Jose Ayala stands beside the hospital bed of his father, Ubertino Ayala.  ""We don't even know why the police were there,"" he said. DAVID BOHRER / Los  Angeles Times    "

THEY SEEK A MORE OPEN EXISTENCE ON THE FORCE.      By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      He is 24 years old, the son of a cop from the Midwest, and enrolled as a  recruit at the Los Angeles Police Academy. And because he also happens to be  homosexual, he lives a double life, masquerading in a hat and dark glasses when  off duty in the gay community, fearful that his fellow recruits or supervisors  will stumble upon his true identity.    ""I know these people play rough here,"" he said, afraid to divulge his name.  ""Something could happen to me. There are people, some hard-core people, who  would stop at no lengths to get rid of me.    ""I mean, it's one thing to handle the court system and street crime, but  something else to have your own brother officers against you.""    She is a six-year veteran officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. And  because she is a lesbian, she too lives a shadow existence, avoiding the annual  police picnic and the Christmas party because she can't bring her lover.    ""The walls have ears,"" she said, also shielding her name. ""Nothing happens that  your sergeant and your lieutenant and your captain don't know about.""    But while gay Los Angeles police officers fear being discovered, many of their  counterparts in other major law enforcement agencies in California are open  about their homosexuality. They are shedding their hidden identities in  response to decisions by police administrators to recruit gay and lesbian  officers and to discipline officers who discriminate against their homosexual  brethren and sisters.    A new survey by a key California police accreditation agency identifies gays  and lesbians as an untapped group of potential police recruits.    Furthermore, the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, a professional  organization of police administrators, last fall rescinded its decades-old  policy of opposing the hiring of homosexual police officers. ""That policy,""  said Phil Lynn, manager of the association's National Law Enforcement Center,  ""was one that no longer reflected the views of our organization.""    The exact number of gay and lesbian officers in the Los Angeles Police  Department is unknown; of 8,400 officers, not one single man or woman is openly  homosexual, according to police administrators. Local gay activists suggest  that the number mirrors the city's percentage of homosexual citizens -- perhaps  as high as 10% -- but police administrators say they know of only a few  ""suspected"" gay and lesbian officers.    But regardless of their numbers, and after years of working incognito inside  the department, closeted gay and lesbian officers are growing hopeful because  of a lawsuit filed by a gay sergeant who contends he was threatened and  harassed off the force by fellow officers.    Gays and lesbians are hoping his suit will change the policies at Parker Center  to conform with those of other major police agencies in the nation, put an end  to alleged discrimination by heterosexual officers of their homosexual  counterparts and, perhaps most important, launch new police recruitment drives  aimed at the city's gay and lesbian community.    Gay activists believe that if the police hire more people from within their  community, relations with police could improve and, likewise, make many  heterosexual officers sensitive to problems in the gay community.    Homosexual officers are hoping that they need no longer work publicly in a  dark-blue police uniform while living private lives in a cloak of secrecy.    ""It's going to happen,"" vowed Mitchell Grobeson, the former Los Angeles police  sergeant who brought the suit. ""It has to happen. Otherwise, the number of  lawsuits will be so exorbitant to the city of Los Angeles that it will be too  costly for the department not to.""    In an environment that demands loyalty, gay officers see Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates as their foe. And the chief made it clear in a recent interview that  while he will not tolerate harassment among his troops, he also will not  compromise on the issue of selectively recruiting gay and lesbian officers.    Under Gates, the department does not specifically exclude homosexuals from  among its ranks. But the department also does not actively target gays and  lesbians for recruitment, as it does other minorities.    ""In the factors that go into being a police officer,"" the chief said, ""sexual  preference is irrelevant. It should stay irrelevant. And it will stay  irrelevant while I have anything to say about it. I guarantee that.""    Indeed, Sgt. Ed Mautz, a longtime recruitment officer, said the department only  once in the last decade actually tried to attract homosexuals to the force,  when it set up a recruitment booth at the Gay Pride parade.    ""Not one person came up and asked us about our recruitment program,"" he said.  ""Now, granted, this was seven years ago and attitudes may have changed by now.  But we got no response at all from gays or lesbians.    ""In fact, the only people who did come up to talk to us were punk rockers with  spiked hair and steel boots, and they just came up to laugh at us.""    Despite the Los Angeles department's refusal to recruit homosexuals, other  large police departments in California and around the nation are actively  seeking gay and lesbian officers to fill their police academies, and they are  demonstrating to their local homosexual communities that the police are  sensitive to their needs.    The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, for instance, advertises for  recruits in gay publications and sets up recruitment booths during large public  events in the gay community. Capt. Rachel Burgess of the sheriff's West  Hollywood station said her deputies are also well aware of an automatic  three-day suspension for any officer making a derogatory statement about  homosexuals.    ""If they are gays or lesbians,"" she said, ""the doors are not going to be closed  to them.""    In the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department, 20% of the sworn work force  is gay or lesbian, a lesbian lieutenant supervises a 70-officer bailiff  security office, several gay sergeants are watch commanders, and the  department's budget officer is a lesbian.    A few years ago, according to Ray Towbis, an aide to the sheriff, the president  of the local Deputy Sheriffs Assn. was a sergeant who also happened to be gay.  ""He was voted in by everybody,"" Towbis said.    In traditionally conservative San Diego, Police Chief Bob Burgreen has assigned  an officer to work as a special liaison with the homosexual community in the  city's Hillcrest district, where the department earlier this year conducted a  police job fair.    ""People in our command are aware that we don't play this bull of screening out  gays or lesbians,"" said Matt Weathersby, the San Diego liaison officer. ""We are  going to get more gay officers.""    Added one San Diego gay police officer, who is considering dashing his secret  identity to become the first openly homosexual officer there: ""The Police  Department has taken on some new policies and training methods to help us. And  the people are very supportive.""    A statewide study in June by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and  Training in Sacramento, which certifies police officers, identified the  homosexual community as a key target area for future officers, if police  agencies in the 1990s hope to bolster their sagging recruitment efforts.    The study said that gay officers are often more stable and less transient than  heterosexual officers, and that a single man does not need the salary that a  married man with children requires. The study also questioned the wisdom of  perpetrating the macho image of the big-city officer.    ""The stiff upper lip macho mentality characteristic of the average police  officer collapses under too much stress,"" the report said.    ""In addition, the macho image carried by many police officers into their work  tends to have a negative impact on the average citizen. This leads to distrust  of police departments in general and, as in Los Angeles, into citizen  reluctance to increase police department budgets when (the issue) appears on  the ballot.""    A Golden State Peace Officers Assn., run for and by gay and lesbian officers,  has been established, and emissaries like Richard Norton, a co-founder and San  Francisco County sheriff's deputy, travel the state teaching local departments  the value of extending their ranks into the local gay community.    Likewise, the Gay Officers Action League was set up in New York City to foster  the same camaraderie among homosexual police officers on the East Coast.  Executive Director Sam Ciccone said the group helps sponsor recruitment drives  in the gay community, and helped persuade the New York Police Department to  print recruitment posters picturing gay and lesbian officers.    ""We sent them throughout the city,"" he said. ""Why? Because police departments  reflect the areas they serve, and I think that the people in New York want to  have a police department that is really responsive to them.""    In Texas, a lesbian recruit named Mica England is suing the Dallas Police  Department, alleging she was disqualified because of her sexual orientation.  She hopes to overturn a state law that classifies sexual intercourse with a  member of the same sex as deviant -- the biggest stumbling block for homosexual  police recruits in Texas.    ""I was mad and angry,"" said the 26-year-old England, describing how she was  turned down as unfit to work for Dallas' finest. ""On my way out, I yanked down  the equal-opportunity employment poster from their bulletin board.""    Sam Lindsay, head of the litigation division for Dallas, declined to discuss  the city's defense against the lawsuit, except to say: ""There are legitimate  reasons for not hiring people who are lesbians or gay for law enforcement  postions.""    The Texas case is similar to what is happening in Los Angeles, where a bloc of  City Council members wants to settle Grobeson's lawsuit. But what the former  police sergeant wants most of all is the creation of a special position in Los  Angeles for an officer to work as a liaison with the gay and lesbian community,  and for the department to actively recruit future officers from within that  community.    Without those changes, Grobeson and others contend, the Police Department will  continue to foster harassment and discrimination of gay and lesbian officers.  They complain that the department looks the other way in condoning pranks,  name-calling and threats against homosexual officers, and that some patrolmen  even refuse to work with or provide backup to officers suspected of being gay.    One Los Angeles police officer, whose lesbianism was suspected by her peers,  recalled an incident several years ago when she chased a burglary suspect alone  on foot for 15 minutes, without backup from her partner. ""It was like a slap in  the face,"" she said. ""I was terrified.""    And Grobeson described how a fellow officer once told him how he would like to  strand a suspected gay policeman inside a vacant building during a false-alarm  call. Grobeson said the officer boasted: ""I'm going to sneak up behind him and  I'm going to blow off the back of his head. Then I'm going to claim it was dark  and that I thought he was the suspect.""    The incident never occurred, but Grobeson said it was an example of the  hostility some officers harbor toward gays in their ranks.    Homosexual officers said the discrimination begins as early as the background  investigation into new recruits, when all applicants are asked pointed  questions about their private lifestyles, their closest friends and their past  and present romances.    In fact, many gay activists accuse the top police managers in Los Angeles of  being prejudiced for refusing to recruit and welcome gays and lesbians into the  rank and file.    ""We're going to have to drag him (Chief Gates) kicking and screaming to go  along with change,"" said Donna Wade, co-chair of the Los Angeles-based Gay and  Lesbian Police Advisory Task Force, and herself a former police officer in St.  Louis and Atlanta.    ""Gates has a very homophobic attitude,"" added Miki Jackson of the task force.  ""He has an attitude that is very dated. He is creating an atmosphere that is  allowing job harassment in the job place.""    Gates today declines to discuss his personal views on homosexuality, but in a  1982 interview with The Times, he quipped: ""Who'd want to work with one?""    In a recent interview, Gates would only go so far as to say: ""We have  homosexuals in the Police Department, and what my personal views are have  nothing to do with it.""    He also emphasized that while federal law requires police departments to  recruit racial minorities and women, the same does not hold true for gays and  lesbians. ""What you do in your bedroom, what your sexual preference is, is none  of my business,"" the chief said.    ""That is so private, and I think it would be absolutely ridiculous and wrong to  try and go out and recruit people based on their sexual preference.""    He also said he strongly discourages harassment within his police ranks.    ""We may have some mavericks out there,"" he said. ""But I don't allow anybody to  harass a Los Angeles police officer. I don't let them do that. I won't allow  that.    ""We have women in this department. You think they haven't been harassed? Well,  we deal with that harassment.""    Several patrolmen interviewed at random said they would not object to working  alongside a homosexual officer, as long as that officer is professional and  conscientious.    ""I don't think the department is ready,"" said one officer, a sergeant with  about 20 years in the department. ""No more than private industry would want to  hire so many gays. What is the need to?""    But others disagree, particularly gay and lesbian peace officers with other law  enforcement agencies who feel secure enough in their jobs that they have openly  revealed their homosexuality.    Said James Simms, a five-year veteran of the California Department of  Corrections who now works at the R.J. Donovan prison in San Diego County:    ""I could hold my personnel file up to almost any heterosexual officer. I come  to work on time, always properly dressed. I'm courteous and my file reflects  that. I've got over five letters of commendation.    ""And other gay officers can do the same. We're just as good as anybody else.""

Executive Director Sam Ciccone said the group helps sponsor recruitment drives  in the gay community, and helped persuade the New York Police Department to  print recruitment posters picturing gay and lesbian officers.    ""We sent them throughout the city,"" he said. ""Why? Because police departments  reflect the areas they serve, and I think that the people in New York want to  have a police department that is really responsive to them.""    In Texas, a lesbian recruit named Mica England is suing the Dallas Police  Department, alleging she was disqualified because of her sexual orientation.  She hopes to overturn a state law that classifies sexual intercourse with a  member of the same sex as deviant -- the biggest stumbling block for homosexual  police recruits in Texas.    ""I was mad and angry,"" said the 26-year-old England, describing how she was  turned down as unfit to work for Dallas' finest. ""On my way out, I yanked down  the equal-opportunity employment poster from their bulletin board.""    Sam Lindsay, head of the litigation division for Dallas, declined to discuss  the city's defense against the lawsuit, except to say: ""There are legitimate  reasons for not hiring people who are lesbians or gay for law enforcement  postions.""    The Texas case is similar to what is happening in Los Angeles, where a bloc of  City Council members wants to settle Grobeson's lawsuit. But what the former  police sergeant wants most of all is the creation of a special position in Los  Angeles for an officer to work as a liaison with the gay and lesbian community,  and for the department to actively recruit future officers from within that  community.    Without those changes, Grobeson and others contend, the Police Department will  continue to foster harassment and discrimination of gay and lesbian officers.  They complain that the department looks the other way in condoning pranks,  name-calling and threats against homosexual officers, and that some patrolmen  even refuse to work with or provide backup to officers suspected of being gay.    One Los Angeles police officer, whose lesbianism was suspected by her peers,  recalled an incident several years ago when she chased a burglary suspect alone  on foot for 15 minutes, without backup from her partner. ""It was like a slap in  the face,"" she said. ""I was terrified.""    And Grobeson described how a fellow officer once told him how he would like to  strand a suspected gay policeman inside a vacant building during a false-alarm  call. Grobeson said the officer boasted: ""I'm going to sneak up behind him and  I'm going to blow off the back of his head. Then I'm going to claim it was dark  and that I thought he was the suspect.""    The incident never occurred, but Grobeson said it was an example of the  hostility some officers harbor toward gays in their ranks.    Homosexual officers said the discrimination begins as early as the background  investigation into new recruits, when all applicants are asked pointed  questions about their private lifestyles, their closest friends and their past  and present romances.    In fact, many gay activists accuse the top police managers in Los Angeles of  being prejudiced for refusing to recruit and welcome gays and lesbians into the  rank and file.    ""We're going to have to drag him (Chief Gates) kicking and screaming to go  along with change,"" said Donna Wade, co-chair of the Los Angeles-based Gay and  Lesbian Police Advisory Task Force, and herself a former police officer in St.  Louis and Atlanta.    ""Gates has a very homophobic attitude,"" added Miki Jackson of the task force.  ""He has an attitude that is very dated. He is creating an atmosphere that is  allowing job harassment in the job place.""    Gates today declines to discuss his personal views on homosexuality, but in a  1982 interview with The Times, he quipped: ""Who'd want to work with one?""    In a recent interview, Gates would only go so far as to say: ""We have  homosexuals in the Police Department, and what my personal views are have  nothing to do with it.""    He also emphasized that while federal law requires police departments to  recruit racial minorities and women, the same does not hold true for gays and  lesbians. ""What you do in your bedroom, what your sexual preference is, is none  of my business,"" the chief said.    ""That is so private, and I think it would be absolutely ridiculous and wrong to  try and go out and recruit people based on their sexual preference.""    He also said he strongly discourages harassment within his police ranks.    ""We may have some mavericks out there,"" he said. ""But I don't allow anybody to  harass a Los Angeles police officer. I don't let them do that. I won't allow  that.    ""We have women in this department. You think they haven't been harassed? Well,  we deal with that harassment.""    Several patrolmen interviewed at random said they would not object to working  alongside a homosexual officer, as long as that officer is professional and  conscientious.    ""I don't think the department is ready,"" said one officer, a sergeant with  about 20 years in the department. ""No more than private industry would want to  hire so many gays. What is the need to?""    But others disagree, particularly gay and lesbian peace officers with other law  enforcement agencies who feel secure enough in their jobs that they have openly  revealed their homosexuality.    Said James Simms, a five-year veteran of the California Department of  Corrections who now works at the R.J. Donovan prison in San Diego County:    ""I could hold my personnel file up to almost any heterosexual officer. I come  to work on time, always properly dressed. I'm courteous and my file reflects  that. I've got over five letters of commendation.    ""And other gay officers can do the same. We're just as good as anybody else.""

About 7,000 students took part in the march organised by the leftwing Student Activist Alliance. The action followed the government decision - announced in the November Budget - to cut grants by 10 per cent in the next academic year. Similar cuts are planned for the next two years. The shortfall will be made up with student loans. The demonstrators forced the closure of Westminster, Lambeth, Waterloo and Hungerford bridges yesterday afternoon - causing widespread traffic problems. The police made three arrests for public disorder but said that otherwise the demonstrators were 'fairly quiet'. The alliance hopes to spread its campaign with a national shutdown of colleges and universities in support of a strike by Natfhe, the lecturers' union, on March 1.

Mayor Richard Riordan has urged the officers to accept mediation. The Police Protective League, the officers' union, did not favour this but was expected to reply later yesterday to the mayor's offer. Only 105 of the 317 officers and sergeants scheduled for the early shift yesterday arrived, the police department said. Officers from the Tuesday evening shift were kept at work to cover. The city estimates that the 'sick-outs' are costing it nearly Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) a day in overtime. The city has nearly 7,700 officers who have worked without contract for two years. Los Angeles has been reluctant to offer police more money because of budget constraints. Last week, they rejected a 6 per cent rise over two years. Starting pay for a new officer is Dollars 33,157 a year.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9221 Police Protection.   Types:-  PEOP  Labour.

BY YOUNG BLACK GIRLS SET OFF AIDS PANIC      By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NEW YORK      Groups of teen-age girls have jabbed dozens of Upper West Side women with sharp  pointed objects in recent days, laying bare the racial tension that is never  far from the surface here and setting off a panic that the gang may be  spreading the AIDS virus.    The wounds, such as they are, have been minor. But the impression is spreading,  with no apparent grounds, that the instruments being used in the attacks are  AIDS-infected hypodermic needles.    As of Friday, 39 women, ranging in age from 14 to 50, had reported being jabbed  since Oct. 24. All the incidents occurred on Broadway, between 95th and 110th  streets.    Police have stepped up patrols of the area, and late Friday they arrested  several teen-age girls in connection with the attacks.    Sgt. Ed Burns, a police spokesman, said that the suspects were all under 16  years old and their identities would not be announced because of their ages. He  would not say how many were in custody.    Neighborhood youths have alleged that the girls involved in the attacks are  members of a gang called the Deceptinets.    The girls are reported to be black, and all but one of their victims have been  white. As a result, police say they believe racial motivation may lie behind  the incidents, and they have assigned the case to the Police Department's bias  unit.    One of the earliest victims, who asked not to be identified, said the incident  occurred early one evening as she was walking past ""a group of teen-agers, all  impeccably dressed. Before I knew it, one of the girls was coming at me with  what I thought was her fist."" She felt a ""stinging, burning sensation"" and ran  away screaming, as the girl continued to swing at her face.    The neighborhood is racially and economically diverse, but some residents said  they had not thought it to be particularly tense before the incidents began.    Police Officer Joseph Gallagher said the jabbings have happened quickly, with  the attackers disappearing almost instantly. In some cases, he said, the  victims have not even noticed the wounds until later.    He also downplayed the widely circulated speculation that the ""unknown sharp  instrument"" being used as a weapon is a needle infected with the AIDS virus.    ""No one in the Police Department has said anything that would further that  theory,"" Gallagher commented. ""Your fellow journalists have drawn that  conclusion.""    ""I wasn't freaking out at all, but the whole media hype made it into a monster  that has its own life,"" agreed the victim, who said she has been assured by her  doctor that her chances of having contracted AIDS are virtually nil.    Nightly news shows have featured interviews with victims who have expressed  concern that they might have contracted AIDS -- a possibility that health  professionals say is very remote, even if the weapon had been dipped in the  virus, because the virus cannot live long outside the body.    Women who live in the neighborhood say they are terrified. ""It is no  coincidence that I've worn my leather jacket every day this week,"" said one,  who added that she is taking taxis even for the shortest outings.    The incidents have occurred toward the end of a year when New York has been  wrenched by sensational crimes that have had racial overtones, including the  brutal attack on a white female jogger in Central Park by a group of black  youths and the murder of a young black man by whites in the Bensonhurst area of  Brooklyn.

REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      In a major policy change, the U.S. Border Patrol and California Highway Patrol  announced Thursday that they will begin apprehending undocumented aliens who  gather on freeway medians, in a plan to reduce the number of deaths occurring  when migrants dash across the highway and are struck by motorists.    Border Patrol and CHP officials said the new policy, which became effective  Wednesday, was instituted because the old one sometimes encouraged hundreds of  illegal aliens to loiter on freeway medians, knowing the Border Patrol would  not try to arrest them there.    Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said the previous policy prohibited agents  from attempting to apprehend aliens on medians ""for obvious safety reasons.""    ""What we have been trying has not been working. People are still getting  killed, and that is unacceptable,"" Swofford said. "" . . . We will try to  implement the new policy in a very cautious manner. We're not putting a lot of  pressure on them. We're pulling over on the median well away from them, so they  don't panic and run out in front of traffic.""    However, Swofford said agents will pursue migrants who try to evade arrest.    ""We'll try to do it as safely as we possible can,"" Swofford added.    According to figures released by the California Rural Legal Assistance, 83  illegal migrants have been killed on San Diego-area freeways within 5 miles of  the border since 1987. An additional 33 have died during the same period near  the Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre in North County when they were hit  by cars traveling on Interstate 5.    On their trek north, illegal aliens frequently hide or wait on freeway medians  until they are picked up by smugglers who transport them away from the border.  Most of the migrants, especially those from the interior of Mexico, have never  seen a freeway and are unable to gauge a car's speed.    Deaths usually occur when they attempt to cross a busy freeway to get to the  median. At San Onofre, migrants are frequently killed when they try to  circumvent the INS checkpoint by jumping out of smugglers' vehicles and running  west -- across eight lanes of traffic -- to the beach. After walking north past  the checkpoint, they then recross the freeway and are picked up by the  smugglers to continue their northward journeys.    The California Department of Transportation has attempted to curb mounting  freeway deaths by posting signs to warn motorists in areas where aliens  congregate on the median. Lights have also been installed on freeway stretches  where aliens are known to gather. However, those efforts have met with little  success.    CHP Officer Jim Anderson said the CHP will assist the Border Patrol ""only on a  casual basis"" and will not respond every time agents attempt to arrest migrants  hiding on the median.    ""If an officer can safely approach them on the median, we will detain them and  hand them over to the Border Patrol,"" Anderson said.    The new policy will be effective only in the San Diego area and not at San  Onofre, Anderson said.    Migrant rights activists immediately attacked the new policy.    ""It's a totally irresponsible and reckless policy,"" said Roberto Martinez of  the American Friends Service Committee, a migrants rights group. ""They're  gathering at the median to get away from the Border Patrol. When the Border  Patrol shows its presence, they will start dashing in and out of the freeway  again.    ""The Border Patrol is jeopardizing people's lives just to apprehend them. . . .  Renewing this policy is like taking one step forward and two steps back,""  Martinez added.    Despite the criticism, CHP and Border Patrol officials said they will go ahead  with the apprehensions.    ""We've had 80-some people killed over the past few years. Do you just sit there  and say that's an acceptable toll?"" asked the CHP's Anderson. ""This is almost  our last alternative. We've tried posting signs, installing freeway lights and  handing out leaflets at the border. Nothing has worked in the past.""    According to Anderson, the CHP and Border Patrol have apprehended up to 300  aliens at one time on a freeway median. Some CHP cars have been pelted by rocks  thrown by aliens loitering on the medians, he added.    Swofford complained that critics of the policy would complain regardless of  what the Border Patrol did.    ""If we can get people used to the idea that they cannot go out on the freeway,  these killings will stop,"" Swofford said.    Anderson said CHP officers will also be enforcing the law that prohibits  pedestrians on the freeway.    ""Do they want to just let these people get run over and ignore the fact that  they're also breaking the law?"" Anderson asked. ""They're entering the country  illegally and breaking the law against pedestrians on the freeway.""    Martinez countered that CHP officers are in effect going to be enforcing U.S.  immigration laws by getting involved in the apprehensions. ""This is totally out  of their jurisdiction. They are only going to exacerbate the problem because it  will put more officers chasing people on the freeway,"" Martinez said. He said  the change in policy is premature and accused the CHP and Border Patrol of  acting unilaterally when both agencies are members of an advisory committee  formed by Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) to find a solution to the  freeway deaths.    ""They completely ignored what we're trying to do in the committee,"" Martinez  said. ""It's very upsetting. We've been meeting for about six months, and they  go on and implement this policy on their own.""

REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      In a major policy change, the U.S. Border Patrol and California Highway Patrol  announced Thursday that they will begin apprehending undocumented aliens who  gather on freeway medians, in a plan to reduce the number of deaths occurring  when migrants dash across the highway and are struck by motorists.    Border Patrol and CHP officials said the new policy, which became effective  Wednesday, was instituted because the old one sometimes encouraged hundreds of  illegal aliens to loiter on freeway medians, knowing the Border Patrol would  not try to arrest them there.    Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said the previous policy prohibited agents  from attempting to apprehend aliens on medians ""for obvious safety reasons.""    ""What we have been trying has not been working. People are still getting  killed, and that is unacceptable,"" Swofford said. "" . . . We will try to  implement the new policy in a very cautious manner. We're not putting a lot of  pressure on them. We're pulling over on the median well away from them, so they  don't panic and run out in front of traffic.""    However, Swofford said agents will pursue migrants who try to evade arrest.    ""We'll try to do it as safely as we possible can,"" Swofford added.    According to figures released by the California Rural Legal Assistance, 83  illegal migrants have been killed on San Diego-area freeways within 5 miles of  the border since 1987. An additional 33 have died during the same period near  the Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre in North County when they were hit  by cars traveling on Interstate 5.

Two policemen and one kidnapper were killed in a 20-minute pre-dawn shootout after Uttar Pradesh state police stormed a militant hideout in Saharanpur, near New Delhi, to rescue the Britons. Police believe three more militants were involved in the kidnapping and have launched a massive hunt to trace them. The three were handed over to the British High Commission yesterday. Al Hadeed, a hitherto unknown militant group, had left a note at the BBC office in New Delhi on Monday afternoon, demanding the release of eight Kashmiri militants or threatening to kill the three British hostages. Police said they were able to locate the Britons so swiftly because of a tip-off from Mr Bela Joseph Nuss, an American tourist whom they rescued by coincidence in Ghaziabad on the outskirts of Delhi on Monday.

In activities against this use of drugs, a high level force  of the Criminal Police arrested three Vietnamese illegal drug  users and seized a 20 ml. bottle of drugs on 3 March at 1700.    According to a statement by Mr. Chey Ritthi, the deputy  chairman of the High Level Office of Criminal Affairs at 0800  the following day, 4 March this High Level Criminal Police Force  conducted operations in this area and arrested a Vietnamese  named Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh who collaborated with his wife to  provide intravenous drugs. At that time the authorities  confiscated a number of pieces of evidence: seven packages of  opium power No. 4, a can of cotton impregnated with drugs for  rubbing or sniffing, four hypodermic syringes, approxiametly 10  ml. of drugs, a number of ampules of diazepam and prometazine  made in China, and a number of hypodermic needles.    People who know say that the drug problem became very active  in South Vietnam when the American soldiers arrived. Later, the  Vietnamese communist government made a show of strongly  suppressing this problem, but without much success. The  Vietnamese drug addicts who use these drugs call them ""si ke"" in  Vietnamese. In Cambodia prior to this the use of drugs in this  way has not been confirmed by any source. So this should be a  sign for the appropriate ministries and for the people in  general.    Din Tieng Ngoc Vang, a woman aged 33 born in Hau Giang  Province, Vietnam and currently living in an unnumbered house in  front of the Beng Trabek School in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward  admitted to the High Level Criminal Police, ""I have been earning  a living giving intravenous drugs for the past five months.  During the five days before I was arrested, I ceased taking  intravenous drugs because I feared being arrested by the  authorities and I didn't dare buy any more drugs. I changed  from injecting drugs to taking them orally or applying them by  rubbing (rubbing them on the skin or on wounds) and sniffing  them.""    Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she had known how to take  intravenous drugs since her first marriage, but her first  husband later went insane and returned to Vietnam.    Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she bought these drugs  from  an old man about 70 years old whose name she did not know and  that he brought them from Vietnam in 1 chi lots (equals a little  less than 4 grams) worth 6,000 riels.    Each day Din Tieng Ngoc Vang provided illegal drugs giving  injections to at least six or seven addicts.    Responding to the question when had he started using drugs,  a  Vietnamese man named Ha Hung Ung, age 35, a native of An Giang,  Long Xieng Province, Vietnam, employed as a carpentar in Phsar  Doeum Thkov Ward recently admitted that, ""I have been an  intravenous drug user for perhaps more than one month. At first  I got injections from an old woman whose name I don't know.  Then I got them from Din Tieng Ngoc Vang a.k.a. Sieng. I took  intravenous drugs once a day. At the beginning my friends got  me hooked. Now I am addicted to opium and I have to use drugs  every day. If I don't get a fix, I feel terrible.""    Ha Hung Ung added that, ""On 3 March at 1700 I was just about  to inject drugs when suddenly the police arrived and arrested me  and brought me here (the Ministry of the Interior).""    Ha Hung Ung's partner who, according to him, is called ""A  Tung,"" is a worse drug addict than him. A Tung is also a  Vietnamese. This opium addict with heavily lidded eyes and who  constantly drools annoyed the High Level Criminal Police Force  because he would not admit to any of their accusations.    Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh, a male age 28 a native of Ba Dinh,  Hanoi, Vietnam first lived at house No. 105 Borikeyla 7th of  January District when he came to Cambodia, but he later moved to  the Beng Trabek area to a new house in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward.  He worked as a runner crossing the border from Cambodia to  Vietnam and buying stolen motorcycles.    A police investigation revealed that Sar Van Kha a.k.a.  Thanh  was a sapper for the Hanoi communist government which had  discharged him, but when arrested by the police he had a Human  Rights Card [as published] which had been issued by the LICADO  Organization.    Responding about his arrest for conspiracy together with his  wife in the illicit distribution of drugs, Sar Van Kha a.k.a.  Thanh admitted that, ""the drugs that the authorities took away  on the morning of 4 March 1994 were my wife, Din Tieng Ngoc  Vang's, drugs, but I don't know where she bought them.""    The High Level Criminal Police are building a case against  these four Vietnamese who are involved in the use and  distribution of illegal drugs in order to send it to court and  punish them according to the laws in effect.    This is the very first success of the Cambodian police in  the  suppression of people involved in the illegal use of drugs which  in the past we only heard stories about in Hong Kong videos.     "

Bombay police chief Amarjeet Singh Samra said one of the men had driven a jeep packed with plastic explosives to a market place in central Bombay. The other had confessed to planting a bomb in the city's crowded jewellery market. Six suspects arrested so far have all been linked to the Memon brothers, smugglers who have since escaped to Dubai. The police allege that the Memons have been involved in the narcotics trade, gun-running, silver smuggling and foreign exchange rackets. Police said the intention of the bombings was to 'disturb the peace in Bombay and take advantage of the turmoil to further their illegal business.' Meanwhile, the death toll in the blast in central Calcutta rose to 80. Police have found no links between the Bombay and Calcutta blasts.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

In a statement to the KBC,  the Rift Valley provincial police officer, Francis Sang, said  investigations as on the spot check at Kamara and Mau Summit  showed that no clashes whatsoever occurred in the area as  imagined by the reporters from THE STANDARD newspaper in an  article published today.

Mr. Sang also said a check with the Nyayo  Bus Corporation confirmed that none of their vehicles had been  hired to transport those displaced from Molo to Kisii town as  reported in the press. He said appropriate machinery was  already in place to ensure the authors of the story, which was  obviously meant to create animosity and disrupt peace in Molo,  are brought to book.     "

The  protesters, who claimed they were invited by local NP supporters  to attend the meeting, had earlier toyi-toyied [protest danced]  and chanted slogans as Mr de Klerk's motorcade entered and left  the stadium.

It could not be established  whether anyone was injured in the shooting.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk told about 300 supporters, most of them  black, the NP was a party of peace and would ensure the rights  of every South African. He accused the ANC of intimidating and  threatening people in townships. ""The NP will ensure that the  policies of a new government of national unity will help build a  better life for all South Africans,"" Mr de Klerk said.     "

Burgreen's comments on the investigation came two days after an undercover  police officer shot and killed John Joseph Kelley, 30, while attempting to  arrest him in the parking lot of a Mission Valley restaurant. The shooting  marked the seventh time this year that San Diego police have shot and killed a  suspect who was being arrested.    ""I have made no conclusions at this point as to what if anything needs to be  done,"" Burgreen told members of the Citizen's Advisory Board on  Police/Community Relations. ""I want to protect our officers . . . but, at the  same time, I want to make sure that our officers are acting appropriately in  this critical area (of) the use of force.""    Burgreen said he and other top police officials are ""personally participating""  in the ""time-consuming"" investigation into policies and procedures that guide  police officers in the use of deadly force. The investigation won't be  completed until late this year, Burgreen said.    During the course of the investigation, Burgreen and other top police officials  will ride along with officers to determine if policies and procedures are being  followed, or if those guidelines need to be revised.    The officials ""will actually be sitting in on classes and reviewing what is  being taught,"" Burgreen said. ""We will be visiting other police agencies . . .  looking at their policies, at their training . . . and lastly, (officials) will  be reviewing what is going on on the streets in actual practice.""    Burgreen on Wednesday said a ""parallel review by (the advisory board) would be  in the public interest at this time."" After the meeting, Burgreen said board  members ""have an open door . . . I think it's within their authority and  jurisdiction . . . they have an open invitation from me . . . nothing will be  kept from them.""    As part of its review, the Police Department is sending officers to Los  Angeles, Dallas and Phoenix to study deadly-force policies.    Burgreen defended the use of deadly force in San Diego, which, in recent years,  has led the nation in the number of police officers killed while on duty.  ""Eleven officers in 11 years were murdered,"" Burgreen said.    But, although Burgreen is intent on giving his officers the right to protect  themselves, he said the history of police killings ""does not alleviate the need  for our officers to act under appropriate policy . . . and to be held  accountable"" if policy violations are occurring. ""I'm very anxious to do what  we can to remedy some problems"" that might exist, Burgreen said.    On Oct. 5, Burgreen will make a preliminary report to the San Diego City  Council. Burgreen said he ""will not be waiting for the whole package to make  changes. . . . Any changes that are needed will be implemented as they are  identified.""    In a related matter, Burgreen on Wednesday made public a letter he sent to  county grand jury foreman Reno J. Testolin on Aug. 2. The letter acknowledged  that the Police Department violated its own evidence rules when officers  improperly stored a Rolodex seized during the highly publicized investigation  of Karen Wilkening, who, prosecutors said, ran a high-class call-girl ring out  of a Linda Vista condominium.    Although Burgreen's letter defended the department's rules and procedures, he  acknowledged that, ""unfortunately, in the case in question, those guidelines  were not followed. These policies have been restated in order to assure total  compliance by all members of the department.""

In the letter, Burgreen responded to seven recommendations made by the grand  jury in the wake of Wilkening's trial.

The letter  included descriptions of the department's responses, ""which have been taken to  ensure future compliance with these recommendations.""    "," LA080990-0003   258944    August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition      Part A; Page 23; Column 1; Metro Desk      695 words      CHIEF DISCUSSES SHOOTINGS BY SAN DIEGO POLICE      By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN DIEGO      Police Chief Bob Burgreen on Wednesday said preliminary results of an extensive  internal investigation into the San Diego Police Department's use of deadly  force do not suggest that changes in policy and procedure are in order.    Burgreen's comments on the investigation came two days after an undercover  police officer shot and killed John Joseph Kelley, 30, while attempting to  arrest him in the parking lot of a Mission Valley restaurant. The shooting  marked the seventh time this year that San Diego police have shot and killed a  suspect who was being arrested.    ""I have made no conclusions at this point as to what if anything needs to be  done,"" Burgreen told members of the Citizen's Advisory Board on  Police/Community Relations. ""I want to protect our officers . . . but, at the  same time, I want to make sure that our officers are acting appropriately in  this critical area (of) the use of force.""    Burgreen said he and other top police officials are ""personally participating""  in the ""time-consuming"" investigation into policies and procedures that guide  police officers in the use of deadly force. The investigation won't be  completed until late this year, Burgreen said.    During the course of the investigation, Burgreen and other top police officials  will ride along with officers to determine if policies and procedures are being  followed, or if those guidelines need to be revised.    The officials ""will actually be sitting in on classes and reviewing what is  being taught,"" Burgreen said. ""We will be visiting other police agencies . . .  looking at their policies, at their training . . . and lastly, (officials) will  be reviewing what is going on on the streets in actual practice.""    Burgreen on Wednesday said a ""parallel review by (the advisory board) would be  in the public interest at this time."" After the meeting, Burgreen said board  members ""have an open door . . . I think it's within their authority and  jurisdiction . . . they have an open invitation from me . . . nothing will be  kept from them.""    As part of its review, the Police Department is sending officers to Los  Angeles, Dallas and Phoenix to study deadly-force policies.    Burgreen defended the use of deadly force in San Diego, which, in recent years,  has led the nation in the number of police officers killed while on duty.  ""Eleven officers in 11 years were murdered,"" Burgreen said.    But, although Burgreen is intent on giving his officers the right to protect  themselves, he said the history of police killings ""does not alleviate the need  for our officers to act under appropriate policy . . . and to be held  accountable"" if policy violations are occurring. ""I'm very anxious to do what  we can to remedy some problems"" that might exist, Burgreen said.    On Oct. 5, Burgreen will make a preliminary report to the San Diego City  Council. Burgreen said he ""will not be waiting for the whole package to make  changes. . . . Any changes that are needed will be implemented as they are  identified.""    In a related matter, Burgreen on Wednesday made public a letter he sent to  county grand jury foreman Reno J. Testolin on Aug. 2. The letter acknowledged  that the Police Department violated its own evidence rules when officers  improperly stored a Rolodex seized during the highly publicized investigation  of Karen Wilkening, who, prosecutors said, ran a high-class call-girl ring out  of a Linda Vista condominium.    Although Burgreen's letter defended the department's rules and procedures, he  acknowledged that, ""unfortunately, in the case in question, those guidelines  were not followed. These policies have been restated in order to assure total  compliance by all members of the department."" The policies include proper  management of evidence and execution of search warrants, as well as several  management policies.    In the letter, Burgreen responded to seven recommendations made by the grand  jury in the wake of Wilkening's trial. Burgreen said he had ""reviewed these  recommendations and is in full agreement with the grand jury."" The letter  included descriptions of the department's responses, ""which have been taken to  ensure future compliance with these recommendations.""    "

It was the second incident in Los Angeles this week in which the theft of a  Rolex led to death.    Police on Friday arrested Phillip Conrad Sanders, 38, in the shooting death of  Melvin Thompson, 49, owner of Kayser's Service in the 11000 block of Santa  Monica Boulevard.    Police said a tip from a witness led them to a Sylmar house where Sanders had  been staying. A second man was still being sought Friday.    Sanders was being held without bail at the West Los Angeles police station  after he was booked on suspicion of murder, Detective Andy Monsue said.    Police believe that Sanders was the gunman who shot and killed Thompson as he  was closing up shop for the night.    Police declined to release many details of the incident.    However, they said the gunman entered the shop, took an undetermined amount of  cash and then took the watch from Thompson, who was alone.    During the incident, Thompson was shot several times but it was not clear if he  was shot before or after the robbery or if he struggled with the gunman.    The gunman then fled in a car driven by a second man, whom police have not been  able to identify, Monsue said. A witness saw the car fleeing the scene and  jotted down the license number, police said. Police, using that information,  traced Sanders to the Sylmar home.    Thompson's wife of 10 years, Catherine, was on her way to the shop to pick up  her husband at the time of the shooting.    Approaching the garage, ""I heard what I thought was backfire,"" but someone told  her that a man with a gun had entered the shop. She fled, she said, and called  911 from a pay phone.    Thompson was taken to the UCLA Medical Center where he died at 7:30 p.m.  Thursday.    Catherine Thompson said her husband never took the watch to work, bringing it  out only on ""weekends and special occasions.""    ""He never wore it to the shop,"" she said. But he decided he would take it to a  jeweler Thursday. ""He had lost some weight and he needed to have some links  taken out.""    Thompson, his wife said, did not worry about his safety because he considered  it a relatively safe neighborhood. Still, he told her that if someone ever held  up the store while she was working, she should turn over all the money without  arguing, she said.    Catherine Thompson said her husband's shop had been burglarized several times  before, including once about three months ago.    ""It's going to be hard,"" she said, sobbing.    Her grief was shared by others who knew Thompson. ""He was a nice guy who always  tried to help people,"" said Patty Downs, a secretary from Bud Hand Sports Car  Co., located across the street from Kayser's. ""He would do anything you asked.  He even loaned money to street people.""    Thompson's death marked the second shooting in a week tied to the theft of a  Rolex watch, which can range in value from $950 to $23,000. On Tuesday, a  42-year-old man was shot in his newly purchased Beverly Hills home by a gunman  who struggled with him over one of the watches.    Renee Grissin, spokeswoman for Rolex, a New York City-based watch company, said  she was aware of the two incidents in Los Angeles, but had not received word of  similar thefts in other areas.    Detective Monsue said police were exploring the possibility that Thompson's  killer was someone he knew previously -- either as a customer or an  acquaintance.

Newton to death during an argument  over cocaine, police said Friday night.    Investigators said Tyrone Robinson, 25, who has an extensive criminal record  that includes a robbery conviction in 1985, killed Newton early Tuesday in an  effort to advance his position in the Black Guerrilla Family, a narcotics  distribution gang. According to police, Newton had ""crossed"" the gang several  times in the past.    Robinson, Police Sgt. Dan Mercado said, ""wanted to be a high-mucky-muck.""    ""He was a foot soldier, and he wanted to be a shot caller. He figured we  already knew. We felt we had him and he knew it,"" Mercado said.    Detectives said Robinson told them that he shot Newton in self-defense when the  two met by chance on the street. Robinson told detectives that Newton demanded  free cocaine, and when Robinson refused, Newton threatened him with a gun.    However, police questioned several aspects of the story, saying there was no  evidence that Newton had a gun at the time of the encounter.    Robinson said he and Newton had met earlier in the evening at a ""crack"" house  where cocaine was being dispensed.    Mercado told reporters that the gun believed used to shoot Newton -- a  9-millimeter pistol -- has been recovered at the rear of a house ""associated  with Robinson."" Ballistics tests are scheduled to see if, in fact, the gun was  used in the killing.    Robinson and two other ex-convicts -- Mark White and Rodney Jackson -- were  stopped in Oakland on suspicion of running a red light about 14 hours after the  murder. The stop was made near where Newton died.    Police said that after the stop, the three men ""got cute"" with the officers,  who then discovered two guns in the vehicle. The three were booked on suspicion  of being ex-convicts in possession of firearms.    Oakland Police Sgt. Mike Sitterud said Friday that there is ""no indication at  all"" that White and Jackson, who were arraigned Friday on the gun-possession  charges, were involved in Newton's death.    Police said Robinson, an Oakland resident, admitted the killing prior to his  scheduled arraignment Friday on the weapons charge, and the arraignment was  postponed until Tuesday. As a result of his statement that he killed Newton,  Robinson was rebooked Friday night on suspicion of murder.    Newton, 47, a leading and controversial figure in the Black Power movement of  the 1960s, was shot in the head and left to die on an Oakland street corner  near where he and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966.      Two Views    While some, such as his attorney, Charles Garry, said they saw him as a leader  in the fight for ""humanity, equality of the races (and) the dignity of black  Americans,"" others, such as Alameda County Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom  Orloff, saw him simply as a criminal ""who played no positive role in the  community.""    Newton's encounters with the law began in 1964, when he was convicted of felony  assault with a knife.    He was convicted in 1968 of the murder of an Oakland police officer during a  bloody gun battle that erupted in 1967 during a routine traffic stop. The  conviction was later overturned, and a second trial ended with a hung jury.    He was accused of the 1974 murder of a prostitute, but the trial ended with a  hung jury. Another 1974 charge involving the pistol-whipping of a tailor was  dropped.    In 1982, Newton was accused of embezzling $600,000 from a Panther-run  elementary school. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to stealing $15,000 in  state aid to the school and was sentenced to six months in jail.    He had been sentenced earlier this year to 90 days in San Quentin Prison for  possessing drug paraphernalia, which was a violation of his parole in an  earlier case.    Several weapons charges over the years resulted in three convictions for which  he served various amounts of jail time.

The  conviction was later overturned, and a second trial ended with a hung jury.    He was accused of the 1974 murder of a prostitute, but the trial ended with a  hung jury. Another 1974 charge involving the pistol-whipping of a tailor was  dropped.    In 1982, Newton was accused of embezzling $600,000 from a Panther-run  elementary school. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to stealing $15,000 in  state aid to the school and was sentenced to six months in jail.    He had been sentenced earlier this year to 90 days in San Quentin Prison for  possessing drug paraphernalia, which was a violation of his parole in an  earlier case.    Several weapons charges over the years resulted in three convictions for which  he served various amounts of jail time.

SA did not only serve as a transit destination for  drugs to Europe, but was itself also, fast developing into a  major drug market, Grove told a Security '94 conference  presented by the University of Pretoria's Institute for  Strategic Studies.    Political instability, lawlessness, unemployment,  insufficient border control and a lack of an awareness of the  dangers of drug abuse rendered SA an attractive market for drug  traffickers, he said. Many syndicates were based in Nigeria,  from which large loads of cocaine were shipped to SA.    Worldwide, at least $85bn[billion] in drug profits was  laundered through the financial markets each year, he said,  adding that never before had one form of criminal activity  generated such enormous sums of ready money for investment in  business, both legal and illegal.    Grove said an estimated 2.5-million people worldwide,  excluding users, were believed to be directly involved in  drug-related activities. He said heroin was the latest drug  trend of the 1990s due to the production of and demand for  cocaine appearing to be leveling off.    Grove added that the SA drug market was dominated by dagga  [marijuana], Mandrax, cocaine, heroin and LSD.    SA Narcotics Bureau statistics clearly indicated a sharp  rise  in smuggling, especially cocaine, to the region. ""The financial  profit to be gained by the smuggling of this drug is  self-evident when one considers that the street value of cocaine  fluctuates between R200/g [gram] and R400/g,"" he said.    Smuggling networks were so well established, not only in the  southern African region but worldwide, that the same routes were  often used for drugs, weapons, cars, ivory and gemstones.    ""Mandrax is increasingly being bartered for stolen vehicles  and vehicle spare parts from SA,"" Grove told the conference.    Heroin smugglers from southeast Asia and southwest Asia, as  well as Mandrax syndicates from India, had recently expanded  their operations in SA via East and North Africa, while  Colombian cocaine smuggling druglords had moved their operations  to Nigeria, from which they focused on the SA market, he said.    Grove said police agencies simply did not have the manpower  or resources to match the limitless billions of the drug  syndicates. To combat the problem, a close relationship between  all the parties involved in the prevention of drug use should be  established.     "

It  will have the job of fighting illegal immigration and the  ""underground"" work done by foreigners.    For the first time in its history, the French Government is  setting up a specialized immigration police force. After  redrafting legislation on the entry and stay of foreigners and  after modifying the law on ID inspections, the Balladur  government is thus creating a police force responsible for  enforcing this restrictive legislation. In terms of the police,  it thus completes the response provided by the government to the  illegal immigration issue that it had from the outset ranked  among its top priorities.    Drafted by an Interior Ministry under the stewardship of  Charles Pasqua, the reorganization will result in the creation  of a Directorate To Oversee Immigration and Fight Illegal  Employment (DICILEC) within the National Police. According to  the draft order sent on to the prime minister, DICILEC will be  responsible for ""organizing and coordinating the action of the  National Police with respect to the fight against illegal  immigration and the employment of illegals."" It will be headed  by Prefect Robert Broussard, who previously served as special  commissioner in the fight against organized crime before being  entrusted with an antidrug mission. The creation of the new  directorate should take place--following an examination of  legislation creating it by various party technical committees,  followed by the Council of State--in March or even February.    The bulk of police supervision of immigration has heretofore  been the responsibility of the Central Branch of the Air and  Border Police (PAF). Created in August 1973 and established in  some 50 departments, the force has so far essentially devoted  itself to border surveillance at airports and at land and  maritime borders. In his report to the prime minister, Pasqua  stated his opinion that the PAF ""cannot provide an effective  response to the new guidelines of government policy which imply  going beyond mere supervision of crossborder traffic.""    DICILEC has therefore been entrusted with an ""overall  strategy"" of fighting illegal immigration. In addition to  exercising surveillance over the borders, which will remain one  of its primary missions, the new directorate is to carry out two  other aspects of the policy of overseeing the migratory flow:  the fight against the underground employment of undocumented  foreigners and the deportation of illegals or undesirable  persons from France.    ""Black Market"" Work    Feared as the immigration ""suction pump,"" the problem of the  employment of undocumented foreigners will henceforth be the  responsibility of DICILEC, which will have to find a modus  operandi with the labor inspection departments. The problem had  previously been handled by the police only marginally. Working  with the Criminal Investigation Police (PJ) and General  Intelligence (RG), the PAF had indeed succeeded in breaking up a  few rings bringing in undocumented workers from Asia or Turkey.    However, the employment of ""black market"" workers, whether  foreign or French, is far from being a priority for the police  except in the capital, where the 12th section of Parisian  Intelligence began in the early nineties to specialize in the  fight against the employment of undocumented foreigners. In the  rest of France, urban police stations and Gendarmerie squads  have generally concentrated on missions relating to public  safety.    The government also hopes that the handling of the  deportation of foreigners, illegals or undesirable elements will  be improved with DICILEC's creation. Its dissatisfaction is  mainly based on the drop in the rate of actual deportations,  which fell from 58 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in  1993.[.sup]1[/] One solution to the difficulties considered  by Place Beauvau was the merger of DICILEC with the Directorate  of Public Freedoms and Legal Affairs (DLPAJ), but the plan was  abandoned.    Modeled after the American immigration office, the merger  would have posed problems of liberties by bringing together the  DLPAJ ""jurists"" responsible for drafting regulations with the  DICILEC police officers responsible for applying them. The  Interior Ministry therefore rejected the option, going instead  for increased coordination between the new police directorate  and the regulatory departments under the DLPAJ which are  responsible in the prefectures for individual followup on  deportation measures.    Within DICILEC and in coordination with the DLPAJ, a  deportation office will oversee the ""implementation of material  means (transportation, escorts, and so on) making it possible to  effectively carry out administrative and legal deportation  measures ordered against undocumented foreigners or those  disturbing law and order,"" the ministry states.    Schengen Space    Concerning the mission traditionally performed by  PAF--overseeing border traffic--the new directorate must fit  into a Europe of immigration. The interior minister is therefore  asking DICILC to step up its control of crossborder traffic,  ""particularly at the future external borders of the Schengen  space.""    Originally scheduled in February 1994 but constantly  postponed, the implementation of the agreements signed in  Schengen by nine European countries (the Twelve, minus Great  Britain, Ireland, and Denmark), provides for the free  circulation of nationals within the space common to the  territories of their nine countries. As a result, DICILEC police  officers are to be assigned to the outer borders (the  Oder-Neisse line, for example) of the Schengen space. The  Interior Ministry is therefore also entrusting DICILEC with the  task of intensifying ""inspection and training action above the  (common) border (with signatories of the Schengen) and, in  sensitive countries, in liaison with the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.""    If the 6,000 PAF police officers are to be reassigned to the  new directorate, no increase in personnel is planned in the near  future (except to staff the teams exercising surveillance over  the Channel tunnel). Pasqua has personally deplored the  ""unstandardized"" presence of the PAF. In the initial period,  DICILEC will therefore have territorial detachments worthy of  the name only in departments in which the PAF had established  its own presence.    In addition, the new directorate is expected to suffer from  a  lack of personnel necessary for its new missions, particularly  since migratory pressure has recently increased on the borders  of countries (Germany, Belgium, and Italy) affected by  immigration from East bloc countries. According to the most  recent statistics, nearly half of the nonadmission measures are  applied at borders with these countries in the Schengen space.  In the long run, the national arrangement will nevertheless be  ""completed by the implementation of a multiyear plan"" consisting  of setting up specialized departments and units throughout  France that will perform the duties of administrative and  criminal investigative police with respect to illegal  immigration.    In the immediate future, the acronym for the new directorate  therefore risks, particularly in departments where the PAF  maintained no presence, ending up being but a skeleton  immigration police force. Is it for the sake of compensation  that the Interior Ministry notes, with no further ado, that ""the  action of Police and Customs will complement one another?""  Footnotes    1. This drop is largely explained by the decision made in  1991 to systematically issue deportation orders to all  undocumented foreigners, not just those stopped by police, but  also those whose visas have expired.

Sources inside and outside the commission confirmed this  week  that they have information tying Mtetwa to the receipt of  weapons from the network alleged to have been set up by renegade  South African Police members.    The police portfolio in the Natal cabinet has been at the  centre of this week's battle between the ANC and the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] in Natal over regional executive positions.    It has also emerged that the government of national unity is  keeping new details of the involvement of key former South  African Police [SAP] and IFP officials in political violence  under close wraps for fear of the political repercussions.    The MAIL  GUARDIAN has been leaked the second report  of the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task group on hit squads in  the KwaZulu Police which names IFP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] leader Themba Khoza, IFP PWV parliamentarian  Humphrey Ndlovu, and 16 senior KwaZulu (KZP) policemen who are  said to have taken part in hit squad activity. No action has  been taken on this, although it is dated March 29. And a new  Goldstone report, which was expected to have been made public,  has been sent to the international team investigating the  involvement of IFP and SAP officials in ""third force"" activity.    This report, dealing with covert operations against anti-  apartheid activists, corruption and other criminal activities by  policemen, was expected to be released three weeks ago,  according to sources in the ANC.    Sources in the commission have confirmed that such a report  was drawn up. ""There was going to be a report but it was  decided it was inappropriate for Goldstone to have his own  report now that the international team was investigating,"" said  a source close to the minister of safety and security.  Goldstone is understood to have discussed the report with the  minister, Sidney Mufamadi.    Judge Richard Goldstone confirmed his commission had handed  over the relevant information to the international team. ""All  information has been submitted to the international team,"" he  said. Asked if his commission would produce further reports on  the matter, he said: ""It depends very much on what comes out of  the international investigation. There may or may not be, I  really can't say.""    The second report by the TEC task group investigating  hitsquads in the KwaZulu Police recommends the immediate  suspension of the deputy commissioner of the KZP, Major General  Sipho Mathe, on grounds that he aided and concealed the  activities of hit men in the KZP. Among other things, he is  accused of ""disgraceful conduct"" by failing to investigate hit  squad claims against three senior Inkatha members.    The report paints a frightening picture of the systematic  concealment, failure to investigate and conniving at hit squad  activity in the KZP by senior officers. It recommends the  suspension of two KZP brigadiers, C.P. Mzimela and B.L. Ndlovu,  and a district commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sipho Mdluli. It  also calls for charges of defeating the ends of justice to be  investigated against L.A. Hlengwa, a former policeman and  currently an IFP head office official in Ulundi. Also  recommended is the suspension of two majors, two captains and a  lieutenant and the investigation of a brigadier, a major and two  captains.    The TEC report says an investigation into a massacre at  Nqutu, Natal by a KwaZulu policeman, Lieutenant Mbatha,  ""revealed that the rest of the suspects were members of a hit  squad that operated from hostels in East Rand and that Themba  Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu were involved in the planning of the  massacre.""    The reluctance to take firm action against ""third force""  suspects reflects differences in both the ANC and the government  about how to deal with criminal rightwing elements in the  security forces.    In the ANC, there are those who are urging a ""softly-softly""  approach, in an attempt to win these elements over. They appear  to have the backing of State President Nelson Mandela.    Others feel the quick removal of those who were involved in  orchestrating violence is the only way to finally stop those  involved in political destabilisation and get to the bottom of  the political violence which has rocked South Africa since 1990.    The debate around indemnity is also crucial. The authors of  the TEC report urge the TEC to grant selective indemnity to  witnesses who are prepared to give further details of ""third  force"" activity. They warn that without being able to offer  potential witnesses indemnity, there is ""little or no prospect  of rooting out those orchestrating this significant cause of  political violence.""    The government has made no substantial moves towards  addressing this particular indemnity issue. Senior former South  African Police officers are pushing for a blanket indemnity for  all political crimes after a cut off date, without disclosure of  the crime. They apparently hope this will prevent lower ranking  officers from testifying against their seniors.    The ANC and human rights activists have been pushing for the  full disclosure by those involved in political violence to help  them with their investigations. At the moment, the government  is taking the view that they cannot defy the generals without  destabilising the security forces -- something they are not  prepared to risk.    Meanwhile, all Judge Goldstone's witnesses -- the mystery  ""Qs"" who were sent to Denmark for safety in the wake of the  release of the ""third force"" report -- were brought back to  South Africa three weeks ago.

Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler said in a statement on Tuesday [5 April] he had  reported the working committee's conclusion to State President F  W de Klerk, the Transitional Executive Council, African National  Congress leader Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. ""The IEC has indicated that in the light  of the report, political measures were required. As such  measures fell outside its brief, the IEC, as in the past, did  not make any proposals,"" the judge said. The IEC is  nevertheless continuing with its planning of elections in the  province as a whole, and envisages providing the optimal level  of voting facilities possible in those areas unaffected by the  political climate in kwaZulu.""    He said the effect of the recently-proclaimed state of  emergency in kwaZulu/Natal could not be gauged as yet, but the  IEC anticipated it would ""significantly contribute to the  performance of its mandate"". An in-depth study was under way  and would be followed by an inspection in loco by two IEC  commissioners later this week. They would report to the full  commission on April 9.    Mr Justice Kriegler said the working group, set up on March  28, consisted of heads of relevant kwaZulu government  departments, representatives of the South African Department of  Home Affairs, the South African Police and the IEC.    He said the working committee gave the following reasons for  its assessment that an election was not feasible in kwaZulu:     -  ""the high level of political intolerance and fear, as well  as large-scale intimidation, which factors have led to the  current state of emergency;    -  ""the kwaZulu civil service and tribal structures/authorities  are, at present, unable to fully assist the process for a free  and fair election;    -  ""due to time constraints, the IEC will not be able to follow  the prescribed protocol required to confirm, evaluate, and  secure the voting stations; (and),    -  ""the South African Police and the kwaZulu Police do not  foresee  that they will be in a position in the present political climate  to adequately ensure that the elections are free and fair. This  is due to the additional demands on its manpower resources  relating to the level of violence (present as well as future),  normal policing duties and normal election-related duties.""     "

By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Over the past two years, the Ventura County district attorney's office in four  separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they  were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by  Oxnard officers, records show.    In a fifth and more recent incident, the district attorney's office declined to  file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and  several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police.  Instead, Anthony Flores, 22, was charged with five misdemeanor counts of  resisting arrest.    The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality  lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved. The  suits, which seek unspecified damages and medical and legal expenses, are  pending.    Two of the incidents have led to an investigation by the Police Department's  internal affairs division.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Brodie, misdemeanor supervisor for the office, said  the decisions not to prosecute the suspects do not necessarily mean that Oxnard  police were not justified in making the arrests. In each of the four cases,  Brodie said, his office did not prosecute because it found that police did not  provide enough evidence to prove the charges ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""    But Jean Farley, a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender's office,  said it is extremely rare for the district attorney's office not to prosecute a  suspect who is accused by police.    The district attorney's office may have declined to prosecute the suspects  because police brutality has been alleged, she said. Prosecution is usually  turned down when the arresting officer is suspected of using excessive force,  she said.    Assistant Police Chief William Kady declined to discuss the brutality  allegations against the Oxnard officers because of pending litigation. He said,  however, that the decisions by the district attorney's office not to prosecute  the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department.    ""I don't think our reputation is any worse than any other department's,"" he  said. ""There is always going to be a disagreement over how much force is used.""    The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from  the June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in  the 1300 block of South E Street.    It began when four officers answered complaints about a loud party. A police  report said Flores started the fight by shoving a policeman. Flores and his  brothers, Alex, 19, and Luis Jr., 24 -- all of whom suffered gashes and scrapes  on their heads and bodies -- said the officers beat them without provocation.    Police had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of  resisting arrest but the district attorney's office decided two weeks later to  prosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest.    ""Based upon my review of all the reports, the charges were the most appropriate  charges to file,"" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald Gran, who declined to  elaborate.    Police Chief Robert Owens has ordered an investigation into the incident.    In an incident April 7, Sergio E. Gonzalez, 19, accused Oxnard officers of  ordering a police dog to attack him before he was arrested.    In a suit filed June 29, Gonzalez said he was standing on Sunkist Circle when  the dog attacked him, biting him on the arm and left shoulder. Gonzalez was  taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and  spent two weeks recovering from his injuries.    Edward M. Fox, an attorney representing Gonzalez, said his client, a gardener,  might suffer some permanent injury to his right arm.    According to a police report filed by Officer Michael Cole, police were sent to  a parking lot outside the Oxnard Moose Lodge to investigate a report of an  altercation between several men after a wedding reception. Cole's report said  Gonzalez was found hiding in the parking lot and ""was bit by a police service  dog during the arrest.""    The report, however, does not say why the dog attacked Gonzalez or whether  Gonzalez resisted arrest. Police arrested Gonzalez on suspicion of disturbing  the peace, Brodie said. But the district attorney's office declined to file any  charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in  the altercation, Brodie said.    Fox said Gonzalez did not attend the wedding but was visiting a friend nearby  and went to the parking lot to find out what was causing the commotion.    In a third incident, Louis M. Cornett, a retired teacher and licensed gun  dealer, said he was beaten on Oct. 20 while in custody at Oxnard police  headquarters. Cornett said the altercation began as he was returning home after  scouting out a site for quail hunting near Santa Maria.    Officer Robert Camarillo said in a police report that Cornett was arrested in  the 3600 block of Taffrail Road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon, resisting  arrest and possessing a loaded firearm.    Camarillo said in the report that he stopped Cornett while investigating a  complaint of a man waving a gun from a car and threatening youngsters packed  into another vehicle. Camarillo said Cornett fit the description of the man who  allegedly brandished the weapon.    When he searched Cornett's car, Camarillo said, he found a semiautomatic  handgun, several rounds of ammunition and a 12-gauge shotgun.    Camarillo admitted that he later shoved Cornett against a wall at police  headquarters because the suspect had struggled and had clenched his fists in a  threatening manner.    But a lawsuit against Camarillo filed May 8, 1989, alleges that while in  custody at the police station, Camarillo shoved and punched Cornett in the  mouth. ""He slammed me in the mouth once, twice and a third time,"" Cornett said  in an interview.    Cornett, maintaining that he never struggled with the officer, said he suffered  a broken tooth and a cut lip during the beating.    The district attorney's office declined to file charges against Cornett  because, Brodie said, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett  brandished a gun.    In a fourth incident, Alejandro Guzman-Flores, 21, accused three Oxnard  officers of beating him on his face, causing severe damage to his eyesight.    Guzman-Flores said he was working in a motorcycle repair shop on Jan. 27, 1989,  when his boss asked him to investigate a noise in the alley behind the shop in  the 1500 block of South Pine Street.    In a suit filed against the city Nov. 14, 1989, the Police Department and  officers Jana Younger, Fred Sedillos and James Struck, Guzman-Flores contends  that he was grabbed from behind by Younger while in the alley. The officer  poked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby,  Guzman-Flores said in the suit.    The Police Department declined to release Flores' arrest report because, police  officials said, it contains his criminal history. But Flores' lawyer, Sherrie  L. McCracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding  to a complaint of a man with a gun.    McCracken said the officers continued to question Flores in English, but Flores  -- a recent immigrant from Mexico who speaks only Spanish -- could not respond.  Flores was handcuffed and shoved to the ground, causing Sedillos to trip and  fall on him, according to the suit.    Sedillos got up and punched and kicked Flores several times while Younger held  Flores in a ""choke-hold,"" the suit alleges.    Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an  officer. The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Flores but later  dismissed all charges during Flores' trial because police failed to turn over a  recording of a dispatcher's call requesting that officers investigate the  incident at the motorcycle shop, McCracken said.    McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was  placed in the choke-hold. McCracken said Flores was beaten so severely that he  suffered a detached retina and might lose partial sight in one eye.    ""They essentially beat the hell out of him for nothing,"" she said.    In another incident, Luis C. Luna, 50, alleges in a complaint filed with the  city on June 27, 1989, that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant  in Port Hueneme.    Luna said in an interview that he, his wife and several friends were leaving  the restaurant on July 16, 1988, when an Oxnard police car pulled up in front  of the group. Luna, a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme, said  he walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero ""in a kidding  manner"" what he was doing in Port Hueneme.    ""The officer jumped out and started pushing me back against the pillar in front  of the building, using his baton on my throat,"" Luna said in the complaint.    When he asked the officer why he was being shoved, Ruggiero told him that he  was under arrest, according to the complaint. Officers Steven Vendt and  Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said.    ""They used forcible brutality by hitting me with the baton on my elbow, knees  and back, forcing me to drop down on the sidewalk with my face slammed against  the pavement,"" Luna said in the complaint.    Luna was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct under the influence of  drugs. The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Luna, but in  September, 1988 -- before his trial began -- all charges against him were  withdrawn for lack of evidence, Brodie said.    Owens ordered the department's internal affairs division to investigate Luna's  complaint. But Luna said the Police Department later sent him a letter saying  the investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officers' parts.    Luna had asked the city for $50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for  ""humiliation suffered in public."" He failed, however, to submit the claim for  damages during the statutory six-month period after the incident and was barred  by law from filing a lawsuit.      Photo, Attorney Sherrie L.

When he searched Cornett's car, Camarillo said, he found a semiautomatic  handgun, several rounds of ammunition and a 12-gauge shotgun.    Camarillo admitted that he later shoved Cornett against a wall at police  headquarters because the suspect had struggled and had clenched his fists in a  threatening manner.    But a lawsuit against Camarillo filed May 8, 1989, alleges that while in  custody at the police station, Camarillo shoved and punched Cornett in the  mouth. ""He slammed me in the mouth once, twice and a third time,"" Cornett said  in an interview.    Cornett, maintaining that he never struggled with the officer, said he suffered  a broken tooth and a cut lip during the beating.    The district attorney's office declined to file charges against Cornett  because, Brodie said, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett  brandished a gun.    In a fourth incident, Alejandro Guzman-Flores, 21, accused three Oxnard  officers of beating him on his face, causing severe damage to his eyesight.    Guzman-Flores said he was working in a motorcycle repair shop on Jan. 27, 1989,  when his boss asked him to investigate a noise in the alley behind the shop in  the 1500 block of South Pine Street.    In a suit filed against the city Nov. 14, 1989, the Police Department and  officers Jana Younger, Fred Sedillos and James Struck, Guzman-Flores contends  that he was grabbed from behind by Younger while in the alley. The officer  poked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby,  Guzman-Flores said in the suit.    The Police Department declined to release Flores' arrest report because, police  officials said, it contains his criminal history. But Flores' lawyer, Sherrie  L. McCracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding  to a complaint of a man with a gun.    McCracken said the officers continued to question Flores in English, but Flores  -- a recent immigrant from Mexico who speaks only Spanish -- could not respond.  Flores was handcuffed and shoved to the ground, causing Sedillos to trip and  fall on him, according to the suit.    Sedillos got up and punched and kicked Flores several times while Younger held  Flores in a ""choke-hold,"" the suit alleges.    Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an  officer. The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Flores but later  dismissed all charges during Flores' trial because police failed to turn over a  recording of a dispatcher's call requesting that officers investigate the  incident at the motorcycle shop, McCracken said.    McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was  placed in the choke-hold. McCracken said Flores was beaten so severely that he  suffered a detached retina and might lose partial sight in one eye.    ""They essentially beat the hell out of him for nothing,"" she said.    In another incident, Luis C. Luna, 50, alleges in a complaint filed with the  city on June 27, 1989, that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant  in Port Hueneme.    Luna said in an interview that he, his wife and several friends were leaving  the restaurant on July 16, 1988, when an Oxnard police car pulled up in front  of the group. Luna, a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme, said  he walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero ""in a kidding  manner"" what he was doing in Port Hueneme.    ""The officer jumped out and started pushing me back against the pillar in front  of the building, using his baton on my throat,"" Luna said in the complaint.    When he asked the officer why he was being shoved, Ruggiero told him that he  was under arrest, according to the complaint. Officers Steven Vendt and  Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said.    ""They used forcible brutality by hitting me with the baton on my elbow, knees  and back, forcing me to drop down on the sidewalk with my face slammed against  the pavement,"" Luna said in the complaint.    Luna was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct under the influence of  drugs. The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Luna, but in  September, 1988 -- before his trial began -- all charges against him were  withdrawn for lack of evidence, Brodie said.    Owens ordered the department's internal affairs division to investigate Luna's  complaint. But Luna said the Police Department later sent him a letter saying  the investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officers' parts.    Luna had asked the city for $50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for  ""humiliation suffered in public."" He failed, however, to submit the claim for  damages during the statutory six-month period after the incident and was barred  by law from filing a lawsuit.      Photo, Attorney Sherrie L.

The impact of the collision broke McIntyre's back in 17 places and left him  paralyzed from the ribs down.    McIntyre was a 23-year-old patrol officer and had been out of the police  academy for only 18 months when the accident left him in a wheelchair.    But McIntyre and the Oxnard Police Department have both made the best of the  tragic accident. Although the department lost a good beat cop, it gained a desk  officer with a particular sensitivity to victims of crimes and accidents.    Before McIntyre was injured, the department was considering creating a desk job  for injured officers who could soothe crime victims, fill out reports and  answer questions about the law. The position was a perfect fit.    ""It was advantageous for him and the department,"" said Lt. Stan Myers,  McIntyre's supervising officer. ""It provided us with somebody with experience  and knowledge. And, boy, he's contributed a lot.""    Myers said that many times police officers on the street don't have enough time  to listen to victims or residents with a concern. But McIntyre ""has the time to  listen,"" he said.    McIntyre agrees. He said that because he was a victim of an accident and a  crime, he can now better sympathize with the victims he comforts at the police  station.    ""I can relate to them being disabled or I can relate to them as victims,"" he  said. ""I tell them if you didn't end up with a permanent injury or you didn't  lose something that you can't replace, that money can't buy, then you're doing  all right.""    Police Chief Robert Owens said he offered McIntyre the position of answering  phone calls from victims because ""we knew he was a good man, a good officer.""    Because McIntyre's accident occurred while off duty, he was not eligible for  many of the Police Department's insurance benefits, Owens said. To aid their  disabled colleague, several police officers donated their sick leave so that  McIntyre wouldn't lose his regular paycheck, he said.    ""We are like a family,"" he said. ""We try to support each other.""    Although he said he tries to be encouraging to victims, McIntyre has had to  struggle in his own life.    ""There are a lot of people that have bounced back better than I, and there are  some who haven't bounced back as well,"" he said.    McIntyre said it took him five months to learn how to dress himself and 10  months to learn how to use the bathroom without any help. And then there is the  constant pain, which he said is ""like someone digging their knuckles into your  back.""    Although the struggle to fight off depression and frustration continues every  day, McIntyre said, things are looking up.    In 1986, he bought a two-bedroom house in Oxnard, which he has renovated for  wheelchair access. He installed a Jacuzzi specially designed so he can get in  and out without help.    Last year, he married Hellmi Chavez, a young records clerk he met at work.  Merlin, a black Labrador service dog who spends almost 24 hours a day at his  master's side, carried the rings in a basket during the wedding ceremony.    McIntyre, a blond, blue-eyed native of Laguna Beach, competes in tennis  tournaments for the handicapped and lectures schoolchildren about the  capabilities of the disabled. St. John's Regional Medical Center has sponsored  McIntyre in the tournaments.    ""I don't like being in a chair,"" he said. ""I hate being in a chair. I want to  change my own light bulbs and I want to paint my own house and do my own  gardening. But I wouldn't change what I have with my wife and my dog and the  Police Department and the community of Oxnard.""    When asked, he does not hesitate to recount the events involving the motorcycle  accident that so drastically altered his life.    On the night of April 5, 1985, McIntyre was headed north on Pacific Coast  Highway in Laguna Beach, returning from Palm Springs with a woman friend on the  back of his bike, when a Ford Mustang suddenly cut in front of him, beginning a  U-turn.    McIntyre, who was riding at about 45 miles per hour, had just enough time to  apply the brakes and slide the motorcycle onto its side.    Although the impact of the crash broke his back and shattered his hip and five  ribs, McIntyre never lost consciousness. His friend suffered several broken  bones but recovered with no permanent injuries.    The driver of the car was not injured. However, police tests later showed that  the driver had a 0.18% blood-alcohol level and had used cocaine that day.  Several witnesses said they saw the man stagger into the Mustang just before  the accident but no one tried to stop him.    ""I wasn't angry at the guy,"" McIntyre said. ""I met him several months later in  court. He just cried and said he was sorry.""    The driver was sentenced to one year in jail and ordered to pay $65,000 in  restitution to McIntyre. The drunk driver spent eight months in jail and has  yet to pay the restitution, McIntyre said.    McIntyre admits that the episode made him ""a little frustrated with the whole  justice system,"" but he said he tries not to let it discourage him or affect  his work.    McIntyre underwent 14 hours of surgery before he was strapped face down onto a  special hospital bed that nurses rotated every two hours to keep him from  developing bedsores. He remained strapped to that bed for two weeks.    Initially, McIntyre said, he considered suicide to end the agonizing pain in  his back.    ""They had a 24-hour watch on me for several weeks because it was so  depressing,"" he said. ""The pain was unbearable. Sometimes you just lay there  and scream and cry for hours.""    But he survived the eight months in the hospital with the support of his  parents and many friends.    Things were different when McIntyre returned to the police station. It bothered  him that his colleagues had to look down to meet his eyes. And although he  continues to be physically active, he said some officers began to greet him  with a feeble handshake.    ""People should know that being in a chair you still have the same wants,"" he  said. ""You want to do everything just like before and you really hate it when  someone looks at you differently.""    Hellmi, his wife, said that even after McIntyre got out of the hospital and  returned to work, he was often depressed and frustrated. She said much of her  time with him has been spent motivating him to do such basic things as getting  dressed.    ""To be married to someone who is in a chair can be a lot of work,"" she said.  ""But when you are in love with someone it really doesn't matter.""      Photo, Oxnard Police Officer Glenn McIntyre talks to Elm Street school  students. LAWRENCE K.

There the police had been confronted by a man  armed with a handgun. The man was wounded and arrested.    Inside the building, four males, the youngest of whom was 14  years old, were found in a barred holding cell. All of them  showed signs of severe assault. Col.

The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel  Taboada, in prison for five years now and a witness in the  service of U.S. agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack  of imagination from the silent partners to this accususation  which is, according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards.  Second point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the  Haitian case is being treated in the United States. So far as I  am concerned, the challenge remains complete.    This was a note from Lt.

The police threatened to  throw in the street all property of the edition, including  computers, if its employees did not leave the building  voluntarily.    The police stated that the measure had been carried out  under  the order of Baku Mayor Rafael Allakhverdiyev.    The Baku Mayor's Office refused to comment on the decision  of  the mayor saying he was not present at the office.    The AZADLYG was the newspaper of the Azerbaijani People's  Front (now in the opposition) before summer, 1993. Now the  newspaper reflects the point of view of the opposition and the  Azerbaijani People's Front remains one of its sponsors.    On the same day the Turan independent news agency and  several  other editions which occupy the same building with the AZADLYG  were demanded to leave it.    Editor of the AZADLYG newspaper Gyundyuz Tairli told  journalists that he considered the actions by the police a a new  wave of oppressions against independent media.     "

Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two  other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of  Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol  Lt-Gen Chaisit said.    Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi  Lotfollar, who is still at large, were sought under arrest  warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring  to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of  others, and making and possessing explosives.    The warrants were issued after the police said they had  evidence to prove the two were behind a plot to car-bomb the  embassy.    The bombing plan ran into trouble when the bomb-laden  six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein accidentally hit a  motorcycle-taxi near Central Chitlom department store a short  distance from the embassy.    After failing to negotiate with the motorcycle driver, the  truck driver, said to be an Arab-looking man, fled the scene.    The truck from a rental company was then taken to Lumphini  police station where it was left for about a week before its  owner found a water tank containing C-4 plastic explosives wired  to a diesel fuel tank.    The body of Chom Thila, a Thai employee of the rental firm,  was found in the tank.    Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the  Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck  driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit.    Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and  Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra  Hotel in Hat Yai.    A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao  district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran  under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the  immigration checkpoint on Thursday.    Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked  similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and  distributed to immigration offices across the country, an  immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch  on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday.    The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand  through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok  districts more than 10 times under different names.    The immigration officers, however, earlier could not  identify  him because they did not have his photograph.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left  the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy,  came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat  Yai.    The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had  called off their investigation.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the  other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot.    He said the police found the gang had its command centre in  Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by  Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents.    The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional  witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and  southern provinces.    Investigations will be completed in seven days and the  suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen  Chaisit said.    Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon  Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to  kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem not under stress.    Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted  the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am  yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some  ""Thai people in Bangkok"".    ""I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something  strange would happen,"" Gen Chawalit said. He did not elaborate.    He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy  that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.     "

Hundreds of households are now living  in destitute conditions because of opium addiction. In early  1994, Dac Lac set up a labor education center to help  rehabilitate drug addicts. Opium addiction is still on the rise,  though, and may spread quickly to local residents because the  number of immigrants from Cao Bang is growing fast.

In the last month, seven people have been arrested in the East Valley on  suspicion of auto theft for towing cars to salvage yards and selling them  without the owners' consent. And authorities say at least another dozen  tow-truck operators have engaged in the practice.    The police proposal, scheduled to be considered by the Los Angeles Police  Commission on Tuesday, would require junk dealers citywide to notify police  about each car they purchase for destruction and to hold the cars intact for  five days before crushing them. Junk dealers would also have to keep records so  they could provide police the name of any seller of a vehicle that turned out  to be stolen.    ""It's been happening for a long time but never on this scale,"" Detective Glen  Higgins said of tow-truck operators stealing cars. Higgins is head of the  Consolidated Effort to Combat Auto Theft, a multi-agency task force set up in  the Valley last year.      Tow-Truck Thieves    Since the salvage yards pay according to weight, the tow-truck thieves have  targeted large, older-model American autos, which can bring up to $200 each,  Higgins said. They have also sought out dirty cars or cars that appear to have  been in accidents since such vehicles are less likely to attract attention as  they are hauled away, Higgins said.    People who have seen tow trucks picking up vehicles in their neighborhoods only  suspect foul play after they hear that their neighbors' cars have been stolen,  Higgins said.    Of about 1,500 cars reported stolen each month in the Valley, Higgins said, 10%  to 15% are older autos in disrepair. These cars frequently belong to low-income  families who cannot afford to lose what is sometimes their sole means of  transportation, he said.    While newer stolen cars are frequently recovered, though usually with parts  missing, these older autos rarely turn up, except as compact blocks of crushed  metal at junkyards, Higgins said.    After four tow-truck operators were arrested in North Hollywood on Aug. 4 on  suspicion of auto theft, police searched Valley Junk, a San Fernando scrap  yard, and found the crushed remains of four stolen cars.    Police said those arrested had been stealing 10 to 12 cars a day from the North  Hollywood and Pacoima areas and selling them as scrap.    Although police say they do not believe that junkyards deliberately collaborate  with such thieves, they add that regulating such businesses is the best way to  halt the destruction of stolen cars.    But Valley junkyard operators, who say they would not crush a car they knew was  stolen, believe that it is unfair to target them for increased regulation.    ""The police want us to do their work for them,"" said Mike Raspa, manager of  Valley Junk.    Raspa said he requires a seller to produce a ""junk slip"" before he buys a car  for crushing. But junk slips, which are issued by the state Department of Motor  Vehicles and authorize a vehicle's destruction, are easily forged, police say.    Before a junk slip is issued, the DMV requires proof of ownership.    But ownership papers can be easily obtained by thieves since car owners often  keep them in the car's glove compartment, police say.    And to make matters worse, the DMV does not contact police agencies about  whether a vehicle is stolen before issuing a junk slip, police say.    Sharon Larkin, weighmaster of San Fernando Crushing in Sun Valley, said her lot  requires junk slips. But she said the lot is occasionally duped by car thieves.    ""There is definitely a problem,"" she said.      Paper Work Unwelcome    Still, she said, the rules before the Police Commission would create unwelcome  paper work for the salvage yard's staff.    And the yard would have insufficient space to store cars intact during the  mandatory holding period, she said.    Police have also proposed to the City Council that state legislation be  requested that would allow authorities to regulate tow-truck operations outside  the city.    Now police can conduct unannounced inspections of towing companies in Los  Angeles but have no jurisdiction over operations based outside the city.    The seven tow-truck operators arrested in the last month are:    Jorge Barrocal, 30, of Sherman Oaks; Angel Simones, 28, of North Hollywood, and  Pacoima residents Douglas Gray, 34; Jorge Cruz, 42; Teri Lynn Anderson, 32;  Malcolm Pfeferstein, 20, and Ronald Isaacs, 51.    Barrocal, Simones, Gray and Cruz were arrested in North Hollywood on suspicion  of auto theft and have been released on $1,500 bail each.    The district attorney's office has until the end of the month to file charges  against them, authorities said.    Preliminary hearings are scheduled Monday in San Fernando Municipal Court for  Anderson and Pfeferstein, each arrested in Pacoima on suspicion of grand theft  auto and receiving stolen property.    Isaacs, charged with five felonies relating to his alleged car thefts, is  scheduled for a preliminary hearing Aug. 21 in San Fernando Municipal Court.    Another tow-truck operator, Lee Schurr, 63, of Pacoima, pleaded guilty to one  count of auto theft in San Fernando Municipal Court on May 12.    He was sentenced to 120 days in County Jail and four years probation.  Authorities say Schurr and Isaacs were working together.

In a report to the standing committee  for safety and security at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center]  near Soweto, Duarte said the creation of peace and the  rebuilding of communities on the East Rand were high on her list  of priorities.    Other priorities included the establishment of community  policing forums, car theft, rape, allegations of police torture,  and gun control legislation.    Duarte said the improvement of working conditions for  policemen and the upgrading of police stations were also  ""absolute necessities"".    ""Job satisfaction is certainly not the motivating factor for  entering the SAPS [South African Police Service]. Rather, job  necessity seems to be the factor motivating people.""    She added that solving the problem of disillusionment,  without looking at a programme of affirmative action for black  police personnel in particular, was not possible.    Duarte said efforts to stabilise the East Rand had already  begun, with the creation of an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]-ANC  working group to look at the opening of ""no-go areas"", the  resumption of train services between Kwesini and Katlehong, and  the security of residents returning to their homes.    She explained proposals to reorientate members of  self-defence and self-protection units created to protect  communities and hostels. Duarte said a programme, organised by  the PWV MEC [member executive council] for education, had been  established to enable members of the units between the ages of  13 and 18 to attend six- month ""reintegration school programmes""  to prepare them for admission to ordinary schools.    Members between the ages of 19 and 24 would be put through  adult literacy programmes and be assisted with job creation or  entrance to tertiary institutions.    And older members would be assisted in joining the police  force as reservists or organised into neighbourhood watch  programmes.    Duarte said that according to the defence force about 20,000  illegal weapons were in circulation on the East Rand and an  amnesty or gun collection campaign would retrieve only about 10  percent of the weapons.    One of the problems was community scepticism about the  police  force and the number of weapons illegally owned by criminals,  said Duarte.    The ""unprecedented"" increase in rapes and violent crime  against women had prompted the urgent need for members of the  police force to be trained to deal with victims, said Duarte.    She also proposed the creation of a commission of inquiry to  investigate police torture.     "

The conference was called by a manufacturer of the vests, Santa Fe  Springs-based U.S. Armor Corp.    In the aftermath of the Downey incident, the company said it would seek  legislation that would severely restrict who could purchase the vests.

Willis was one of two Downey officers wounded in the wild shoot-out with the  robbers, who were armed with an arsenal of semiautomatic rifles and carried  two-way radios.

The Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang task force, dubbed Operation  Hammer, arrested 472 people in all -- 288 of them reputed gang members -- in a  crackdown that began Friday evening and continued into the early morning hours  Saturday, police said.    Hundreds of officers from police divisions in East Los Angeles, the Mid-City  area, the San Fernando Valley and other stations participated in the latest in  a series of periodic sweeps aimed at controlling street violence.    But despite those efforts, gang-related warfare still flared over the weekend.    Police reported that one apparent gang member was shot and killed Saturday  about 2:45 a.m. as he stood on a Pacoima sidewalk, less than an hour after the  task force had ceased operations for the day. The victim was reportedly hit in  the head by a bullet from a passing car and was pronounced dead at the scene.  No arrests had been made, Lt. Maurice Rubio of Foothill Division said.    At least six people were also wounded in gang-related shootings, including a  12-year-old boy who was shot in the back in the South-Central Los Angeles area.  He was left paralyzed from the waist down, police said.    The youth was walking in the 1200 block of East 41st Street just before  midnight Friday when he was shot by several gunmen in a passing car. ""They  yelled out their gang affiliation and fired several rounds at the youth walking  down the street,"" said Lt. Ron Code of the Newton Division who added that the  victim is in critical condition and that no arrests had been made.    A few hours later, in Hollywood, two officers on patrol witnessed another  drive-by shooting as three gunmen armed with shotguns opened fire on a rival  gang member in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, police said.    The officers chased the speeding car on the Hollywood Freeway, and after  stopping it, they arrested four juveniles, said Sgt. C. E. Tave of Hollywood  Division. The unidentified victim was hit in the arm, buttocks and foot by  shotgun pellets but refused medical treatment, Tave said.    In other weekend incidents:    * An unidentified woman was wounded in the chest late Friday in Koreatown in a  drive-by shooting that police are investigating as gang related.    * A 22-year-old gang member was hit by gunfire from a passing car early  Saturday in the Mid-City area, Wilshire Division police said.    * And outside the city of Los Angeles, 18-year-old Mario Escalante of Bell -- a  reported gang member -- was wounded in the hip when he emerged from a bowling  alley in Huntington Park and four shots were fired from a car, Sgt. Mike Leinen  said.    No arrests have been made in any of the incidents.    During their weekend sweep, however, task force officers did arrest five gang  members, including four juveniles, as suspects in the Friday shooting of two  teen-agers in North Hollywood. The victims, who apparently had no gang ties,  were gunned down on a street by a pickup truck full of gang members, police  said. Both survived the shootings and have been hospitalized.    Operation Hammer, which began in January, 1988, targets gang members for arrest  for minor violations or felonies. Police said 106 gang members arrested Friday  and Saturday were booked for felonies. The majority of those arrested were  booked for various misdemeanors, including drunk driving, narcotics possession  and warrants for failure to appear in court.    Police also reported seizing 11 guns from gang members during the operation.    In another drive-by shooting Saturday afternoon, police said an unidentified  Latino man in his mid-20s died after he was gunned down in the Union Avenue  section of Los Angeles. But Sgt. John Wickham of Rampart Division said the  death did not appear to be gang related.

The information was conveyed to the security authorities  after the recent assassination of the Jordanian Embassy first  secretary in Beirut by the Palestinian organization, Hamas  [Islamic Movement]. The Hamas organization proceeded with this  action after Jordan deported 24 Iranians. However, because of  Jordan's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian talks on the Middle  East issue, fears are expressed that the incident will not end  there.    This is why the Cyprus authorities have increased security  measures at the Royal Jordanian Airlines offices in Nicosia  while police patrols in the surrounding area have also been  increased and the police guards have strict orders to keep their  eyes open. Measures have also been adopted at other ""targets.""    As is known, Jordan does not have an embassy or any other  diplomatic mission in Cyprus but it has a person who functions  as a representative.

The reasons the police chief cited are  quite simple. During 1992 the Economic Crimes Brigade received  3,000 investigation orders and, with great efficiency, recovered  818 million pesos. In 1993 the number of investigation orders  issued by the courts did not change much, reaching 3,100. But  over 2.66 billion pesos were recovered. This means that the huge  amounts stolen through fraud had multipled by a factor of at  least three.    Not only did the numbers grow, but so did specialization and  the use of advanced technology to falsify public documents and  instruments, not to mention the new and infrequently reported  cases of computer fraud.    In Mery's report on Tuesday, he said that Bridec [Economic  Crimes Brigade] ""is a unit that has shown a great increase in  efficiency during this period. Crimes like robberies with  intimidation or crimes involving bloodshed generally have a much  greater impact on public opinion. But white-collar criminals  cause considerable damages to the state, to development projects  that the state has to finance, and to workers who are victims of  fraud and swindling."" [passage omitted]    A few years ago, Bridec operated only in Santiago. Today it  has units in all regional headquarters, the result, a  high-ranking police official said, of ""the difficult changes in  the Chilean economy.""    Money laundering is always directly related to drugs, but it  is an eminently economic crime, for this ""black"" money comes not  only from drugs, but also from tax evasion, arms trafficking,  and hundreds of lesser crimes that produce dirty money that  needs to be laundered.    To counter this new scourge while waiting for Parliament to  enact legislation, the Investigations Police began to work on it  a year ago.    Police experts from the Antidrug Brigade and from Bridec who  will be working under the coordination of a team of attorneys  from the State Defense Council have taken courses to upgrade  their skills in England, the United States, Germany, and Italy.    Six officers, including police officers with accounting  degrees, are also in contact with foreign police agents who are  experts in money laundering. They will also have the direct  support of the FBI office that is to be set up in Chile, as well  as of the U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration].    Chile's prospects for preventing economic crimes seem  favorable. This is no place for people who want to pursue their  base designs of swindling their fellow citizens. As Nelson Mery  said, ""No matter who they may be, they will end up in jail.""  [passage omitted]     "

In  a statement in Lagos today, the inspector general of police,  Ibrahim Commassie, warned that any attempt to install another  government other than the present federal military government by  any person or group of persons, will be repelled with force.  The inspector general of police said that the federal military  government, in its genuine effort to return the country to a  democratic rule, has set in motion a program to achieve the  goal. He said the fact that the present military administration  has continued to guarantee freedom of expression, should not be  used to cause public disorder. The police therefore advised  members of the public to go about their lawful businesses as  their safety is guaranteed.    The statement added that the Nigerian police and other  security agents, are fully prepared to deal decisively with any  person or group of persons who decide to break the public peace  or stand as an obstacle to the march toward a lasting democracy.

George Curtis, 45, of Oak View was arrested on suspicion of possessing a  sawed-off shotgun, said Ventura Police Sgt. Steve Bowman.    Curtis, who was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail, was a  target of the investigation which led to a search Tuesday of his house at 100  Watkins Way, Bowman said.    During the search, police found firearms and a small amount of methamphetamine,  Bowman said.    They also seized a bomb that Bowman described as similar to those used by the  military in aerial target practice. The bomb squad of the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department dismantled the bomb and found that it was inert, he said.    Delia Coonrod, 35, of Ventura was also arrested at the house for possession of  methamphetamine.    Ronny Archer, 24, of Ventura and Robert Blymer, 44, of Ojai came to the house  while the search was under way. Blymer was arrested on suspicion of being under  the influence, possession of drug paraphernalia and driving without a license.  Archer was arrested on a warrant for violating probation.    The search of the house led police to three storage areas in the 5700 block of  Ventura Avenue, where they found chemicals used in the manufacture of  methamphetamines, Bowman said.    Walton Peacock, 40, and Rosalee Jones, 32, both of Ventura, were stopped by  officers after they left the storage area. Police said Peacock had two loaded  handguns concealed in his car and about a half-ounce of methamphetamine.    He was arrested on suspicion of possession of methamphetamine for sale,  carrying a concealed weapon, having a loaded gun in public and possessing a  controlled substance while armed, Bowman said. Peacock was out on bail from a  1989 arrest by the Ventura Police Department for possession for sale of  methamphetamine.    Jones was arrested on an outstanding traffic warrant and on suspicion of being  under the influence of a controlled substance.    Christina Hope, 37, of Ventura was arrested at the storage area on an  outstanding traffic warrant. She was being held in the Ventura County Jail in  lieu of $5,000 bail. James Paul Urban, 24, of Ventura also was arrested at the  storage area on warrants for grand theft, violation of probation and a traffic  violation.    He was being held in lieu of $6,819 bail in the County Jail.    Coonrod, Peacock, Jones, Blymer and Archer were booked into the County Jail and  subsequently released, either on their own recognizance or after posting bail,  a jail spokesman said.

The man, King Fung Chu, 40, of San Diego, was stopped by officers about 10:20  p.m. while driving a car with its anti-theft alarm blaring, police said.    The car, which wasn't stolen, was traveling west on Home Avenue near California  94, police said.    When two officers approached Chu after stopping the car, he was uncooperative  and shouted: ""I'm going to kill an American cop. Shoot me, shoot me,"" said  police spokesman Dave Cohen.    Police summoned a backup unit with a police dog, Cohen said.    The dog was used by officers to distract Chu on the driver's side of the car  while an unidentified officer broke the car's right window and fired the Taser  gun at Chu, Cohen said.    The gun fires a dart that emits 50,000 volts of electricity, Cohen said.

Following is a defense from  Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois to those accusations.  We read:    On 28 October 1993, I publicly challenged Father Aristide or  any of his supporters, foreign or national, to bring just one  proof of the existence of any link between myself and illicit  drug traffic. The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel Taboada, in  prison for five years now and a witness in the service of U.S.  agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack of imagination  from the silent partners to this accususation which is,  according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards. Second  point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the Haitian  case is being treated in the United States. So far as I am  concerned, the challenge remains complete.    This was a note from Lt. Col. Michel Francois in reaction to  accusations of drug trafficking.     "

A woman was also arrested in the incident, but a second man, believed to be an  accomplice in the shootings, escaped, police said.    The double slaying in the alley of a Sepulveda apartment building was  apparently a random attack by two men who were angry over a New Year's Eve drug  deal gone awry, said police Lt. William Hall.    The identities of the two dead men were not released, pending notification of  relatives. The wounded man, Timothy Brown, 24, was being treated at Northridge  Hospital Medical Center, where officials refused to disclose his condition.    Edward T. Furnance, 23, who was shot once in the leg by police, was arrested on  suspicion of murder. He was being held in the jail ward at Los Angeles  County-USC Medical Center, where he was in stable condition, police said.    Sophina Newsome, 27, of Van Nuys, who is believed to have been involved in the  drug deal, was also arrested on suspicion of murder.    Hall said Furnance and his accomplice, armed with automatic rifles, had gone to  a Sepulveda apartment complex late Sunday night ""to seek retaliation"" against a  resident apparently involved in the drug transaction.    ""The dope deal had gone sour. There was a dispute and maybe a rip-off,"" said  Hall, who described the deal as ""a small-time narcotics transaction.""      Grabbed Man and Woman    On their way into the building, the two suspects grabbed a 22-year-old man and  a 33-year woman who were talking outside. At gunpoint, the pair was ordered to  accompany the men into the unit.    ""We don't know if they kidnapped them for cover or as hostages,"" Hall said.    The gunmen, who were wearing ski masks, kicked down an apartment door, but  found the unit vacant, police said.    As they left, the gunmen, without provocation, fired at four men who were in an  alley behind the apartment complex at 8861 Langdon Ave. Two men were killed,  one was wounded, and the fourth man escaped the bullets by scrambling beneath a  car.    ""There is no motive in that shooting,"" Hall said, adding that the gunmen did  not argue with the bystanders and may have shot ""out of frustration.""    After firing at the group, the gunmen released the couple unharmed, police  said.    Police investigators determined early Monday morning that the gunmen had  invaded the wrong apartment. The resident who was the gunmen's alleged target  later told police that Furnance may have been involved in the drug deal with  Newsome, who lived in a Van Nuys apartment about three miles away, Hall said.    Police did not release the identity of the man who apparently had been targeted  for revenge. He was not arrested but was being questioned by detectives.    Two officers hid inside Newsome's apartment at 15630 Vanowen Street for several  hours Monday morning. Hall said Newsome is suspected of ""setting up"" the  retaliatory shooting.    About 9:45 a.m., Furnance entered the locked unit with a key. Police said he  was carrying the same kind of semiautomatic rifle that was used in the double  shooting.    Furnace refused an order to drop the gun, police said, and was shot in the leg  by an officer.    Police, believing that the second suspect might also be in the building,  ordered the evacuation of about 60 residents. The crowd stood for hours across  the street, watching police and trained dogs search their apartments.    A police radio dispatcher warned of a ""man with an Uzi"" inside the three-story  brown stucco complex. Police fired tear gas into a Jeep during their search for  the accomplice.    Many residents said they did not know Newsome and did not know of the stakeout  at their building until police issued the evacuation order.    ""We knew there was a problem apartment with drug-dealing going on, but that's  about it until today,"" said resident Mike Payton, 20.

Forty-five of these vehicles have been stolen so far this year in Huntington  Beach, police said Wednesday. Most are recovered a day or two later but have  been stripped of their seats and stereos. The Hyundais often are missing body  parts and radios, while the Hondas and Toyotas are missing seats and radios.    Most of the equipment is not marked, police say, making it difficult for  authorities to identify stolen property when it is recovered.

Forty-five of these vehicles have been stolen so far this year in Huntington  Beach, police said Wednesday. Most are recovered a day or two later but have  been stripped of their seats and stereos.

It was learned at the weekend the three were arrested in a  small villa on the coast north of Naples in November or December  last year and found in possession of counterfeit documents, ten  passports which had been stolen in the United States and address  books packed with the names and telephone numbers of people  resident throughout the Middle East.    The suspects were named as Echen Oyechei, 22, from Nigeria,  Barle Binda Brown, 32, who claims to come from the United  States, and Yvette Perbach, 21, from former East Germany.  Policemen from Castel Volturno, on the southern Tyrrhenian  north of Naples, took the trio into custody in a villa rented in  the names of foreign nationals, including that of Echen Oyechei.  Many of the residents of the area are members of the military  attached to the nearby NATO base and their families.    Also turned up during a search of the small villa, it was  learned at the weekend, were notes written in coded Arabic,  credit cards and other documents in the name of Italian  journalist and writer Roberto Gervasi and newspaper clippings of  reports of bombings, terrorist acts and protest demonstrations  which had occurred in the Israeli- occupied Arab territories,  especially Gaza.    Also found were maps of the centers of cities and towns on  the southern Tyrrhenian around Naples and photographs of Castel  Volturno law enforcement personnel and notes on their movements  in patrolling the area.    Oyechei declared himself a political prisoner at the time of  his arrest and, later, claimed that he was working for Israeli  intelligence on a search for a Palestinian terrorist, said the  U.S. FBI was looking for him and threatened suicide if he were  turned over to U.S. authorities.    The woman who identified herself as Barle Binda Brown  reportedly was found to speak English with a Ukrainian accent  when she was questioned in what she claimed was her native  language. Shortly before her arrest, she and the other woman  taken into custody arrived in Italy together on a flight from  Istanbul.    As investigations into the three were pursued, the Caserta  police chief, Luciano Rosini, ordered tighter surveillance and  checks of the area ahead of the Group of Seven industrialized  nations summit in Naples, on the calendar for early next month.

The reasons the police chief cited are  quite simple. During 1992 the Economic Crimes Brigade received  3,000 investigation orders and, with great efficiency, recovered  818 million pesos. In 1993 the number of investigation orders  issued by the courts did not change much, reaching 3,100. But  over 2.66 billion pesos were recovered. This means that the huge  amounts stolen through fraud had multiplied by a factor of at  least three.    Not only did the numbers grow, but so did specialization and  the use of advanced technology to falsify public documents and  instruments, not to mention the new and infrequently reported  cases of computer fraud.    In Mery's report on Tuesday, he said that Bridec [Economic  Crimes Brigade] ""is a unit that has shown a great increase in  efficiency during this period. Crimes like robberies with  intimidation or crimes involving bloodshed generally have a much  greater impact on public opinion. But white-collar criminals  cause considerable damages to the state, to development projects  that the state has to finance, and to workers who are victims of  fraud and swindling."" [passage omitted]    A few years ago, Bridec operated only in Santiago. Today it  has units in all regional headquarters, the result, a  high-ranking police official said, of ""the difficult changes in  the Chilean economy.""    Money laundering is always directly related to drugs, but it  is an eminently economic crime, for this ""black"" money comes not  only from drugs, but also from tax evasion, arms trafficking,  and hundreds of lesser crimes that produce dirty money that  needs to be laundered.    To counter this new scourge while waiting for Parliament to  enact legislation, the Investigations Police began to work on it  a year ago.    Police experts from the Antidrug Brigade and from Bridec who  will be working under the coordination of a team of attorneys  from the State Defense Council have taken courses to upgrade  their skills in England, the United States, Germany, and Italy.    Six officers, including police officers with accounting  degrees, are also in contact with foreign police agents who are  experts in money laundering. They will also have the direct  support of the FBI office that is to be set up in Chile, as well  as of the U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration].    Chile's prospects for preventing economic crimes seem  favorable. This is no place for people who want to pursue their  base designs of swindling their fellow citizens. As Nelson Mery  said, ""No matter who they may be, they will end up in jail.""  [passage omitted]     "

Another criminal named Wang Jianzhi, former party chief of  Rushan City of east China's Shandong Province, was sentenced to  death with a two-year reprieve for harboring smugglers and  taking bribes of 221,000 yuan, said Zhu Mingshan, vice-president  of the Supreme People's Court, at a press conference here today.    Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu and Liu Ning from Shandong Province  were condemned to death with political rights deprived for life  for illegally transporting 9,900 packing boxes of cigarettes,  taking bribes of 62,000 yuan, 154,000 yuan and 258,000 yuan  respectively, and offering bribes.    Liu Qishan was head of the Commerce Bureau of Rushan City,  Fan Zhanwu was political commissar of the frontier subbureau of  the Weihai Police Bureau, and Liu Ning was an officer under Fan.    Yang Mingji, a former frontier officer in coastal Zhuhai  City  of Guangdong, was sentenced to death for ordering his staff to  provide armed escorts for cigarette traffickers four times in  March last year from Macao, smuggling 2,300 packing boxes of  cigarettes, worth 5.18 million yuan, and taking escort fees of  172,000 yuan with 48,200 yuan pocketed by himself.    Zhu said the Rushan crime was committed by the Rushan  Commerce Bureau, a state organization, with smugglers and  officers of law enforcement bodies collaborating, using armed  escorts and protection from local officials.    The Rushan Commerce Bureau was fined 100,000 yuan for the  crimes of smuggling and bribing.    According to Zhu, the Rushan crime story began when the  frontier subbureau of the Weihai Police Bureau issued a  regulation contrary to existing laws in July last year. It  stipulated that state functionaries or enterprises involving  smuggling would be ""fined without having their original capital  confiscated,"" provided they ""confessed voluntarily"" to the  bureau. The frontier subbureau was surreptitiously encouraging  the Rushan Commerce Bureau to smuggle cigarettes from south  China.    Once he knew that the smuggling vessel was on the sea, Liu  ""confessed immediately"" to the Weihai Frontier Subbureau. Fan  ordered his four staff members, armed with machine guns, to  receive it.    At Liu's request, two police heads from Rushan led more than  20 staff members and three police cars to the port to meet the  vessel, to ""maintain order.""    They refused inspections by customs officers, who later left  for fear of armed conflicts. 6,900 packing boxes of cigarettes  were unloaded and sold immediately, with a portion of the  illegal cargo left behind for investigation by relevant  departments.    After being informed of the case, former Rushan City Party  Chief Wang did not press for a further probe, but covered up the  criminals' activities with false statements in ensuing  investigations.    The verdicts by the local courts of Weihai and Zhuhai have  been upheld by the higher people's courts of Shandong and  Guangdong and approved by the Supreme People's Court, the top  judge said.    Zhu said China has cracked a number of smuggling cases and  severely punished the smugglers in its anti-smuggling campaign  since last August.    He described these two cases as ""typical"" of the smuggling  wave the government is battling, with crimes characterized by  involvement of ""a considerable number"" of legal persons, such as  state agencies, organizations and enterprises, with huge amounts  of state funds siphoned off, bringing extremely harmful  consequences to the state and society.    Another feature reflected in the crimes is the collusion  between smugglers and law enforcement officers, Zhu said, adding  that such link-ups by a small number of people have played a  growing role in setting off rampant smuggle activities.    ""Local protectionism and departmental cover-ups are an  important root of the malignant and prevailing crime,"" Zhu said,  warning that ""those still adhering to such ideas will swallow  what they have sown.""    The vice-president pledged that the people's court will  continue to severely punish smugglers according to law,  especially in what he called the ""major and important"" cases, to  guarantee the progress of the country's reform, opening up, and  economic development.

Francisco Saldivar, 34, and his brother Pedro, 29, were booked on suspicion of  murder after their cousin, Mario Guzman, 39, died at Huntington Humana  Hospital. The two allegedly used their hands and feet to beat Guzman, following  an argument at 5 a.m. on Sunday, said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Bill  Peterson.    Paramedics were summoned nearly five hours after the fight, and Guzman was  treated in the hospital's intensive care unit. When his condition worsened  Monday afternoon, hospital officials called Huntington Beach police.    Guzman died in the operating room, before surgery could begin for his chest and  abdominal injuries, according to hospital spokeswoman Joyce Mulligan.    Police do not know what sparked the fight, and several witnesses -- other  relatives who shared the apartment with the brothers and Guzman -- refused to  say, according to Peterson.

Francisco Saldivar, 34, and his brother Pedro, 29, were booked on suspicion of  murder after their cousin, Mario Guzman, 39, died at Huntington Humana  Hospital. The two allegedly used their hands and feet to beat Guzman, following  an argument at 5 a.m. on Sunday, said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Bill  Peterson.    Paramedics were summoned nearly five hours after the fight, and Guzman was  treated in the hospital's intensive care unit. When his condition worsened  Monday afternoon, hospital officials called Huntington Beach police.    Guzman died in the operating room, before surgery could begin for his chest and  abdominal injuries, according to hospital spokeswoman Joyce Mulligan.    Police do not know what sparked the fight, and several witnesses -- other  relatives who shared the apartment with the brothers and Guzman -- refused to  say, according to Peterson.    An autopsy to determine the cause of death was ordered.    Francisco and Pedro Saldivar, both employed as laborers, were being held in the  Huntington Beach city jail.      Brief    "

In this situation it is very difficult to take effective  steps against ""the fingertips of the drug mafia,"" Doucha said,  pointing to the growing numbers of local consumers of drugs,  including the ""hard"" ones such as heroin and cocaine.    Last year, the police seized 3.5 kilograms of cocaine,  almost  11 kilograms of heroin, 2 kilograms of ephedrine, 3 kilograms of  morphine and 540 LSD doses. The anti-drug police discovered the  existence of 18 laboratories equipped for the home production of  drugs, particularly the ""popular"" Czech-invented pervitine,  Doucha said.    The legislative loopholes do not allow the ""operative drug  purchase"" as is possible in some states where the police can  ""arouse interest in drug sales, and detain the seller and  confiscate the drug at the moment of the sale,"" Doucha pointed  out.    He also spoke about organized crime, stressing that Czech  criminal gangs have been ever better organized and ever more  tightly integrated into international crime structures. This  trend is expected to continue in the next years, Doucha added.    ""Czech organized criminal groups target practically  everything that is profitable, from thefts of expensive  foreign-made cars, to financial frauds, to illicit trade in  drugs, fission materials and weapons, to  financially-advantageous people smuggling,"" Doucha said.    The Crime Police ""disintegrated"" in 30 operations last year  16 crime gangs, all of which included foreigners. Out of the 93  persons prosecuted, 21 were foreigners. The groups specialized  in qualified criminal activity, such as bribery, people  smuggling, murder, robbery and restraint of personal freedom.    The police seized in these operations 1.6 million crowns  (about $54,000)--264 kilogram of Czech-made Semtex explosive,  186 kilogram of perunit explosive, 1,532 electric fuses, 500  detonators, 0.6 grams of radioactive californium 252, 33  illegally possessed weapons, 10 short-wave transmitters, more  than 1,000 forged or illegally possessed passports and various  forging instruments, Doucha said.    The police also registered 17 cases of racketeering.    Foreign gangs are particularly Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese  and Italian. ""Excellent"" among them are the Russian gangs which  specialize in money laundering, racketeering, organized  prostitution, murders of uncomfortable people and illicit trade  in drugs, weapons and works of art. They bribe not only Russian  and Ukrainian, but also Czech entrepreneurs.    The mafia-type Camorra from Naples focuses on trade in ""fake  goods"", such as imitation leather and silver.    Chinese groups specializing in people smuggling combined  with  passport forging, money laundering and bribing Chinese  businessmen is no longer any ""novelty"" in the Czech Republic,  Doucha said.

The directive from the Press and Publication Administration  (PPA) requires its regional branches to cooperate with local  Public Security organs in starting a comprehensive search for  pirated books and pornographic materials.    China's publishing industry is a combination of State-owned  printing houses, of which there are about 300, and over 60,000  privately-run or collectively-run printing workshops and book  dealers. The PPA says that the private sector of the industry  is the main target of scrutiny.    Unlike large-sized publishers which have licenses to print  books, many small printing houses often break regulations in  order to make quick profits, said Huang Xiaoxin from the PPA's  distribution department.    They often illegally print best-sellers, reference works and  indecent materials.    The PPA estimates that out of the country's 100,000 new  publications each year, some 1,500 titles are pirated.    The nationwide battle against illegal and indecent  publications has been particularly successful in Hunan and  Guangdong provinces and Beijing where printing houses and  backroom printing shops have been closed down and main offenders  arrested, Huang said.    According to PPA investigations, Hunan has over 4,000 small  printing shops. In Changsha, the provincial capital, one shop  was discovered to have been distributing pornographic books.  The Guoxiao Book Shop had sold over 100,000 sexually offensive  books to other shops in 27 provinces and municipalities.    So far, 13 of the prime culprits have been arrested by  police  in connection with the Guoxiao case alone, Huang said.    Also in Hunan, a county printing house was closed down for  illegally printing 250,000 copies of the Xinhua Dictionary, the  most popular dictionary among students.    When police raided the premises some 50,000 illegal copies  were confiscated.    All those arrested for piracy in Hunan are awaiting trial,  Huang said.    Meanwhile, police in Jiangsu Province have apprehended a  35-year-old book merchant for pirating over a period of several  years.    Lu Ping, from Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, was  found to have made profits of 3 million yuan ($345,000) from his  illegal business.    Lu is now awaiting trial. If found guilty he could face the  death penalty, Huang added.    In Guangdong Province, investigators have discovered piracy  involving a novel, ""Zeng Guofan,"" which is about the famous Qing  Dynasty (1644-1911) general who put down the Heavenly Kingdom  uprisings.    Huang said that he expected more printing house closures and  arrests as the crackdown gained momentum.     "

The women, all in their early 20s, accepted rides from the man, said Long Beach  Police Sgt. C.S. Roberson. After raping them, the man dumped them out of the  car naked, leaving them in industrial sections of Long Beach.    ""(The rapist) says he is there to redeem the women in the face of God,""  Roberson said. ""That's why he cuts off their hair, to give them a cleansing  before they meet the Lord. He says the hair is a token for the devil or for  Satan.""    All of the assaults have occurred between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., Roberson said. All  of the victims are described as slender women in their early 20s with long  hair.    The first assault took place Sept. 16, when a woman was picked up near the  intersection of Long Beach Boulevard and 6th Street, Roberson said.    A second woman was raped on Sept. 21 after being given a ride near the corner  of Pacific Coast Highway and Linden Avenue. The third woman was raped Friday  after accepting a ride near the intersection of Ximeno Avenue and Pacific Coast  Highway, police said.    The victims told police that after being picked up by the man, he began to rant  about God and religion, while threatening them with an eight-inch knife. They  were taken to remote sites near the harbor, where they were raped, Roberson  said.    The suspect is described by police as a white man with blonde hair, 28 to 35  years old, and between 5 feet, 9 inches, and 5 feet, 11 inches tall. Police  said he is driving a beige Volvo with a sunroof and tinted windows.    Police are also attempting to determine if there are any links between the  rapes and the shooting death of a woman in her early 30s whose nude body was  found Sunday morning on the Carson Street underpass of the Long Beach Freeway.

Most of the calls are threatening, apparently made by right-wing extremists  with little tolerance for any criticism of Japan's millennium-and-a-half-old  emperor system, the hot line's operators say. But about a fifth of them come  from citizens who either praise the service or complain that their rights were  violated in an encounter with some of the 24,000 police officers combing Tokyo  for terrorists.    Authorities are convinced that leftist radicals will strike with some sort of  violence -- most likely bombs or rockets -- when foreign dignitaries from 150  countries, including President Bush and 54 other heads of state, descend upon  the city to attend the state funeral next Friday.      Rocket Attack Still Rankles    Police are still furious about a rocket attack that fizzled harmlessly during  the Tokyo Economic Summit of seven major industrial powers three years ago, and  they are embarrassed about a midnight bomb blast Feb. 3 that caused minor  damage at a Shinto shrine about a mile from the park where the funeral will be  held. They are taking no chances. An additional 8,000 men will soon be deployed  as part of a special force of 32,000 officers, several thousand more than at  the May, 1986, summit.    Roadblocks have been erected. Shipments of domestic air cargo will be banned  for a five-day period to prevent bombs. Traffic will be completely shut off  near the route of the funeral procession next Friday. A squadron of helicopters  and a helium-filled blimp will patrol from the sky.

""It is certain that the ultra-leftists are going to cause some trouble,"" said a  senior superintendent at the National Police Agency's security bureau, who  briefed foreign reporters Thursday on the condition his name not be printed.  ""It is necessary we take measures to protect life.""    Critics, however, say the authorities are going too far, and that their  enthusiasm for surveillance and control brings back disturbing memories of  Japan's dark days of authoritarianism, which for some Japanese is symbolized by  Emperor Hirohito, who since he died Jan. 7, has been known as the Emperor  Showa.    ""It's true that the radicals go into action when foreign leaders come to town.  There must be security measures,"" said Wataru Yoshimura, a local labor leader  in Hachioji who helped organize the hot line for complaints about police. ""But  there is no reason why ordinary citizens should be harassed.""    Yoshimura said his hot line has gotten about 400 calls since it went into  service Feb. 1. When callers do not breathe menacingly or demand to know the  office's location -- for the avowed purpose of torching it -- they tell stories  about nasty run-ins with the law.    Take the 19-year-old man from Ibaragi prefecture who was driving into Tokyo  recently when police stopped him because a number was missing from his damaged  license plate. When they demanded to search his trunk they found a wooden  martial arts sword and a fruit knife. The man was arrested on the spot,  Yoshimura said.    Mothers in Hachioji, where the imperial mausoleum is being constructed,  complain that police have banished their children from public playgrounds, he  said. Police in central Tokyo stopped a 16-year-old high school student in her  school uniform and demanded to search her bag, Yoshimura said.    Since the emperor's death six weeks ago, police have counted 974 ""ultra-left""  demonstrations against the emperor system attended by a total of 13,715 people,  the police superintendent said. This funeral security dragnet has gotten  results, too. Police arrested 68 suspected radicals on such charges as using  false names on rental contracts.    Most of them -- 51 -- were accused of belonging to Kokurokyo, or the  Revolutionary Workers' Assn., a small underground group that claimed  responsibility for bombing the shrine earlier this month. The alleged leader of  Kokurokyo's guerrilla faction, Etsuo Okazono, was nabbed on a bus while  carrying blueprints of homemade rockets and diagrams of a government  traffic-control dispatching facility, police said.      Group Lobbed Rockets    Another 17 suspects were associated with Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction,  the clandestine organization that fired rockets harmlessly over the roof of the  official guest house in the 1986 summit. A leader of the group, which police  believe has several thousand members, vowed in interviews with news agencies  earlier this month to disrupt the Showa funeral.    The senior police superintendent conceded that the radicals have probably  improved their technology since their last demonstration of homemade firepower.  Projectiles are expected to fly farther than the 2.4-mile range achieved in the  attack during the 1986 summit, and a similar gain has been made in explosive  force, he said.    But the gravest cause for vigilance is the Japanese Red Army, a band of  hardened, expatriate terrorists who began to show signs of renewed activity  over the past year or so. Red Army operatives, based in Lebanon, were linked to  the fatal bomb blast at a nightclub in Naples, Italy, last April.    Police are resigned to seeing some form of ritual violence that will disrupt  the funeral, but they are hoping to prevent any lethal action.

Security forces launched a manhunt on Sunday after General  Ra'uf Khayrat was killed by assailants who hurled a bomb at his  car in the Egyptian capital.    Three people in a car and two on a motorbike raked General  Khayrat's car with automatic gunfire late Saturday and then  lobbed the bomb before escaping, witnesses said.    The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said in a  statement to AFP it had carried out the attack ""to avenge the  most atrocious violations of human rights which Islamic  prisoners are subjected to in Egyptian prisons.""    Khayrat was the number two in the state security services,  which have been accused by human rights groups of torturing  suspected militants.    His charred body was found in the burnt-out car after the  attack in the suburb of al-Jizah on Pyramids Avenue, which  happened as the general was leaving home at the wheel of his  car, the witnesses said.    The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned on March 27 that it would  avenge what it called the ""serious violations of human rights in  Egyptian prisons,"" where the state security services interrogate  thousands of suspects.    It said it had tracked the general down even though he had  changed address several times, and used three different cars in  a bid to outwit possible assailants. [passage omitted]    Khayrat was one of the leading officials in charge of the  fight against militants who launched a terror campaign against  the government in the spring of 1992.    It was the first killing of a police general in Cairo,  though  four other police generals have been killed in southern Egypt, a  hotbed of Muslim fundamentalism.    Police launched a massive manhunt in al-Jizah, with officers  out on patrol and soldiers armed with automatic weapons posted  on all the main roads and bridges of the capital.    The motorbike and car used in the attack were found near the  general's home.    It was the worst attack in Cairo since a failed November 25  assassination bid against Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. The  authorities had since kept Islamic violence mostly confined to  the south of the country.    The Egyptian Human Rights Organisation has accused Khayrat's  services of systematically torturing suspects in Islamic  militant attacks.    More than 360 people have been killed, including 132  policemen, since the militants declared war on the secular  government of President Husni Mubarak in March 1992.     "

Although Welz is still a very good police dog, Bell said, he was beginning to  slow down and show some signs of age.

The fatal shooting is the 11th this year by San Diego police, breaking a  6-year-old record for slayings in a year.    It was also the 25th police shooting of the year. According to police records,  last year's total of 24 was the highest number of shootings since 1985.    Police said an undercover narcotics officer made a cocaine buy at an apartment  in the 4100 block of Van Dyke Avenue. He returned with other officers about 2  p.m. to serve a search warrant, and they identified themselves as police  officers. When nobody responded, the officers broke down the door with a  battering ram, police said.    Once inside, they found four men and two women. One of the men pulled out a  .22-caliber handgun, police say, and they shot him once in the chest. He was  pronounced dead at Mercy Hospital a short time later.    Homicide officers investigating the shooting did not identify the dead man or  the officers, and did not say if anyone was arrested.    They said the victim had $400 in cash and rock cocaine on him. Narcotics  officers at the scene found rock cocaine, a .22-caliber revolver and an  undisclosed amount of cash in the apartment, they said.    Wednesday's shooting will follow the normal course of investigation in  officer-involved shootings: reviews by homicide detectives, the department's  internal affairs unit, a special police board of commanders, the San Diego city  manager and the district attorney's office.    Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Wednesday night that the high number of  shootings is hardly surprising.    ""It's reflective of the times,"" he said. ""There's more narcotics and more  firepower on the street. It's a very deadly year, but this is a nationwide  trend. Every major city has experienced an increase in violence.""    Robinson said narcotics officers serving search warrants are especially  vulnerable because of the weapons drug dealers carry. He said a member of the  narcotics team was recently shot in the hand while serving a warrant.    The shooting is bound to focus new attention on the use of deadly force,  already the subject of an extensive internal department study that began in  August.    Some of the fatal shootings have been particularly controversial because the  victims had no guns. In two cases, the victims carried baseball bats. In  another, a garden trowel.    In those particular cases, civic activists and others questioned the officers'  need to fire their guns and suggested that the victims could have been subdued  in some other way.    The district attorney's office has not filed criminal charges against an  officer in six years, although it has reviewed dozens of police shootings  during that time.    Escondido Police Officer David DeLange was charged in 1984 with killing a  22-year-old office secretary who was taken hostage and shot to death while  fleeing her abductor. DeLange was acquitted.    The study of fatal shootings, initiated by Police Chief Bob Burgreen after a  series of four over three months beginning in June, is supposed to be completed  before Christmas.    Burgreen had to take over the study in September when one of his deputy chiefs  asked to step aside. Deputy Chief Mike Rice said he could no longer be part of  the group after his son, Charles, a police officer, shot and killed a man who  police said had threatened him with a stick.    Since taking over the study, Burgreen has held seven community forums on the  shootings, most of which have been poorly attended. He said he has personally  met with more than 300 police officers to seek their opinions, and department  representatives have visited 15 law enforcement agencies, including the FBI's  Virginia headquarters, the Phoenix and Kansas City police departments, and the  Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments.    A citizens police review board is examining all officer-involved shootings and  will make its findings known to the police chief and city manager.    In an interview with The Times last month, Burgreen said he was looking at new  equipment for the department and more extensive training for both rookie and  veteran officers.    Burgreen said that, although the changes will not be earth-shattering, he  believes they will have a great impact on the department.

According to the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Public  Security, on August 28 last year, police in the Jinmu District  of Chengdu Municipality learnt that a gang of people were  engaging in drug trafficking. Police were immediately sent to  track down and investigate the case after which they were joined  by another special police team, organized by the provincial,  municipal, and district public security departments, taking the  total number of policemen on the case to over 100. The case was  finally settled after over 170 days of efforts.    The drug trafficking gang was made up of illegal elements  from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong. Since the first half of  1992, these criminals, acting in league with overseas drug  traffickers, had conducted drug trafficking and smuggling  activities on several occasions, making profits of several  millions of renminbi.    In this case, the police also confiscated five imported  luxury cars, over 1 million renminbi, and a number of weapons,  ammunition, and equipment for drug processing.     "

He was 52.    Police and Fire Department officials responded to calls from a neighbor, who  said she heard a loud crash followed by Briglio's pleas for help, Police Sgt.  George Verbeck said. Firefighters located Briglio under the pile of lumber in a  back room of the house, Verbeck said. Power saws were needed to cut through the  lumber and extract Briglio, who died about an hour after arrival at Garfield  Hospital.    Briglio served as mayor from Feb. 9 to Dec. 14, 1987. In Monterey Park, City  Council members are appointed to the office of mayor on a rotation basis.    Briglio's term on the City Council lasted from April 10, 1984, to April 12,  1988, during which he survived a recall effort initiated by opponents who  differed with Briglio over real estate development issues. He lost his bid for  reelection in a campaign that featured heated debate over the development issue  as well as the city's changing ethnic makeup.

GOMEZ and WENDY PAULSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      SAN CLEMENTE      Local law enforcement investigators, with the aid of the Orange County district  attorney's gang detail, have arrested an Oceanside man in connection with a  Christmas Eve drive-by shooting that left a 4-year-old girl hospitalized.    Floyd Avery, 18, described by acquaintances as an unemployed high school  dropout, was arrested at his mother's home at 2 p.m. Thursday, police officials  said. He has no prior criminal record.    Avery's arrest was made public on Friday after police arrested a San Juan  Capistrano juvenile and named another who was already being held in Orange  County Juvenile Hall on an unrelated charge, San Clemente Police Chief Albert  C. Ehlow said.    In addition, police said they have recovered a shotgun believed to have been  used in the shooting.    Avery, who moved to Oceanside from San Clemente almost two years ago, was  charged with attempted murder and shooting at an occupied dwelling, Ehlow said.  He was being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.    The two juveniles, whose names were withheld, face similar charges, according  to Ehlow.    ""We put a lot of work into this,"" Ehlow said, adding that the investigation is  continuing. ""We're still trying to sort things out.""    Despite the involvement of the district attorney's gang unit, police and  investigators for the Orange County Sheriff's Department maintained on Friday  that they are not sure if the shooting was gang-related.    ""We're getting a lot of conflicting stories,"" Ehlow said. ""Until we get it  straightened out, we won't know if it's gang-related. It could be a personal  thing.""    The shooting victim, Prisca Lorena Caudillo, was hit in the face and upper body  by shotgun pellets as she was playing on the porch of a neighbor's second-floor  apartment in the 100 block of Avenida Pelayo.    She was released on Dec. 28 from Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in  Mission Viejo.    The family was unavailable for comment Friday.    Police initially had speculated that the shooting was the result of a feud  between two gangs -- the San Clemente Varrio Chico and the San Juan Boys, also  called the SJC Boys.    But law enforcement officials later said that they had no proof that the  shooting -- the first of its type in South County -- was linked to gang  activity.    Ehlow confirmed that the two juvenile suspects, both 17 and Latino, were San  Juan Capistrano residents. But he declined to say if the two were members of  the SJC Boys.    Assistant Dist. Atty. Martin Engquist said that the gang unit was asked to aid  in the investigation at the request of the San Clemente Police Department.    ""We got involved because there was an indication that there was group  involvement,"" Engquist said. But like other law enforcement officials, he was  reluctant to say that the shooting was the result of gang activity.      Called 'Sleepy'    Meanwhile, Avery's former classmates in Oceanside, who said Avery wore thick  glasses and was nicknamed ""Sleepy,"" expressed mixed feelings about the arrest.    While some said that they believed Avery was capable of committing such a  crime, others defended him, saying he was ""mellow and friendly"" and spent a lot  of time with his girlfriend and 1-year-old daughter.    ""He was probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" said David Rivera,  21, as he stood with a group of friends in a park near Avery's home.    ""I don't think he would have pulled a trigger,"" Rivera added.    Acquaintances described Avery as a quiet person and one who did not pick  fights. Although not a gang member himself, he often hung around with known  gang members in the neighborhood around the high school and often visited  friends in South County.    ""He's like a home boy,"" said one 16-year-old girl who asked not to be  identified. ""He was not part of a gang. He just hung around with some gang  members.""    Avery's mother, visibly shaken by her son's arrest, declined to be interviewed  or give her first name.    ""I don't want to talk about it,"" she said, holding back tears before going back  into her modest, single-story home located in an older section of the city.    Police would not give details of the connection between Avery and the San Juan  Capistrano juveniles who were arrested on Friday.    ""We believe they know each other,"" Ehlow said. ""We're not certain what the  relationship is.""    Sgt. Richard Downing said that investigators believe that the two juveniles  were with Avery in his car when the shots were fired on Christmas Eve.    Suspects believed to be riding in two other cars are still at large, Downing  said.    One of the other cars, a 1978 Buick, was found abandoned along Interstate 5 in  Capistrano Beach shortly after the shooting, police said. It was later found to  be stolen in Los Angeles.    On the night of the shooting, Avery reported that his light-blue, 1973 Datsun  had been stolen ""somewhere on Camino de los Mares"" in San Clemente, police  said.    Two days later, Avery's car was found, stripped down, off San Juan Creek Road  in south San Juan Capistrano, Lt. Bob Rivas said. He would not, however, say  what evidence was in the car that may have linked it to the shooting and  Avery's arrest.    Ehlow said police were tipped off to the location of the weapon believed to  have been used in the attack.    A 20-gauge, pump-action shotgun was found buried in the back yard of a San Juan  Capistrano residence. Police declined to give the address, saying that other  suspects were still being sought in the investigation.    Ehlow said it was not likely that residents at the home where the shotgun was  found were involved with the shooting.

TV pictures showed helicopters and transport aircraft landing heavily-armed troops in Medelln and the surrounding area of Antioquia Province where Escobar is believed to be hiding. President Cesar Gaviria has blamed Escobar for a campaign of car bombings that have killed over 40 people in Medelln and Bogota in the past two months, but claimed last week that security forces were finally closing in on him. Escobar escaped from jail last July during a bungled operation to transfer him to a more secure prison. Despite a reward of Dollars 6.7m (Pounds 4.7m), one of the highest ever offered by a government for the capture of a criminal, he has remained at large. A senior police officer said army commander Gen Hernan Jose Guzman and deputy National Police director Octavio Vargas Silva had arrived in Medellin to direct the operation. Deputy Prosecutor-General Francisco Sintura also flew in amid tight security, leading some to speculate that Escobar may be intending to surrender.   Countries:-  COZ  Colombia, South America.

Street cops, sometimes. Not homicide  investigators.    ""We're not exposed to the same degree of danger that patrol officers deal  with,"" said Detective Rick Swanston. He spent eight years working Hollywood  homicide under Kuster, slain Tuesday night in a gun battle in a Hollywood  restaurant. ""We usually know what we're dealing with. Folks who get hurt on the  job, they usually don't know the seriousness of the situation they're getting  into.""    Homicide detectives are supposed to come in when the gunfire is over, put  together the evidence and nail the bad guy. Then, after a long career of  strange, frustrating hours, of cases closed and murders unsolved, they are  supposed to collect a pension.    ""Everybody wants to do their time and retire,"" said Detective Leroy Orozco, a  28-year veteran of the force, 24 years in homicide. Kuster had been a friend  for more than 20 years. ""Then you can all get together, a bunch of old (guys)  talking about the old days.""    Detective jobs are coveted in police work, and none is more coveted than a job  in homicide. Kuster's generation has witnessed technical advances such as  computerized records and DNA fingerprinting, but detectives have also seen the  growing menace of drugs, gangs and high-powered weaponry.    In the end, Kuster wound up a victim of the sort of seemingly random violence  that plagues Los Angeles. He is now part of the 1990 body count that is on a  pace to exceed the city's record for homicides -- 1,028 in 1980. As of Sept.  30, 762 slayings had been recorded within city limits.    Like every other Los Angeles murder case, Kuster is now the subject of a  three-ring binder notebook in which homicide detectives assemble interviews and  evidence. Above Kuster's desk hangs a sign that says:     Hollywood Homicide     Our Day Begins When Yours Ends    According to investigators, Kuster was in the cocktail lounge at a favorite  hangout, the Hilltop Hungarian Restaurant in the Hollywood Hills, when the man  with the 9-millimeter pistol equipped with laser sights came in, terrifying the  patrons. So Kuster identified himself as a police officer and tried to calm the  man. The gunman fired four rounds at Kuster.    As Kuster went down, mortally wounded, he managed to fire seven rounds at his  killer, striking him three times.    The homicide detective thus solved his own murder.    The assailant was identified as Bela Istvan Marko, 37, a native of Hungary who  lived in Las Vegas. That, too, proved ironic. Hollywood detectives had arrested  him in 1982 in the fatal shooting of his roommate. Kuster signed the paper  work. Marko had claimed self-defense and the district attorney chose not to  file charges. Police said there is no connection between Marko's earlier arrest  and the shoot-out Tuesday night.    Retired homicide detective Hank Petroski was one of the detectives who  investigated the 1982 shooting. Petroski had partnered with Kuster both in  patrol and in homicide, and worked under his command before retiring this year  after 25 years with the LAPD.    ""You understand some guys are going to get off, the D.A. is not going to file  on others. It's frustrating but you can't let it bother you so much you can't  do your job,"" said Petroski.    ""If end result is the arrest, you're happy. It's not only satisfaction of work  done, but relief for the surviving family members,"" Orozco said. ""But then the  torture really starts because of our court system. . . . That's the toughest  part of the job, getting into the court system and dealing with the b.s.""    Kuster's slaying wouldn't get that far. Detectives wept at Hollywood Division  on Tuesday night. One of Kuster's men broke down at a press conference  Wednesday. At other divisions, detectives felt the loss as well.    ""We've got guys here with tears in their eyes,"" Lt. John Zorn of the  robbery-homicide bureau at Parker Center said on Wednesday morning. ""They've  known him for a long time.""    Kuster had put in 24 years on the force, his last 12 as a supervising detective  in Hollywood homicide.    ""He was the best supervisor I ever had,"" said Swanston, who now heads the  homicide unit in the West Valley Division. ""He was very fair. . . . He demanded  a lot from you, but he had a tendency to get the best out of his men.""    Petroski, who now works as an insurance investigator, said Kuster had told him  he was going to work one more year and retire.

0,FT944-17445 ,"FT944-17445 _AN-EJIA1AAUFT 941008   FT  08 OCT 94 / Commuter anger explodes      By REUTER      BOMBAY   Stranded Indian commuters went on a rampage yesterday, burning railway carriages, looting shops and attacking buses after a derailed train halted peak-hour traffic into Bombay. Irate commuters attacked railway property at about 11 suburban railway stations, beating up railway staff, burning furniture and stealing cash from ticket offices. At least 34 people were taken to hospital, including 20 railway staff. Police opened fire at Bhayandar to quell angry mobs, and used batons elsewhere to try to maintain order. Police said at least 70 buses were damaged, while 10 carriages of a train were set ablaze. Passengers pulled out the seats from another train and made them into a bonfire. More than 500 suburban trains were cancelled because of the day-long violence. Hundreds of commuters squatted on the tracks blocking trains into the evening. Railway staff said train services would be disrupted for at least 48 hours because of the violence and damage. It was the fourth time since July that violent commuters had attacked railway property following the disruption of services. Bombay's suburban railways carry more than three million commuters a day into the banking and commercial centre.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 21-year-old Ocean Beach man was shot and killed Thursday by one of the two  San Diego Police officers who were attempting to arrest him on an assault  charge.    Police said the suspect attacked the officers with a pair of martial arts  nunchakus he had taken from one of them. The suspect was the ninth person to be  slain by San Diego police so far this year.    Witnesses to the shooting disputed the officers' account and questioned whether  it was necessary for police to use deadly force in the incident, the second  time this week that San Diego police have killed a suspect.    Police gave this description of Thursday's events:    Officers John Cain and Detective Ron Featherly, both of whom have shot and  killed suspects before, prepared to arrest Anthony Tumminia outside his West  Point Loma Drive apartment on an assault charge at about 9 a.m. when he became  violent.    They walked Tumminia from his apartment to his red Toyota pickup truck to find  a steering wheel locking device, which allegedly had been used in the assault.    Police could not say whether they found such a device or whether they had a  search warrant. Nor did they have any details about the alleged assault.    But, when Cain and Featherly began to arrest Tumminia, he resisted, grabbed  Cain's nunchakus and struck both men.    Cain fired a single shot into Tumminia's chest. He was pronounced dead at UC  San Diego Medical Center at 9:55 a.m.    In interviews with The Times, two witnesses disputed the police account and  said they saw no nunchakus used by the victim.    Michele Hatfield, 21, who lives across the street from the restaurant parking  lot where the shooting occurred, said the officers stood on either side of  Tumminia and held him face down, with his hands behind his back. She said  Featherly, dressed in a suit, was kicking Tumminia in the ribs at the time.    They flipped Tumminia on his back, Hatfield said, and he began to rise.  Tumminia stood up, and either pushed or hit Featherly, she said. He backed up  two steps, apparently about to run, when Cain fired.    She said Tumminia had no weapon at the time he was shot.    ""It happened like it was in slow motion,"" she said. ""The last thing I could  think of was that Tony was going to get shot. You're not supposed to resist  arrest, but they could have done something else.""    Debbie Tehan of Hillcrest was driving to a martial-arts class about 9:20 a.m.  when she passed the restaurant parking lot. She said the officers had Tumminia  pinned, and he was screaming at the same time the burglar alarm in his truck  was wailing. She said she did not see a weapon in his hand from about 25 yards  away.    ""I don't think (the shooting) was justified,"" she said. ""I feel there are other  ways of handling someone's anger.""    After the shooting, a pair of black polycarbonate nunchakus, which all officers  are required to carry, were lying on the ground next to Tumminia.    Cain, 29, has been a patrol officer 1 1/2 years. He shot and killed an alleged  purse snatcher in February after the man started to point an unloaded  .22-caliber pistol at him. The district attorney cleared Cain in that shooting.    Featherly, 30, a seven-year veteran, fatally shot 25-year-old Chip Doonan of  Clairemont in January, 1988, an action Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller severely  criticized while also clearing him of legal wrongdoing.    Doonan had been carrying a pellet gun under his arm. When Featherly told him,  ""Put your hands up,"" it was his first warning to a startled Doonan, who reached  for the gun, uttering ""It's . . . "" before Featherly shot him, according to the  D.A.'s report. Doonan finished his sentence as he started to fall: "" . . . only  a BB gun.""    The report said Featherly was ""visibly shaken"" during the district attorney's  interview. In his report, Miller concluded that Doonan's death was ""a needless  tragedy. The officers did nothing to alert Doonan to a police presence. They  didn't call out to him or question those in the residence as to who he was.""    Miller rejected the Doonan family's assertion that police had been harassing  Doonan for years.    In 1985, Featherly also shot and wounded a robbery suspect who had shot at him  during a car chase.    Neither Cain nor Featherly was seriously hurt in the scuffle with Tumminia.    Tumminia, whom friends described as a health-conscious body-builder, lost his  job as a Domino's pizza deliverer on Voltaire Street two weeks ago after  getting into a fistfight with a customer, said Chris Peters, who was an  assistant manager at the store.    Neighbors remembered Tumminia as friendly, good with kids, and seemingly unable  to work himself into the violent frenzy of which he is accused.    ""I can't picture Tony as the type to resist arrest,"" said Michelle Warren, a  neighbor who heard the gunfire and saw police standing over Tumminia with guns  drawn. ""He was just a young kid starting out.    ""Even if he took the nunchakus from a cop's belt, I can't see getting shot in  the chest.""    Thursday's events once again raised questions about the number of times San  Diego police officers have been involved in shootings -- 21 times so far this  year, nine of them fatal. Last year, there were 24 police shootings, the  highest ever for San Diego police in the last six years. In 1988, there were 10  fatal shootings by police.    ""There is not a wave of police shootings, just a series of incidents that have  to be looked at individually,"" Deputy Chief Ken Fortier said Thursday. ""I know  the public is concerned. So are we. But officers are lawfully permitted to  shoot if their lives are in danger.""    Mayor Maureen O'Connor told a gathering of reporters Thursday that she had no  answers.    ""I'm as alarmed as everyone else,"" she said after a speech. ""We have to come up  with some solution. It's clear this has become a recurring event.""    Police Chief Bob Burgreen last month ordered a task force to analyze the  department's use of deadly force, from a review of training and textbooks to  the scrutiny of similar-sized agencies throughout the country.    He requested the review in response to three specific controversial shootings,  two of which involved lethal force on men wielding baseball bats and the other  a cement trowel. The district attorney's office has ruled on the trowel case  and one of the baseball bat shootings, saying the officers in both cases acted  in self-defense.    On Tuesday, police shot and killed a man armed with a 3-foot long wooden garden  stake.    The shootings have not been limited to the San Diego Police Department. Last  Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol Agent fatally shot an undocumented alien who the  agent said had hit him with a rock. Some witnesses said the man had thrown no  rocks.    Times staff writers Armando Acuna and Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed to this  report.
