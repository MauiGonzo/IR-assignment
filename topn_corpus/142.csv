Political observers deem the visits as ""very important"" and  in line with bilateral interests for further strengthening of  political, economic and cultural ties as well as regional and  international cooperation.    In the pre-revolution era, Africa was ignored by the shah's  regime which had ties with only certain African countries such  as the racist South African regime. However, the following the  triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1079, Iran severed its  relations with the racist South African regime upon the orders  of the father of the Islamic revolution the late Imam Khomeini,  and expanded its ties with sub-Saharan African countries.    Islamic Republic of Iran now has established ties with 20  African countries at the ambassadorial level and ""very sincere""  relations with many others, but is yet to develop healthy  economic ties with them.    The six African countries which Velayati is to visit are  rich  in gold, diamonds, silver, bauxite, zinc, iron, copper, tin and  cobalt as well as in such agricultural products as coffee,  cocoa, tea, rice, cotton, sugar cane and pineapple.    Iran can have favourable cooperation with the said countries  and can invest in their mineral and agricultural sectors in  favour of common interests.    However, Iran has no direct aerial and marine transportation  links with the said countries to promote economic cooperation.    Contrary to Iran, the European Community, U.S., Japan and  even the Zionist regime have embarked on economic investments in  sub-Saharan Africa unilaterally to plunder the rich natural  resources of the deprived continent.

In a statement issued after a meeting in London with President F W de Klerk, Mr Major said South Africa was 'firmly on the road towards full, non-racial democracy'. 'The progress made within South Africa has opened the way for her to take her place in the international community,' he said. 'The question of South Africa's relationship with the Commonwealth will be one for a future South African government and for the Commonwealth as a whole to decide.' South Africa became a republic and withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961. Mr de Klerk arrived in Britain earlier in the day from Washington, where he called for international financial aid and corporate investment to develop fully South Africa's natural resources and help move the country toward a multiracial democracy. Mr Major backed Mr de Klerk's call for investment, saying: 'We shall support lending by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to South Africa. I warmly welcome the lifting of economic sanctions. The South African economy has huge potential. Outside help to regenerate it and create more jobs will be vital to the transitional process.'

""The estimated 5.4 million refugees in Africa are evidence of  the suffering.

'There is an awareness that South Africa is a promising market,' says Mr Sota Sakai, manager of the Middle East and Africa Section at Marubeni, the trading house. 'But when it comes to investment, this is like a marriage so it will take more time to reach that point,' he notes. While Japan was South Africa's fourth largest trading partner in 1990 after West Germany, Great Britain and the US, due to international sanctions there has been no Japanese direct investment in South Africa for at least the past 10 years, the ministry of finance says. The political situation is still a strong concern. The Japan Bond Research Institute, gave South Africa a 5.9 general rating in its latest July report, which was up from 5.4 in January and 4.0 in January, 1989. The Institute attributed the higher ranking to the positive aspects of the government's fiscal and monetary policies as well as enhanced international trust in South Africa. Geography is also a problem. 'Japan is not that internationalised yet,' explains Mr Sakai. Japanese businesses also believe that the entire business environment in South Africa needs to be improved before the country can expect to see a significant influx of investment from Japan. Greater communication between the two countries is also necessary before Japanese businesses are likely to feel comfortable with the idea of investing in South Africa. For much the same reasons, there is little interest in Japan in South Africa's capital markets. Meanwhile, the activities of Japanese banks with regard to South Africa have been frozen since the country declared a debt standstill in 1985. It is believed that no new lending will be forthcoming from banks, Japanese or other, until that situation is resolved.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

All G-7 members-states, including Japan  and the United States, which had earlier objected to this,  agreed to such a modification of the previous formula ""seven  plus one"", under which the Russian leader met G-7 leaders after  the programme of the G-7 summit was comleted, the TOKYO SHIMBUN  said today with reference to sources from the Japanese  Government.    The political discussion is expected to focus on the  situation on the Korean peninsula, in connection with suspicions  that North Korea is involved in the development of nuclear  weapons, the Bosnian crisis, the progress of peaceful  settlement in the Middle East, war in Yemen and the situation in  South Africa following presidential elections. The problem of  North Korea might be brought up in light of strengthening the  regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons not only in asia,  but in the whole world.    Russia's problem will be discussed only at an economic  conference of G-7 leaders. The discussion is expected to focus  on the expansion of the framework of aid to Russia as it  switches over to the market economy.    Joint measures taken by the G-7 countries in combating  organised crime in the world are expected to be high on the  agenda of the economic conference, and in particular, preventing  the practice of money laundering by drug dealers and drug  trafficking.    The TOKYO SHIMBUN newspaper pointed out that Russia's  participation would make some corrections in final documents of  the Naples summit.

Mr Ryrie, speaking at a conference chaired by Mr Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank, said achieving the target figure of 15 per cent of GDP was 'doubtful at best'. 'In most countries, even with the best will and the best policies, it will probably be the first decade of the 21st century before we begin to see real results - that is to say steadily rising private investment, sustained higher rates of growth and job creation', he added. Mr Ryrie said the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, was investing approximately Dollars 200m a year in about 35 companies in sub-Saharan Africa. He estimated that projects in which the IFC had recently participated accounted for around 10 per cent of total private investment, domestic and foreign, in the region. Much of the IFC finance has gone into a few large investments, he acknowledged. 'What is lacking is a flow of medium-sized investments in manufacturing businesses,' Mr Ryrie said. He said private investment in sub-Saharan Africa has been running at about Dollars 8bn a year, with foreign private investment contributing less than Dollars 1bn a year. Net official development assistance to the region between 1980-89 had been Dollars 105bn, or about Dollars 30 per capita each year. He said the flow of aid had 'no parallel in history' but standards of living had continued to fall.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT933-5761 ,"FT933-5761 _AN-DIAB3AGJFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (11): In search of a kick-start - Private sector      By TONY HAWKINS   ONE of the most important challenges facing Africa in the 1990s is that of kickstarting the private sector. But as Sir William Ryrie, retiring executive vice-president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), says, Africa is the only region in the developing world where public sector investment exceeds that of private enterprise. More than half the region's investment is funded from aid. This low level of private investment cannot be attributed to a shortage of entrepreneurship, says Sir William, noting that since the African Project Development Facility was launched in 1986, over 2,000 entrepreneurs have sought its assistance, The IFC - the World Bank group's private sector arm - has launched four main initiatives in the region: More than 23 governments have been advised by the IFC's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) on how to attract direct investment from abroad. The IFC itself has invested in large energy sector projects in Cameroon and Nigeria and in the Ashanti Gold Mine in Ghana. Much is expected from small enterprise development programmes, seen as a partial solution to the region's escalating unemployment problem and also as an area where Africa has comparative advantage. In Ghana, for example, small enterprise accounts for more than 80 per cent of manufacturing employment. Access to finance is probably the main constraint on small firm expansion and the IFC's African Enterprise Fund targets its lending and investment activities on small businesses, funding some 58 projects in 18 countries since its inception. The IFC has assisted 10 countries in privatisation programmes, though progress has been slow. The fourth initiative is fostering capital market development. The World Bank's private sector programme has a broadly similar focus. Initially, its support for private sector development targeted infrastructural investment to complement industrial and agricultural projects. This changed in the 1980s as the Bank focused on specific obstacles to private sector growth, launching its Private Sector Development Programme in 1989, with three main objectives - creating an enabling business environment, restructuring the public sector and promoting financial sector development. In the 18 months to mid-1992, it financed 42 projects in 24 sub-Saharan countries. In addition to its support of privatisation, the Bank is working to strengthen the role of the state through capacity-building and institution-building investments. In the financial sector, its main task has been regulatory reform, including liberalising interest rates, allied with institutional reform including restructuring ailing banks, and establishing appropriate systems for prudential regulation and bank supervision. Yet there remain formidable obstacles. In Kenya, for example, a study found that the average company needs 15 licences a year to operate, taking some 223 staff hours to acquire. Backhanders add 66 per cent to legal fees while total costs including 'irregular charges' amounted to more than a fifth of incremental profits. Given the scepticism over an early return of foreign investment, the donors are right to bang the small enterprise drum. But in a world where retailers and consumers want increasingly sophisticated quality products, and where modern technology and scale economies demand heavy investment, it is difficult to see small business playing more than a residual role.

0,FT931-7991 ,"FT931-7991 _AN-DBVBWABBFT 930222   FT  22 FEB 93 / ANC sanctions plea until poll date set      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   THE African National Congress yesterday relaxed its policy on economic sanctions against South Africa, but said sanctions should remain until a date is set for multi-racial elections. This cannot be done until multi-party negotiations yield agreement on a range of difficult issues, including basic principles for a new constitution, the re-incorporation of nominally independent black homelands and multi-party control of the security forces. Agreement on an election date is likely to take several months, although swift progress in multi-party talks, due to begin next month, could bring agreement sooner. The ANC yesterday imposed several linked conditions for the lifting of sanctions, apart from an election date: a multi-party council must be established to oversee the government, with subsidiary councils to supervise elections and the state-run broadcasting corporation, and the existing constitution must be amended. Once these steps are taken, the ANC would call for trade, investment, financial and diplomatic sanctions to be lifted, but the international arms and oil embargoes would remain in place. Such a move would boost the business mood in South Africa, but would have little effect on private investment, with domestic and foreign investors more concerned about prospects for political stability and economic discipline under a multi-racial government. A resumption of lending by multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund would be the biggest benefit from an end to sanctions. The IMF might make funds available immediately through its compensating financing facility, designed to reimburse member countries for an unexpected shortfall in export receipts or for a rise in imports. However, South Africa could not seek balance of payments support until its current account was in deficit. It was around R4.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in surplus last year. Since the mid-1980s, South Africa has been forced to run a substantial current account surplus to cover foreign debt repayments, since international banks halted new lending to the republic. Capital outflows since 1985 have totalled over R40bn. ANC officials hope that lifting sanctions would prompt a surge of foreign investment and boost its chances of victory in the first multi-racial elections. At the weekend, ANC leader Nelson Mandela appealed for R130m for the organisation's election campaign. Meanwhile, Mr FW de Klerk, the President, tried to tackle his government's racist image in advance of elections, by appointing two coloureds (mixed race) and one Indian to his cabinet in minor positions. However he also appointed a noted hardliner, Mr Kobie Coetzee, to the sensitive position of Minister of Defence.   Companies:-  African National Congress (South Africa).

Already a lot of international aid has been  pledged to South Africa. America alone has promised $600  million. Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor and a country with  its own experience of racial division, is one of the countries  most likely to lose out in the battle for international aid.  President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is in London on a state  visit, and Julian Marshall asked him if Zimbabwe was now  competing with South Africa for international aid.    [Begin recording] [Mugabe] Some competition is inevitable,  and after all why shouldn't there be competition? If South  Africa will have that investment, well and good, but there are  also forms of investment which, because of the advantage that we  have over South Africa, will come our way. Anyway, we can say  that today as things stand, we are more peaceful and stable than  South Africa, that we have had areas of greater development and  progress than South Africa because of the problems they have  had, and that this gives us here in some way and some areas that  needed advantage.    [Marshall] How important is the white population in Zimbabwe  -- I am thinking particularly of white farmers -- to the  continued prosperity of the country?    [Mugabe] Very important. We still need commercial farming,  and don't forget that commercial farming has to do with just  more than production of food. We need cash crops; we need  greater productivity in the commercial sector so we can compete.  So, apart from the fact that we need more land from the  commercial sector, and how acquiring this land is going to  affect some of the farmers, apart from that problem, there is no  other problem. Really, the commercial farmer, I mean, the white  commercial farmer, is a happier person in Zimbabwe.    [Marshall] So, you do intend to continue with the process of  the equitable redistribution of land?    [Mugabe] It is equity we are aiming at -- land which must  come into the possession of the peasant community -- so that the  peasant community has a resource and asset for the improvement  of their economic position.    [Marshall] So, finally, given the experience of the white  population in Zimbabwe in 14 years of independence, what is your  message to the white people in South Africa?    [Mugabe] Our message is that they should look at how and why  community in Zimbabwe -- white and black community -- have  reconciled to each other, and I am glad that President Mandela  has pronounced the policy of national reconciliation and  national unity as guidelines for the people of South Africa, and  I hope they do respond to his call in a social and economic way,  reacting to it positively, trying to work together with the  majority of the people in South Africa, and trying also to  enhance the lot of the poor in their country. That way, there  will be greater harmony and greater stability, and the whites in  South Africa needn't fear of any repercussions, any policies of  retributions in the future -- if this happened.

United States Vice-President Al Gore,  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, Palestinian Liberation  Organisation Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, Tanzanian founding  President Julius Nyerere and more than 80 other leaders arrived  to heap praise on South Africa and its people.    Heading a 65-strong U.S. delegation, the most senior to  visit  South Africa, Mr Gore said the moment was historic not only for  South Africa but for all mankind. The inauguration of African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela marked a transition in  the history of the world, he said. The U.S. civil rights  movement and the struggle for democracy in South Africa were  historically intertwined with both countries sharing the spirit  of the fight for full democracy. ""And so the people of the  United States rejoice with the people of South Africa. We look  forward towards starting a new and more vigorous relationship.  We see the inauguration tomorrow (Tuesday) of Mr Mandela as the  beginning of a partnership between our two countries."" Included  in the us delegation was first lady Hilary Clinton, Mr Gore's  wife Tipper, the Rev Jesse Jackson and U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ron Brown.    On his arrival, Mr Hurd said there has been a huge upsurge  in  British business interest in South Africa. He said he was in  the country to show Britain's support for a new South Africa and  was going directly from the airport to visit British-aided  projects in the East Rand townships.    Croatian Prime Minister Mr Nikica Valentic said South Africa  had shown it was possible to satisfy diverse interests in a  positive way. ""We are a country that has emerged from war. The  message (from South Africa) is political solutions have to be  sought by peaceful means,"" he said.    Former British prime minister Lord James Callaghan said  South  Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he  had a message for this country, Lord Callaghan said: ""South  Africa is going to work out its own destiny.""    Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the struggle  against apartheid had few parallels in modern history. ""We are  confident that under Mr Mandela's sagacious leadership the scars  of the past will soon heal and the goal of peace and development  will be achieved.""    The diminutive Mr Arafat, wearing his traditional black and  white keffiyeh, said he brought greetings from the Palestinian  people ""and best wishes for my brother and friend President  Mandela...and Mr (F W) de Klerk"". He was greeted by ANC  representative Stanley Mabisela who held the PLO leader's hand  as the large delegation strode into the airport building.    Mr Nyerere, once a crusader against colonialism and a  long-time enemy of Pretoria, said he had always wanted to come  to a free South Africa. ""I never believed it would come. But  here it is.""    Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman, who was asked if  his country would be investing in South Africa, said Bangladesh  had no money to invest ""but we will share our knowledge"".    On his arrival, Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen praised  the demise of apartheid as ""a victory for humanity"" and pledged  R375 million [rand] in aid for South Africa's transition. He  said he hoped the two countries would exchange ""experiences"",  expecially in the labour market, and he extended a formal  invitation to Mr Mandela to visit Denmark. The Danish national  soccer team, European champions in 1992, were scheduled to visit  South Africa in 1995, Mr Rasmussen announced. ""This is a most  happy moment in Danish international politics. (It) is the fall  of the Berlin Wall...in human terms...a victory for humanity.""    From Syria to the Bahamas, Italy, Slovakia, Georgia, Malta,  Iran, Malaysia, the Philippines and Romania they continued to  pour into Jan Smuts from dawn and into the night. Other  notables included the Irish President Mary Robinson, Greek King  Constantine and Mr Abdul Rahman Taib who is the Industry  Minister of Brunei, the richest country per capita in the world.  Also among them were European Union Chairman T Pangalos,  Portuguese president Dr Mario Soares, French first lady  Danniella Mitterand, Spanish heir apparent Prince Asturias and  Finland President Mr Martii Ahtisaari [name and title as  received] who is credited with brokering Namibian independence.  The presidents of Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, as  well as Lesotho King Letsie III, were due to arrive later in the  night.    The prize for the biggest present went to the Philippines --  a four-foot square box in colourful wrapping paper and ribbon  reportedly containing shoes for Mr Mandela.    By 6PM there was still no news of the expected appearance of  Libyan Chief Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or Cuban leader Fidel Castro.  A Cuban aircraft arrived early on Monday but apparently it was  carrying only cigars.

Testifying to the accuracy of such predictions, South Africa's economic record over the past 10 years has been dismal, averaging growth of less than 1 per cent a year. At the same time, triggered by the combination of sustained political unrest, the loss of international confidence, and gross economic mismanagement by the government, inflation and government spending soared while investment, domestic savings and overall business confidence plunged. Now that the political side of the equation has finally been resolved, however, there is widespread optimism in the country that the economic challenges can be tackled with equal success. And with political change fortuitously coinciding with an upturn in the global business cycle, there is a widespread belief that South Africa can become an economic engine capable not only of pulling millions of its own citizens out of the mire of poverty, but acting as a catalyst for renewed growth in the region as well. Unfortunately, however, the situation is not that simple. The distorted policies of the apartheid era have left a deep-seated and destructive economic legacy that will take years to resolve. The crucial problem remains government spending, which accounted for 21 per cent of GDP over the first half of 1994 - a figure double the norm in most developing Asian economies. This extraordinarily high level of government involvement in the economy causes other problems, too. Funding the budget deficit, expected to be 6.6 per cent of GDP, diverts money from new fixed investment while continued spending by government intensifies inflationary pressures. The high level of government borrowing also means that gross domestic saving in the economy, essential to help fund new development, is at only 16 per cent of GDP. Compounding the problem is the fact that the economy remains overwhelmingly dependent on commodity exports, which account for some 71 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Although the government has been trying for some years to switch the focus to manufactured goods, it remains hampered by the fact that South Africa's economy is still highly protected, and many of its enterprises uncompetitive by global standards. In addition, the maintenance of a relatively expensive workforce with a low skills base acts as a further obstacle to development. In an international competiveness survey released by the World Economic Forum this month South Africa ranked 35th out of 41 countries and came last in the 'people' category, assessing the educational and training levels of the general populace. Despite all this, however, the underlying fact remains that the economic outlook for South Africa is better than it has been for decades. Growth this year is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, below the more optimistic forecasts made at the beginning of the year, but still up on 1993's 1.1 per cent, which itself followed four years of painful recession. Next year the figure is expected to reach between 3.5-4 per cent. The consensus among most economists is that provided the government sticks to conservative fiscal and monetary policies, South Africa is capable of continuing to generate domestic growth of around 3.5 per cent for the next five years. But to achieve more than that, a significant inflow of foreign investment, bringing with it exposure to new international skills and technology denied to the country during its years of isolation, is desperately needed. So far, the first condition seems to be met. Despite the immense political pressures on the ruling African National Congress to provide the populace with tangible benefits following the demise of apartheid, it has successfully resisted the temptation to undertake high spending, populist policies that would further destroy the economy's fragile base. Indeed, in its public statements to date, including the June budget, the government has been a model of fiscal probity, stressing its commitment to reducing the budget deficit and promising to fund its centrepiece reconstruction and development programme through savings rather than new borrowing. And while inflation may be rising, its current level of 8.2 per cent is still well down on the double digit rates that characterised the 1980s. In addition, trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel has shown an encouraging willingess to take on entrenched business lobbies and has already started to dismantle tariffs in sectors such as the motor and textiles industry to force South African manufacturers to become more competitive. Despite its good track record, however, the markets remain sceptical of the government's ability to successfully rein in spending - a fact signalled in the recent rise of bond yields to more than 17 per cent, representing a real rate of return of more than 9 per cent. And while industrial restructuring is an essential step if South Africa is to successfully start pursuing an export-led growth strategy, in the short term it is likely to depress rather than enhance growth prospects. However, most analysts agree that the key to whether the South African economy can finally step on to the high road of renewed growth is whether it can successfully attract renewed inflows of foreign capital. Although the country has seen net capital outflows of around R50bn between 1985 and the first half of 1994, since June the situation appears to have stabilised. But it has not yet reversed. People have stopped taking money out of South Africa, but few people are yet willing to start putting new investments into the country. Meanwhile, the country's foreign reserves remain seriously depleted and are currently able to cover only five weeks of imports. With total foreign currency debt at only Dollars 16.7bn and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, one possible means of correcting this is renewed borrowing. However, the far more desirable route is new foreign investment. But while a large number of foreign companies have set up offices or franchise operations in South Africa over the past 18 months, few have yet made any investments of any significance. As a result, over the next few years South Africa is likely to follow a path of only moderate growth, representing a significant improvement over the recent past but still well short of the high levels the ANC needs to satisfy the needs of its black constituents.

0,FT933-1184 ,"FT933-1184 _AN-DIXCIAHZFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (38): Enfeebled giant burdened by debt - Africa / Only the return of foreign investment, in partnership with a thriving private sector, will give the economy the boost it needs      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   AFRICA AND its allies are in danger of losing the battle for the recovery of a continent, now so weakened by years of adversity and mismanagement that it cannot take full advantage of a stronger world economy. More than a decade after the World Bank first sounded the alarm about Sub-Saharan Africa's crisis, and despite some Dollars 170bn in net development assistance that has followed, the region's problems remain acute. Economic reforms that got under way in the 1980s are not measuring up to expectations, whether due to weak implementation by African governments, inadequate incentives from western governments and agencies, or flaws in the structural adjustment policy itself. And on the political front, the democratisation process that raised hopes in the 1990s is proving divisive rather than constructive, as ethnicity, rather than policies, determine voters' allegiances. Today, Africa is an enfeebled giant, poorer in per capita terms than it was in 1960, and burdened by an external debt that has soared from Dollars 3bn to more than Dollars 145bn, and which costs a quarter of export earnings to service. Wars in Angola, Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere continue to scar the continent, foreign investment (outside the oil sector) is negligible, management is weak, corruption widespread, and Aids is on the increase. 'It is the only region in the world likely to experience an increase in absolute poverty over the next decade,' Kim Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, told his executive board last February. Admittedly, Africa will do better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, if the forecasters are correct. In its World Economic Outlook, published last May, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted real GDP growth at 3.3 per cent in 1993-94, rising to 4.4 per cent a year between 1995 and 1998. But the Fund was quick to hedge its bets: 'These projections are subject to a wider margin of uncertainty than for other regions,' it warned, noting that 'despite considerable progress in some countries, many obstacles to stronger growth remain to be tackled, including inadequate infrastructure, weak administrative capacity . . . and social and political instability.' Given that Sub-Saharan Africa's four leading economies are all in difficulties, the caveat is understandable. Nigeria is in the grips of a political crisis, and its economic reform programme has effectively lapsed; Kenya is faltering in its promise to root out corruption; the Ivory Coast cannot implement an effective reform programme as long as the CFA franc remains overvalued by as much as 30 per cent; and South Africa remains plagued by political violence, likely to get worse not better as party rivalries intensify in the run up to next April's general election. Nevertheless, the IMF forecast may seem encouraging, compared with the 1980s, when growth over the decade averaged less than 2 per cent and per capita income fell by more than 1 per cent. The reality, however, is that this rate of growth will only stem, possibly halt, the rate of Africa's overall decline, for it must be set against a current population increase of 3.1 per cent annually - which, if sustained, will double the region's population every 22 years. Even the most successful example of reform provides a salutary warning of the long battle ahead if Africa is to make up ground lost during the disastrous post-independence era. Structural adjustment in Ghana has worked  -but only up to a modest point. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. But at current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population), it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. One important lesson from Ghana is that aid is not enough. Only the return - on a substantial scale - of foreign investment, in partnership with a thriving private sector, will give Africa's economy the boost it needs. As Kim Jaycox points out: 'Even if aid succeeded in generating annual growth rates of 6 per cent on average, most African countries would still require 25 years to reach acceptable unemployment levels and Dollars 1,000 GDP per capita. Only the private sector has any chance of achieving higher rates of growth with greater speed.' There is little evidence that foreign investors, who saw their rate of return drop from some 30 per cent in the 1960s to just 2.5 per cent in the 1980s, are about to come back. Net foreign direct investment in Africa has averaged around Dollars 500m a year over the past few years (mostly into the oil and mining sectors), less than 1 per cent of the global total according to the UN's World Investment Report. Obstacles range from the poor state of the infrastructure in most countries to the tough competition from other countries in the developing world, such as Thailand, Indonesia or Vietnam. Above all, Africa has yet to convince the outside world that it means business. 'Too many African countries have embraced economic reform too hesitantly,' Sir William Ryrie, outgoing head of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, told a conference in Nairobi in March this year. Whether Africa and its allies are prepared to admit that defeat looms in the battle for recovery remains to be seen. Since the Bank first sounded the alarm, in its 1981 report, further warnings have come at regular intervals. Africa 'faces acute economic difficulties', said the Bank's next appraisal, published in 1984. Five years later the picture remained bleak. The Bank looked back on 'a decade of falling per capita income' and concluded: 'Overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago.' The Bank has been taking stock once again and, in a report due to be published shortly, is expected to conclude that economic reforms have stemmed the pace of decline. But at current rates of per capita GDP growth it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid 1970s. Given better implementation of reforms and an improved international economic environment, and a renewed effort by the international community to tackle Africa's crisis, prospects could change. But the critical question remains whether African governments have the political will to adopt painful economic reforms, or the managerial capacity with which to implement them. But Africa's allies will also have to take fresh stock of their performance. No development agency likes to admit failure, for it fears losing its raison d'etre. No non-government organisation likes to acknowledge defeat, for fear of funds drying up. No western government wants to add to its problems by acknowledging that its aid policy is ineffectual. But only a frank appraisal of the crisis can provide the basis of the fresh initiative the continent desperately needs.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: EXTERNAL DEBT (DOLLARS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total debt   63.5  75.1  89.8  95.6  99.1 112.3 120.6 124.8 132.4 140.5 By maturity Short-term    6.5   7.5  10.0  10.8  11.7  13.7  14.7  16.7  15.8  17.3 Long-term    57.0  67.6  79.7  84.8  87.4  98.6 105.8 108.0 116.6 123.3 By type of creditor Official     44.4  56.1  68.6  73.9  74.7  86.6  94.1  96.8 104.0 110.4 Commercial  banks       13.2  13.0  14.7  14.1  14.4  16.0  16.5  16.3  16.7  17.5 Other  private      5.9   6.0   6.5   7.6  10.0   9.6   9.9  11.6  11.7  12.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Debt-service payments (% of exports of goods and services)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa*      27.5  28.0  23.7  24.7  24.1  23.3  25.2  26.6  33.4  25.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP (annual percentage change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub-Saharan  Africa       3.4   2.9   2.2   3.0   2.9   1.3   1.1   0.4   4.5   4.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real per capita GDP (annual percentage change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa*       0.3  -0.9  -1.6   1.1   0.8  -1.0  -1.1  -1.7   0.0   1.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Figures are for all of Africa  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Economic Outlook (May 1993), IMF  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT941-4190 ,"FT941-4190 _AN-ECMANAA4FT 940312   FT  12 MAR 94 / In 40 years' time, black Africa might reach the level of wealth it had 20 years ago: IMF reforms are paying off, but the continent is way behind the rest of the world, says the World Bank      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor   Unless sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, warns a World Bank report on the region published tomorrow. Even Ghana, rated the best of Africa's reforming countries which has achieved real growth of about 5 per cent a year, is still among the world's poorest countries: 'At this growth rate, the average Ghanaian will not cross the poverty line for another 50 years,' says the report. The report is the most sombre in a series that go back to the early stages of Africa's economic crisis. Past studies have combined tough appraisals with upbeat expectations of reform. The latest study warns that success will not come easy, but cautions against 'undue pessimism', pointing to the fact that Asian countries which had almost no growth between 1930 and 1960 now enjoy 'stunning' growth. Structural adjustment is essential but not sufficient if sub-Saharan Africa is to achieve sustained growth, says the World Bank in a 280-page appraisal of economic reform. But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in Africa, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or assess its impact on economic performance in the years under review. Of the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement in macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest resurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per cent in GDP. By contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies saw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the number of poor. Although the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they might be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades. 'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical trend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto a higher growth path. 'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export and GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other developing nations.' The report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in sub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two periods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries were implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African governments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment programmes. The six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation, introduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural incentives. Countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops, says the Bank. The study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were complementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.' Export volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if the exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies were implemented, says the report. Comparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is worrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to matching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget balances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and currencies are fully convertible, at least for current account transactions.' African governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The value of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank, 'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even after adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.' Africa's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector demands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding public enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit. 'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in Washington to launch the study. 'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no country has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low inflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he said. Africa performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing countries. In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of population growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited resources available. Adjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and efficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development efforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate resources into education and strengthening weak management capacity. 'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid growth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank. Other central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate divestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's external debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank 'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes are in place.

0,FT933-1136 ,"FT933-1136 _AN-DIZABAA7FT 930925   FT  25 SEP 93 / Investors still wary of the new S Africa: The decision to lift sanctions may not spark a bonanza      By PHILIP GAWITH   AFTER three decades of isolation, South Africa can now re-enter the economic community of nations following Nelson Mandela's successful call for the lifting of sanctions at the United Nations last night. While the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations promises considerable benefits, there is little anticipation of a short term investment bonanza. A mixture of domestic political uncertainty, international distractions, sanctions legacies and practical obstacles will ensure that South Africa's rehabilitation is a gradual process. In the US, which has been the most vocal and influential proponent of sanctions, the most positive response was always likely to come from Mr Mandela's most prominent supporters - namely Mr David Dinkins, the mayor of New York, Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York state, and Mr Douglas Wilder, governor of Virginia. Mr Dinkins immediately announced that he was asking his city council to repeal New York's anti-apartheid legislation, which could release cash in city pension funds, some of which could be invested in South Africa. Mr Charles Moses, executive director of the New York state governor's Advisory Committee for Black Affairs, confirms that the state has been working for 18 months on drawing up an International Partnership Programme (IPP), an initiative that will cover economic development, trade, education and support for small business. An early response can also be expected from the IMF and the World Bank, which are impatient to get involved in lending to South Africa. South Africa is eligible for a Dollars 800m loan in terms of the IMF's Compensatory and Contingency Finance Utility, while the World Bank has also made clear that it stands ready to lend large sums in support of socio-economic development. The Clinton administration, mindful of the political clout of the 43-strong congressional black caucus, is expected to be supportive. Expectations of the business community, however, are more muted. Mr Jonathan Huneke, investment policy manager at the US Council for International Business, an industry association representing about 300 multinationals, believes they will re-enter South Africa 'very cautiously, very quietly and very slowly'. Mr Huneke says there remains a 'residual distrust and scepticism' about the ANC among his members, many of whom were 'vilified' during the 1980s for their ties with South Africa. Although he acknowledges a 'metamorphosis on foreign investment, appreciating that they need to cater to the interests of business people', he says the ANC still has 'some way to go' before businessmen are confident with its policies. Mr Huneke adds that investors also have many more opportunities in new markets - notably in eastern Europe, east Asia and Latin America - which were not available when the sanctions period started. The Washington based Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) believes that investors will initially hold back from big investments, preferring to set up branch sales and marketing offices, or assuming direct control of a distributorship, while watching political developments. Whatever foreign investment does flow is likely to focus on two areas in particular: spending on infrastructure and consumer goods. The reasoning is that a new government is likely to spend heavily on a social reconstruction programme, while the rapidly urbanising black population, with rising incomes, is targeted as a major future growth market for small ticket consumer items. The IRRC suggests cosmetics, clothing, footwear, prepared foods and non-prescription medications as likely consumer markets. It also indicates computer and software companies as potential beneficiaries. New investors are likely to seek partners in the black community, a route already taken by Digital Equipment and the UK company Cable  Wireless, which this week was part of a consortium awarded a cellular telephone licence. Even if investors are keen to enter South Africa quickly, some will continue to face practical obstacles. According to the IRRC, 179 local entities (30 states, 109 cities, 39 counties and regional authorities and the Virgin Islands) had maintained some sort of restriction in their investment, banking or procurement policies. Although the US Senate and President Bill Clinton have urged that these be rescinded, this will not take place overnight. Mr Bill Moses of the IRRC notes that most states have adjourned until next year and in some cases, notably Texas, state legislatures do not meet until 1995. Cities, counties and public pension funds are often bound by legislative comment an waiting periods. In terms of portfolio investment, South Africa starts from a very low base. A study of 47 global emerging market funds by the UK group Micropal shows that at June 30 1993, only 0.07 per cent of their Dollars 8bn assets were invested in South Africa. By comparison, on September 22, South Africa, by market capitalisation, represented 0.85 per cent of the Financial Times World Actuaries Index, measured in US dollars. Mr Lloyd Pengilly of the New York brokers Mcintosh Martin says there is relatively little foreign investment in South African stocks outside mining. He says recent weeks have seen a lot of inquiries from US mutual funds about the South African market, but this has not yet been matched by any significant flow of funds. He stresses that a 'terrific re-education process' lies ahead with most portfolio managers ignorant of the market. This is borne out by a cursory examination of Nelson's Directory, the US investment bible, which does not list a single US analyst covering South African stocks. Mr Pengilly believes that 'over time' there will be a flow of funds to South Africa. Wall Street observers believe important US securities firms like Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Smith Barney Shearson Inc and Lehmann Bros are likely to re-enter South Africa.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA: 30 YEARS OF PRESSURE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1963    - UN calls for voluntary ban on arms sales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1964    - India imposes total trade ban         - Japan bans direct investment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1973    - Arab countries impose oil embargo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1977    - UN resolution calls for mandatory arms embargo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1979    - UK bans North Sea oil exports         - Sweden bans new investment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1985    - UN Security Council calls for suspension of new investment and           export guarantees; prohibition of krugerrand sales, nuclear           contracts and sales of computer equipment for use by security           services; restrictions on sporting and cultural relations         - EC bans sales of arms, oil and nuclear co-operation         - US bans computer exports to security services, nuclear           technology exports, new loans (except those that benefit all           races) and krugerrand imports.

0,FT933-858 ,"FT933-858 _AN-DI0BZAC3FT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / Personal View: Private sector key to Africa's future      By LEWIS T PRESTON   The Financial Times's recent supplement on sub-Saharan Africa ('Africa; A continent at stake', September 1) performed a service for everyone concerned with development. At a time when the world's attention is diverted to the dramatic changes taking place in other areas, it is vital that the magnitude of the development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa is not forgotten. Half the region's 600m people live in absolute poverty. It is the only region where the number of poor people would - if current trends are not reversed - increase by the year 2000, where population is doubling every 20 years, and external debt exceeds gross domestic product. Indeed, the future of the continent is 'at stake'. However, Africa is also changing. We are all familiar with the evolving political transformation in South Africa. Not so well known is the fundamental change in economic policies which has been taking place across much of sub-Saharan Africa. This has been a 'quiet revolution', with more than 30 countries undertaking adjustment programmes aimed at increasing productivity and growth. The intensity and success of their reforms have varied, and more time will be required before definitive results emerge. However, there are signs of progress. Benin, Burundi, the Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda are among a group of countries - supported under a special programme of assistance co-ordinated by the World Bank - that has achieved growth rates double the region's average, tripled output in the critical agricultural sector, and reversed the decline in exports. There remains a long way to go. But these results indicate that in Africa - as in East Asia or Latin America - adjustment to economic realities produces economic results. Now is not the time for Africa to slow down its reform efforts. On the contrary, they must be accelerated. Many countries have taken the first macroeconomic steps. Africa now needs to underpin them with a 'second generation' of reforms - to encourage the private sector, and to build its human and institutional capacities. About 350m new jobs will be needed in sub-Saharan Africa within a generation. Only the private sector - free to allocate resources and respond to market signals - can create employment and incomes on this scale. And only the private sector can provide Africa with the access it needs to investment, know-how and technology. The message is clear: the movement toward a 'market-friendly' approach must be broadened and deepened. It is Africa's only hope of competing in the global economy of the 21st century. Educated and healthy people - and competent institutions - are also essential. In this regard providers of aid to Africa have a major responsibility. The international community needs to re-examine the quality of its assistance effort - and its overall development effectiveness. Donors cannot be satisfied that external technical assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has increased over the last decade and now stands at about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) a year. Nor can they be satisfied that an estimated 100,000 expatriate 'advisers' are at work in Africa today, a larger number than at independence. At the same time - and as the FT pointed out - Africa knows that the 'rules of the aid game' have changed in the post-cold war era. The competition for resources has never been greater. Aid budgets are being scrutinised and, in some cases, cut. Countries that cannot show they are using aid effectively - and that means good governance as well as good economic policy - will lose it. The World Bank is one of Africa's strongest supporters in its development efforts. Evidence of this is the wide range of initiatives we have undertaken as well as the volume of our lending. But we don't have all the resources required. And we don't have all the answers. Our partners in the donor community have a crucial role to play. Non-government organisations are vital at the grass roots. And the private sector holds the key to providing the bulk of future investment. However, the principal responsibility for Africa's development rests with Africa and its leaders. They must adopt the right policies, inspire confidence in investors, and motivate their peoples. Many African nations have started to change in the right direction. The international community must support them. The author is president of the World Bank   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT933-5762 ,"FT933-5762 _AN-DIAB3AGIFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (9): Thrown into the deep end - Industry      By TONY HAWKINS   FEW yardsticks measure Africa's marginalisation better than its share of global manufacturing activity. In 1980, manufacturing value added (MVA) in sub-Saharan Africa totalled Dollars 12bn - 0.4 per cent of the global total if South Africa is excluded, or Dollars 30.5bn (1.1 per cent) including South Africa. Ten years later, in 1990, the region's share had slipped to 0.9 per cent; though if South Africa is left out, it remained at 0.4 per cent. By 1980, it had become clear that misguided, if well-intentioned, attempts to promote industrialisation had saddled the continent with a battery of inefficient, internationally uncompetitive manufacturing firms, many owned by governments. Since then, structural adjustment measures - especially trade liberalisation, tariff reform, exchange rate devaluation, deregulation, positive real interest rates and privatisation - have changed the rules of the game. Industries that grew up behind tariff walls and import controls - many of which should never have been established - were thrown into the deep end of global competition. Macroeconomic stability aside, the most important single factor in industrial adjustment has been establishing - and sustaining - competitive exchange rates. Given the size of the domestic market and high inflation, substantial devaluation has been necessary to re-establish competitiveness in both domestic and export markets. Also crucial is the simplification of import regimes to ensure that manufacturers importing raw materials or parts do not face bureaucratic hurdles and heavy import taxes. Critics of structural adjustment claim that the reform package implies de-industrialisation, destroying domestic capacity and favouring imports. World Bank researchers insist that there is no evidence for this, pointing out that in nine countries where macropolicies improved, manufacturing output grew substantially faster than before adjustment. Ultimately, though, there is only so much policymakers can achieve. Thereafter, it is up to private initiative and investment, which is where the problem arises. Abundant raw materials and low-cost labour are no longer enough. Technical and managerial skills, scientific and marketing know-how, prompt deliveries and high-quality products are essential, achieved primarily by foreign investment by global companies. In 1990, for instance, Singapore's manufacturing output was almost half that of the entire African continent, due in large part to the presence of some 3,000 affiliates and subsidiaries of multinationals. Unido figures show African productivity levels at about one tenth of those of north American manufacturers - the comparative figure for Asia is 18 per cent. But because average wages in Africa are less than 9 per cent of the north American level, as against 16 per cent in Asia, sub-Saharan producers still have a competitive edge on cost grounds. However, this is not enough; the key role of human capital cannot be exaggerated. In the 20 years to 1990, Africa's productivity rate - relative to north America - fell from 16 per cent to 10.5 per cent, while Asia raised productivity to 18 per cent from 12 per cent. But the most important factor in productivity is the region's low levels of investment in physical plant and in human capital. Government policy will help but the turnround in African industry will depend on the return of the foreign investors. So long as they remain scarce, so too will Africa's industrial capacity.

There is an understandable perception that it's  wrong to dispense charity abroad when so much is needed at home.  There is also a feeling that much foreign aid simply drains  into the bottomless pit of incompetent, spendthrift Third World  countries.    As a result, legislation is being overhauled this year to  make foreign aid more flexible and allow its use as an incentive  for countries which pursue the right political and economic  policies. The $600 million development, trade and investment  package which President Clinton has offered South Africa over  the next three years should be seen in this light.    Most of the money is intended for the private sector rather  than government. Much is indirect aid or seed money aimed at  ""leveraging"" greater amounts of private sector investment, both  domestic and American. So, typically, the aid will consist of  guarantees to building societies and other institutions to grant  housing loans to black homeowners, or credit to black  businessmen or guarantees to U.S. businesses to cover  investments here.    The idea is to help jump-start the economy to the growth  level needed to deliver the material needs of the back  population. Not included in the $600 million total is the  lifting of duties on 4,400 categories of South African products  imported into the U.S. And the package is also designed to  promote American business by opening up trade and investment in  what America has identified as one of the world's top 10  emerging markets.    South Africa should be reassured by this pragmatic approach.  Ultimately it is only a flourishing private sector which will  meet development needs.     "

Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest commercial banks, said it would proceed with a bond issue for Escom, the electricity utility, which had been postponed during the referendum. It will lead an international consortium for the issue. German banks have already paved the way for South Africa's return to the international capital markets after a six-year absence. Deutsche Bank, the country's biggest bank, was the lead manager in a DM400m (Pounds 139m) issue for the republic last September, increased from DM300m because of strong investor demand. Deutsche Bank yesterday welcomed the outcome, as did Mercedes-Benz, one of Germany's largest corporate investors in South Africa. Mercedes said the vote was a vindication of its decision to stay in South Africa  - where it employs nearly 5,000 people. Corporate America's initial reaction was muted. A handful of companies and banks surveyed said it was too early to plunge back into major investment in South Africa. Ms Jennifer Kibbe, an official at the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre, which tracks US investment in South Africa, said US companies regarded the referendum vote 'as a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for them to go back in.' Citicorp, the biggest US bank, bank indicated it would need to see what type of interim government came to power before it could consider changing its position. Citicorp which closed its office in South Africa in 1987, does have a limited business in South African ADRs (American depository receipts), but it is unlikely to expand that business immediately. After sanctions were lifted Citicorp said it had no plans to resume lending and that position has not changed. The Ford motor company, which withdrew in 1988, said it would conduct a full review before changing its position. Among British companies, Barclays Bank, which pulled out of South Africa in 1986 in response to student protests, said it was a positive result but that it would wait to see how the situation developed. 'As the political situation and economic climate becomes clearer .. it is possible that in the future Barclays may establish some representation in South Africa to look after large corporate business in that country and to service the bank's global clients,' the bank said. RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said it was 'delighted'. It saw 'nothing but good coming out of the complete integration of southern Africa.' On the international bond market, the result was widely seen as likely to bring forward further bond issues from the republic. Bankers said further political headway would have to be made before there was fresh fund-raising. South Africa has launched three international bond issues since last summer, two in the name of the republic and one in the name of the Development Bank of South Africa. All have been sold mainly to German private investors, rather than institutions. Concern about political risk, and ethical or legal obstacles, still loom large. The republic's Ecu250m (Pounds 178m) of bonds, launched in January, were trading at a yield of 10.63 per cent, 0.2 of a percentage point above offer price  - a reflection that demand for the bonds, though reported to have picked up yesterday, has yet to affect the price.

But it is nowhere near enough to lift an  economy which, nevertheless, has the potential to achieve  much-heightened growth rates.    Aid of about R1.7 billion a year might seem a lot of money.  Yet perspective indicates that R1.7 billion worth of aid in the  next 12 months is about equal to the cost of establishing one  new gold mine. It's half the sum South Africa borrowed from the  International Monetary Fund at the end of last year -- funds  used to bolster foreign exchange reserves which, in spite of  that injection, are now, only five months later, under severe  pressure. Indeed, in the first four months of 1994, the net  reserves plummeted by R3.2 billion, equivalent to more than two  years' worth of foreign aid.    Accordingly, the aid-to-SA [South Africa] conduit won't even  begin to have a favourable impact on an economy desperately  trying to emerge from five years of crippling recession. Not  that we should be looking for handouts to pull us out of the  economic mire. We need to be tugging ourselves up by our own  bootstraps. Aid dents the pride of the nation and promotes a  poor work ethic -- as countries to our north have discovered at  exorbitant cost. In short, the entire country has to get back  to work -- to work hard, efficiently, and assiduously. Is the  nation prepared and able to do just this? The portents are  promising. What remains is for the potential to be realised.    It is the new Government's most awesome task to get people  into jobs, to train them to do those jobs well and to ensure  that they keep doing them well. It won't be easy and it won't  happen soon. The starting point is to enhance South Africa's  economic growth rate. Even this year's predicted 3 percent is  well short of the desired mark. Next year simply has to be 5  percent plus -- and, if one is to take a less than jaundiced  view of the future, it can be achieved. How?    -- The psychology is right. All South Africans are suddenly  on the same side, working for the same goals. No more is  government at such odds with labour and business; no more is  labour at such odds with business. Co-operation among all the  aspects of production translates into meaningful economic growth.    -- Foreign investment, as opposed to foreign aid, stands  ready to enter an economy no longer constantly threatened by  violence and labour unrest -- an economy with a well-developed  infrastructure, a sound legal system and one which offers an  attractive platform for launching products into sub-Saharan  Africa.    -- Even without the post-apartheid benefits that are about  to  accrue, the economy has been emerging from recession. The major  indicators are pointing up and, given a heightened level of  foreign and domestic investment, they are poised to point yet  higher.    -- Inflation remains in single-digit territory. While many  fear that the huge social upliftment expenditure targeted by the  new Government will before long jerk inflation back into double  digits, the substantial excess production capacity in the  economy and the Reserve Bank's continued vigilance are notable  ameliorating factors.    -- International capital markets are now, as seldom before,  ready to lend to South Africa. Although they involve a cost in  the form of interest payments, if the funds thereby raised are  used to expand the nation's productive base, the interest bill  can be covered many times over by heightened exports and import  replacement.    -- Much local and foreign money is destined for education  and  training. Some dividends will be garnered only many years into  the future. But some, particularly in the training arena, will  accrue in the near term. In concert with the will to work hard,  those dividends will help lubricate South Africa's economic  engine.    -- Interest rates are scheduled to decline in the near  future  as the balance of payments constraint is rendered less onerous  by capital inflows. Cheaper money implies more investment in  productive capacity and increased spending -- vital ingredients  for growth.    -- The global economy is expanding. This is bound to benefit  all exporting nations, including South Africa. In addition, the  upturn is coinciding with a revival in the commodities cycle.  And South Africa is among the world's leading exporters of  gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, manganese, and chrome.    Too optimistic a scenario? Are there no flies in the  economic ointment?    Earlier in the year, the gloom and doom merchants predicted  that the election would bring chaos; that the Left-leaning  elements in the ANC would drive the country down the communist  precipice. Today they're silent. Business people are positive.  The Johannesburg Stock exchange continues to scale new peaks,  pointing to a future more prosperous than the recent past.    Even so, flies, among them exchange control, are by no means  absent from the ointment.    International investors are invariably reticent about  placing  their money in a country which prevents its unfettered  repatriation. They're wary of a country which aims to attract  foreign capital via a discounted financial rand.    Why not, then, abolish exchange controls and scrap the  financial rand? Because vast sums of funk money would leave our  shores, plundering our scarce foreign exchange reserves. At  least that's been the reason for the past decade or so. It's a  reason which could evaporate if confidence is restored --  confidence that South Africa does indeed have a bright future;  confidence that capital seeks to flow into the country rather  than out of it; confidence that democracy will bring with it  responsible government of responsible citizens.    Ultimately, South Africa will row its own boat. Its  oarsmen's determination, wisdom, and strength will determine its  destiny.     "
0,FT932-3840 ,"FT932-3840 _AN-DFKB5AG1FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (4): In search of skills and technology - Resumption of foreign investment is crucial to sustained recovery      By TONY HAWKINS   AFTER a decade of political turmoil, sanctions and disinvestment, few multinationals have been perched on the end of their chairs waiting for Nelson Mandela to give the green light to invest in South Africa. But with investment at its lowest level for more than 30 years (15.9 per cent of GDP), and with capital pouring out of the country at the rate of 2.8 per cent of GDP between 1985 and 1992 the resumption of foreign investment is crucial to sustained recovery. Little is likely to materialise in the near term, though in both business and government there are high hopes of resumed access to IMF and the World Bank funding once agreement is reached at the constitutional negotiations. Welcome though this will be, what South Africa desperately needs is substantial direct investment inflows, bringing with them skills, technology and market access. The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) estimates that between 1984 and 1991, 214 US firms or about two thirds of those with investments in South Africa disinvested. As a result, the stock of US direct investment fell to Dollars 700m at the end of the 1980s from Dollars 2.6bn at the start. Another 190 non-US firms have left during the same period, the majority British-owned. Many foreign firms retained non-equity links with South Africa, which could limit the number of returnees. There have been some moves since the sanctions thaw began three years ago with Mr Mandela's release. The IRRC says 16 US companies have quietly opened offices or established subsidiaries in the past two years, including four of the 168 US corporations that disinvested between 1985 and 1990. Six of the new entrants were in the software and computer businesses. There are now 119 US corporations with direct investments or employees in South Africa, with many more likely to set up shop once second-tier sanctions, operated by more than 60 city, county and state organisations penalising US firms doing business in South Africa, are lifted. Britain is by far the biggest player with the UK-South Africa Trade Association estimating British investment, direct and portfolio, at more than Dollars 16bn. The London School of Economics Centre for the Study of the South African Economy and International Finance, has identified 51 new investments in the country since late 1989. While stressing that its database is incomplete the centre estimates the inflow of new direct investment over the past three years at around Dollars 1.5bn or 1.5 per cent of GNP. The LSE Centre found that the bulk of the resumed foreign investment has focused on a narrow range of activities - those that are highly vertically integrated, knowledge and communications intensive and quality dependent. More than 85 per cent of the investments identified since 1989 were in five sectors - beverages, hotels and leisure, electronics, chemicals and oils and engineering. According to the IRRC, a feature of renewed US investment is the switch from equity to non-equity links, with the number of US companies with non-equity links increasing from 184 to 299. South African Reserve Bank figures show a similar trend. The Bank's census of foreign transactions for 1989, just released, makes a distinction between direct and non-direct investments, noting that the share of the latter has risen from 46 per cent of the total in 1973 to more than 76 per cent in 1989. Since South Africa fell off the foreign investment agenda of most global firms in the mid-1980s, the rules of the game have changed. Today's global business is unenthusiastic about natural resource investments in mining and less likely than 20 years ago to be attracted by plentiful labour, even when it is low-cost. The key attractions today are markets and skills and because South Africa is a long way from the Triad markets of North America, the EC and the Far East and has little to offer on the skills front, new foreign investors - as distinct from those already there - may well be thin on the ground. The more so if the new government insists on codes of conduct, social programmes, affirmative action, and expatriate and local value-added quotas. The fact is that global competition for inward investment is intense and there are already enough disincentives to investment in South Africa without throwing up new obstacles that do not apply elsewhere in the third world. Pessimism can be overdone. A peaceful, stable South Africa must become the logical headquarters for African operations and the platform for developing exports and markets in the sub-Saharan region.

0,FT931-4751 ,"FT931-4751 _AN-DCJCTAAPFT 930310   FT  10 MAR 93 / S Africa plan focuses on equality: Philip Gawith and Patti Waldmeir report on a radical economic programme      By PHILIP GAWITH and PATTI WALDMEIR   THE South African government yesterday launched its most radical economic restructuring programme since it took power in 1948. The programme, which reflects a new emphasis on equality, would touch almost every aspect of economic life. It aims to increase the amount of investment in relation to gross domestic product to improve productivity and to re-establish the stable financial environment without which investors cannot prosper. It is a classic supply-side restructuring programme - but with a human face, designed to make it palatable to opposition political forces whose approval must be gained if it is to succeed. Initial union reaction was positive, with a leading union economist describing the plan as a useful starting point rather than rejecting it out of hand. The changes required to effect it are enormous. They include: Reducing government current expenditure to 20.1 per cent of GDP in 1997 from 26.8 per cent in 1992; Lowering the company tax rate to 40 per cent from 48 per cent, and the individual's marginal rate to 40 per cent from 43 per cent, by 1997; Reducing tariff barriers on imports to 18 per cent (possibly 14 per cent) in 1997 from 27 per cent at present; Keeping real wage increases to 0.75 per cent per annum; Taking a tougher line on anti-competitive behaviour, price-fixing and collusion; Balancing the budget by 1997. (Last year's deficit represented 9 per cent of GDP); Phasing out exchange control; Success will depend on wage restraint from the unions and an inflow of foreign capital equivalent to 2.8 per cent of GDP in the mid 1990s, tailing off later (largely from international finance institutions). It will also depend on a strong government's ability to push through unpalatable reforms - at a time when Pretoria is about to hand over to a power-sharing government which could prove weak and fractious. The programme is published against a background of widespread acceptance of the pressing need for fundamental economic restructuring. 'South Africa cannot afford another decade of poor economic growth, since this will only lead to greater unemployment, poverty, violence and social instability,' comments Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance and the driving force behind the document, in the foreword. At the heart of the programme is the simple assumption that levels of investment, and productivity of that investment, must be raised if South Africa is to meet its daunting development challenge. Fiscal and monetary discipline the improved functioning of product and labour markets and liberalised trade and financial markets are among the programme's goals. The focus is on providing long-term solutions to structural problems, rather than short term palliatives. The approach will be gradual as the government believes the economy, and the society are too sick to survive a 'big bang' approach. Government officials acknowledge they have long paid lip service to economic reform. And while some progress has been made - for example in monetary policy and agriculture - it took the deepening economic crisis and the appointment last May of Mr Keys, to produce a comprehensive programme. While the programme is focused on the supply side, it makes clear that growth is not seen as being more important than equality. The document notes 'the new political understanding of the nature of the South African economy . . . accepts that the process of economic growth must be seen as but a central feature of the broader process of economic development of the country and its people.' In the past they have always insisted that growth alone was enough to cope with poverty. 'What is envisaged is a process of structural adjustment in the developed market economy and a reconstruction of its less-developed socio-economic framework, in particular the equitable access of all South Africans to all opportunities in the economy.' During the difficult political transition to democracy, the government would provide a package of measures including labour intensive public work schemes, unemployment insurance and special training programmes. Mr Keys has been careful to stress that the restructuring proposals are not prescriptive, but are meant to provide a platform for debate. But his officials make clear that reform will begin with next week's budget. 'It may have more teeth than people would like to see' says Mr Jacobs. The document highlights constraints on growth: in the short term, a large fiscal deficit could crowd out a private investment revival, and balance of payments problems will constrain growth if large net capital outflows cannot be stemmed. The longer term constraint is the legacy of apartheid - defects in the socio-economic system, such as large distances between industrial centres and labour force accommodation, and lack of education and skills which would 'prevent the full participation in the growth process by the country's large developing community.'

0,FT934-7735 ,"FT934-7735 _AN-DKRC7AGTFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (19): In search of recognition - Philip Gawith discusses foreign investment      By PHILIP GAWITH   AFTER the isolation years, South Africa's business community is enjoying being back in the fold, hoping the world will want to lend to the country, trade with it and, above all, invest in it. First prize would be a headline investment of the 'IBM to build Dollars 1bn plant' variety. Clearly the optimists are going to be disappointed, for the time being. First, the world has changed. Before isolation, the eastern bloc and China were no-go zones and the Pacific Dragons had barely entered the business lexicon. Nor had South America embarked upon widespread financial liberalisation. Change in all of these areas has opened a host of markets competing for the multinational investment dollar. Second, save for special cases - such as investment flowing from the recent issue of cellular telephone licences - it is unlikely any significant investments will be made until it is clear South Africa has achieved a stable transition. This is not, however, to say that nothing is happening. On the contrary, there is a ferment of activity. Examples include: Alfa Romeo is again selling cars in South Africa and Volvo will soon be doing so: IBM is probably going to return through an investment in a local distributor; Hoechst has expanded its operation by paying R70m for a polyester fibre plant; Foodcorp has signed a deal with Pillsbury; Lufthansa has added an extra flight and is flying on a daily basis; ferrochrome producers Samancor and Nippon Denko have formed a joint venture, while Mitsui will distribute some of Sasol's chemicals in Japan and Korea. The list goes on. So, while the headline investment may be absent, the incremental internationalisation of the corporate scene is proceeding apace. The main trend to be observed is as obvious as it is understandable: companies want to establish a presence, but without any significant equity commitment. As Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented recently in Washington: 'They're offering us their services, not their money.' The deals one is hearing about are thus in distribution, licensing and franchising. At issue here is not only the question of who will come, but how they will do it. Any future government is sure to have a very strong commitment to black economic advancement, a process that many US investors, in particular, are likely to want to support. Given the underdeveloped state of black business in South Africa, franchising (sectors with strong potential include hair care salons and fast food outlets) and joint ventures are the most logical routes of assisting this process. There are, for example, many small black business contractors, but often they will lack access to credit to buy materials and have non-existent financial or administative systems. The process of finding partners, however, will not be easy. Despite years of activity in this field, the US embassy is still not in a position to offer a list of potential partners. According to the Reserve Bank, at the end of 1992 total investment in South Africa by foreign residents amounted to approximately Dollars 30bn. This included repayable debt of about Dollars 18bn and about Dollars 12bn of South African corporate equities and bonds issued by government and other public and private sector borrowers. About half of the latter sum is 'direct' investment - in South African subsidiaries and branches of foreign companies - with the other half being invested by non-residents in rand denominated paper ('portfolio' investment). During the sanctions years, South Africa experienced a net outflow of foreign investment from the country as many companies, especially US ones, disinvested. The stock of US fixed investment in South Africa shrunk as a result by a third, to roughly Dollars 1bn and 110 companies. Although some UK and European companies also left, most stayed and already have a presence in South Africa. From an investment perspective, the Japanese and Asian presence is negligible. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, speculates that the order in which foreign countries will 'carry the baton' when they return might be: US, Japan, UK and other Europeans. How will they be received by a future government? The key policy document in this regard is the 'Agreed framework in relation to foreign direct investment', a product of the National Economic Forum, and endorsed by the ANC. This is largely a motherhood-and-apple pie affair, but points worth stressing are: Realisation of the importance of stability and 'consistent, credible economic policies'; The view that South Africa should not introduce special tax incentives to attract FDI, the object rather being 'the equal application of reasonably low corporate tax rates which remain stable'; During the transition assurances will be provided on security of investment, foreign exchange policy, and minimisation of bureaucratic obstacles; Industrial incentives will be equally available to foreigners and locals.

The Conference Board survey of more than 400 chief executives of the nation's  largest corporations is believed to be the first attempt to measure how top  U.S. business leaders feel about Japanese investment in the United States. Its  findings are in line with recent nationwide polls that reveal Americans  increasingly perceive Japan as a formidable economic competitor.    The survey on ""Japanese Business and Investment Practices"" showed that more  than two-thirds of the top executives believe that continuing Japanese  acquisitions will increase friction between the the United States and Japan.    Most attributed the criticism and discomfort over Japanese investment to the  recent acquisitions of traditional American institutions, such as Rockefeller  Center and Columbia Pictures, and to ""a degree of cultural bias.""    In responding to questions on their views about U.S. investments from five  specific countries, 73.1% of the CEOs felt most comfortable with investment  from Canada, 62.0% from United Kingdom, 52.5% from the Netherlands, 50.1% from  Germany, 37.5% from Japan and 31.9% from Saudi Arabia.    ""Latest survey results reflect growing concern among U.S. business leaders over  Japanese-U.S. relations,"" said Preston Townley, president and chief executive  of the Conference Board. ""The free-market tradition is strong in the U.S., but  the feeling is now widespread that Japan and some of this country's other major  trading partners clearly play by different rules.""    Although 9 of 10 of the chief executives said foreign capital can move freely  into the United States, they said it is extremely difficult for foreigners to  invest in Japanese companies. Although there ""was considerable irritation with  Japan's barriers to investments by foreigners,"" 57% of the respondents said  that Japanese investment patterns overseas are not much different from those of  American firms when the dollar was strong.    While the majority said that Japanese investment helps to bring advanced  technologies and better quality control to the United States, they also  expressed concern that Japanese purchases of U.S. firms provides them too much  access to American technology.    The Conference Board, a nonprofit, New York-based business research group, said  Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper, helped in the  preparation of its survey questionnaire. It was the third of the Conference  Board's series of chief executive surveys on issues of critical importance to  business.    American executives also had mixed views on other Japanese management and  business practices. Most endorsed the Japanese policy of commitment to teamwork  and the group over the individual. However, they rejected the practice of a  worker spending his entire work life at one firm with promotions and raises  based primarily on seniority rather than merit.    Surprisingly, the chief executives said it was appropriate for governments to  grant loans and subsidies to assist key industries in maintaining a high level  of technology. But they rejected, by a large margin, the Japanese practice of  companies holding stock in other firms to promote one another's management  stability.    A majority said they liked the fact that Japanese companies did not have to  worry about hostile takeovers, and 90% endorsed the principle of primary focus  on long-term corporate strategies rather than short-term performance.    About half of the 400 company executives responding to the survey have annual  sales volume of more than $1 billion. About 49% of total respondents were  engaged in manufacturing; 18% finance, insurance and real estate; 13% business  services and communications; 6% wholesale and retail trade, and 15% other,  according to Fabian Linden, director of the Conference Board's consumer  research center.

The Bush Administration did not offer the promises that Israel requested,  officials on both sides said. Nor did Shamir yield on any of the points.    At the same time, both Shamir and U.S. officials emphasized that Egypt -- which  is serving as unofficial surrogate for the PLO -- has not responded officially  to Baker's five points.

0,FT943-15483 ,"FT943-15483 _AN-EGKDTAFOFT 940708   FT  08 JUL 94 / Global investment flows bypass poorer developing nations      By CANUTE JAMES   Finance ministers in the poorer developing countries, who have recently been lamenting the diversion of foreign investment from their regions to more developed countries, have had their fears confirmed by a study on global investment flows. Although foreign direct investment destined for developing countries continued to rise rapidly between 1985 and 1992 at an annual rate of 23 per cent, the smaller and least developed received very little. The study, by the International Finance Corporation, found that the increase reached 37 per cent in 1991 and 33 per cent in 1992. From a level of Dollars 8.4bn in 1985, net foreign direct investment in developing counties had expanded to Dollars 36.3bn in 1992. East Asia and Latin America were the main recipients of foreign direct investment, taking about 80 per cent. 'While investment to Latin America and East Asia continues to dominate flows, as has been true throughout the 1980s. . . sub-Saharan investment has been declining in relative terms, a characteristic shared by Europe, the Middle East and North Africa since 1989,' the report says. 'On the other hand, there has been a rapid rise in foreign direct investment destined for east European countries following the disintegration of communism.' The poorer among the developing countries are at the bottom of the list because of a combination of infrastructural and policy deficiencies. Although foreign and domestic investors are influenced by much the same factors, foreign investors differ in that they look at market size, actual or potential, as one criterion, the report says. They also tend to be sensitive to specific policy issues such as those related to foreign exchange availability and operational freedom. Consequently, private investment tends to be more attractive in regions where strong growth has occurred and seems likely to continue, or where there are promising prospects. These regions include many of the East Asian countries, Chile, Argentina and Mexico. 'There is evidence as well that private investment is a function of relative stability in country economic policies and, to some extent, in political stability more generally,' it says. 'Moreover, recent research has confirmed that income inequality, by increasing the likelihood of instability, also tends to reduce private investment activity. Compared with any other region, private investment in sub-Saharan Africa remained low relative to average gross domestic product. The study found a correlation between the deregulation of developing country economies, particularly the privatisation of state-owned economic enterprises, and the pattern of foreign investment flows. These policy changes have also encouraged increased domestic private investment. Trends in Private Investment in Developing Countries 1994, Discussion Paper Number 20.

He was tied up  with representatives from the German government's development  wing, and then another man, Mr Gopichand Hinduja, who also  appeared to have lots of money, an aide explained. The new  deputy foreign minister's willingness to make time for wealthy  and influential people like Mr Hinduja -- said to be the  10th-richest man in the world -- became clear as he explained  the new government's pragmatic and interest-driven foreign  policy.    Simply put, it entailed being very nice to the rich and  powerful, nice to the potentially rich and powerful and kind to  old friends who were neither. Although Mr Pahad would blanche  at such a crude assessment, he agreed that gone were the days of  making friends for friends' sake to further partisan objectives.    It is a whole new game for a man who spent a good part of  his  ANC career trying to isolate South Africa, and a department  which devoted itself to sanctions-busting and forming ties with  everyone that would have it.    Like all the other ministries under the new government,  South  Africa's foreign policy priorities are dictated by the need to  ensure the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP]  success.    ""Our priority is making sure that the country has a  sustainable, growing economy, otherwise the Reconstruction and  Development Programme will remain an empty theoretical concept,""  Mr Pahad said.    The job of the Foreign Affairs department was to promote and  sell this programme abroad to secure foreign resources as  swiftly as possible.    Mr Pahad firmly ruled out the sale of grand embassies and  art  works as mooted by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The  resources he speaks of are investment, favourable trading terms,  development aid and soft loans.    Given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will  be to increase favourable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union. But, Mr Pahad said, South Africa would also be  looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations  with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India,  the People's Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored was the Middle  East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.    There were also important new friends to consolidate  politically in the context of being the new government. These  would include China, which was sympathetic to the ANC as a  liberation movement, and Russia, whose relationship with the ANC  changed with the collapse of communism at the turn of the  decade. Both these countries are permanent members of the UN  Security Council.    As there were scores of other developing countries on the  lookout for favourable relations with the most important  economic and political blocs -- the EU, NAFTA and the  Association of South East Asian Nations -- SA [South Africa] had  to capitalise on the enormous goodwill that existed since the  successful elections, and keep it going, said Mr Pahad.    South Africa had two aces to play in this regard. The first  was its moral status in the world. The second, its position in  an increasingly marginalised continent.    Despite all gloomy predictions, South Africa became the  example of the ""best miracle of the century"". ""We have captured  the moral high ground in non-racialism, democracy and conflict  resolution to become the world leader in this arena.""    But, more importantly, it had become imperative for the rest  of the world that this success story continued. For if South  Africa were to fail -- and its success depended on consolidating  democracy with economic growth -- there would be serious  consequences for other countries' internal policies on democracy  and racism.    ""They see our success as a godsend to a more healthy  approach  to politics. They want us to succeed."" Another ace was South  Africa's position in the continent of Africa. ""If we don't  sink, they see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the  region doesn't sink they see some hope of a breakthrough in the  development of other parts of Africa.""    This brings him to South Africa's second foreign policy  priority -- its relationship with the southern African region,  which, he says, is fundamental to South Africa's broader  interests.    President Nelson Mandela's reception at the OAU summit this  week as the messiah of the continent highlighted the important  role that South Africa could play in the continent. However,  South Africa will have to be careful to straddle the demands and  expectations of the rest of Africa with pragmatic policies.    Mr Pahad once again has a realistic attitude towards  relations with Africa. ""Unless we can achieve mutually  beneficial development in our region, we will not be able to  tackle effectively our international or regional challenges,"" he  said.    This translates into developing regional co-operation by  joining the SADC [South African Development Community] and  rationalising the many regional institutions like the SA Customs  Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement.    He stops at integration. This was a long-term vision and  would be dictated by the process of co-operation. It would  also be in South Africa's interests to ensure stability in both  the region and the continent. A lot of time would be spent  strengthening OAU mechanisms for conflict resolution.    Mr Pahad sees regional cooperation extending not only to  areas of economic development but to basic issues like  gun-smuggling, drug-peddling, refugees and illegal immigrants.    He distinguished between illegal immigrants and refugees,  the latter which South Africa would deal with according to  internationally accepted conventions. ""But we cannot turn a  blind eye to illegal immigrants. We are going to have to deal  with this in a way that protects the interests of our country.  We must have an effective immigration policy and apply it  justly and humanely.""    It was in this context that regional development became a  priority for SA. ""If you don't have mutually advantageous  regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South  Africa. And, given that our borders are so big, we will not be  able to prevent it"".    On the question of the country's role in the OAU, Mr Pahad  said that with its expertise in many fields South Africa could  help the organisation become a more effective body on the  continent and in the United Nations.    Implicit in this is South Africa's desire to be the first  African country to take a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council.    The government's policy of making new friends and extending  South Africa's profile into uncharted territories would not mean  establishing diplomatic missions everywhere in the world, he  said. This would be dictated by the budget and the national  interest and would entail downscaling some embassies, having one  diplomatic representatives serving several countries, upgrading  priority areas and establishing links with countries with  perceived potential.    One example under debate was the policy towards the People's  Republic of China and Taiwan. He pointed out that, should South  Africa establish diplomatic ties with the PRC, it would have to  forego long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The PRC  was important for South Africa not only because of the enormous  trade potential, but also because it was a permanent member of  the UN Security Council. Taiwan was however, one of South  Africa's largest trading partners.    ""In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our own interests and international precedents.""    Mr Pahad stressed that foreign policy would not be dictated  only by South Africa's interests.    However, establishing friendships and coming to the rescue  of  friends did not necessitate establishing embassies in these  countries. ""There are other forms of interaction and  co-operation.""

Yoshio Hironaka, head of the Forestry Agency's Guidance  Division, told the ITTO session that it is the government's wish  to tackle forest depletion at home as well as abroad.    Hironaka outlined to the board a policy for conserving  Japan's forests, saying that sustainable timber management  continues to be a prime conservation goal of the government.    ``Japan has established goals for forest conservation and  sustainable forest management and has been achieving these goals  in various systems,'' Hironaka said. ``We will maintain this  goal and continue implementing sustainable management of our  forests.''    But in a statement to the ITTO board on behalf of a  coalition  of five consumer and environmental organizations, Kazuko Matsue,  a member of the Sarawak Campaign Committee, said the agency's  effort to lower its debt by cutting the forestry work force is  leaving plantations understaffed and causing a drop in timber  quality.    The statement said the widespread conversion of the nation's  forests into single species tracts is starving the forests of  biodiversity and decreasing the nation's store of natural  forests.    It said Japan's resort law has led to the construction of  golf courses and resorts totaling 5 million hectares and  ``causing the clearing of vast areas of natural forests,  especially beech.''    The statement said Japanese timber cannot compete with  low-priced wood from Canada, the United States, Indonesia, and  Malaysia, while imports of timber are causing ``devastation'' in  Southeast Asia, North America, and Siberia.    It called for the ITTO to monitor the trade in boreal and  temperate timber as well as tropical timber.    The weeklong ITTO meeting began November 10 at its  headquarters in Yokohama. Participants are discussing measures  to achieve sustainable management of tropical forests by 2000.    Tropical timber producing countries from Asia, Africa and  Latin America, and consumer countries such as Japan, the U.S.,  European Community (EC) nations, Russia and China are attending  the ITTO board of directors' meeting and standing committee  meeting.    Government representatives from 49 ITTO member countries are  also attending. Officials from international organizations and  nongovernmental organizations are present as observers.    The Yokohama-based ITTO consists of 23 producing countries  such as Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Malaysia, Indonesia and India,  and 26 consumer nations including Australia, Canada, China,  Japan, Germany, France and the U.S.     "

THE COMPLEX ISSUE OF AIRCRAFT LIMITS IS UNRESOLVED.      By NORMAN KEMPSTER and JACK NELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      U.S. and Soviet officials said Saturday that negotiators have broken a deadlock  and moved closer to a historic agreement to slash troop levels and conventional  weapons in Europe.    There was no official announcement of the development as President Bush and  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded three days of summit meetings with  an informal session at the Camp David retreat in Maryland. However, a ranking  Soviet official said in an interview, ""The stalemate you Americans talked about  is over. I don't think any problems remain.""    U.S. officials were far more cautious in their assessment. ""The deal is not  done yet,"" a senior American official cautioned, but he confirmed that the  impasse was broken.    Bush and Gorbachev, preparing to return to Washington after about 10 hours of  wide-ranging discussions at the retreat, declared that they had deepened their  understanding of each other's positions on what the Soviet leader had called  ""the global flash points.""    ""We have an awful lot of common ground,"" Bush said.    Calling the day ""very instructive,"" Gorbachev said, ""I think there is really  ample opportunity for cooperation even though there are real problems that  neither the President nor I can turn a blind eye to.""    Questioned by reporters, Bush sharply defended his decision to proceed with a  trade agreement with Moscow despite the continuing economic embargo of  Lithuania.    ""I look at the overall relationship,"" Bush said, asserting that the trade  accord is ""in the interest of the United States.""    ""Somebody wants to argue with me, fine, we'll take him on,"" he said.    Bush and Gorbachev did not comment publicly on the conventional arms issue. In  Washington, an American official said substantial progress was made toward  agreements on limiting numbers of tanks, destruction of weapons that are taken  out of service and the issue of verifying destruction of weapons. Unresolved,  he said, were limits on aircraft, probably the most complex topic facing the  conventional arms talks.    The progress toward a treaty to reduce conventional forces -- one of the  superpowers' chief arms control goals this year -- comes as another positive  note in U.S.-Soviet relations at a summit that both sides already were hailing  as a success.    It helped to counterbalance continuing differences over several other major  issues, including two of the most vexing of the relationship: whether a unified  Germany will be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Soviet  handling of the independence movement in the Baltic states.    Bush and Gorbachev again took up Lithuania and Germany during their more than  eight hours of discussions Saturday at the presidential retreat, an  Administration official said, but only to go over what they will say at a joint  press conference at the White House today -- the climax of the summit.    Soviet officials have said they expect two more Bush-Gorbachev summits to be  held later this year, one to sign a treaty reducing conventional forces,  assuming it is completed this year, and another at Moscow to sign a treaty  drastically reducing strategic or long-range nuclear weapons (START). The  conventional forces pact would be signed, probably in Paris, at a meeting of  the heads of all 35 nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe.    On Friday the two leaders signed a framework for a START treaty and indicated  that they thought they had narrowed their differences on remaining issues.  Although some sources suggested the Moscow summit would be officially announced  today, an Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  such a meeting could not be announced until it is certain that a START treaty  will be ready for signing this year.    In the sunshine and relaxed setting of Camp David, the two presidents removed  their ties and sat around a large patio table Saturday as they discussed a wide  ranging of regional issues, touching on Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba, Nicaragua,  El Salvador, India and Pakistan, and the Middle East.    It was ""not in a sense of dividing up the world,"" Bush said. ""Maybe that would  have happened years ago. In terms of ironing the problems, achieving common  ground, as we looked at a lot of regional problems.""    ""It's been a big day,"" Gorbachev said.    Bush quipped that he had only one disappointment from their time together --  that coming at the camp's horseshoe pit. The Soviet president, who never played  the sport before, ""literally, threw a ringer the first time,"" Bush gasped.  ""There's not much more to say.""    In an earlier briefing for reporters, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary,  said the President and the Soviet leader included a thorough discussion of  human rights in their Saturday session.    They discussed ways to increase the number of Jews emigrating from the Soviet  Union and ""talked about direct flights to Israel and the general problems about  allowing emigration to be as free and open as possible,"" Fitzwater said.    Bush noted that the United States is accepting about 70,000 emigres annually  now compared to 14,000 a few years ago, Fitzwater said, adding that ""we  continue to want to take more.""    During the day, U.S. and Soviet officials also issued a joint statement  announcing a new cooperative effort to ferry relief supplies to Ethiopian  famine victims. The statement said U.S. food would be hauled to stricken areas  on Soviet aircraft ""to demonstrate our joint commitment to responding to this  tragic humanitarian problem.""    U.S. and Soviet negotiators plan to brief their allies on the results of the  talks on Monday. Unlike the superpower negotiations over reduction of  long-range nuclear weapons, the Conventional Forces in Europe conference is a  multinational affair including the 16 members of NATO and the seven members of  the Warsaw Pact.    A senior U.S. official said American and Soviet negotiators reached tentative  agreements defining classes of tanks and armored vehicles and establishing  limitations on them. But he said nothing can be considered final until the  other NATO nations give their approval.    ""Most of those are likely to be acceptable to the allies, but there are at  least one or two that will require some careful study and may or may not work,""  the official said. ""On some of these issues, ceilings and weights, allied  equipment is affected more than American equipment.""    The Soviet official said that difficulties may develop between Washington and  its allies.    ""We don't have that problem any more,"" he added in a somewhat rueful reference  to the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact -- which has left Moscow virtually  without allies.    Bush and Gorbachev signed a joint statement Friday fixing a goal of completion  of a conventional arms pact by the end of this year.    Although it has often been overlooked by a world public preoccupied with the  destructive power of nuclear weapons, the sophistication and destructive power  of non-nuclear arms in Europe has mushroomed during the years of the Cold War.  Western leaders see the Vienna talks as an opportunity to roll back Soviet  power in Europe and end the hair-trigger confrontation that has lasted for more  than a generation.    ""A war in Europe would mean total, irreversible catastrophe,"" Valentin M.  Falin, head of the international department of the Soviet Communist Party, said  Saturday.

THE COMPLEX ISSUE OF AIRCRAFT LIMITS IS UNRESOLVED.      By NORMAN KEMPSTER and JACK NELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      U.S. and Soviet officials said Saturday that negotiators have broken a deadlock  and moved closer to a historic agreement to slash troop levels and conventional  weapons in Europe.    There was no official announcement of the development as President Bush and  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded three days of summit meetings with  an informal session at the Camp David retreat in Maryland. However, a ranking  Soviet official said in an interview, ""The stalemate you Americans talked about  is over. I don't think any problems remain.""    U.S. officials were far more cautious in their assessment. ""The deal is not  done yet,"" a senior American official cautioned, but he confirmed that the  impasse was broken.    Bush and Gorbachev, preparing to return to Washington after about 10 hours of  wide-ranging discussions at the retreat, declared that they had deepened their  understanding of each other's positions on what the Soviet leader had called  ""the global flash points.""    ""We have an awful lot of common ground,"" Bush said.    Calling the day ""very instructive,"" Gorbachev said, ""I think there is really  ample opportunity for cooperation even though there are real problems that  neither the President nor I can turn a blind eye to.""    Questioned by reporters, Bush sharply defended his decision to proceed with a  trade agreement with Moscow despite the continuing economic embargo of  Lithuania.    ""I look at the overall relationship,"" Bush said, asserting that the trade  accord is ""in the interest of the United States.""    ""Somebody wants to argue with me, fine, we'll take him on,"" he said.    Bush and Gorbachev did not comment publicly on the conventional arms issue. In  Washington, an American official said substantial progress was made toward  agreements on limiting numbers of tanks, destruction of weapons that are taken  out of service and the issue of verifying destruction of weapons. Unresolved,  he said, were limits on aircraft, probably the most complex topic facing the  conventional arms talks.    The progress toward a treaty to reduce conventional forces -- one of the  superpowers' chief arms control goals this year -- comes as another positive  note in U.S.-Soviet relations at a summit that both sides already were hailing  as a success.

He added  that such accusation had adverse impacts on China's export trade  worth billions of U.S. dollars. Last year saw 37 such cases,  registering the greatest ever number in a single year. There  were 12 cases under the anti-dumping accusation during the first  quarter of this year which should arouse great concern because  such accusation from abroad targeting China's export trade have  tended to grow serious.    The United States, Canada, the European Community and  Australia were the very countries in the past to file protest  with China for its alleged dumping overseas. Other countries  including Japan, South Korea, Denmark [as received], South  Africa, Chile Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria followed suit since  1992.    The anti-dumping practice was just against a particular kind  of export item in the past but such practice turns to most of  China's export items at present. Some South America countries  such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela accused  China of committing alleged dumping of a certain kind of export  item in great quantity nearly in each of their anti-dumping  movements [sentence as received].    Key export items including machinery products and textiles  showed an increasing portion in the items which were alleged to  be involved in the dumping practice. Colour televisions,  microwave ovens, electric fans and bicycles were put under  anti-dumping investigation by the U.S., South Africa and the  European Community last year while preparations on anti-dumping  campaign were made by Japan, South American countries and the  European Community to target China's other export items such as  textiles, clothing and sport shoes.    Three type foreign-funded enterprises run in China tended to  be under attack for their alleged dumping practice overseas.  Nearly each anti-dumping campaign carried out abroad in recent  years involved products turned out by these enterprises. Bad  influence will be cast on the use of foreign capital by China in  a long run [sentence as received].    Accusation of dumping made by foreign countries on many  occasions mainly lied in some reasons [sentence as received].  First, a long term economic slump in Western countries, the  rising trade protectionism and being jealous of China's vast  trade surplus in recent years played an important role in such  accusation. Second, following the reform of the foreign trade  system in China, the export channels tended to increase but  administration of and control over export items which carry no  export quota nor export permit stopped short. Some enterprises'  practice of lowering prices of their products in order to  strengthen their competitiveness gave a pretext for such  accusation.     "

The goals that the U.S. Administration has set for itself  are  slowly emerging. Above all, the longer a war lasts, the more it  attracts more foreign forces -- Russians and possibly a growing  number of Islamic radicals from Asia and Africa -- but this  should dry out quickly. The order after the war should ensure  that the major part of the eastern Adriatic coast remains in  reliable hands, and that Russian influence remain as small as  possible in the western Balkans. The United States wants to be  able to rely on the states in the region that share the same  vital interests.    The United States is confronted with other powers in the  region -- above all, the Serbs who have captured territory in  Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia is the state with the greatest  concentration of weapons in Europe west of Russia. Still, this  is not a factor that might disturb U.S. circles in the long run.  However, because the United States and its Western allies are  determined not to use military force against the Serbs, Serbia  is the one power in southeastern Europe that the United States  is treating very cautiously and with great consideration. A  soft Western -- and U.S. -- attitude, even encouragement, has  made President Milosevic important in Belgrade.    Serbia is being endorsed by Russia, which found a supporter  in Belgrade after its return to world politics. An old affinity  strengthens relations, which is in line with the political  pan-Slavism that is again spreading in Moscow. Russia has been  striving for predominance in the Balkans since the last century.  First, the Turkish, then the Hapsburg empires were in its way,  then it removed itself with the introduction of Bolshevism.  After his World War II victory, only Tito, who wanted to be a  Stalin himself, prevented the Moscow empire from taking  possession of the whole Balkans. For the first time after the  changes in Europe in 1990, there is a renewed opportunity for  Russia to gain a political foothold in southeastern Europe. The  Russian objective is diametrically opposed to that of the United  States: Moscow wants to establish a sphere of influence that  extends as far as possible from Serbia to the west and north, as  far as the Adriatic Sea, and toward Central Europe.    In the former Yugoslavia, West European powers have  relinquished the field to the two major world powers. If their  influence increases again, Great Britain and France in  particular will not only pursue common Western but also their  own interests -- which might collide with U.S. interests. This,  and not only the Russians, may be one reason for Washington's  hurry.    The United States would prefer a Bosnian state within its  old  boundaries. Yet Washington knows of Belgrade's plans for a  greater Serbia, which are being encouraged by Russia. There are  also doubts that the Serbs in Bosnia will form a common state  together with the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. Some things --  including Washington's lack of interest in the Serbian  offensives in eastern and northern Bosnia -- suggest that the  United States has accepted Bosnia's partition. Then the United  States would be left only with the task of ensuring a  sufficiently large and coherent territory for the  Muslim-Croatian canton state proclaimed, under its leadership,  after negotiations with the Serbs and Russia.    The United States would certainly welcome a return of the  Croatian territories occupied by the Serbs. Yet what efforts  will it attempt to ensure that Serbia gives up the most valuable  result, strategically and economically, of its war of conquest?  The ""normalization"" being negotiated between the Zagreb  government and the Serbian leaders in the occupied territories  might finally consist of Croatia being granted sovereignty over  these territories that exists only on paper, and in Croatia  having to content itself with the reopening of the traffic  routes. Then the Serbian war of aggression would have been  worthwhile in Croatia -- just as in Bosnia.    The United States would then be the protector of a reduced  Bosnia and an amputated Croatia. However, it also appears to  view Macedonia and Albania as countries belonging to its sphere  of influence. Yet there are obstacles and uncertainties. The  Greek ethnic lobby group in the United States prevents the  administration from efficiently supporting Macedonia against the  Greek blockade. Albania is anxiously looking at neighboring  Kosovo. If Serbian authorities increase the mistreatment of the  Albanian population there, there might be a mass exodus to  Albania one day.    How would the protector, the United States, react? As early  as today, Washington may be considering a partition of Kosovo,  with the ""ethnically cleansed"" portion remaining part of Serbia.  The other half with the double Albanian population would fall  to Albania. Yet such a cut would leave behind deep wounds. The  United States would have to guard another trouble spot.     "

0,FT942-9045 ,"FT942-9045 _AN-EERD0AA5FT 940518   FT  18 MAY 94 / Harare sows seeds for an investment harvest / Review of the progress and potential of an ambitious structural adjustment programme      By TONY HAWKINS   Political transition in South Africa and economic reform in Zimbabwe are transforming the regional business climate, suggesting that Zimbabwe's investment promotion conference, starting in London tomorrow, will prove far more successful than its predecessor five years ago. Then, Zimbabwe had not embraced structural adjustment, and South Africa appeared headed for long-running, bloody confrontation. After a slow start in 1991, economic reform in Zimbabwe has accelerated over the past 18 months with two substantial tranches of exchange control and foreign payments liberalisation. This was complemented by price deregulation, labour laws and investment regulations, the commercialisation  -though not yet privatisation - of some state enterprises, the freeing of interest rates and a partial exchange rate float. In January, the Zimbabwe dollar was devalued by 17 per cent and quantitative import controls were abolished. A two-tier exchange rate system was created with exporters allowed to retain 60 per cent of their foreign earnings, selling the balance to the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe at the official exchange rate. Initially, the free market rate traded at a discount of some 5 per cent below the official rate of ZDollars 8 to the dollar, but the gap has since narrowed to less than 1 per cent, and the market is to be unified later this year when exporters will retain all their earnings and all current account transactions will have been liberalised. This cannot come too soon for some of the multinationals attending this week's meeting. In an effort to attract new investment, Zimbabwe has - mistakenly - favoured the relatively few newcomers (Tony O Reilly's Heinz and Algy Cluff's gold mines being the two most notable) over the long-standing players such as Unilever, Dunlop, Carnaud Metal Box, Barclays and Standard Chartered Banks . For the past decade, pre-independence investors were not allowed to remit more than 25 per cent of after-tax profits, while new arrivals were allowed 50 per cent. These regulations have since been loosened allowing post-1993 investors 100 per cent repatriation, while existing companies are allowed to remit 50 per cent of profits. Zimbabwe is committed to levelling the field, almost certainly this year which, with the eventual release of blocked funds, will stimulate increased investment activity by existing companies. Portfolio investment was liberalised last year when foreign investors were allowed to trade on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. In the nine months since this reform took effect, foreigners have injected some Dollars 80m into the market contributing to the 300 per cent surge in share prices over the past year. All this is very different from the 1980s when foreign direct investment averaged a mere Dollars 20m a year. Inflows have since accelerated markedly averaging Dollars 60m a year since 1990. Two big new projects are in the pipeline; the Dollars 225m BHP-Utah platinum mine at Chegutu and a proposed Hong Kong-financed airport hotel and casino close to Harare. The Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIC), set up to facilitate and promote investment, approved 843 projects worth some ZDollars 5.6bn (Dollars 1.4bn) between 1989 and 1993. Of these, 100 were foreign and a further 159 were joint-ventures, valued at Dollars 470m, though not all of this represented foreign inflows. In the first quarter of 1994, a further 67 projects were approved, representing new investment of almost Dollars 200m, of which Dollars 63m was foreign or joint-venture. Zimbabwe needs much more; the most disturbing aspect of the ZIC numbers is the number of jobs created. Investment of some Dollars 800m in the last two and a half years has generated less than 35,000 new jobs. With an annual net addition of about 200,000 school-leavers to the labour market, the implication is that the country needs to invest nearly Dollars 5bn annually, or 25 per cent more than its GDP, merely to peg unemployment at its present level of around 30 per cent. Clearly, that is not going to happen, implying a combination of higher levels of unemployment and enhanced reliance on the informal sector. Higher investment levels are also needed to kick-start the sluggish economy. Since independence in 1980, real GDP growth has fallen behind the 3.1 per cent rate of population increase, expanding at 2.8 per cent annually. As a result real income per head is lower than at independence and 16 per cent below its peak of the mid-1970s. Assuming the economy can grow at a steady 5 per cent a year, it will take a decade to regain 1975 living standards. Policy reform is a significant part of the solution, but weak commodity prices, adverse weather conditions, and regional political instability have left their mark on the economy. With commodity prices seemingly on the upturn and the regional political environment better than any time for over 30 years, investment prospects have brightened considerably. Regional investment should improve with the political climate, but there are fears that investors, motivated as the International Finance Corporation notes, by market size more than anything else, will plump for South Africa's Dollars 112bn market rather than Zimbabwe's Dollars 4bn. For Pretoria's neighbours, it is a swings and roundabouts situation. Market size, infrastructure and logistics dictate that a stable South Africa, accounting for more than 80 per cent of southern African GDP, will attract the lion's share of new investment. But Zimbabwe with its relatively efficient infrastructure, its plentiful cheap labour and close proximity to the South African hub of Pretoria Witwatersrand-Vereeniging, should be able to exploit new and different market opportunities. For this to happen Zimbabwean business will have to rethink its strategy, seeking niche markets and going for joint-venture opportunities in alliances with South African business rather than risking head-on competition. None of this will happen without continuing, and urgent, policy reform and a stronger commitment to an economy, that welcomes foreign capital and skills and facilitates cross-border commerce and investment.

During an interview that lasted more than an hour with Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Kellenberger said he was also  interested in learning about the dispute between the United  States and Cuba. He expressed his government's sympathy with  the complex situation the Latin American country is experiencing.    The Cuban foreign minister, who made a technical stop in  Bern  before beginning his tour of five African nations, told PRENSA  LATINA that, although informal, his stay had been very important  and fruitful for the development of future bilateral ties.    Besides his meeting with Kellenberger, who is also the  political director of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs,  the Caribbean minister met with Heinrich Reimann, the ambassador  and chief of the Department of African, Middle East, Asian, and  Latin American Affairs at the Swiss Foreign Ministry.    He visited the parliament of the Swiss Confederation, where  he was briefed on that body's organization.    Local authorities expressed their willingness to hold talks.  In response, Robaina invited the secretary of state to visit  Havana.    Switzerland and Cuba are working on a bilateral agreement to  promote and protect investments, similar to those Cuba has  signed with other European countries.    The Cuban foreign minister saw Nicolas Imboden, the  ambassador of the Federal Department of Public Economy [name and  title as received], before concluding his brief stay in this  capital. Imboden, who is also in charge of commerce and  investment, expressed his interest in some sort of trade  exchange with Cuba.    Robaina gave interviews to BERNER ZEITUNG, the leading  newspaper here, and Radio Switzerland International.    The Cuban minister will arrive in Ghana on Sunday, on the  first leg of a venture through Africa that will take him to the  People's Republic of Angola, then on to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and  finally Namibia.

How would you sum it up?    [Chissano] Well, you know, we started the struggle together.  Actually, I must say that the ANC inspired the struggle for the  liberation of the whole of Africa when it was created in 1912.  We in Mozambique were also inspired by that although our  liberation movement started much later, but not to go far back  in history I would say -- speak to you about the years ... the  '60s. In '61 we started organizing our liberation movements  with the support of all the freedom fighters of the region,  including South Africa. Around '63 we were training together  with South Africans, Mozambicans, Angolans, Ghanaians, in  Algeria, when all these countries came to the conclusion that  the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the  Portuguese colonies didn't want peaceful change towards freedom  and independence, so our contribution for the eradication of  apartheid starts from that cooperation of the liberation  movements.    We got independence before South Africa and we continued to  offer our support, to struggle together. We made analysis on  the forms of the struggle, the tactics to be applied as times  were changing and we came to certain conclusions which led us in  Mozambique to be in contact with the regime, to confront the  regime directly here in South Africa, while the ANC and the  other liberation movements were continuing to press -- put  pressure through the armed struggle and other forms of struggle,  but we continued together in the diplomatic field and political  field, both individually and through the Frontline States, and  in multilateral organizations like OAU and Non-Aligned Movement.  We were very much active. We ... the ANC didn't have to be  present in order to put forward the case of South Africa. We  were always there and we put always, as a first priority, the  liberation of South Africa -- well, I'm speaking after the  independence of Zimbabwe because before it was Zimbabwe,  Namibia, and South Africa.    [Mashokwe] Is there a feeling of achievement? Is there a  feeling in your heart as president of Mozambique that you have  contributed to a worthy cause?    [Chissano] Yes, in my heart, as a person I have no doubt  that  I have given all my best, because when I speak about  coordination during the arms struggle I am one who was lucky to  be together with my Comrade Modise, in the offices of the ANC in  Lusaka, or elsewhere, and to coordinate and to plan, even to see  how could smuggle in weapons and so forth with Modise.    [Mashokwe] These are stories in the old South African terms.    [Chissano] In the old South African terms and Portuguese  terms, but we ... it was a challenging aspect, and also it  happened that I was the first prime minister in Mozambique at  transition period and I had to deal, at that time of transition  with the racist regimes, both in South Africa and in Rhodesia.  Then I became foreign minister. As a foreign minister my task,  primary task, was to support international forums -- the cause  of liberation -- whether its OAU -- in many occasions I had to  forget about the problems of Mozambique, to concentrate on this,  because we did not feel free in Mozambique without the freedom  of South Africa -- or there to offer Zimbabwe, in fact  Mozambique has suffered the most ruthless destabilization and  destruction by direct invasions from the South African forces  and also the Rhodesian forces and later by the utilization of  Mozambican artificially created movements. And we had a lot of  destruction, so it was very much logical that we should be keen  to work for the freedom of our brothers in South Africa and in  Rhodesia.    [Mashokwe] What do you expect, Mr. President, from a free  and  a democratic South Africa? What do you expect that South Africa  to do to small Mozambique, in terms of economic power?    [Chissano] To say the truth we expect the same thing -- that  we join hands and we cooperate the same way. We plan knowing  that the success of one is the success of the other, and we  should wish to bring success to the other. Who can more, should  help, who can less as we have done in the past. [sentence as  heard] So, we hope that South Africa will be a spokesman, not  only for South Africa but also for the other countries in the  region, so that we have, will fulfill our plan of creating a  region which cooperates towards integration, which brings a  harmonious growth of the economies of the countries in benefit  of all in the country.    We will not demand that the countries which are more  advanced  should slow the pace, but we will demand that those who are more  developed help give a hand to the others and help them to grow  until we can reach a certain balance, which is a necessary thing  to create an internal market in the region, so that we, from  that point, we become competitive as a region in the world and  we assume our rightful place in the world -- a rightful place  which is given to us, is there for us, because we have a big  potential of resources.    Our resources pooled together make of our region one of the  richest regions in the world, and therefore, we must know how to  coordinate. This is why we expected that South Africa is going  to join SADC [Southern African Development Community]. Already  we are cooperating with South Africa within SADC -- with this  constructive spirit, without the aim of competition but with the  spirit of complimentarity. [sentence as heard]    [Mashokwe] Would you be surprised if it was the South  African Government, Mr. President, that would have wanted to  kill President Samora Machel then?    [Chissano] I would be surprised if it was the South African  Government, but I would not be surprised if it were anyone in  the armed forces of South Africa. The reason for me to say this  is because when the war came to an end in Zimbabwe, for  instance, we had a talk with Mr. Peter Ells and with Mr. Ken  Flower, and we agreed on certain issues, and one of the issues  was that the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] people who  were serving there should not be allowed to cross the border  into Mozambique, and that they should be handed over to us with  an agreement that we would not ill treat them, and we also would  not smuggle in weapons for ZANU [Zimbabwe African National  Union] into Mozambique. But what Peter Ells did was to bring  these people into South Africa and to reorganize their fight  from here, and together with the South African officers who paid  the Renamo people -- so the Renamo fight was led actually by  officers from the South African defense forces. And there are  some who did not believe in change even after the change of  government here. There are some who continued giving headaches  to De Klerk and his friends, therefore whether it was condemned  by government or not, the possibility of having South African  security forces -- whether they or the intelligence services,  this is a strong possibility.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion, Mr. President, was it worthwhile  to  have signed the Nkomati Accord?    [Chissano] Yes, I think it was worthwhile, because first of  all it has decreased the direct participation of the South  African defense forces in the war in Mozambique. Secondly, it  has created a new atmosphere in the region, including in the  minds of the whites in South Africa themselves. They started  thinking about change in South Africa and thinking about  business with the neighbors. There was a conflict created  within the white community in South Africa because they had to  judge the validity of the Nkomati Accord. That's when they  started thinking about how to deal with the people in prison and  Robben Island, and all this -- the Nkomati Accord was a ferment  for us for many things. There was a big discussion in the  world, and the fact that there was a big discussion about that  in the world, even in the ranks of the ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] and so forth, our friends and so forth, it was good  because it was focussed more and more on the struggle in South  Africa and the measures to be taken both by the Western  countries, the Eastern countries, and it came at a time when the  Eastern countries, who were the backbone of the support to the  struggle for independence and freedom, were becoming weakened,  because they were weakened. And so the tactics of struggle had  to change, and so the Nkomati Accord was a culmination of the  change of tactics of struggle against apartheid.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for talking to us, and  thanks for giving us your time.    [Chissano] Thank you. You are welcome.    [Mashokwe] The bandits in your area, as they are termed,  have wrecked everything. Do you have hope that that will be  corrected and how will that be corrected?    [Chissano] Well, we have started already the work. We have a  program of national reconstruction which is aimed at rebuilding  all what have been destroyed, starting from the social services,  health centers, hospitals, schools, and coming to the commercial  network, shops, and going to roads, in order to facilitate the  life of the citizens, especially in the countryside, in the  rural areas, then we also ... we will pay attention to the  reconstruction of factories, like sugar factories, tea  factories, which were destroyed and the reopening of mines which  were closed during the war, gold mines, marble mines, graphite  mines which are being reopened, and other ... other activities.    We are also reopening the traffic through the railroads  towards the interland countries like South Africa, which is  somehow an interland country in some regions, Zimbabwe, Zambia,  Malawi, and also we are serving a bit of Botswana, and Swaziland  and Lesotho. So we are going to call for investments. We are  calling for investments, for internal investments of nationals,  trying to create conditions so that we create new businessmen,  which is African, black businessmen in Mozambique and other  Mozambicans who are not black, because even those who are not  black -- and not many who were businessmen in Mozambique in the  past, but we are also going to attract as we are doing already,  the foreign investment, and through all this process we are  going to create jobs for the lots of unemployed people.    As you know we have more than 1 million people who were  refugees outside the country and more than 3.5 million people  who were displaced inside the country, therefore, these people  have got no jobs -- about 4-5 million people who are ... have no  real jobs. So we aim at creating conditions for self-employment  in some projects but also through these investments we are going  to create jobs. The process of national reconstruction itself  will create some jobs, but most important thing will be the  training of personnel. The human resources development program  is very important. The integration of the demobilized soldiers  in the civil life is very important and again here it's about  creating jobs or self-employment by helping them to start their  own projects, their own initiatives.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, there is no peace yet -- total  peace in Mozambique. We know of efforts, we know your  government's position, but why should a South African business  person go and invest in an unstable area now?    [Chissano] To say the truth, we have peace. There are some  acts of criminality which are here and there, the same way as  they exist in London or in Chicago or in Washington, or even in  South Africa, Johannesburg, but we cannot speak about war. We  cannot speak about the same amount of instability.    In fact, three weeks ago, I have inaugurated these graphite  mines in which there is a South African company which is  participating, and that graphite mine is placed in area which  was dangerous in the past. We had started work. We had to put  a battalion to protect the area but now that battalion is not  there. We don't have soldiers there. We have taken them all  away and so the mine is operating without need of special  security. It has got the normal security which all mines have  and there is a factory there. The people are living in the  area, the workers and ... it's very active -- we have started  exporting now this graphite, so it means that we have peace  since October 1992.    We have peace so small incidents of criminal nature, of  course, these exist, but we have a program. After we finish  demobilization we will concentrate on the process of collecting  unlawful weapons which are enabling these hooligans to create  some trouble here and there. This is a process which we are  going to undertake in cooperation with South Africa because in  South Africa you have the same problem. You have too much  weapons in the hands of people, but we cannot speak now of war.    I can say there is peace and economic activity has started  and many investors, Americans, and Ireland investors are there  with big projects. Some other British have investments. South  Africans themselves have in tourism and many other aspects, so  investments are already there.    [Mashokwe] Is it the old Lorenco Marques that South Africans  used to know or this the Maputo -- the new Lorenco Marques?    [Chissano] No, Maputo is not the new Lorenco Marques because  Lorenco Marques was a time of apartheid without the name of  apartheid. I may say even that it was worse than apartheid  because the Portuguese used to say that they didn't have  racialism and discrimination and so forth, but in fact it was  worse, because as far as I was informed, apartheid meant  separate development, but in Mozambique blacks didn't have  development. [60-second advertising break]    [Chissano, in progress] ... and our government informed the  other parties that the government was not satisfied and the  government wanted that this question and the other questions  which were not answered that they should be addressed,  therefore, that inquiry would give us just a lead to proceed the  inquiry, and we hope that if there is still possibility that the  inquiry can be made. Not that we want to accuse someone but we  want to be satisfied that the inquiry has been concluded and  that questions have been answered. If we find that was it  someone outside South Africa we will be glad.     "

For several months American police have had information that  an international gang has succeeded in using Cyprus to launder a  large amount of money received from the sale of drugs.    According to our information, the American police and the  Cypriot police are cooperating to investigate this case and  locate the people behind it.

0,FT932-10997 ,"FT932-10997 _AN-DEFCSAD7FT 930506   FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: Africa needs new economic medicine      From Mr STEWART WALLIS   Sir, Your comment on our Africa: Make or Break report ('Diagnosing Africa's ills', April 29), is right to point to the past and present policy failures of some African governments. Misguided economic policies, autocracy, endemic corruption and armed conflict have been part of the lethal cocktail which threatens to consign the region's citizens to deepening poverty. This is why northern governments should encourage the moves towards democratisation, peace and economic policy realism now taking place in many African countries with a 'Marshall plan' for recovery. Seven years after the Group of Seven industrial countries grudgingly accepted the need for debt relief, the world's poorest region is being drained of Dollars 10bn annually. There can be no moral or economic justification for this, especially in the wake of the massive debt relief measures agreed for Russia. This is why Oxfam is calling on Britain to press for a new initiative on African debt at the G7 summit in July. Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), implemented by African governments under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, have failed to create a platform for economic recovery and even more conspicuously to address the challenge of poverty alleviation. The World Bank's own most recent review confirmed that SAPs have a particularly bad record in terms of restoring investment, the yardstick against which recovery prospects must be measured. In part, this can be traced to the impact of deflationary monetary policies and sweeping trade liberalisation measures under SAPs. These have exposed fragile, but potentially competitive, manufacturing industries to increased competition in the face of spiralling interest rates and rising import costs. The predictable result has been disinvestment, de-industrialisation and mounting unemployment. Rather than apportion blame between doctor and patient, surely it is time to recognise that both are hooked on the wrong medicine. It is time for the World Bank and IMF to surrender their dogmatic attachment to an outmoded set of economic prescriptions. What is needed is a new approach to adjustment, based on redistribution policies, selective import liberalisation, more carefully phased market reforms and above all a commitment to increased investment in human capital.

I would like to ask you one very personal  question. You studied in South Africa. You were at Fort Hare  University, and you have been avoiding coming to this country  for very a long time. With the demise of apartheid how do you  feel being back in the Cape?    [Mugabe] It's a great feeling to be back to South Africa. I  was back actually at the time of the inauguration, to attend the  inauguration of President Mandela, and that was a great feeling,  a great feeling indeed because I had last been here in 1952,  only when I came back for graduation. I stayed in South Africa,  I think for two years up to 19...[pauses] end of '51, in the  Eastern Cape. A lot of things have happened since then, when I  was at Fort Hare, and apartheid was just beginning to be  implemented, and I remember the students who belonged to the  African National Congress Youth League planning real action by  way of demonstrations, sit-ins, and passive resistance, but  after that the struggle took other dimensions, and there was  armed struggle.    It was during that period -- we were in exile together with  the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and together we  planned the strategies to defeat colonialism in whatever form,  whether it was in the form of apartheid or in form of UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence], as in southern  Rhodesia then. And we got our independence in 1980, 14 years  before South Africa got its freedom and democracy.    Of course, when we got our own freedom, we never regarded  that as complete freedom of Africa, and we had always worked on  a program, yes, for us to get our own freedom in what was  Rhodesia, but also for others -- Namibia to get its own  independence; South Africa to get its own freedom and democracy,  and that was a long, long wait, a very long wait indeed. We all  longed for a day when apartheid would go, when we could interact  with South Africa, and we could visit South Africa and the South  Africans could visit us. The day has now come, so it's a  tremendous joy.    [Mashokwe] Were you at all surprised by the turn of events  come February 1990, when President De Klerk then announced these  changes?    [Mugabe] Yes, a mixture of both surprise and disbelief.  Surprise, because we never expected that the leader of an  Afrikaner Party, the National Party, which in fact had been the  initiator of apartheid, could one day reverse it in that  dramatic way. It was indeed dramatic, too dramatic for us to  believe, but there it was.    When it was first announced, we thought it was just  palliative, the statement was just palliative in that apartheid  would not really go, but when one measure after another was  taken to undo it and completely eradicate it from the statute  book, then we started to believe.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you ever regret the stance that  you took? You were known to be very vocal against apartheid.  You didn't mince your words on this. When you look back, your  country suffered a lot of economic ills. You were destabilized  in the process. When you look back, do you have any regrets?    [Mugabe] We don't regret having taken the steps that we  took.  In fact, a country like Zimbabwe, who did not go the full length  in opposing apartheid -- we wished we could have done more, but  it was not possible because of the linkage between our economies  -- the South African economy and Zimbabwe, a linkage that was  consolidated by Ian Smith during UDI, and when Rhodesia was made  to depend on South Africa. But politically, diplomatically we  took quite a rigid stand, and we were not to have anything to do  with those who were in charge of apartheid here and in  government, therefore, because we held them responsible. We  don't regret having taken that rigid stand at all, but we regret  the loss of life that ensued, the sabotage that was carried out  in Zimbabwe, destruction of ANC property and the loss of life  that followed that destruction of property. That we regret. We  still have those wounds. We still have the scars, the damaged  buildings. They still are there, and in fact we still have  prisoners we have arrested--people we have arrested for  committing those acts of sabotage. But all that was really the  amount of sacrifice we were called upon to make in order for us  to have the day that now we have. In order for us to return to  South Africa, we had to do all that.    [Mashokwe] The prisoners -- are they going to be released at  any stage? What are the possibilities?    [Mugabe] Well, we are reviewing their cases. There are only  five in our prison, and one of whom is a South African,  (?called) (Zwayo), and the other four were South Africa's agents  from white Rhodesia -- Rhodesians who worked with South Africa,  but President De Klerk and now President Mandela have all  appealed to me for possibly their release, but their death  sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment, and therefore  they are not going to die, but we are reviewing their cases.    I consulted with the Minister of Justice the other day, and  we thought we should review their cases in the same way as we  review the cases of our own, but now that here people have been  pardoned, people who were guilty of what one might call  political crimes, and had been pardoned, except a few, we might  very well review their cases in a favorable way.    [Mashokwe] In South Africa we talk of this truth commission  where South Africans are saying: Let's know what happened in the  past. Let's pardon people, including right-wingers probably.    [Mugabe] Pardons, sure, must be granted. The past must go.  Bygones must be bygones, and this is what I said in March 1980,  when I appealed to both the black and white community to work  together. They had to forget the past. They had now to  recognize that whether yesterday they had fought as enemies or  as allies, they could no longer actually do without each other,  whichever way things go. We shall live side by side with each  other, and therefore, there had to be a recognition of that  common belonging, a common denominator that came about as a  result of our independence.    The same with South Africa. There is that common denominator  and your situation here is even much more complex than our own.  We are only 10.5 million. You are 40-plus million, and  therefore it's a big population you have, but apart from that a  population that also subdivides itself into various races,  various tribes, people living in various regions and a number of  religious affiliations, and so it's a much more complex  situation, and I admire the stance that President Mandela and of  course the ANC have taken in demonstrating that this is now a  new South Africa, which requires a new ideology, a new political  outlook that binds everyone together and makes the people of  South Africa have a common destiny, which means there is that  greater sense of belonging to South Africa, greater sense of  nationality than there ever was before. At least that's what is  being cultivated and we admire that.    [Mashokwe] We talk now of the conference that you attended,  on the threshold of the new era. Many critics say that this  threshold never really reaches the ordinary people of southern  Africa, of Africa. What is your comment on this?    [Mugabe] No, it does reach to the ordinary people of African  grassroots, and we are always talking about the grassroots.  True, when policies are first enunciated they don't  immediately....[pauses] They don't go down to the masses until  they have been explained, but this is the work that our  subordinates must be doing in the regions and at various levels,  to tell the people that we are now one, but of course it will  take time for some of our people to forget and to forgive and  forget, but the leadership, if it does continue to preach  national reconciliation and national unity, national harmony,  the message will get through. I assure you.    [Mashokwe] Unemployment in Zimbabwe is said to be about a  fifth of your people there. We have the same kind of problems.  Is there no danger, not just in Zimbabwe -- South Africa has  the same problem -- is there no danger of unemployed people  overturning political gains?    [Mugabe] No, I think the numbers are exaggerated. We have  quite a lot of youngsters, yes, who are unemployed but our  situation is quite different from yours. We are less urbanized  than South Africa, less industrialized than South Africa. In  industries -- we have in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, yes --  but over 70 percent of the people, between 70 and 80 percent,  are over [sentence as heard]. And the youngsters who are  unemployed by and large are people with roots back in the rural  areas. They come into urban areas to seek employment, but when  they can't get that employment they go back to the rural areas.  There is hardly a Zimbabwean who says Harare is his home. None.    We all have our roots where people can do agriculture, and  this is a solution that really, that we find amongst us -- that  is, if the going is not that good in town, people can always go  back to the rural areas and eat, provided of course we have not  been struck by droughts, and so there is that aspect. People can  do agriculture, and our youth, we are now trying to mobilize so  some of them, I hope a substantial number, can pursue  agriculture you see, as a way of life. But this is not to say  we don't have a sizable number of people unemployed. Yes, the  reason they are unemployed is not because there had been any  mismanagement of the economy, but rather that colonial -- the  colonial legacy that we have has been that of underdevelopment  in what was regarded as the African sector in the rural areas  and also the development of skills was delayed or denied in some  cases.    Therefore, even though the jobs are there but they are jobs  for skilled men, and these cannot be found in every case. With  jobs in industry, even in the public service, you see, we have  jobs, but they require skilled people. In some cases the white  employers go out of Zimbabwe to get skilled personnel, people  with high skills whom they want to be managers or to be highly  trained technicians operating in the -- I mean, to undertake  operations in their industries. So that is one reason, but of  course we are now engaged in trying to transform the system and  opening it up to investment, encouraging existing investment to  expand and, thereby, create more jobs. It will take us time,  but we are doing that.    [Mashokwe] What role, Mr. President, do you see for South  Africa in the Southern African Development Community?    [Mugabe] Oh, a tremendous role. South Africa will now come  with its heavy muscle and join us. Heavy muscle, because it is  a highly developed country. It has its own problems, of course,  of underdevelopment in certain sectors, but you have highly  developed industries and that gives South Africa quite a muscle  with which it can interact with us as we relate to it, both  multilaterally within the region, and also bilaterally.    We trade with South Africa. Zimbabwe is the largest trading  partner South Africa has in Africa, and 20 percent of our  imports come from this country, and so we are quite a market.  Botswana gets about 80 percent of its imports from this country  and so also is a good market, and now what we want to see is an  economic order that binds us together in a cooperative way, and  of course the benefits must be reciprocal. We must open up our  borders, remove tariffs, or lower them for a start, and trade  with each other as freely as we can.    [Mashokwe] Is there no fear of this big brother image which  could probably bring about concern or suspicion?    [Mugabe] Oh, no, no, no. We are very happy. In fact we are  encouraging countries whom whenever we speak and this subject  arises, we always encourage countries to help South Africa at  this stage. South Africa will need a lot more of aid by way of  investment, even grants for a start. We had that kind of, you  know, boost at the beginning of our independence, and at least  to get us...[pauses] to get our economy to be reconstructed and  rehabilitated, and South Africa needs that kind of assistance  from the whole of the international community.    Yes, when one looks at Cape Town and Johannesburg, Durban,  and the other big cities one is impressed by what happens there.  But one must look also, even within those cities, at the  depressed areas, you see, the townships, that has been  neglected. One must look at the systems, social systems that  operate and see whether these systems are equitable or  inequitable. Look at the educational system. A lot needs to be  done really to rehabilitate, to reconstruct and restructure it  in such a way that it is the education that formally on the  blacks [as heard].    Education systems can be boosted, can be qualitatively  transformed and brought to the level of the education that was  obtained on the European side, and this is what we had to do in  our own country -- remove the inequities of the past, all the  inequalities.    That will require some funding, a lot, lot more funding and  investment is required in order for the economy to continue to  grow, and if South Africa prospers that way they will get the  benefits as well, by way of the new technology which has come to  South Africa.    There would be companies that will come to Zimbabwe, to  Botswana. We already have lots of South African companies in our  country and the technology that their parent companies acquire  here will be technology that the subsidiaries elsewhere will  require, but of course, within the system of our interaction,  cooperation, the benefits by way of technology will be our  benefits. The benefits by way of capital goods will also be our  benefit. We will use machinery for our mines from South Africa.  South Africa will sell them much more cheaply that Britain or  Germany, for obvious reasons, are likely to sell those same  goods to us. So, there is that benefit to be derived and we  don't think that money that comes to South Africa is money that  would have come to us, necessarily, no.    [Mashokwe] Fourteen years of Zimbabwe's independence. What  lessons are there for South Africa -- for this new emerging  democracy?    [Mugabe] Quite a number of lessons, and I don't think they  are lessons necessarily for the government or for Mandela. They  are lessons for the community. One, independence does not usher  in an era of manna falling from heaven. Never will there be  gifts the Almighty will shower down on the people of South  Africa. The people of South Africa have got to sweat, to work  hard. Now the environment is there. We must ask for the  opportunity, you see, for them to work. The opportunity for  them to have the necessary skills, the opportunity to be  appointed, given they have those skills, to jobs that they were  denied yesterday, and this is what the outlook must be on the  part of the people -- patience. They will require a great  amount of patience because delivery of benefits is a process, a  function really, of the development of industries.    Then there is the second aspect which has to do with racial  harmony. That has got to continue. If that fails then the  country is ushered into an era of conflict and a country as  large as South Africa, if it develops conflict you know what the  consequences will be and there will then be a spill over into  neighboring countries. One we would hope that doesn't happen.  We are glad that the policy that has been adopted by President  Mandela is one of racial harmony and one, of course, that seeks  now to get rid of the conflict between Inkatha and the ANC, the  conflict between the whites and the blacks, and if only the  people will heed that lesson, then we will have a very peaceful  and stable South Africa, but it will take time.    It has taken a long time for our own whites to adjust to the  new situation. Yesterday they were the leaders, they were,  well, the policy makers, and now that we are the policy makers  some of them find it extremely difficult to adjust.  Economically, they are still bosses in our country, the whites,  and they have not, you know, as it were, reoriented their  thinking. They have not fully adjusted. Some have adjusted but  they are only a small number.    Ian Smith is still talking the same UD language ... UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] language as in 1965.  He hasn't adjusted, but we didn't have to adjust. We adopted  the policies that we espoused, even during the liberation  struggle. We said to ourselves we are not fighting the white  man because he is white. We are fighting his policies. Once  those policies have gone the white man becomes acceptable, but  he will have to accept the new order, but you have people like  Ian Smith. You have your own Ian Smiths here who will continue  to fight for the old order, even though it's a futile struggle,  but it will continue until [laughs] death takes them, and so  really, we have got to be patient, and I would hope that my  brother President Mandela will be patient with them and not get  annoyed. We have been patient with Ian Smith. He still runs  his farm. We have not confiscated it in any way. We ...  sometimes you feel... [pauses] you feel the man is completely  unrepentant. Why continue to treat him justly, but then sense  and I think, magnanimity bids that, well, that the man is  harmless anyway. Let him have his outpourings and they won't do  anyone any harm.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, I'm running out of time.    [Mugabe] Yes?    [Mashokwe] The issue of the Frontline States, will it still  be there as the OAU has been accused of not being able to  address its own socioeconomic and political problems. Let's  look at Rwanda for instance?    [Mugabe] Yes, the Frontline States no longer have a front  line, and we do not regret that the front line has gone. I was  joking with former President de Klerk yesterday, when he asked  me whether South Africa was a member of the Frontline. I said  yes, and he said where is the front line? I said if the FL  still exists it's now the fishing line along the coast. And so  that's why we wanted the Frontline to (?leave) and that's where  we now are. So we can go fishing now, but we are looking at how  we can transform the Frontline into an organ that will be a  watchdog one, and come to the assistance of countries or a  country that will have lost control because of some instability  that has been triggered by lawless people.    And we have the example of Lesotho, what's happening in  Lesotho, and really Lesotho requires friends now. Friends who  believe in democracy. Not long ago they had elections there in  order to transform the military experience there, which the  people of Lesotho were forced to embrace for so long a time,  into a new democratic order, and the elections were won by the  BCP [Basotholand Congress Party]. But some people are opposed  to that experience. And we feel that Lesotho is really to be  allowed now some period of rest from military rule, and anyway,  a period it deserves, because everybody in our region is going  democratic. They will possibly be assisted.    And so the Frontline States, as a spearhead of the OAU, and  also of course as an organization of our own region, can be  transformed so it embraces not just the countries that fought  for Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa, but others also in our  region. Possibly the role of SADC [Southern African Development  Community], and has this political agenda, but not an agenda to  interfere in the domestic affairs of a country, an agenda really  to salvage a country, to save it from being torn apart by forces  that are inimical to progress and democracy. And that's the  role we hope those of our experts we asked to look at how the  Frontline States can be transformed, and the new look Frontline  States might be able to do.    But you made mention of the OAU and Rwanda. Well, the OAU is  a much larger organization than the Frontline States, and of  course the larger an organization is then the more complex and  the more problems, and in some cases the more contradictions it  embraces. And it's true that in Rwanda we have a situation that  should have been controlled long ago, but this is not to say  nothing was being done, President Mwinyi was working with our  encouragement on a program to get the leaders to agree to  proceed to elections, and in fact there is already an Arusha  Agreement.    Unfortunately, the incident of an air crash reversed the  process that was underway, but we hope we can once again, if we  send troops, as some of us have committed ourselves to do, and  bring the situation under control, and President Mwinyi can  start the exercise from there. He left it off where the air  crash and the events that followed disrupted it. So it's not  that nothing was being done in Rwanda, it is only that when the  event or the tragedy of the air craft that crashed happened, and  the subsequent developments, the Hutu rising against the Tutsi,  and we were not poised immediately to go into Rwanda and help  solve the situation, that was unfortunate.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion Mr. Mugabe, what do you want to do  when you stop being a politician?    [Mugabe] What do I want to do? I want to teach again. I  want to go teaching. When I retire from politics, obviously, I  want to do a little more reading, more writing especially, and  bring you into another focus of our people, and some of my  experiences in getting them to read and evaluate my experiences.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mugabe, thanks for your time and for honoring  us with this interview.    [Mugabe] Thank you.     "

""We are managing to pay  salaries at the moment, but the election is a problem,"" said  Nkobi. ""We have not reached our target of $17-million  (R[rand]58.3-million) in contributions from the international  community, and we are afraid to borrow -- because of course we  would have to pay for it.""    The $17-million international fundraising target is believed  to be significantly lower than originally planned. Fundraisers  on both sides of the Atlantic are locked in a battle with the  ANC's chief Washington representative, Lindiwe Mabuza, over  large American campaign donations promised to Nelson Mandela,  but never received by ANC headquarters.    At stake are millions of U.S. dollars. Repeated requests to  Mabuza to transfer the funds, raised during Mandela's U.S. trip  last July, have fallen on deaf ears, say sources in the U.S. and  South Africa.    Mabuza refused this week to discuss the issue when  telephoned  in Washington, saying she was answerable only to the ANC  leadership. ""I don't want to discuss this in the media,"" said  Mabuza. ""I don't even know really how much was transferred or  not -- I don't keep the books.""    The election cash crunch would be eased, say insiders, if  Mabuza were to transfer almost $500,000 (R1.7-million) in cash  and cheques raised during Nelson Mandela's U.S. trip last July.  A further $1.8- million (R6.2-million) in pledges has also  failed to materialise, because Mabuza has not followed up on the  promises made to Mandela. Mabuza, who has been nominated to a  safe position within the top 102 on the ANC's list for the  national parliament, is understood to be the sole signatory to  the organisation's Washington bank accounts. The $500,000 was  deposited after Mandela's fundraising swing last year, which  took him to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and other centres.    Asked about his department's difficulties with Mabuza, Nkobi  was unspecific, saying ""Nelson Mandela brought about $10,000  (34,300) back with him"" after the July U.S. trip, and the ""most  of the rest was pledges which are not being fulfilled"".    An audit of the ANC's Stockholm office while Mabuza was  chief  representative in Sweden several years ago apparently revealed a  gap of several tens of thousands of Swedish krona between amount  paid by local donors to the ANC and expenditure records kept by  the office.    Confronted over the hole in the till, Mabuza is reported to  have burst into tears, saying she knew nothing about accounting.  Asked about the audit this week, she denied any knowledge of a  cash shortfall, saying: ""I am aware there was an audit, but I  was not told that figure was missing.""    An attempt to transfer her to Dar es Salaam as chief  representative to Tanzania failed when she successfully lobbied  for the Washington D.C. position. She is said to have an  ""inside track"" to foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki. But far  from winning friends and influencing people in the U.S. capital,  Mabuza is reported to have thrown her lot in with some dubious  Capitol Hill entrepreneurs and put several important noses out  of joint. Sources in the U.S. say she has angered ANC donors  and sympathisers by ""trying to hog everything for herself""  rather than leaving fundraising to the professionals.    One American source, who asked to remain anonymous, said she  had failed to prevent turf battles between two ANC-aligned  fundraising operations, and ""funds raised have not found their  way back to South Africa"".    ""There is definite incompetence within the Washington  office,  and it needs better financial controls -- even outside the issue  of fundraising. The fault lies with the organisation at large,""  said a source. A fundraising effort set up to encourage large  tax- deductible contributions from corporate donors and chaired  by Heinz chief Tony O'Rielly, who recently bought a major stake  in South Africa's Argus newspapers, has reportedly been using  its clout to raise funds from traditional ANC donors like  churches and black groups.    Called Safe -- for South Africa Free Elections -- the  organisation was set up with Mandela's blessing and the  involvement of the ANC in an attempt to mobilise U.S. funding  for voter education projects. Pro bono legal services were  provided by former Kennedy aide Theodore Sorensen.    U.S. law makes makes tax-deductible donations to political  parties impossible, and the clear expectation was that Safe  would fund voter education projects close to, but not  organisationally linked to, the ANC. But aside from minor  amounts which have gone to ANC partners within the Patriotic  Front, Safe has ended up supporting voter education projects  beyond the ANC orbit to the tune of at least $1-million  (R3.4-million). Among those receiving support is the Institute  for a Democratic Alternative in South Africa (Idasa).    Considering the use of Mandela's high profile for Safe's  fundraising effort, said one U.S. source, ""anger is justified if  ANC-related voter education is not getting the funds"". Mabuza  was also instrumental in brokering a contract between the ANC  and former non-voting congressional delegate for Washington D.C.  Walter Fauntroy, for ""the provision of public policy, political  action, public relations, mobilisation and other services to  assist the ANC mission to the U.S."".    The initial proposal included a draft first year budget of  $700,000, (R2.4 million) and requested a three-month start-up  planning grant of $230,000 (770,000). Fauntroy was to cover  these costs through fundraising in the U.S., but has not  remitted a cent to the ANC. Instead, the start-up grant has  been lost, putting the ANC more than $230,000 out of pocket.    Mabuza has also pushed other associates at the ANC's  expense,  including one Albert Nellum, who came to South Africa with his  wife, ostensibly because there was an ""urgent need"" to plan  fundraising events around a tennis match involving Zina  Garrison. Nellum is described as ""a very close friend of  Lindiwe and the godfather of Zina Garrison"". Mabuza was told  twice by fax not to approve Nellum's visit, but he came anyway,  billing the ANC for his room at the Carlton Hotel and for air  fares for himself and his wife, which he insisted on having  upgraded to business class. Asked to comment on the goings-on  in the Washington D.C. office, an spokesman said: ""We don't deal  with election fundraising -- that's the treasurer's and the  election campaign department's responsibility. We have no cause  to be unhappy with our representation in D.C.""     "

The sources added, however, that Argentina -- Brazil's  main trade partner in the Common Market of the South (Mercosur)  -- will not be affected by the increase.    The wheat surcharge -- which ranges from 10 to 17 percent --  will be enforced from 15 September 1994 to 31 January 1995, the  period for marketing Brazilian wheat. The measure will  particularly affect U.S., Canadian, and German wheat.    An Agriculture Ministry spokesman told EFE that the decision  is designed to expand trade with Argentina and to promote  Brazilian wheat production.    Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli is also studying a  proposal to impose a surcharge on grounds of unfair competition  on any wheat purchased by Brazilian mills from countries that  are subsidizing agricultural production.    The proposal, which is part of a package that would go into  effect until 1997, seeks to make the surcharge match the value  of the subsidies granted by the producing country.    In light of the process of eliminating customs duties within  Mercosur, under which member countries are entitled to an 82  percent tax reduction, the import duties to be paid on Argentine  wheat sold to Brazil amounts to 1.8 percent.    Additionally, a bilateral agreement guarantees the annual  purchase by Brazil of 2 million tonnes of Argentine wheat.  Actual purchases have, however, often been higher than this  minimum figure.    In 1994, Argentina will export between 3 and 3.5 million  tonnes of wheat to Brazil, but the Brazilian imports will total  some 5.5 million tonnes.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has described the  purchase of Argentine wheat as a ""strategic"" decision linked to  integration within Mercosur and has said that Brazilian mills  have acknowledged the advantages of purchasing Argentine wheat  because of the low import duties and lower freight costs  involved.    The Argentine Government has expressed its displeasure over  the U.S. offer to sell 500,000 tonnes of wheat to Brazil at  subsidized prices.    According to official sources in Brasilia, a U.S. Government  delegation has made the offer to Brazilian officials.    Argentine-Brazilian trade, which has markedly increased  since  1990, is negative for Argentina, whose deficit in 1993 amounted  to $1,074,200,000.    According to the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat, in  1993  Brazilian sales to Argentina totaled $3.7 billion, while its  imports from Argentina totaled $2,625,700,000.     "

The economic route to prosperity as the party sees it is set out  in a 36-page manifesto released at its federal congress at  Kempton Park's World Trade centre on Thursday [3 February].    Punting the NP as ""the party for peace and prosperity,"" the  manifesto states that peace can be achieved only if all people  enjoyed prosperity. People and families could not be happy and  prosperous without jobs, homes, education and proper health care.    ""Only a free and strong economy can make jobs, houses,  schools, hospitals, clinics and other good things possible,"" the  NP says. It then sets out its view of the prerequisites for such  an economy as being:     -  proper protection of private property;    -  investor confidence to build factories and create jobs; and    -  reasonable taxes as an incentive to harder work.       Dealing with the broad economic aspects in some detail, the  manifesto stresses that a strong economy requires peace and  justice in the workplace with the rights of both workers and  employers properly protected.    Socialism and communism, as proved in Eastern Europe and in  Africa, destroyed the economy, prosperity and jobs.    ""Organisations and parties who still want socialism and  communism do not really understand economics,"" the NP says.    Dealing with jobs, the NP claims credit for having created  job opportunities by giving millions for small business  development, deregulation, reduced taxation, bringing down  inflation and export promotion. ""The economic policies of the  new National Party are attracting foreign investment, thereby  creating more jobs.    ""Only the NP can create more jobs,"" the manifesto claims.    On housing the party claims credit for making huge portions  of land available for new urban settlement, helping more than a  million families with a R[Rand]7,500 discount on buying a home,  spending R550 million on subsidies for first time home owners  and making R2,500 million available for housing in 1993 alone.    Furthermore, the manifesto claims credit for the government  having introduced site and service schemes for a million  families to build and upgrade homes in informal settlements. Its  housing edownment scheme, launched last month, would motivate  the private sector to participate in eliminating the  underdevelopment of the past and deal with the needs of a  growing population.    On education the party bemoans the fact that the nation had  for too long been hampered by discrimination, a lack of  discipline and a political struggle being waged in schools.    Again it claims credit for the new NP government having  increased education funding by leaps and bounds in recent years,  eliminating or significantly reducing discrepencies in funding,  working towards a single department with regional  decentralisation and the creation of a more autonomous school  management system with parental participation.    The NP stood for a stable system which was just and equal  for  everyone and which provided for:     -  compulsory schooling for at least nine years;    -  vocational training;    -  relevant learning material and curricula;    -  international certification standards;    -  choice of mother tongue education; and    -  the option of language, culture and religion based state  funded  schools.       Dealing with the health aspect of prosperity, the NP claims  credit for the advances and achievements of the present system  and says the highest priority must remain on primary health care  and the basic service be a function of local authorities.    Setting the year 2000 as a target, it then pledges to:     -  set up a local health committee for each community;    -  ensure there are enough clinics to provide access to health  facilities for all;    -  affordable health care in public and private sectors;    -  immunisation programmes to provide 100 percent coverage;    -  extending feeding development programme; and    -  ensuring constructive cooperation between the public and  private sectors.       The manifesto also contians a chapter on ""prosperity and  affirmative action,"" criticising discriminating laws, schooling  systems and attitudes of the past and claiming credit for  removing many and much of these.    The government was overcoming backlogs and opened up equal  opportunities for all in the civil service.    It pledges itself to ensure that all individuals have equal  access to opportunities for self-development and making the best  possible contribution to the economy. ""People who in the past  did not have equal opportunities must receive special training,  education and support so that they can develop fully and make  their full contribution,"" is the party pledge to affirmative  action.    Finally, the NP says, prosperity depends on relations with  the world outside, on foreign investors building factories and  creating jobs.    The NP's economic policies pleased the outside world and its  reforms had lured trade and investment delegations and  rejuvinated its sports ties and tourism.    The National Party would make South Africa a leader in  southern Africa and the continent as it had much ""to offer our  brothers to the north.""     "

In the United States, contact the nearest passport agency  office; abroad, check in with the nearest American embassy.    Asia     -- China: Shanghai has big plans to ease its congestion, including a 105-mile  subway system and tunnels under the Huangpu River. The first nine miles of the  subway will be completed by 1992, with the rest of the system scheduled for  completion by the turn of the century.    All pets dogs in Shanghai have been ordered killed because of an outbreak of  rabies. Pet dogs are outlawed in most Chinese cities, but Shanghai has 500  legally registered dogs, as well as thousands of illegal ones. Owners have been  ordered to kill them or have them confiscated by authorities.    Begging is on the increase in China's major cities. In some places, beggars can  make in a day what an ordinary worker earns in a month. According to some  estimates, it's quietly becoming a profession, especially in Hunan Province.     -- India: While cameras are allowed, photographs can no longer be taken from  the terrace level of the Taj Mahal, a new regulation that serves no discernible  purpose and keeps monitors busy blowing their whistles. People take photographs  anyway, and the constant sound of the whistles is an intrusion that interferes  with the enjoyment of one of the world's greatest treasures.    Many regions in India require special permits for travel, and some can be  difficult or impossible to obtain, notably permission for non-Indians wishing  to go to the Punjab. Check your itinerary with Indian authorities before you  go.     -- Pakistan: Peshawar, near the Khyber Pass leading into Afghanistan, has long  been an open market for arms and other merchandise of war, but of late it has  become a marketplace for an odd assortment of luxury goods imported from  Europe, Japan, the United States, even the Soviet Union. Bara Bazaar, 10 miles  west of the city, displays Soviet refrigerators and air conditioners alongside  French perfumes and American cosmetics, all contraband goods in great demand  among upper-class Pakistanis. The bazaar is testament to the ingenuity of  Afghan traders and the power of the free market.    Africa     -- Angola/Namibia: The recent signing of a peace treaty between Angola, Cuba  and South Africa paves the way for regional peace and independence for Namibia,  formerly ruled by South Africa. The agreement could likely open up travel and  tourism to the region.     -- Burkina Faso: This country is now free of cholera and yellow fever.     -- Mozambique: South Africa has signaled an end to its support of Renamo  guerrillas fighting a war of terror against the government and populace, and  plans to replace it with economic cooperation. Without South African aid, the  guerrilla group will probably disappear, because it has little support within  the country and no other source of arms or income. The move raises hopes for  the future of this beautiful but desperate land ravaged by more than a decade  of internal conflict.    Soviet Union    Perestroika and glasnost are changing the face of the Soviet Union, but if you  want to find your way around Moscow, the only comprehensive street guide  available remains the one produced by the CIA. Russian maps of the city are  deliberately inaccurate, designed to confound rather than guide.    Caribbean     -- Haiti: Haitian leader Gen. Prosper Avril recently suggested the formation  of an electoral council to organize a presidential election two years from now,  a sign that a return to democracy there is a long way off. The potential for  unrest remains high. Defer non-essential travel.    Mexico    Mexico City's air pollution, among the worst in the world, has reached such  levels that schools will reopen a month later than usual after the Christmas  break because officials fear for the children's health. January and February  are the worst months for pollution there because of thermal inversions.    Southeast Asia     -- Burma: The Burmese government is making attempts to draw foreign  investment, recently implementing laws to allow repatriation of profits and tax  exemptions for the first time in 26 years. But the prospects for foreign  investment are not good until political stability is achieved. The U.S. State  Department still advises Americans to defer travel there.

Asia     -- China: Shanghai has big plans to ease its congestion, including a 105-mile  subway system and tunnels under the Huangpu River. The first nine miles of the  subway will be completed by 1992, with the rest of the system scheduled for  completion by the turn of the century.    All pets dogs in Shanghai have been ordered killed because of an outbreak of  rabies. Pet dogs are outlawed in most Chinese cities, but Shanghai has 500  legally registered dogs, as well as thousands of illegal ones. Owners have been  ordered to kill them or have them confiscated by authorities.    Begging is on the increase in China's major cities. In some places, beggars can  make in a day what an ordinary worker earns in a month. According to some  estimates, it's quietly becoming a profession, especially in Hunan Province.     -- India: While cameras are allowed, photographs can no longer be taken from  the terrace level of the Taj Mahal, a new regulation that serves no discernible  purpose and keeps monitors busy blowing their whistles. People take photographs  anyway, and the constant sound of the whistles is an intrusion that interferes  with the enjoyment of one of the world's greatest treasures.    Many regions in India require special permits for travel, and some can be  difficult or impossible to obtain, notably permission for non-Indians wishing  to go to the Punjab. Check your itinerary with Indian authorities before you  go.     -- Pakistan: Peshawar, near the Khyber Pass leading into Afghanistan, has long  been an open market for arms and other merchandise of war, but of late it has  become a marketplace for an odd assortment of luxury goods imported from  Europe, Japan, the United States, even the Soviet Union. Bara Bazaar, 10 miles  west of the city, displays Soviet refrigerators and air conditioners alongside  French perfumes and American cosmetics, all contraband goods in great demand  among upper-class Pakistanis. The bazaar is testament to the ingenuity of  Afghan traders and the power of the free market.    Africa     -- Angola/Namibia: The recent signing of a peace treaty between Angola, Cuba  and South Africa paves the way for regional peace and independence for Namibia,  formerly ruled by South Africa. The agreement could likely open up travel and  tourism to the region.     -- Burkina Faso: This country is now free of cholera and yellow fever.     -- Mozambique: South Africa has signaled an end to its support of Renamo  guerrillas fighting a war of terror against the government and populace, and  plans to replace it with economic cooperation. Without South African aid, the  guerrilla group will probably disappear, because it has little support within  the country and no other source of arms or income. The move raises hopes for  the future of this beautiful but desperate land ravaged by more than a decade  of internal conflict.    Soviet Union    Perestroika and glasnost are changing the face of the Soviet Union, but if you  want to find your way around Moscow, the only comprehensive street guide  available remains the one produced by the CIA.

Mexico    Mexico City's air pollution, among the worst in the world, has reached such  levels that schools will reopen a month later than usual after the Christmas  break because officials fear for the children's health.

0,FT931-663 ,"FT931-663 _AN-DC2BZACUFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / US lectures on economic co-operation ring hollow      By EDWARD BALLS   US President Bill Clinton, nearly two thirds of the way through the first hundred days of his administration, has good reason to feel pleased. The budget package is making good progress through Congress, relations with the Federal Reserve appear cordial, long-term interest rates have fallen and the US economy is conveniently accelerating. In short, the domestic economic agenda looks under control. His only disappointment is the tardy pace at which the rest of the world is falling into line. Russian president Boris Yeltsin can hardly be blamed for his current plight, and the US, like the rest of the world, has little option but to mouth support and wait with crossed fingers. But other countries that do control their domestic policy agendas, notably Germany and Japan, appear less willing to follow the world leader's example. Undeterred, the Clinton administration has quickly adopted the standard US presidential practice of lecturing other countries on how to manage their affairs, with the US Treasury taking the lead on the lecture circuit. Germany, the G7 finance ministers were told, should cut its interest rates more rapidly in order to kick-start European demand (for US exports). Japan, senior Treasury officials publicly imply, should be using fiscal policy in a more aggressively expansionary way to stimulate Japanese demand (for US exports). Would-be recipients of aid and debt relief should liberalise their economies and open their markets (to US exports). Yet, while it is easy to see why the world's only superpower speaks its mind, it is less obvious that it has the moral right to do so. While lecturing other countries about their responsibilities, the world's richest nation continues to benefit from a huge net resource flow from the developed and developing world alike. At its peak in 1987, the net resource transfer to the US was Dollars 151.4bn (Pounds 106.6bn), of which over Dollars 70bn came from developing countries, equivalent to 2 per cent of developing country GDP. The cumulative flow since 1980 is a little over Dollars 980bn. The US might bridle at these statistics. The net resource flow (equivalent to the US current account deficit minus net interest, profits and dividends) is, after all, the product of millions of individual, private and voluntary decisions. Yet the US, by virtue of its size and economic power, can alter the incentives that private individuals face. Hence, the rise of the US fiscal deficit in the 1980s was, in part, responsible for the rise in world interest rates and the flood of capital into the US. This sharp rise in real interest rates encouraged US commercial banks to liquidate their third world lending to take advantage of the higher domestic returns, thus bringing on the debt crisis. Not that the US can take all the blame. While profligate US fiscal policy sucked resources in, mistaken domestic policies in many developing countries also drove resources towards the US. This was particularly true of Latin America and Africa for whom the stock of flight capital is estimated at a third to two thirds of annual GDP. For all its good intentions, the Clinton administration will continue to suck scarce resources towards the world's richest country. Its budget plans envisage a budget deficit of over 3 per cent of GDP by 1998 while the combination of a nascent recovery and persistently low US national savings will expand the current account deficit over the next year. It is the regional profile of America's capital donors, not the demand placed on them, that appears to be altering. Budget deficit-burdened Europe is now importing capital from the US, while eastern Europe is drawing on US savings. Meanwhile, economic reform and debt relief in Latin America has made the region a magnet for portfolio investment, capturing almost all of the 135 per cent (Dollars 4.7bn) increase in annual equity flows to developing counties over the past three years. This leaves an extraordinary alliance of Japan, east Asia and debt-burdened Africa to finance the world's largest, and least progressive, economic assistance programme.

0,FT922-1938 ,"FT922-1938 _AN-CFSBAAC3FT 920619   FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African coal prices give 'barely adequate' return on investment      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   CONTRACT PRICE levels for coal are barely adequate at present to offer South African producers a return on existing investments, never mind encourage new investment, says Mr Allen Cook, chief executive of Randcoal, South Africa's second largest producer. Speaking at a recent conference in Australia, Mr Cook said although international demand for South African coal would continue to rise in future years, there were two major points of concern for the local industry. The first concerns the high rate of cost escalation in recent years, which is eroding South Africa's competitive position. This is a function of increased wage demands, rising transport costs and continuing inflation of about 15 per cent. Mr Cook said there was a significant drive in the industry to lower costs by improving productivity. Agreement has also been reached with Spoornet, the state rail company, to peg rail freight costs on the line to the Richards Bay export port in the next few years at about half the inflation level. The second issue is that 'current market conditions, recent price history and some buyers' attitudes to pricing' militate against further investment. Mr Cook said a buyers market had existed for a number of years, with the real price for coal declining in all major currencies. 'The cost squeeze on producers has led to a number of mine closures which, in the medium term, will be detrimental to the continued secure supplies of coal from major producing companies,' said Mr Cook. He added that it was in the interest of all parties that a 'reasonable' price level should be set that encouraged future investment in coal. South Africa has port capacity to export 53m tonnes a year. Fob contract prices would have to rise by between Dollars 5 and Dollars Pounds 8 a tonne to make projects to expand capacity beyond this point viable, said Mr Cook. Coal is South Africa's second largest export earner after gold. Last year the country earned R4.2bn (Pounds 630m) from exporting 48.5m tonnes of coal. Mr Cook said that with sanctions gone, large potential new markets were opening up, particularly in Japan, Korea, Denmark, France, Holland, UK and US. He said that Western Europe had regained its position as the main destination for South African exports. Mr Cook said Europe remained a major growth market for South African coal that was price competitive, 'particularly if the price of coal from current low-price producers in CIS and Poland begins to reflect the actual cost of production'.

The MENA report, citing the Paris weekly ""L'EVENEMENT DE  JEUDI,"" said that the United States, backed by Britain, still  thinks it premature to lift the international embargo against  Iraq, which was imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of  Kuwait.    However, the weekly said that France, backed by Russia and  China, stands for lifting the sanctions.    MENA said that the change in the French stand came slowly  after much hesitation.    Currently, French companies are preparing to secure the  lion's share in Iraqi contracts after American companies  clinched two big contracts in Saudi Arabia, the weekly said.    The economic incentives might have been the reason that  prompted Paris to accelerate its steps toward lifting the  embargo on Iraq, it added.    According to MENA, two events have shown the improvement in  France's position on Iraq. The first one was an announcement by  the French Government to terminate its participation in  monitoring the embargo, and the second is the tendency to open a  section to look after the French interests in Iraq.    ""The Iraqis believe that the change in France's stand is a  positive step toward better bilateral relations, and they are  awaiting more to come in the coming few weeks,"" the news agency  said.

0,FT931-8796 ,"FT931-8796 _AN-DBQC0AF1FT 930217   FT  17 FEB 93 / Duo preaches rewards of rigour: South Africa has accepted the need for economic reform      By PATTI WALDMEIR and PHILIP GAWITH   It took the ruling National party in South Africa more than 40 years to come to its senses about apartheid, and it was the economic failure of the policy  -not its moral repugnance - which finally tipped the balance. Now, with the National party on the point of abandoning its hegemony and entering government with the African National Congress, it is keen to put behind it the peculiarly South African form of state socialism which bolstered apartheid. It fears that the ANC might otherwise decide to ape this policy, using the state to further African interests at the expense of the Afrikaner. So at the last moment, the National party has been converted to economic discipline, to the kind of free-market policies without which post-apartheid South Africa cannot flourish. Faced with an economy which can only employ just over half of the available labour force, where productivity is low and real wages high by international standards, and where the civil service is large and inefficient, there is no alternative to economic reform. That has been true for years, and it has not previously stopped Pretoria from denying reality. But the country's finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, finally seems to have removed the blinkers from both government and opposition eyes. With a clever slide show demonstrating the depths of the economic crisis, which he has presented to everyone from the cabinet to the leaders of the ANC, Mr Keys has concentrated the minds of politicians on the need for a rapid political settlement. More than anything else, this has driven progress in the constitutional talks between the National party and the ANC which last week yielded an outline agreement on power-sharing. Mr Keys, with his commitment to tight fiscal policies, is a powerful ally for Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the country's central bank. Mr Stals has fought for years to instil monetary discipline. Last year, he managed to restrict money supply growth, as defined by the broad measure of M3, to within a tight target of 7 to 10 per cent. The finance minister, who took office last May after a successful career as executive chairman at Gencor, the country's second-largest mining company, says South Africa has now entered a 'sane economic era' which can lay the basis for future growth. The credit for that must be shared between Mr Keys and Mr Stals, whose uncompromising monetary policy has helped push inflation to a 15-year low. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of just under 10 per cent in December (see chart.) There are also signs that inflationary expectations are also beginning to fall. Fund managers, for example, are expressing renewed interest in fixed-interest securities. But Mr Keys' achievement in promoting economics to the centre of the political debate should not be underestimated. Through force of intellect and personality, he has frightened the politicians out of their previous leisurely approach to negotiations, while maintaining good relations with both sides. More technocrat than politician (probably the main reason for his success), Mr Keys has gained the respect of the ANC. But more important, he has won over the president, Mr F W de Klerk, who alone can authorise the painful economic restructuring now being planned. Pretoria has yet to release details of the restructuring programme, but Mr Keys has made clear that stimulating investment is the centrepiece. That can only be achieved by reducing government consumption expenditure so as to channel more of national income into private fixed investment, and by restoring investors' confidence after years of political uncertainty and high inflation. Mr Keys has taken his reform message to every forum that will listen. He mourns the fact that gross domestic fixed investment has fallen from 26 per cent of national income in 1983 to 16 per cent now - only 1 per cent more than is needed simply to replace worn-out and obsolete capacity. That, he says, is the most important element restraining economic growth, which has been negative for each of the past three years. A modest recovery, to real growth of between 0.5 and 2 per cent, is expected this year. Government expenditure is the obvious target to free more funds for investment. Mr Keys points out that government consumption spending has risen from about 10 per cent of national income in the 1960s to more than double that now. Over the same period, Japanese government consumption spending was held to 9 per cent of national income. But politically, there could hardly be a worse time to restrain government expenditure. Many blacks expect a multi-racial government to make up for the deprivations of apartheid overnight. Scope for cuts is also limited, although Mr de Klerk (under Mr Keys' influence) has said that civil servants must take a large pay cut in real terms, of perhaps 3 to 5 per cent, in the coming fiscal year. Taxes will also be increased, while civil service personnel should be cut by 5 per cent by the end of March. Nonetheless, the budget deficit, which is expected to end the financial year at more than 8 per cent of gross domestic product, will probably remain high at 6 or 7 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1993-94. Finance department officials say that to cut the deficit to 5 per cent of GDP would require drastic action, the equivalent of a 7 percentage point rise in value-added tax (now 10 per cent). Despite the deficit, finance ministry officials point out that spending targets were largely achieved this year. They say that the deficit resulted from a revenue shortfall due to recession and severe drought, and they predict spending will show only a very modest real increase next year. Mr Stals says he believes 1993 will set the tone for the new South Africa. If Mr Keys proves to have the courage of his convictions on curbing government spending - and crucially, if the ANC and the trade unions resist public protests against such measures - then the central bank governor predicts this 'can easily become a decisive year in which the foundations will be laid for future economic development'. With the labour force shrinking by 2 per cent in 1991 and 3 per cent in the first half of 1992 - adding to the 40 per cent of the economically active population already without formal employment - something must be done to revive growth. But nobody believes anything can be done quickly. Indeed, many economic commentators are sceptical that inflation will remain in single figures, as the finance minister has promised, and that economic growth will resume. But with Mr Keys at the Finance Ministry and Mr Stals at the central bank - posts both could retain in an interim government - South Africa has the best chance in years of breaking out of what Mr Keys calls 'the down-and-out trap'. And unless economic success can be achieved, South African democracy will rest on fragile foundations.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The talks, which used to include auto and auto parts,  insurance and government procurement, will soon be expanded to  cover such areas as financial services and intellectual  property, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor disclosed.    In the forthcoming talks with Tokyo, Washington will still  seek ""objective criteria"" to evaluate progress on trade,  although it will no longer seek numerical targets or managed  trade, Kantor said.    ""We needed qualitative and quantitative criteria, and we  were  not seeking to manage trade or to seek numerical targets,"" like  quotas, Kantor said. ""We have confirmed we are not seeking  numerical targets.""    Objective criteria, Kantor noted, will provide the basis for  deciding if the agreements succeed or fail to meet their purpose  to achieve concrete results.    Meanwhile, Kantor stressed, ""I think it's fair to say that  the two countries are moving forward on the economic area as  well as in the strategic and political areas as well.""    On February 11, President Clinton and then Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to reach an agreement on the  trade framework talks, in which the U.S. wanted to set numerical  targets for U.S. sales to Japan.    Kantor stressed that the Clinton administration, in the  forthcoming talks, will still seek to substantially increase  sales and access to Japanese markets.     "

Laar told a press conference, on Monday, that his meeting  with Perry was extremely efficient in discussion of situation of  Estonian defence forces, borderguard and the Baltic peacekeeping  battalion to be formed. He pointed to Perry's statement that  the U.S. will not let anyone ""dictate in what amount and with  whom it will develop security policy cooperation"". He added  that U.S. concern about Estonian-Russian interstate negotiations  was illustrated by the fact that Perry expressed clear support  to unconditional Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by August  31, 1994.    Laar said that during his meetings in the U.S., he discussed  possible arms deals but no concrete plans to buy arms have been  made yet.

Moreover, $180 million of the $220-million deal will be financed by an  international syndicate of banks led by a South Korean bank, a sign of South  Korea's growing financial strength. South Korea, once deeply in debt, will  enter the ranks of net creditors this year, Kim Kun, a Bank of Korea governor,  said in a recent interview.    The governments of Canada, the United States and South Korea must authorize  Sammi's purchase, but approval is expected ""in the very near future,"" according  to Jin Byung Hwa, overseas investment director at the Ministry of Finance.    Sammi, South Korea's largest specialty steel firm, will purchase three  specialty steel-producing divisions of Rio Algom of Toronto, a mining and  resource exploration firm that is a subsidiary of the London-based RTZ Corp.  The divisions are Atlas Stainless Steel, situated in Tracy, Quebec; Atlas  Speciality Steel, in Welland, Ontario, and AL Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of  Dunkirk, N.Y.    The Dunkirk division operates specialty steel mills in both Dunkirk and  Watervliet, N.Y.    Together the four plants produce about 500,000 tons of specialty steel a year.  Last year, they registered an operating profit of $63.8 million on sales of  $582.4 million.    South Korea's largest integrated steelmaker, Pohang Steel Corp., has invested  in a joint-venture steel mill with USX, and such electronics giants as Samsung  and Gold Star have built manufacturing plants in the United States. But Sammi's  purchase represents the first takeover by a Korean firm of existing American  plants.    Four years ago South Korea's foreign debt peaked at $47 billion. But with the  emergence of trade surpluses, rising wages and the appreciation of South Korean  currency, South Korean manufacturers have begun investing overseas. Net  overseas assets are expected to surpass claims against the country by the end  of this year, making South Korea a net creditor, and the government has been  loosening controls on foreign investment and Korean banks' overseas activities.      'Rare' Korean-Led Loan    Jin, the Finance Ministry official, said a Korean-led loan for an overseas  manufacturing purchase ""is rare."" Korea First Bank has arranged the loan, in  which two Korean state-run banks and eight foreign banks will participate.    At the end of April, total Korean overseas investment amounted to $1.1 billion,  with $362 million of it in manufacturing projects, Jin said. In the United  States, investment had reached $358 million, with $179 million of it in  manufacturing.    In contrast, cumulative foreign investment in South Korea amounted to about $4  billion at the end of last year.    Delegations from Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States are making  increasingly frequent visits to Seoul seeking private Korean investment.    To date, overseas investment has been led by three of South Korea's largest  electronics firms, Gold Star, Samsung and Daewoo. By the end of this year, the  three firms will be operating 21 plants overseas. Footwear and textile firms  are also getting into operations abroad.    Hwang Cheol Kyu, a Sammi spokesman, said the company will retain all the  employees at all three of the Rio Algom divisions it is buying. It will send  Korean representatives to each, but has not yet decided how many.    Although Sammi plans to complete a new plant, expanding its annual capacity to  1 million tons from 385,000 tons, the company will still lack the ability to  produce hot coil specialty steel and plans to import that product from its new  North American plants, Hwang said. Currently, 70% of its imports of 180,000  tons a year comes from Japan.    The acquisition will give South Korea a new assured source of supply of hot  coil steel, Jin said. Hot coil is processed into stainless sheet for use in  automobile manufacturing.    ""Sammi has a history of only 20 years in specialty steel,"" Hwang said. ""AL Tech  has a history of more than 100 years, and our acquisition of it will enhance  our technology.""    The purchase will bring Sammi's total production capacity to 1.5 million tons,  making it one of the largest specialty steel firms in the world.

At a joint press conference with visiting Ukrainian  President  Leonid Kravchuk, Clinton said the new relationship between the  two countries would make a better future for the people of both  nations.    Kravchuk, who has signed a number of accords on economic and  trade cooperation with the U.S., said today marked a ""historic  moment"" in friendly relations between Washington and Kiev.    Clinton praised Kiev's endorsement of the  U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian accord signed last January on getting rid  of the 1,800 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian soil as well as the  first strategic arms reduction treaty.    The U.S. President also expressed the hope that the  Ukrainian  parliament would eventually approve the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.    He welcomed Ukraine's commitment to comprehensive market  reforms as well as Kiev's agreement to join NATO's Partnership  for Peace Program last month.    Kravchuk, whose country is now experiencing an economic  crisis, brought an entourage of high-ranking officials including  the ministers for foreign affairs, defense, economics on the  current official visit.    At the core of the talks between the two leaders were  economic matters, which apparently is the main purpose of  Kravchuk's visit.    Clinton also promised today to press for economic aid from  other Western countries and lending agencies to Ukraine.    Besides meeting with U.S. officials, Kravchuk will also be  seeing officials from the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank on outside economic assistance.    Kravchuk leaves for New York Saturday for a meeting with  U.N.  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and to attend the opening  of Ukraine's general consulate.     "

In doing so, ASEAN do not realize the immense potential  in cross-border investment. For far too long, member countries  have been relying on investments outside ASEAN. This will only  serve to make the region dependent on others. Besides this, it  is not in line with efforts toward ASEAN economic integration.    The fact is that member countries do not have to go far for  investment. With regional trade expanding rapidly, there is  much scope for greater intra-ASEAN investment as well. As Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir Mohamed noted, investment by  ASEAN investors in ASEAN had grown substantially over the years.  However, the choice by ASEAN investors to place their money in  the region does not come automatically. It is vital for member  countries to provide a conducive climate for investment. This  means that the investment climate must be ideal, with the  necessary laws and policies in place.    ASEAN countries have done well in providing the right  environment for foreign investment. Still, with other regions  also competing for investment, member countries must guard  against complacency. Economies in Eastern Europe, Latin America,  and Africa are competing for foreign capital to create jobs and  prosperity. Here, a key to cross-border investment is to  complement one another's economic mood. This is exactly why the  growth triangle concept has become very popular in the region.  It is more effective for a few countries to get together to  develop their respective regions bordering each other. Within a  short period of time, the committees in charge of developing the  growth triangle have swung into action. It is a matter of time  before they start bearing fruit.    The bottom line is that if their investment climate is ideal  for ASEAN countries, they should also be conducive for investors  from outside the region. Therefore, there is much scope for not  only intra-ASEAN trade, but cross-border investments as well  among member countries. The challenge is for the respective  private sectors to tap into each other's potential. Rather than  going for high-cost areas far away, ASEAN countries are among  the most lucrative investment destinations. Areas that need to  be looked into to ensure the flow of investments of proper  infrastructure facilities. [sentence as heard] Efforts should  be made to enhance skilled manpower in the region. This could  encourage reverse investment by some of the more developed  countries in neighboring ASEAN countries.    All this would go a long way in boosting the region's quest  for a single free market. When that is achieved, ASEAN would  emerge as a cohesive force, much to the envy of others. At the  same time, it would give the region a better bargaining power in  international economic issues.     "

On Wall Street, U.S. shares have lost about 10 percent  of their value this year; in Tokyo minicrashes alternate with  spectacular gains; the interest rates on both sides of the  Atlantic are leaping virtually like goats. All this reflects  the insecurity of money managers around the globe, who are  currently reacting a bit more sensitively than is usual in this  branch.    The reason for the nervousness is the unresolved question  whether interest trends that run counter to each other can  persist in the United States and in Europe, especially in  Germany. While overseas the lively economic development is able  to bear the careful pressure on the interest brake applied by  Reserve Board chief Alan Greenspan, the German economy still  needs declining interest rates. The Bundesbank has made good  progress in the short-term sphere with that; regarding medium-  and long-term durations, however, there has been a setback.  There the yields are almost 0.75 percentage points higher than  the lowest level last year.    One thing can already be said now: There are limits to an  opening of the interest rate gap between the United States and  Germany. These limits are reached as soon as investors begin to  turn their backs on the mark and turn toward the dollar,  because, in addition to higher interest rates, they can also  expect gains from the exchange rate. In view of the enormous  need for capital to finance German unification over the next few  years, the Bundesbank cannot go it alone. In this respect, it  is very likely that not all dreams regarding interest rates will  come true in our country.     "
0,FT922-7919 ,"FT922-7919 _AN-CEOAZAEFFT 920515   FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Globe-trotting Czechs seek new markets - The search to replace Soviet sales      By ARIANE GENILLARD and ANTHONY ROBINSON   THE SEARCH by Czechoslovakia for new markets last month took President Vaclav Havel to Japan and South Korea while his prime minister, Mr Marian Calfa, set off for South Africa at the head of a 50-strong delegation of Czech and Slovak businessmen. Such top-level globe-trotting reflects the urgency of finding new export outlets to replace the former high dependence on Soviet trade. But it also marks a desire to re-establish a presence in global markets beyond the European Community and attract new investment to update Czechoslovakia's product range and increase the attractiveness of its exports. Until this happens the country remains locked into its existing pattern of exporting a wide range of relatively low- or medium-technology engineering and consumer goods while importing energy and raw materials from the former Soviet Union and more sophisticated investment and consumer goods from the west. Despite these product limitations, willingness to trim margins and easier access to the EC and markets of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) have already made western Europe the main market for Czechoslovak exports. This has helped offset the loss of the former Soviet bloc trading system Comecon, which accounted for 61 per cent of overall trade in 1989 but less than 30 per cent last year. Growth in trade with the west however has not yet been strong enough to compensate for the collapse of Comecon. Total exports of 321bn koruna (Dollars 11bn) in 1991 were 94 per cent of their 1990 level and nearly 30 per cent down on the Dollars 14.3bn of 1989. Imports have shrunk even more sharply to Dollars 10.1bn from Dollars 13.2bn in 1990. Lower imports reflect both a recession which cut gross domestic product by nearly 15 per cent last year and the shift away from energy-intensive, polluting heavy industry. Imports of crude oil from Russia, for example, dropped from 16m tons in 1989 to 11m tons last year. With imports dropping faster than exports, Czechoslovakia's balance of trade recorded a 25bn koruna surplus in 1991. The collapse of exports to the former Soviet Union in particular has deepened the domestic recession, especially in Slovakia with its heavy concentration of arms factories and other plants geared specifically to the old Soviet market. Within the lower overall volume, however, trade with EC markets grew strongly, to account for 40.7 per cent of Czechoslovakia's total exports last year compared with 24 per cent in 1988. A third of imports came from the EC, against only a quarter from the former Soviet Union, although imports from the former Comecon countries as a whole were virtually identical to the EC share at 32.2 per cent of the total. The trend towards closer integration in the EC is expected to continue as Czechoslovakia, along with Hungary and Poland, reaps the benefits of a recent association agreement with the EC. Germany, which accounts for two-thirds of the estimated Dollars 800m foreign capital invested in Czechoslovakia last year, took 19.4 per cent of Czechoslovak exports and supplied 20.1 per cent of all imports in 1991. It is expected soon to replace the former Soviet Union as the largest single export market. But the influence of the German-speaking world does not stop with Germany. Austria and Switzerland are also becoming important trading partners. In 1991, Efta, of which they are members, accounted for 10 per cent of Czechoslovakia's total trade. Business with Efta countries is expected to be boosted by a recent trade agreement which takes effect on July 1. But, as indicated by the official visits to Asia and Africa, and the opening soon of a trade office in San Francisco to supplement existing offices in New York and Washington, Czechoslovakia is also looking further afield. Until now trade with the Pacific rim countries has been minimal. Czechoslovak exports to Japan for example were a mere Dollars 71m last year, mainly traditional consumer goods such as Bohemian glass and porcelain and hops for brewing Japanese beer. Exports to South Korea were only Dollars 8m. Japan traditionally likes to boost trade links before following up with investment, and in the long run the main purpose of the high-profile state visit to both Japan and South Korea was to raise Czechoslovakia's profile as a profitable venue for investment. Africa was also neglected under the old regime, with trade limited mainly to shipments of military materiel in obligatory support of Moscow's support for revolutionary regimes. The visit to Pretoria last month was recognition that if political developments allow South Africa to become the dynamo for the economic regeneration of southern Africa, a new market would be created in which Czechoslovakia would also intend to participate.

0,FT922-4427 ,"FT922-4427 _AN-CFEA9AD1FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (14): Hopes for psychological boost - The potential for foreign investment      By PHILIP GAWITH   YEARS of international isolation have left a deep scar on the psyche of white South Africa, reflected in a desperate desire to be fully re-integrated into the community of nations. The international travels of President F W de Klerk and the national cricket team's reacceptance into world cricket have given satisfaction. The acid test, however, lies at home. South Africans need to see three things to let them know all is well again: foreign tourists, foreign sportsmen and foreign investors. A plethora of national carriers at Jan Smuts airport and visits later this year from the All Blacks and the Wallabies offer reasonable comfort on the first two counts. Of foreign money, however, there is little sign. The reasons for this are not hard to find, nor are they particularly ominous. The issue, however, is not one of economic need; South Africa is not so much short of money as it is of investment opportunities that inspire confidence. The problem, rather, is psychological: foreign investment is sought as the imprimatur that the outside world believes South Africa has a reasonable future. Without it, South Africans are prone to believe that clear-thinking outsiders have seen the future, and they do not like what they see. Since February 1990, there has been little flow of capital into the country. Indeed, there has been a net outflow of foreign money from the capital markets, albeit at a progressively slower rate in recent years. In 1991, net equity sales by foreigners amounted to R4.1bn, while net purchases of gilts amounted to R2bn. In terms of direct investment, it is instructive to look separately at South Africa's four main trading partners: Germany, UK, Japan and US. The chances of seeing any large headline investments from either of the UK or Germany is very small for the simple reason that most large companies from these countries are already invested in South Africa. Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW, Hoechst, Bayer, Siemens - they were all here before sanctions and they never left. Likewise with BP, Shell, GEC, Lonhro, RTZ, Unilever and others. Most of these companies, naturally, are continuing to invest in their operations here. Mr Peter Bacon, the British commercial consul, comments: 'Having stuck it out through all the political problems and the economic recession, they are determined to stay and reap the benefits.' The US and Japan offer most scope for new entrants to the country. Although the six main Japanese trading houses have offices here, and companies such as Nissan, Toyota and Panasonic are present, albeit in a local guise, Japanese companies were banned from investing in South Africa from 1968 until recently, and hence are under-represented. The US position is different; many companies were here, but about two-thirds left during the sanctions period. Mr Don Steinberg, counsellor for economic and commercial affairs at the US Embassy, notes that in 1984/5 there were about 360 US companies in South Africa, with a total investment of about Dollars 2.7bn. This has now dropped to 110 companies with investments worth about Dollars 900m. Mr Steinberg reports a 'dramatic increase in interest in South Africa. My visitors' list looks like a list of the Fortune 500. This is too important a market not to find out what is going on'. Indeed, South Africa remains by far the largest site of US investment in sub-Saharan Africa, being home to about half of all US non-oil investment in the area. Mr Steinberg says that US investors are not, as many suppose, taking a 'wait-and-see' attitude. He says that there are four to five companies on the verge of announcing 'major new deals' in South Africa. They are merely waiting for some trigger political event, such as an interim government or an ANC welcome to foreign investors, before going ahead. The names most often mentioned in the Press are Pepsi, Heinz, Sara Lee and Apple. Mr Steinberg cites five main areas where US investors have shown an interest: Black consumer market - cosmetics, appliances, food franchising. Electrification projects are expected to open up vast consumer markets, as is the rising income levels of employed blacks; South Africa as an export platform into the region, which was previously serviced by other subsidiaries; Involvement of US contractors in regional projects where South Africa is likely to be the importer of the final good or supplier of capital and expertise; Socio-economic spending in South Africa, which should have spin-offs in areas such as health and education equipment; and Investment by existing companies. Although the US is the most likely source of a 'headline' investment in South Africa, other countries are certainly not standing still. Some of the existing German companies are spending heavily, with Mercedes-Benz and BMW engaged with capital expenditure programmes of R500m and R300m respectively. There has also been a string of high profile visitors from Germany including the minister of economic affairs, the agricultural, economic and transport committees of the Bundestag, various deputy ministers and numerous individual politicians. Likewise, Mr Bacon reports a fourfold to fivefold increase in the number of business visitors and market information inquiries compared to two years ago. Last year also saw about 10 large, officially-funded British trade missions to South Africa. Mr Bacon estimates that about 35 per cent, or Pounds 2bn, of foreign investment in South Africa is British. He notes that in terms of profits and dividends, South Africa is the UK's seventh largest foreign earner. South Africans dream optimistically about being swamped by waves of Japanese investment. The truth is likely to be more mundane. Mr Shuji Okita, president of the newly-formed Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industries in South Africa, says that although Japanese investors believe South Africa has a lot of potential, they are not in a hurry and it will take time for them to develop their investments. He believes they are more likely, in the first instance, to seek joint ventures with well-established local companies than to invest directly. Mr Bacon endorses this view suggesting the logical order for development is that companies are first likely to appoint distributors for their products. If this goes well they will consider manufacturing under licence, or some sort of joint venture, before taking the route of setting up their own operation. From the foreign investor's perspective, there is clearly ample reason for caution. There remains a high degree of political uncertainty and the economic policies of a future government are also unclear. Add to this a familiar list of sins - high inflation, high tax, low labour productivity and the risk of a depreciating currency - and one has a fairly powerful list of disincentives. South Africa also has many powerful and well-established companies which are likely to give any foreign competitor a torrid time. Finally, South African companies have not exactly been falling over themselves to invest in new capacity. There are no grounds for expecting foreigners to be any different. The flip-side is obvious: the market has enormous potential. It promises also to be very profitable. Mr Steinberg says that in 1991 the US investment of Dollars 900m earned profits of Dollars 126m. There are not many countries offering that sort of return. From South Africa's point of view, foreign investment will be a bonus rather than a necessity. The main benefits are likely to flow in terms of enhancing competition and allowing technology transfer, rather than in terms of sheer volume of capital flows. Even here, the flows would not have to be particularly large to make an important difference. For the time being, though, investment trends are being obscured by the underlying growth environment. With South Africa likely in 1992 to record its third successive year of negative growth, investors can hardly be blamed for holding off until there are some signs of growth returning to the economy.

0,FT942-16138 ,"FT942-16138 _AN-EDLEUADPFT 940412   FT  12 APR 94 / The prisoner's dilemma      By JOE ROGALY   The best that can be expected from South Africa this year is the emergence of a government strong enough to restore order and wise enough to lay the foundations of a liberal economy. The worst is chaos, civil war, a botched social revolution, the end of any chance that sub-Saharan Africa's rehabilitation might be led from its southern tip. The first of this pair of anticipations is philosophically improper. It says nothing of democracy, or human rights, or cutting a deal with Inkatha. It implies the emergence of an over-mighty government such as that of Malaysia or Singapore. It suggests autocracy; a controlled, censored, or obedient media; an absence of those civic freedoms in which the north Atlantic countries luxuriate; an ominous willingness to deploy the security forces wherever necessary. Is that really the best that years of struggle against apartheid is destined to achieve? Probably. This foreboding is expressed without relish. Nobody, least of all those of us privileged to enjoy something better, should wish such a fate on post-apartheid South Africa. The world's hope for the republic, the goal to which its friends should assist it to strive, must be that a peaceful, open, democratic polity emerges as the 'new South Africa'. Many intelligent, decent South Africans clearly harbour such a vision. Pray that they are right. It is, however impossible to maintain the fiction that such a fairy-tale ending is imminent. For a start, the received wisdom among those close to the affairs of the republic has been that the appalling bloodshed, the killings of supporters of one party by another, can only be stopped by a 'crackdown'. This proposition has been argued with increasing confidence over the past year. The mailed fist will be visible before the government due to be elected at the end of this month has tidied up the crumbs left behind after the celebration banquets. There will be no doubt about what to do. South Africa has had years of practice at 'crackdowns', in which states of emergency are declared, 'troublemakers' are arrested and detained, and the press is censored. The first step, the declaration of an emergency, has already been taken in kwaZulu. A long-unanswered question has been whether the white-led security forces would take orders from a black-led administration. The signs are mixed, but encouraging for those who believe in civilian control of armed forces. It is not clear that the white-officered South African police (the rank and file is mostly black) are reconciled to the change of government. They do, however, know where their pay comes from. Most of them are expected to obey their new political masters. The SA Defence Force has shown that it will take orders from the mouth of Mr FW de Klerk, even when the president of the African National Congress, Mr Nelson Mandela, is visibly pulling the strings. Thus were lesser tribal homelands such as Bophutatswana and Ciskei brought into line. So, if need be, will kwaZulu be tackled. This time the order will be given by Mr Mandela, as the new president. When I was growing up in Johannesburg the ANC was the embodiment of non-racial, liberal, democratic virtue. The South African Communist party, its close ally, was the only white-led political organisation that could be wholly relied upon to support black aspirations. Others in the 'congress movement' represented Indians and mixed-race 'coloureds'. Liberation from apartheid was the goal that united all such groupings. If you be-lieved that that was an overriding necessity, your support for them was un-wavering. It is different today. I share the global admiration for Mr Mandela. The Nobel prize for peace sits comfortably upon his distinguished shoulders. It does, however, look as if he may be destined to crown his lifetime's achievement, the overthrow of apartheid, by slamming political opponents into the very jails from which he and other ANC leaders were so recently released. Since politics and murder are intertwined in parts of South Africa, he may be said to have little option. That does not detract from the bitter irony of what fate appears to have in store for him. South Africa cannot afford a provincial war, as in Katanga, Biafra or Angola. The ANC might try harder for a political settlement with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of kwaZulu, but it may be that the trick is not possible. Mediation will only succeed if both sides are ready to agree. But Chief Buthelezi, the darling of the dewy-eyed anti-communist right, is not a man anyone can easily do business with. The ANC clearly seeks centralised power over all the territory of the republic. The ANC assumption must be that the army, the most powerful in Africa, could quell a rebellion on its home ground. The elephant, as Mr Mandela has taken to calling his party, is in rampant mood. It would be comforting to stand aside from these hard realities and cry out for justice. The truth is that no clear road to a just settlement exists. South Africa will fail absolutely if there is no economic growth. The economy cannot prosper if there is chaos. The imposition of order by the ANC is thus likely to be a painful prerequisite for a resumption of inward investment, and a resurgence of the economy. Even that would not suffice. Only the free market, the proven stimulator of capitalist energy, can ensure that growth is sufficiently rapid to enable the ANC to keep its election promises. Outsiders can read recent ANC statements to mean that South Africa's new masters have begun to understand this. Mr de Klerk's National party formerly prospered by creating state-financed jobs for Afrikaners. Now it appears to have become a late convert to the merits of private finance. The National party may win as much as a fifth of the vote, perhaps even a quarter. That is not enough to temper the demands of the ANC. It might be sufficient to be useful if Mr Mandela perceives the value of familiar faces in important economic posts. A post-election alliance with Mr de Klerk could produce two Nobel peace prize winners' signatures at the foot of orders to the security forces to 'pacify' troublespots. Together the old jailer and his old prisoner might avert the disintegration of their country. They might also reassure potential investors, if Africa's luck turns.

0,FT943-10555 ,"FT943-10555 _AN-EHDDVAC7FT 940804   FT  04 AUG 94 / UNloved, UNwanted: A fitting fate for the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   You may have missed it, but 1980 to 1990 was the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. It had no impact whatsoever on the continent the first time round, but the perpetrator of this exercise in wishful thinking, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido), appears to work on the principle that Pooh Bear applied to his Hums. Pooh, it will be recalled, managed the first line of Hum without difficulty: 'Sing Ho] for the life of a bear.' It sounded splendid, but what came next? Pooh got stuck, until he had a brain wave. He would sing it very fast, in the hope the second line would just pop out. So will you please welcome the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa. There is not quite the same ring to it, for Unido seems to have been caught napping. The second decade runs from 1993 to 2002. Enough is enough. It is time to abolish a body whose demise would distress only its 1,200 employees and the hundreds of experts and consultants who feed from its Dollars 100m-a-year trough. Unido was introduced to the world on January 1 1967 through General Assembly resolution 2152 (XXI) of November 17 1966. From the start it had ideas above its station, claiming that it had a 'mandate to act as the central co-ordinating body for industrial activities within the UN system'. Like many organisations spawned by the United Nations, Unido has been sustained by pompous jargon and an overriding belief in its own importance. The concept of an Industrial Decade, whatever that means, is given spurious authenticity through the language signalling its creation. The general assembly, we are told, in Resolution 35/668 of December 5 1980, proclaimed the 1980s as the Industrial Development Decade for Africa 'thus giving worldwide recognition to the decade'. Of course, it did nothing of the sort, except for UN bureaucrats. A welter of documents sustained their fantasies, products of seminars and special sessions where the delegates draw their per diems and build nothing more substantial than castles in the air. By 1983 Unido had produced a slim volume of pensees entitled A Programme for the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. The reader is warned that this handbook 'differs in many respects from previous practice, and calls for a firm rejection of isolated piecemeal planning of the past and a clear shift away from over-occupation (sic) with foreign exchange problems external to the region'. So much for Africa's overvalued exchange rates of the era, the single most serious feature of the already evident economic crisis that was destroying the continent. 'The new approach,' the guidelines reveal, 'is also predicated on a decisive move towards the integrated development of the human resources, institutional mechanisms and technological capacities required to assess and utilise the natural resources and raw material endowments of the region, expand local markets, enlarge the range of complementarities and strengthen links between industry and other sectors of the economy.' Of course, these banal exhortations did Africa no service. What they did do was to alert consultants and experts worldwide that here was another UN gravy train. Like the 1970s, the 1980s saw a series of Unido country reports, stupefyingly bland in their analysis, out of date in their statistics, and deferential to autocratic governments and kleptocratic regimes. Like all UN organisations, Unido selects its officers more for their country of origin than their expertise. Thus places were found for assorted econometricians, agronomists and economists, most with dubious credentials. They usually owed their jobs to political patronage, and lived in a world of diplomatic privileges, duty free facilities and hardship allowances. Unlike the World Bank, no one subjects Unido to scrutiny. If anyone cared to assess its policies and proposals over the 1970s and the 1980s, the organisation would emerge deeply discredited. Today Unido has the chutzpah to claim that it 'assists both governments and the public and private sector through technical and investment promotion services, and with policy advice'. The suggestion that this ineffectual agency might assist the private sector, or have any insight into investment, is risible. To be fair, Unido should not be blamed for Africa's crisis. True, it bears the responsibility that attaches to those who stay silent when they should be sounding the alarm. But no one took much notice of Unido and its experts. And that is why no one will miss it.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "
0,FT922-4435 ,"FT922-4435 _AN-CFEA9ADTFT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (8): Burdened by expectations - Profile, Derek Keys      By PHILIP GAWITH   WHILE THE architecture of South Africa's constitutional future is painstakingly negotiated at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the responsibility for the economic foundations of that structure is lodged squarely with one man - Derek Keys, the minister of finance, trade and industry and economic co-ordination. His task is as onerous and demanding as his title is long. It is also, in a wry sort of way, simple. He must arrest the declining standard of living of South Africans which, if it continues unabated, will undermine any constitutional settlement. The real gross national product per head of population declined to R3,275 in 1991 from R3,905 in 1981. The main issue is growth, as Mr Keys has many times stressed since taking office in January - he assumed the Finance portfolio in May following the resignation of Mr Barend du Plessis. Though constitutional politics still dominate the public agenda in South Africa, the urgent need for growth is beginning to take on mild tones of hysteria, and not without reason. South Africa recorded negative economic growth of 0.5 per cent in each of 1990 and 1991 and looks set for another year of negative growth in 1992. As Mr Keys is discovering, the burden of expectations is enormous. Though he comes to the job with the unanimous blessing of the business community, he has already been ambushed by free-market critics, particularly in the areas of tariffs and taxes, distressed at his unwillingness to engage in precipitate, across-the-board cuts. Others, less concerned by ideology, are nonetheless bemused at his approach to the task at hand. A grand plan to turn around the economy is sought, and none is forthcoming. Instead, Mr Keys resorts to tantalising vagueness with phrases such as 'There's nothing to do but return to the old virtues'. Those familiar with the Keys method, however, warn against confusing style and substance. Thus Brian Gilbertson, Mr Keys's successor as chairman of the mining house Gencor, and one wholly admiring of his achievements, comments: 'In four years of working for Derek I never saw him do any work. When I would come into his office he would either be reading the FT or standing at the window looking at the pigeons outside.' On reflection, he says, there were four or five instances in which he saw Mr Keys working. He hastens to add, though, that Mr Keys was always impeccably prepared for board meetings, and his interventions, measured in their frequency, were often decisive. A memorable anecdote about Mr Keys concerns the occasion on which he returned a memorandum delivered to him for decision by two senior managers with the comment, 'I don't feel like Solomon today.' What Mr Keys's civil servants make of his management style is not a matter of public record. Some of it they will like, such as his habit of praising his senior lieutenants lavishly, and empowering them to take important decisions. The flip side of this they are likely to find most disconcerting  -his resolute insistence on delegating not only the power to take decisions, but the responsibility for them, too. Those wishing to assess how Mr Keys is likely to approach his job would do well to examine his time at Gencor. During the five and a half years there he achieved enormous success, much of it attributed to his managerial style and proficiency. He turned around an unwieldy, bureaucratic conglomerate, whose performance and rating were poor, into a highly-rated, entrepreneurially-driven and successful one. His main tools were to decentralise the group structure, empower the management and focus the group's activities through its mission of achieving real growth. His present task may be different, but there can already be no doubt that he is practising the same managerial principles. For Mr Keys, the way to achieve higher growth is through more investment, and the way to encourage this is through raising levels of confidence. This is not something he can achieve unilaterally: political uncertainty and violence are outside his ambit. Where he can achieve a great deal, however, is through helping forge an economic consensus among the main political actors. With the establishment of an economic forum, on which the state and all the main business and labour bodies are represented, the wheels of co-operation are in motion. To the question of whether the forum is not just corporatism of the sort discredited in many other countries, Mr Keys replies: 'This country would register an economic advance if we got to the corporatist stage.' A crucial question is how long Mr Keys will have in office. Most businessmen believe he needs at least five years, presiding through the transitional phase and into the first post-apartheid government. His lack of political and ideological baggage is a plus factor, but as one ANC spokesman commented: 'He's a very nice fellow, but at the end of the day he's in an apartheid cabinet.'

0,FT944-4618 ,"FT944-4618 _AN-ELGCWAGQFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (3): Welcome mat for foreign investors      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Zimbabwe's attitude to foreign investment has changed markedly since the 1980s, when it was ambivalent at best and often plain hostile, writes Michael Holman. But trade liberalisation, the abolition of most foreign exchange controls, the end of all but a handful of price controls, and other reforms have changed the picture. Together with the fact that President Robert Mugabe himself laid out the welcome mat for foreign investors at a London conference earlier this year, the business environment has been transformed. At its offices in the centre of Harare, officials of the Zimbabwe Investment Centre promise to provide a speedy, and if possible, one-stop service to investors. Established in 1989 as a department within the ministry of finance, since 1992 the centre has been an autonomous institution, advising on the incentives on offer, ranging from tax breaks to industrial sites on a concessional basis. Its officials paint a picture of Zimbabwe at the heart of regional groupings which represent a potential market of over 250m people with a combined GDP of some Dollars 155bn. Labour costs are as much as third below South Africa's, without the powerful trade unions which are so influential there. The centre promises that projects up to Dollars 10m will get its approval within a week, provided there is no potential health or environmental hazard, and its staff will assist the investor to obtain the licences or permits that may be necessary. Bigger investments will take longer to clear, but the days of red tape and implicit disapproval are over, the centre insists. Unfortunately, Mr Mugabe has not always made their task easy. Recent comments which have disquieted the investment community include his apparent reaffirmation of faith in socialism, made at the mid-year congress of the ruling party, though party officials maintain that he is committed to the economic reform programme. No less disconcerting to some observers was Mr Mugabe's distinction between 'indigenous' businessmen - ie white - and 'indigenous indigenous' businessmen - ie black - made in the course of a discussion on the need to 'indigenise' the economy. What the president has so far failed to spell out is how the government proposes to redress past inequities which have left the minority community in a dominant economic role, while maintaining the confidence of this vital group and not frightening away foreign investment. Most investors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, not necessarily because they doubt Mr Mugabe, but because they want to find out how post-apartheid South Africa will settle down. Since the London conference in May, and until August this year, UK investment flows have totalled a modest ZDollars 101m (around Pounds 6m), according to the centre. The biggest foreign investment, however, is the ZDollars 1.8bn platinum mining project 80km south west of Harare, financed by Delta Gold and BHP Minerals of Australia. This boost notwithstanding, net foreign investment since independence in 1980 has not reached three figures. Zimbabwe Investment Centre, Royal Mutual House, 45 Baker Avenue, Box 5950, Harare.

For this reason, he  added, Foreign Ministry Director General Tasos Panayidhis called  the deputy British high commissioner and U.S. charge d'affairs  to the Foreign Ministry. The government spokesman confirmed the  fact that British military personnel, whose number he did not  reveal, were interrogated by police for their observation in  Larnaca airport of an area where projects related to the  National Guard were under way. In this case, he said, a U.S.  citizen who earlier had met with one of the British military  officials also became involved. The area, he said, is not  prohibited, and initially it was not confirmed that anything  wrongful had been done. He added that the issue is under  further examination by the Ministries of Justice and Public  Order and Foreign Affairs. The government spokesman clarified  that the British military officials work at the British bases in  Cyprus and that they traveled in a car with regular license  plates. The U.S. citizen, though, used a car with diplomatic  license plates, and he might work at the U.S. Embassy. Replying  to another question, the government spokesman said that the  persons interrogated have not been placed on the stop list and  that they are free to leave whenever they want to. Kasoulidhis  said that no cameras or binoculars were discovered in their  possession, as was written in the press. He also said that an  investigation is also under way to determine how the information  regarding the National Guard work at Larnaca airport was leaked.  According to the government spokesman, the version that the  British and U.S. nationals gave is that it is their habit to  observe airplanes landing and taking off. Asked whether the  Republic's authorities accept this version, the government  spokesman said no.    The report on the action of the British and U.S. nationals  was exclusively reported last night by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation].     "

At the same time, he suggested that ""it might have simply  been a slip of the tongue or he might have said so in duress.""  In the current complex political situation, it is hard to  restrain oneself from poignant statements, he remarked.    In his words, Ukraine has never given any pretext for such  accusations.    U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian delegates discussed nuclear  disarmament and relations between their countries at tripartite  consultations last weekend. According the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry, the sides discussed the possibility of paying  compensation to Ukraine for the uranium that fills the nuclear  weapons withdrawn from the republic.

0,FT933-3937 ,"FT933-3937 _AN-DIJB0AG7FT 930910   FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: ANC offers miners hope of exchange control relaxation      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   THE AFRICAN National Congress yesterday raised the prospect that a new government might relax exchange controls to encourage investment by South African companies in the region, especially in the mining sector. Speaking at a mining conference in Johannesburg yesterday Mr Trevor Manuel, head of the ANC's department of economic planning, said the ANC was 'considering the possibility of creating a special window for investments in the region'. He said the ANC was anxious to stimulate local mining companies to invest in the region and thus to assist in its economic revival. Existing exchange control regulations make it very difficult for South African companies to finance investments beyond its borders. Companies have to convince the Reserve Bank (central bank), which administers exchange control, that there will be a virtually immediate benefit to the country from any such investment. The ANC - likely to be the largest party in a future government - has acknowledged that no such change could be expected before the second half of 1994, and even that may be an ambitious target. Although, as one bank official acknowledged, South Africa has a 'soft spot' for Africa, the selective relaxation of exchange controls for South Africans, while foreign lenders still find some of their loans subject to a sovereign debt repayment scheme, would be controversial. And while the ANC clearly feels a debt to its neighbours, all of whom suffered to some extent from South Africa's destabilisation policies in the past, it may have difficulty convincing the business community that the national interest is best served by favouring regional investment. In a speech outlining the ANC's view of the future of mining in South Africa, and on the continent, Mr Manuel said the ANC was 'committed to maintaining the international position of the (mining) sector and to creating conditions for guaranteeing the high levels of investment needed to replace depleting reserves'. He said that the ANC recognised that mining was a high-risk industry and that investors required 'above average' guarantees if they were to be attracted. The ANC was planning a review of the system of access to mineral rights in an attempt to encourage investment, he added. 'Mineral rights need to be freed up, but this needs to be done in such a way as still to guarantee the investor the right to mine with adequate tenure. The fiscal terms need to be stable and the investor must be given access to foreign exchange, both for imported inputs and the repatriation of profits.' The ANC, Mr Manuel added, was also committed to 'guaranteeing the investor a stable economic environment, including guarantees against nationalisation without compensation'. Mr Manuel did not lay much emphasis on the 'responsibilities' of the investor, other than to note that the legacy of apartheid in the industry would have to be addressed through training of the local population. 'We hope that we will see much greater black South African participation in ownership and the higher paid positions.' He endorsed the conventional wisdom that the future of the local mining industry lay in the route of beneficiation, or adding value, to minerals. Examples suggested were stainless steel and aluminium kitchenware and cutlery.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P1099 Metal Ores, NEC.     P10   Metal Mining.

He expressed gratitude to the Croatian firemen for  their contribution in the patriotic war. Speaking about the  firemen's parade in Varazdin, he also said:    [Begin Tudjman recording] This parade speaks about the unity  of all parts of Croatia, of all Croatian counties, about the  unity that we must nurture in all areas because we have  established a single, independent, sovereign, and  internationally recognized Croatian state. There are still  people in the world who cannot reconcile themselves to this  fact. Our Croatia has become, however, not just internationally  recognized, but our sovereign and independent Croatia also has  powerful allies and friends, including, in the first place, the  United States, the most powerful world superpower in one part of  the world, and also our friend China, another world power, in  the other part of the world.    We have good relations with the European Union and friendly  relations with most of the European and other countries in the  world. Croatia's international status is such that we can  devote ourselves to carrying out other tasks before us: the  liberation of the occupied parts of Croatian and the development  of the federation and the confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  From then on, we can devote ourselves in peace to economic and  cultural development and to the tasks our government is faced  with.    In both the economic and political fields, we have achieved  not just surprising results, but a miracle that the world is  admiring. We have curbed inflation. We have created conditions  for the introduction of a new Croatian currency that will be  stable because our efforts and our sweat and blood are in our  hands and will no longer go to foreign capitals.

Is this what the U.S.-China trade is all about? Observers  here said no, arguing that America's commercial interests are at  stake if the Clinton administration misunderstands the real  nature of trade scene.    While U.S. officials, in discussions with the Chinese,  assumed that the U.S. trade deficit with China is largely the  result of an insufficiently open Chinese market, many observers  thought otherwise.    ""The U.S. should abandon using the bilateral imbalance in  its  trade with China as a meaningful indicator of the state of their  relations,"" the University of Washington scholar Nicholas Lardy  said.    When introducing his new book ""China in the New World  Economy"", Lardy argued that China is ""fundamentally different""  with Japan, and this should be the starting point for decisions  at the White House.    Last year, Washington's trade deficit with Beijing was 22.8  billion dollars, according to the Commerce Department. The  Treasury Department predicted in November that China will  surpass Japan as America's largest deficit trading partner by  the year 2000.    It seems certain that America's absolute trade imbalances  with China, as measured by the U.S., will widen significantly  for several years, but this is not the whole picture, observers  here noted.    China's trade, they said, is following a pattern  increasingly  consistent with the principle of ""comparative advantage"",  supplying more of the U.S. demand for garments, textiles, toys,  footwear and sporting goods.    Meanwhile, the country's imports accounted for industrial  products which embody higher levels of technologies have risen  sharply and by 1993 accounted for almost 90 percent of total  imports.    On economic openness, according to a recent World Bank  report, China is ""significantly more open"" than the U.S., Japan  and other East Asian countries, with ""extremely high"" import  penetration in some sectors.    As an obvious contrast with Japan, China is the only country  with which the U.S. has run a trade deficit that has not been a  global trade surplus country as well.    ""China has run a systematic global trade and current account  deficit since reform began, its external debt has grown  continuously,"" Lardy said. ""I believe China is likely to be a  net borrower over the mid-term.""    According to the U.S. Government, U.S. exports to China grew  54 percent in 1991-92 and 21.5 percent in the first three  quarter of 1993, roughly twice the speed of that to Mexico,  Singapore, Hong Kong and China's Taiwan.    China's position in U.S. exports has been underestimated,  observers said, since U.S. goods re-exported to China from Hong  Kong were not treated as exports to China. If accounted  otherwise, as they should be, China is the fifth largest export  market for the United States.    David Richardson, author of ""U.S. Export Disincentives"",  estimated that U.S. exports to China in 1989 would have been  five to 10 billion dollars higher in the absence of national  security controls on the U.S. side.    Most of the shortfall in exports to China, exceeded only by  exports foregone to the Soviet Union, was in chemicals,  industrial machinery, electronic and electrical equipment,  transportation equipment, instrument and related products.    ""The U.S. cannot afford economically costly symbolism,  especially when the costs are borne by its most dynamic,  technologically competitive sectors,"" wrote Richardson,  professor at Syracuse University.    As to export credits, observers said, American firms seeking  to sell in China are provided with far less export credits by  the administration than those provided to European and Japanese  firms by their governments.    The U.S., the only industrial country without a concessional  loan or mixed credit programs for China, has only a few modest  trade promotion programs to China. Washington, for example,  does not guarantee the investment involving transfer of  resources to China.    Concessional finance and export credits, observers here  noted, will be unusually effective sales tools for American  companies if they are willing to be involved in China's  infrastructure projects like electric power generation,  telecommunications and transportation.    ""U.S. policy towards China,"" Lardy said in his book,  ""ignores  the factors that contribute to China's unique combination of a  global trade deficit and a bilateral surplus in trade with the  U.S..""

This is the question facing the governments on the two  sides of the Atlantic Ocean.    And there is little hope to put their chronic argument to  rest when the labor and finance ministers of the world's biggest  industrial countries gather here on Monday [14 March] for a  summit that, for the first time, focuses exclusively on jobs.    ""For long, the choice is either between a low wage, high  employment model, that is the United States, and a high wage,  low employment model, that is Europe,"" commented Jeff Faux,  president of the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute.    ""It seemed to us that this trade-off is unsatisfactory,"" he  said. ""Solving the problem will require some sort of collective  action.""    Collective action comes from a common solution, which now  looks almost impossible since the problems at issue, despite  some similarities, are basically different, observers noted.    In the U.S., the real wages of workers have been falling by  one percent a year since 1973, when the country's real gross  domestic product went up 27 percent. However, it gained more  than three million jobs since the 1990-1991 recession, mostly  part-time jobs in the service area.    ""Especially in recent years, the real problem is we've had a  collapse in earnings opportunities for young Americans of all  educational levels,"" said Lester Thurow, MIT's [Massachusetts  Institute of Technology] professor on management and economics.    In Europe, it is a picture of another kind. European Union's  unemployment rate stands at a high of 11 percent, although in  the last 18 years, the manufacturing workers there enjoyed wage  increases from 30 percent to 40 percent.    ""From the European perspective, the position is that  unemployment is worse, it is worsening, and it will continue to  worsen,"" said Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor of the Exchequer  of Britain's Labor Party on Thursday.    In the U.S., meanwhile, six out of every seven new jobs  created from 1970 to 1991 were in the private sector, while in  Europe, according to OECD statistics, two thirds of the new jobs  were in government.    Another difference: Half of the incomes for European workers  come from benefits and pensions, while in the U.S., workers  suffered a continuous decline in unemployment insurance  benefits, which generated the call to reform the country's  welfare system ""as we know it.""    For the whole 1980s, the unemployment rate in the U.S. and  European Union were respectively 7.3 percent and 10.1 percent,  while in the 1960s and 1970s, the rates were five percent for  the U.S. and two percent for Europe.    What's in common for them, according to Eileen Appelbaum, a  professor of economics in the Temple University, is that the  industries experiencing high productivity in these countries all  shed workers.    ""The question is how and whether we can get back to a  situation in which wages, productivity and employment all rise  together,"" she asked at a recent seminar.    The Clinton administration, which said it expected no  communiques out of the two-day summit, stressed in recent days  that they wanted to use the occasion to swap notes with Western  Europe.    ""It's the height of arrogance to think we cannot learn from  each other,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen last  week.    For examples, U.S. officials said, Europe's success in  worker  training and integrity of schools and workplaces is one area  that Washington thinks warrants learning.    The mobility of the U.S. labor markets, which means workers  can move freely and employers can fire workers without the  pressures from labor unions, U.S. officials said, is perhaps  their own advantage that cannot be found now in Europe.    For U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, there is a third  choice bringing the gap across the Atlantic.    ""It may be to combine the investment in education in Europe  with the dynamic labor flexibility in the United States, all  encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth  and jobs,"" he told foreign reporters on Wednesday.    In so saying, Reich was referring to the high price  Europeans  have been paying for higher interest rates, especially in  Germany, which the U.S. said obstructed the countries' real  economic growth.    This, in turn, is not what the European ministers would like  to be lectured when they fly half around the world to Detroit,  whose major presence - the auto plants - is the pride for the  White House, more than ever.

These statements have always been premeditated, hostile, and  biased.    Many -- if not all -- of these statements fail to convince  those who hear them. It is noted that U.S. officials issue  judgments that are supposed to be made by the United Nations or  the Security Council. Those officials, without even taking into  consideration the formal side, speak about issues which are the  main responsibilities of international organizations.    In the past, U.S. officials used to drop hints for the  international organizations with their positions and ideas.  Today, however, they do not bother themselves with this.    Examples of this can be seen in the statements by Michael  McCurry, official spokesman of the U.S. State Department, on the  killing of the AFP correspondent in Iraq's Kurdistan and the  wounding of two UN guards in that area.    This U.S. spokesman cited information revealing a hellish  imagination. We listened to an unbelievable story. He said:  The United Nations has information that the Iraqi Government  rewards people who are ready to kill workers in the United  Nations and in humanitarian organizations. He then spoke about  the value of these rewards and how they were raised at the  beginning of March. He then said: If giving these rewards  proves to be true, they represent violations of the UN  resolutions. In other words, he is not sure whether or not the  information is true.    It is natural to say that the information -- if there is  such  information -- is fabricated by their agents in the area, who  live under their protection and who play a treacherous and  terrorist role with the weapons they receive from their masters.    Since the area is under their protection and is run by their  agents, they are responsible for all the crimes and violations  there. Why don't such acts happen with other UN officials  throughout the rest of Iraq, despite the Iraqis' rancor and  rejection of their presence, and despite the fact that hundreds  of reporters visit Iraq and carry out their tasks under the best  of conditions, provided by the Culture and Information Ministry?    Why do the Americans remain silent about the daily killings,  looting, and robbery carried out by their agents against Iraqi  Kurds?     "
0,FT944-14197 ,"FT944-14197 _AN-EJXDSAFDFT 941024   FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Indosat highlights faith in telecom privatisations - International offerings      By MARTIN BRICE and RICHARD LAPPER   The enthusiasm of international investors for shares in Indosat, the Indonesian telecoms group, which rose 20 per cent in their first day of trading, has put under the spotlight one of Asia's most rapidly growing emerging markets. It has also served to underline another significant trend: the enthusiasm of securities houses, banks and institutional investors for freshly privatised telecommunications businesses, but some analysts are questioning whether investors are becoming over-enthusiastic. There is no doubting bankers' enthusiasm. The industry is set to bring Dollars 100bn in offerings to the global markets within the next five years and bankers can expect to earn in the region of Dollars 3bn in fees from these deals. Securities houses are gearing up for a sharp rise in telecoms offerings - increasing the size of their analytical teams is just one method. The Indosat deal has been carried on a wave of enthusiasm which has affected other global telecom offers: Pakistan raised Dollars 900m when it sold 10 per cent of Pakistan Telecom. The government had originally aimed to raise just Dollars 500m. The value of ADRs in Telmex, Mexico's telecommunication company privatised in 1991, has increased from Dollars 27 to Dollars 60. The Indian government plans to sell part of its 85 per cent stake in VSNL, the international telecommunications monopoly, at a price of about Rs1,100 a share - which one banker reckoned as '35 times earnings'. Other countries planning privatisations or sell-offs include Belgium, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey and Hungary. Potential privatisations later in the decade include Brazil, South Africa and South Korea. However, some specialists are suggesting that investors may be losing sight of the risks. 'One warning sign is the almost unanimous view that telecommunications investments carry low risk,' says Mr Rod Dowler, head of Technology Consulting, a specialist advisory company, and formerly head of KPMG's telecoms consultancy. 'This echoes the assertion that countries cannot go broke or property is always a safe investment, that accompanied previous investment stampedes.' He warns that newly privatised companies could be artificially attractive because of their monopoly in local markets and could be hit by the emergence of competition. The question of valuing a telecoms company has been addressed by Baring Securities, which held a seminar on the subject in Cambridge last month. Baring's model looks at the territory covered and growth potential. This question of valuation may be highlighted by the sale of part of OTE, the Greek telecoms operator, which is due this year. At first sight it has all the attractions of an emerging market telecom company but a close examination reveals that there may be less potential for growth. The penetration of telephone lines in Greece, at about 47 per hundred people, is not far short of the European average. Athens is not a major commercial hub, and servicing the myriad Greek islands will be expensive. One analyst values OTE at Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn, yet the Greek government hopes it will be valued at Dollars 5.2bn. 'I'm sceptical. I don't see it as a red hot deal,' he said. Another analyst says that although telecoms are one of the few utilities with good growth prospects 'it is very easy to get too excited and pay silly prices'.

Chien, replying to an interpellation by Democratic  Progressive Party legislator Parris Chang, said the government  had foreseen as long as three and a half years ago that drastic  political changes would occur in South Africa, even though  bilateral ties with the white-ruled government at that time were  solid.    ""We indeed had promised a U.S.$60 million loan to help South  Africa finance a farming development project during F.W. De  Klerk's tenure as the president, but the loan has not yet been  given,"" Chien said.    The loan proposal was raised again when President Li  Teng-hui  visited South Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's presidential  inauguration on May 10, Chien said, adding that both countries  may re-start negotiations on the loan.    Chien emphasized that Li had not offered any new loans to  South Africa during his visit, but did agree to help South  Africa implement a vocational-training project. ""South Africa  will send people here to see for themselves how job-training  projects are implemented,"" Chien said.    He added that the ROC has agreed to share with South Africa  its successful experience in helping military personnel  assimilate into society after retirement.    Many legislators here are against any new economic aid to  South Africa on grounds that the Nelson Mandela-led African  National Congress, which now rules the new government, has  maintained close ties with Beijing for many years, and may  eventually shift diplomatic recognition away from Taipei.    On the contrary, though, Li's visit, previously perceived as  a last-ditch effort by Taiwan to salvage its relationship with  South Africa, seems to have paid off handsomely. A confident  Li, shortly after a meeting with Mandela, told a group of  Chinese and representatives of Taiwan-owned companies in South  Africa on May 11 that the bilateral ties between the two  countries are strong and steady.    South Africa is the largest country of the 29 with which the  ROC maintains official diplomatic ties.     "

The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be  more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing  full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed  the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special  envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met  Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the  Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau.    Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go  along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and  decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended  last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the  stalemate.    In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement  on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future.    Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as  the  three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North  Korea in the future, the sources said.    The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be  forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if  North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental  nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang  without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel  rods.    Takeuchi told reporters that the three exchanged views on  the North Korean matter, describing the current situation as  ""knotty,"" but added that if the talks can be held, ""I look  forward to progress"" on the issue.    Takeuchi said that he had received no information that North  Korea has halted its withdrawal of the spent fuel rods from the  Yongbyon reactor as demanded by the IAEA last week.    Hearing that North Korea started removing the rods last  week,  the U.N. nuclear watchdog demanded a temporary halt to the  operations in order to determine if any radioactive material had  been diverted to military purposes.    A refusal to halt the operations could prove to be an  obstruction to the staging of the talks, and according to  diplomatic sources, Gallucci said that it would be a problem if  North Korea proceeded with the fuel rod removal.

An unidentified correspondent says, ""what you said on many  occasions before was confirmed today. Traces of U.S. supplies  to the Muslim army have been found in this area.""    Mladic answers: ""That is nothing new, as you can see all of  the equipment from parachutes to soldiers' boots is American or  belonging to the states of the NATO alliance.

Mr Adams, continuing his high-profile first visit to the US  in 20 years, listed three points connected with the December  document signed by Mr Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert  Reynolds which he said needed further explanation.    He told an influential New York audience these were:     -  Aspects of the declaration itself;    -  Contradictory  statements about it made by the two premiers;    -  The issue of  processes, measures and steps envisaged by the declaration.    He spoke out as the US administration sent what may well be  a  signal to him, by calling on all parties to the Northern Ireland  conflict to embrace the Downing Street peace declaration.    The US statement, speaking of an ""historic opportunity"" to  end the violence, was released after Vice President Al Gore met  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Washington.    Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, listed his demands during  an address to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy,  the high point of his 48-hour stay.    He told an audience of 300 in New York's Waldorf-Astoria  hotel -- venue for the Committee's conference on Northern  Ireland -- that the US could make a ""significant and positive""  role to achieving peace.    But he accused the British Government of stalling by  refusing  to clarify the December 15 peace declaration.    But his statement brought a strong retort from Mr Major.    In the Commons, the Prime Minister accused Sinn Fein of  ""prevarications"" and ""evasions"" about the ending of violence.    Mr Major said: ""There has been no commitment by Mr Adams or  the Provisional movement to end violence for good.    ""That is the commitment that this House and everybody in  this  country and Ireland is waiting to hear.""    Mr Adams was on day two of his visit, authorised by  President  Clinton against the wishes of the Major Government. He has  conducted a series of coast-to-coast TV interviews amid huge  press interest, as well as meetings with top American  politicians.    He told his audience that Irish republicans had to decide  whether the Anglo-Irish document was a first step for the  British Government in the direction of lasting peace, or merely  a political response by a government under pressure, aimed at  avoiding a political confrontation with Dublin.    He said: ""The Joint Declaration is described by its authors  as `the first step' towards a peace settlement.    ""Sinn Fein is committed to such a settlement and I am  concerned -- I am indeed anxious -- to be persuaded that the  Downing Street declaration can provide the basis for this.    ""And even if this is not the case -- if there is a gap  between what it required and what is on offer -- then we should  all move to bridge that gap.""    Mr Adams said the exercise of the right of Irish  self-determination required a change in British policy and the  removal of the veto on change in Northern Ireland held by the  majority Unionist community.    He acknowledged the democratic rights of the Unionists, but  claimed they would be upheld in an independent Ireland.    ""The argument that the consent of a national minority,  elevated into a majority within an undemocratic  artifically-created state, is necessary before a constitutional  change can occur is a nonsense,"" he said.    Mr Adams also claimed that the Downing Street declaration  was  a response to proposals made after a series of talks he had with  Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume  last year.    He said it would be judged on whether it advanced the peace  process or just a ""cosmetic response"" to that peace initiative.    There was a degree of suspicion and scepticism among  nationalists and republicans regarding the real motives and  intentions of the British Government.    He did not mention whether the IRA would declare a  ceasefire,  Britain's precondition for Sinn Fein's participation in peace  talks.    Awaiting him back in Belfast was a letter he requested from  Mr Reynolds clarifying the declaration from the Irish  government's point of view.    He added that the British government's refusal to ""provide  clarification for Sinn Fein must be a matter of deep concern to  everyone interested in peace.""    ""In contrast...it is clear that for the first time a Dublin  government is making a serious attempt to address the issue of  peace and a political settlement in the north of Ireland,"" he  said.    ""I wish to commend Albert Reynolds. He has taken a postive  and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification.    ""The potential for peace in Ireland has never been more  realisable.""    And he made clear that Americans and the Clinton  administration could be actively involved in the peace process  and bring pressure to bear on Britain to break the deadlock.    ""Progressive opinion in the U.S.A. can assist in the  development of a peace process in Ireland. The U.S. government  can play a significant and positive role in encouraging the  process by helping to create a climate that moves the situation  on,"" he said.    He said the U.S. government could achieve that goal in two  ways -- by facilitating the free exchange of information and,  obviously referring to Britain, ""actively seeking to encourage  dialogue and agreement.""    Mr Adams added: ""It is clear that the British government  have  used all their influence, as in the past, to impede any progress  on this or in any other matter which could influence or inform  perceptions about the current situation in Ireland and the  British government's responsibility for the present intolerable  standoff.""    He again praised President Clinton for permitting his visa  to  enter the U.S., and drew a parallel between the situation in  Northern Ireland and current political moves in South Africa and  the Middle East.    The lessons from those two areas were clear -- and ""the  conflict in Ireland is no different.""    Mr Adams was the third of three Ulster political leaders to  speak at the conference, behind the middle-of-the-road Alliance  Party chief Dr John Alderdice and Mr Hume.    Absent, though, were Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist  Party boss the Rev Ian Paisley and Ulster Unionist leader James  Molyneaux.    Both stayed away in protest at the involvement of Sinn Fein  and to underline their distaste at Mr Adams finally getting his  visa.    The US statement released by the White House said Mr Gore,  in  his meeting with Mr Hurd, ""underscored our admiration for the  courage and vision of Prime Ministers Major and Reynolds in  putting forward a new framework for peace in Northern Ireland.""    ""He (Gore) reiterated our conviction that the December 15  Joint Declaration of the two governments provides an historic  opportunity to end the tragic violence,"" the statement said.    ""It provides a process by which all parties who eschew  violence -- in deeds as well as words -- can participate in  building a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland,"" it read.    Mr Gore also emphasised ""the importance the U.S. attaches to  close cooperation with our British ally on a range of global  issues,"" the statement added.    British officials, although reportedly unhappy with the  decision to reverse the 20-year policy and allow Mr Adams into  the U.S., have not criticised Washington publicly.    In London, Mr Major declared that the peace initiative  ""leaves no conceivable excuse for violence.""    ""And all the words, all the prevarications, all the evasions  of Sinn Fein will be utterly and completely hollow until they  end violence.""    Mr Adams was being subjected to only low-key security.  Volunteer members of the New York police pipe ban were assigned  to protect him ""in a discreet way,"" according to security  sources.     "

""Today Africa stands at the door of total  political liberation as apartheid is about to be relegated to  the ignominy of history"", the organisation's secretary general,  Salim Ahmed Salim said.    Addressing the 59th session of the OAU Council of Ministers  which began in Addis Ababa Monday, Salim said at a time when  South Africa was undergoing fundamental transformation, Africa  which had invested so much energy and resources in support of  the liberation movements must make its presence felt in that  country.    He told the foreign ministers that Africa had a  responsibility to South Africa and must sustain interest and  keep the momentum of support to the on-going process in order to  accomplish the objectives it set for itself in the country.    ""Today, when we are walking the final mile and we are about  to see the results of years of struggle and sacrifice, we owe it  to ourselves and the people of South Africa not to relax our  vigilance or allow our enthusiasm to diminish"", he said. The  end of apartheid, Salim stressed, marked not only the closing of  one of the saddest chapters in the history of Africa, but also  the beginning of a new challenge of economic cooperation in the  southern African sub- region and Africa as a whole. ""We now need  to see how the immense potential which exists in South Africa in  terms of capital, resources and know-how, can interface with  those found in the rest of the continent, to forge an economic  partnership which can propel the continent to new heights of  growth and development"". Salim said for Africa to successfully  monitor the forth-coming South Africa elections, ""we need to be  there, in good time and in sufficient numbers, to support the  process and to encourage our brothers and sisters"". He said  that concerted action on the part of African countries would  make a difference similar to the success they achieved during  the Namibian election. Africa must give some material  assistance to the liberation movements to enable them compete  against a government ""endowed with almost unlimited resources  and the advantage of incumbency"", he added. The OAU scribe  urged African states to urgently contribute to the election fund  established at the OAU summit in Cairo in 1993 to support the  liberation movements.     "

0,FT934-15542 ,"FT934-15542 _AN-DJKC9AEDFT 931011   FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (6): Southerly attractions - The Mediterranean region has much to offer investors      By DAVID LANE   ON DARK winter mornings in Birmingham or Dusseldorf, how many businessmen wish for something different in terms of office or factory location? The idea of working in a more agreeable climate must be attractive to company managers when they peer down headlight beams in peak-hour traffic on motorways and autobahns. Many businessmen would probably prefer to be elsewhere as their cars' wipers clear snow, sleet or drizzle from their windscreens. And where better than the Mediterranean? But it is not only the climate and the accompanying lifestyle, enhanced by the cultural and historical heritage of Mediterranean countries, that makes them attractive for companies setting up or expanding their activities in Europe. Mediterranean Europe enjoys a strategic geographical position, looking north towards its own continent, as well as south towards Africa and East towards Asia. In addition to serving European markets, factories and offices on the Mediterranean's northern side are well placed to cover North and East Africa and the Near and Middle East. However, climate, lifestyle and geography are not enough on their own. In taking decisions on where to site facilities, companies must evaluate many other factors: the availability and cost of skilled and unskilled labour, quality of services, infrastructure, administrative structures and regulatory/legislative frameworks, political stability and incentives. How do Europe's Mediterranean options measure up? Spain: A leading beneficiary of inward investment in its manufacturing industry, statistics show that Spain is the world's fourth largest recipient of direct foreign investment. Last year's Dollars 10.3bn followed Dollars 11.6bn in 1991, Dollars 12.3bn in 1990 and Dollars 6.8bn in 1989. Over this period, Spain received more than twice the foreign direct investment in Italy. Spain owes its success in attracting foreign business to several factors. With a population of about 38m, Spain brought a large new market when it entered the EC at the beginning of 1986. Many foreign corporations wanted to be close to sales and have established operations in the country. The abundant supply of skilled and unskilled labour is an attraction. Over 18 per cent of Spain's workforce was engaged in agriculture in the mid-1980s, offering a pool of labour for factory work. While the agricultural workforce had fallen to just below 10 per cent of the total last year, the high level of unemployment suggests that supply constraints should not be a problem. However, Spain's advantage in direct and indirect labour costs has been eroded over recent years, and labour legislation is not market-orientated. IF the Spanish labour factor has lost some of its attraction, developments in infrastructure have enhanced the country's appeal for inward investors. Road and rail networks have been extensively modernised and expanded, and air services improved. Considerable importance has been placed on upgrading telecommunications. Part of the EC's relatively less-developed southern rim, Spain offers a significant level of investment incentives. Only a few areas of the country fail to qualify. Incentives are available from various sources (the state, local authorities and the EC). Some are targeted at specific industries. Spain's international image received a boost last year when Barcelona hosted the Olympic Games, Madrid held the title of Cultural Capital of Europe and Seville was the location for the Universal Exhibition. With the coverage given to Barcelona and Seville, few businessmen could have been unaware of Spain when listing alternatives for new factories and offices. Italy: Across the sea from Barcelona, Genoa also put on a major event last year. However, the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the Americas was overshadowed by political and economic events. Attendance at Genoa's fair was disappointing. Moreover, investigations after its closure revealed that it had been caught up in Italy's massive tangentopoli ('kickback city') institutionalised corruption scandal. Tangentopoli, which has seen foreign companies in the magistrates' net, has revealed an almost total absence of corporate ethics. But this is only one of several factors to discourage potential direct investors from choosing Italy. The Sicilian Mafia and its Calabrian and Neapolitan cousins is another. Although there seems to have been progress against organised crime this year, memories of the car-bomb assassinations of two leading magistrates last year will take a long time to fade. Italy's standing has taken a series of knocks, this summer's crisis at the Ferruzzi-Montedison Group and the liquidation of the EFIM state-holding corporation providing further examples. More than a year after the liquidation decision was taken, EFIM's creditors are still awaiting payment from the state. Also in the queue for government money are businessmen who have invested in assisted areas and have not received promised grants. The crisis in Italy's public sector finances means that the state is no longer able to honour its commitments. Officials say that all incentives approved will eventually be paid, but that time is needed. However, the uncertainty over capital grant payments that has been a feature of Italy's regional development incentives for many years is now joined by uncertainty of the development framework itself. Officials say that a new approach will ration and target incentive finance. Companies will have to submit projects to the Ministry of Industry which will rank them on the basis of evaluation criteria. With the Mezzogiorno (the south) now showing severe cracks in public order, in addition to suffering from organised crime, it is questionable that it will be a strong contender for foreign investment. Distance from main European markets and public services that creak even more than in the rest of Italy have always been a handicap. Central and northern Italy will continue to offer interesting locations, being close to markets and enjoying better services. Particularly north of Tuscany, the strengths of the country's versatile and flexible labour force are evident, although inflexible labour laws and high labour costs are a severe disincentive. But how Mediterranean is Milan? Greece: There is no doubt about the Mediterranean character of Athens and other Greek cities, albeit the Levantine flavour is very different from Rome and Barcelona. Greece is also different in other respects, being more competitive on labour and other costs. The country has a longer membership of the European Community than Spain, having become a full member at the beginning of 1981. LIKE its Spanish and Italian Community partners, Greece also tries to attract inward investment. Substantial infrastructure projects are underway to encourage this. Law number 1892, enacted in 1990 by the then newly-elected New Democracy liberal government and ministerial circulars and directives, provide the framework for encouraging investment in industry and tourism. The levels of incentive (grants, tax and accelerated depreciation allowances) depend on the prefectures where the investment is located. However, the whole of Greece is open to foreign investment. Malta: Located in the centre of the Mediterranean, 100km from Sicily and 300km from the African coast, the small (250 sq km) island of Malta has been making large efforts to attract foreign investment. Measures such as the Industrial Development Act, the Malta International Business Act and the Offshore Trust Act, passed five years ago, are designed to boost foreign business activity in the republic. The emphasis given to electronics, robotics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing has yielded results. De La Rue, Dowty and SGS-Thomson are among those present. However, Malta also has ambitions to develop as an offshore business and financial centre. The authorities consider that the combination of suitable legislation, strategic position, good services and infrastructure, and low costs should put Malta on short lists when foreign companies are considering new locations. Balkans: While the former Yugoslavia has been struck off lists of alternative locations, and seems unlikely to be re-admitted soon, Albania is a different matter. The government wants to encourage foreign investment, and enacted legislation to this effect in August last year. A diplomat with close knowledge of Albania says, however, that problems over land tenure are a brake on foreign investment, and so also are Albania's own cash shortages and lack of a banking system. Foreign exchange operations are usually through street dealers off the main square in Tirana. Albania is certainly a low cost country and this has attracted Italian businessmen wanting to escape the higher costs at home. However, it offers little at present for leading international corporations. The diplomat says that in a few years 'Albania should be a real alternative.' But businessmen will have to wait several decades before Tirana and Durres offer that attractive Mediterranean lifestyle that sets the Birmingham commuter day-dreaming.

""There  is no plan so far of any military action. But the spirit to  assist and desire to help is there.""    Mr Nzo and senior officials of his department arrived in  Addis Ababa on Wednesday afternoon to officially raise South  Africa's flag outside the Organisation of African Unity  headquarters.

Mr Nzo said South Africa would play a role in conflict  mediation efforts in Africa in consultation with the OAU and the  United Nations.    He warned against exaggerated expectations of economic  benefits arising from South Africa's admission to the OAU.  ""Charity begins at home. South Africa also has large foreign  debt and must do everything possible to end that debt.""    The foreign minister said South Africa's membership of the  OAU was ""the culmination of a dream that one day South Africa  will take its rightful place alongside the independent states of  Africa"".    South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself  in international politics and there was an increased potential  for trade links with other African states.    He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy  would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South  Africans. ""We are not going to foster big brother relations with  the rest of Africa. We are for mutual co-operation to help  uplift the other countries of Africa.""

What is important to us is our  relations with individual countries. As to the handling of  other diplomatic affairs by those countries, they are within the  sovereign rights of that country and we cannot interfere with  the diplomatic affairs of that country. Therefore, we attach  importance to South Africa specifically in terms of our  bilateral diplomatic relations with that country. We should not  interfere with South Africa's choice of friends in its foreign  affairs.

He said that, in the future, our  country would not interfere with South African Government's  selection of friends. Our country would not voluntarily sever  diplomatic relations if South Africa establishes diplomatic  relations with Communist China. Even if it creates the issue of  dual recognition, it would benefit our side because other  countries might then be prompted to follow suit.    Minister Chien Fu said: [Begin recording] Are we going to  sever relations with South Africa if South Africa wants to  establish diplomatic relations with Communist China but  continues to maintain diplomatic relations with us and does not  sever relations with us? Concerning this question, I wish to  provide an explanation. The foreign relations of the Republic  of China are always based on one principle -- that is, we  sincerely want to establish relations with all peace-loving  countries in the world. What is important to us is our  relations with individual countries. As to the handling of  other diplomatic affairs by those countries, they are within the  sovereign rights of that country and we cannot interfere with  the diplomatic affairs of that country. Therefore, we attach  importance to South Africa specifically in terms of our  bilateral diplomatic relations with that country. We should not  interfere with South Africa's choice of friends in its foreign  affairs. We will definitely not sever diplomatic relations with  South Africa if it establishes diplomatic relations with a  certain regime or country.

Africa should not be neglected or marginalized.""    Qian made the statement at a press conference held here  today  at the end of his visit to Kenya.    He said, ""though Africa faces many difficulties, it also has  its own strong points. Africa is not hopeless its future is  bright.""    On his current East Africa trip, he said he has come to see  developments in the region by himself and promote bilateral  relations between China and the countries he visits.    On the major problem facing African countries, Qian said  African countries are not able to concentrate their efforts to  develop economy, adding many problems cannot be solved without  real development of economy.    He said Africa is under great political and economic  pressures from the outside world. Under such circumstances  there are turmoil and unrest in some African countries.  ""Without stability, it is hard for them to develop economy,"" he  pointed out.    On the democratic process in South Africa, Qian expressed  his  hope that the planned non-racial general election on April 27  will take place on schedule and a new democratic non-racial  South Africa will be established. ""China is willing to develop  relations with a new South Africa in various fields on the basis  of the principles of peaceful coexistence,"" Qian said.    As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between  China and South Africa, Qian said South Africa should follow  international regulations. ""It should not have diplomatic  relations with China and China's Taiwan province at the same  time.""    On the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and  Lesotho, Qian said this has once again demonstrated there is  only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of  the Chinese territory, the government of the People's Republic  of China is the sole legal government of China, and the attempt  of the Taiwan authorities to create ""two Chinas"" or ""one China,  one Taiwan"" has no popular support and will never succeed.

0,FT933-5767 ,"FT933-5767 _AN-DIAB3AGDFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (6): Better chance than most - Zimbabwe      By TONY HAWKINS   ZIMBABWE climbed, reluctantly, aboard the structural adjustment bandwagon in 1991, largely jettisoning the ideological baggage that so constrained the economy during the 1980s. The five-year programme started badly, primarily due to the worst drought in living memory, global recession and high interest rates. Few of the programme's quantitative targets are likely to be met by 1995. Real GDP, programmed to increase 25 per cent over the five years, will have fallen some 2 per cent by the end of this year, with the result that incomes today are around their levels of 20 years ago. Even if all goes well over the next two years, it will take conceivably until the turn of the century for income per head to regain its 1990 levels. Initial programme-funding targets have proved wildly optimistic and the government has been forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for an extended structural adjustment facility, as well as stepping up its reliance on aid. Fiscal targets have been missed - for which the drought is blamed - and last year's budget deficit of 11.3 per cent was well above the 6.6 per cent programme target. Exports, which by 1993 were supposed to have reached some Dollars 2,150m, are languishing around Dollars 1,500m, and will fall substantially short of the 1995 target of Dollars 2.6bn - the World Bank's forecast, of tobacco exports doubling by the late 1990s, being a classic example of confusing a short-term blip with a long-term trend. In the past six months, the pace of reform has quickened, though heel-dragging continues in the parastatal sector. On the positive side, finance minister Bernard Chidzero, in a remarkably opaque budget presentation in July, promised to halve the budget deficit to 5.4 per cent of GDP this year, by keeping spending growth to half the inflation rate while revenue rises more than a quarter. Investment is gradually - grudgingly - being liberalised, as are exchange controls. Individuals may now hold foreign currency deposit accounts in Zimbabwe banks, repatriating 'flight capital' on a no-questions-asked basis. In mid-year, Mr Chidzero opened a window to portfolio investment, guaranteeing free remittability of dividends and profits to foreign investors who buy shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. The main obstacle to foreign investment remains exchange control, which discriminates against the country's traditional - and loyal - investors, who were in Zimbabwe before independence in 1980. Trade is being liberalised, with exporters allowed to retain half their export earnings - and this will increase to 60 per cent at the end of the year - and a further 20 per cent of imports on open general licence. In July, too, important moves to liberalise agricultural marketing were announced, and a commodity exchange now operates out of Harare, trading in the main agricultural exports. But because there has been more pain than gain, so far as the man in the street is concerned, the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme is extremely unpopular. With elections scheduled by March 1995, some slippage in implementation seems more than probable. The politically-driven, and very popular, land designation programme - by which government can compulsorily acquire commercially-owned farmland for resettlement purposes - is incompatible with some of the government's more progressive policies designed to attract foreign investment. In the final analysis, Zimbabwe has a better chance than most of breaking the African mould and making a success of economic reform. Should it fail, it will have much to do with institutional and political shortcomings, and the over-indulgent attitude of some donors, specifically the World Bank.

Africa Opens First China  Fair""]    [Text] South Africa's first commodity fair in China opened  yesterday in Beijing, marking a further step by the growing  African nation into the mainland market.    More than 300 South African business representatives are  attending the four-day event.    ""The exhibition is a landmark of the strengthened relations  between the two countries,"" said David Graaff, South Africa's  deputy-minister of industry and trade.    Companies at the South Africa China Exhibition 1994 come  from  31 industries including South Africa's strongest sectors such as  mining equipment, electronics and jewellery.    Many South African big name companies such as Sasol, Iscor  Mining  Steel Production, Saflec Electronics and Nampak are  seeking shares in China's flourishing industrial and commercial  market.    Graaff said he believes the exhibition ""will make an  important contribution to bilateral trade relations by  stimulating more joint ventures, flow of investment and tourism.""    Since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1992,  sound  trade ties have been achieved, he said.    Since then, bilateral trade volume has risen more than 30  percent to reach $658 million last year.    If trade through Hong Kong is included, the figure surpasses  $1 billion.    ""China is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and  we  always take her as an important trading partner,"" said the  deputy-minister.    He added that South Africa will continue to enjoy ties with  China for years to come.    After years of isolation on the world market, South Africa  has become a strong economic power.    Fifty-five percent of the nation's gross national product  comes from international trade, 30 percent of which is generated  by exports.    China mainly imports minerals and exports light industry  products to the South African nation.    Besides being rich in mineral resources, South Africa also  produces construction equipment.     "

The loan will fall in  a range of billions of yen and its disbursement is expected  after an international aid panel designates South Africa as an  eligible recipient this summer, they said.    The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the  request of South Africa and will include construction of roads,  ports and power plants, the sources said.    Tokyo intends to include South Africa among nations eligible  for aid because it is moving toward democracy, they said.    Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on  education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and  agricultural development, they said.    In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has  not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the  country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been  given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development's development  assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990.    Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa  under its new government following the African National  Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.

""Shaka Zulu"" has been traveling  across America in syndication since 1986, amassing impressive ratings, and now  gets its first national airing this week on cable's TBS network. It runs in  five installments, today through Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.    Made at a cost of $24 million -- including $2.5 million from the  state-controlled South Africa Broadcasting Corp. -- the 10-hour miniseries is  lavishly mounted, but so ineptly executed that it's mainly for viewers who like  seeing barbaric, semi-nude blacks running around carving each other up as  civilized whites look on in horror.    ""Shaka Zulu"" is a muddy window.    Watching ""South Africa Now,"" however, is like seeing through a clear window for  the first time.    Always spotty, American television coverage of South Africa has dropped off  considerably since the Pretoria government declared a state of emergency and  increased media censorship in June, 1986. And even in the best of times, the  time limits imposed on network news stories are not conducive to in-depth  reporting.    ""South Africa Now,"" a nonprofit series that has had a single focus since its  inception in April, 1988, has more than filled the coverage gap, drawing from a  variety of sources, ranging from Afrovision to free-lancers in South Africa who  smuggle their material out of the country at great risk. Although a culture  segment is slipped into each half hour, the heaviest emphasis is hard news:    * Black youths turn their bare backs to the camera to display ugly wounds said  to come from police whippings.    * An investigation reveals ways South Africa is said to circumvent a global oil  embargo.    * A white leader in the rebellion against South Africa's continued control over  the South West Africa territory of Namibia speaks about threats and attempts on  his life. He was assassinated after taping the interview.    * A renegade American conservative is accused of violating U.S. law by  representing South Africa's extreme-right, rigidly pro-apartheid Conservative  Party in this country without registering as its agent.    * Anti-apartheid journalists appear in an excerpt from an Irish documentary  about hazards faced by the dissident press operating inside South Africa.    Produced by the independent production firm Globalvision in association with  the anti-apartheid Africa Fund, ""South Africa Now"" surely is anti-apartheid,  which is about as dishonorable as being anti-Nazi.    ""South Africa Now"" is anything but a shrill soap box, however, and the  reporting is usually fiercely sober and thorough.    Produced on a relatively spare budget of $26,000 a week -- which is  underwritten by mainstream foundations and individuals, including Bruce  Springsteen -- this is also not a gleaming, elegant program with wide anchor  desks and dazzling technology.    Because of its diversity of sources, moreover, the quality of production varies  greatly from story to story. So does the quality of the anchors, who range from  rough-edged quasi-amateurs (who are in the show's training program for young  journalists) to producer Carolyn Craven, a polished former anchor-reporter for  KQED in San Francisco and former White House correspondent for National Public  Radio.    What makes ""South Africa Now"" special is that there's nothing like it anywhere  else. No other program sheds so much light on the dark continent.    Mainstream media coverage of Southern Africa does not escape its close  scrutiny. A segment on Sunday questioned New York Times reporter Christopher  Wren's use of ""shadowy"" to describe the ""mass democratic alliance"" against  apartheid in South Africa.    ""South Africa Now"" failed to clarify the context in which Wren had applied  ""shadowy"" to organized apartheid opposition. What it did do was demonstrate the  power and potential hair-trigger combustibility of words used to characterize  political or human rights movements.    Without a doubt, ""shadowy"" does apply to ""Shaka Zulu,"" whose resurfacing on TBS  also occupied a portion of Sunday's ""South Africa Now.""    Los Angeles-based Harmony Gold is listed as the producing company for ""Shaka  Zulu."" Directed by white South African William C. Faure and featuring such  prominent English actors as Edward Fox and Christopher Lee, the miniseries  centers on the great warrior king of the powerful Zulu nation from 1816 until  his murder in 1828.    This is more of the black experience through white eyes. The bottom line here  is image: At a time when Pretoria's white-minority government continues to  argue that South Africa's overwhelming black majority is unfit for self rule,  ""Shaka Zulu"" arrives almost on cue, filling the screen with black tribesmen  motivated only by barbarism and black magic.    ""We think it's a fascinating depiction of a turbulent part of world history  that's rarely seen,"" Bob Levi, executive vice president of TBS, said from his  Atlanta office. Levi characterized the South Africa Broadcasting Corp.'s  financial involvement -- which was unpublicized by KCOP Channel 13 in Los  Angeles and other stations previously airing the miniseries -- as nothing more  than a routine ""pre-buy"" for South African broadcast rights. ""The key is that  they had no script approval,"" he said.    However, ""Shaka Zulu"" is labeled ""the greatest project yet undertaken by the  SABC,"" and crucial for the nation's ""image abroad"" in the public record of a  1984 South African parliamentary debate. And a sales ad for the miniseries in a  1985 London trade publication bore the SABC logo, address and telephone and fax  numbers.    The miniseries shows ""African resistance to English colonialism,"" Levi said.  ""It's relevant and it's good television.""    In its report Sunday on ""Shaka Zulu,"" ""South Africa Today"" replayed footage  from an earlier story it had done on the miniseries in which sharp criticism  was expressed by Mazisi Kunene, a black South African who teaches African  literature at UCLA and wrote the biography ""Emperor Shaka the Great.""    ""It's untenable that Shaka could strip naked and drink blood,"" Kunene said  about one scene in the production. The miniseries ""says Shaka has a brain,"" he  said, ""but a bad one.""

Faure and featuring such  prominent English actors as Edward Fox and Christopher Lee, the miniseries  centers on the great warrior king of the powerful Zulu nation from 1816 until  his murder in 1828.    This is more of the black experience through white eyes. The bottom line here  is image: At a time when Pretoria's white-minority government continues to  argue that South Africa's overwhelming black majority is unfit for self rule,  ""Shaka Zulu"" arrives almost on cue, filling the screen with black tribesmen  motivated only by barbarism and black magic.    ""We think it's a fascinating depiction of a turbulent part of world history  that's rarely seen,"" Bob Levi, executive vice president of TBS, said from his  Atlanta office. Levi characterized the South Africa Broadcasting Corp.'s  financial involvement -- which was unpublicized by KCOP Channel 13 in Los  Angeles and other stations previously airing the miniseries -- as nothing more  than a routine ""pre-buy"" for South African broadcast rights. ""The key is that  they had no script approval,"" he said.    However, ""Shaka Zulu"" is labeled ""the greatest project yet undertaken by the  SABC,"" and crucial for the nation's ""image abroad"" in the public record of a  1984 South African parliamentary debate. And a sales ad for the miniseries in a  1985 London trade publication bore the SABC logo, address and telephone and fax  numbers.    The miniseries shows ""African resistance to English colonialism,"" Levi said.  ""It's relevant and it's good television.""    In its report Sunday on ""Shaka Zulu,"" ""South Africa Today"" replayed footage  from an earlier story it had done on the miniseries in which sharp criticism  was expressed by Mazisi Kunene, a black South African who teaches African  literature at UCLA and wrote the biography ""Emperor Shaka the Great.""    ""It's untenable that Shaka could strip naked and drink blood,"" Kunene said  about one scene in the production. The miniseries ""says Shaka has a brain,"" he  said, ""but a bad one.""    Meanwhile, a very bad series lives on.      Photo, Anchoring PBS' low-budget but informative ""South Africa Now,"" above from  left: Carolyn Craven, Mweli Mzizi, Fana Kekana.

This is a historic day for which  the world has long awaited and I dare say the path has well been  laid to welcome South Africa back to United Nations. Mr.  Mandela, when he visited New York and I had the pleasure of  speaking with him on that occasion, made it quite clear that the  United Nations will represent a cardinal feature of South  Africa's foreign policy and I think we there at United Nations  are very ready to welcome your country to the organization once  more.    [Robinson] Now those are very kind words, Mr. Insanally, but  the point that I am trying to make is this: It is a question of  South Africa being obliged to formally readmit credentials. Is  that the position or not?    [Insanally] I dare say South Africa will have to formally  express its desire to return and as I said I am pretty sure that  that request will be very spontaneously entertained. The other  matters, all the residual matters of financial standing, the  question of contributions, clearly are -- as in the case of all  countries -- there's a question of a assessment of  contributions. I imagine that this is a matter that will have  to be discussed with the South African Government. There is a  scale of assessment and I imagine this will have to be through a  dialogue between the government of South Africa and the United  Nations Secretariat.    [Robinson] As I understand it, South Africa is about $100  million in arrears. So what is going to happen as far as that is  concerned?    [Insanally] As I said, the primary criterion I imagine the  United Nations will use is to open its doors to South Africa, an  important member of the United Nations family. I do not believe  that the question of arrears will be a stumbling block to its  reentry into the organization. Clearly....    [Robinson, interrupting] But will South Africa have to pay  that amount?    [Insanally] I really can't say. I really would be  very...[pauses] I would be hazarding an answer there. It would  be for the committee on contributions to study the case. Let me  say that, you know, the United Nations is composed of a number  of bodies and South Africa has in fact not been entirely  excluded from participation in some of the agencies, so one has  to look at it in fine [as heard], and it would be very  presumptuous of me to give you a sort of blanket answer. As I  said, many countries are in arrears. I am sure that some  arrangement can be worked out which would facilitate South  Africa's entry as soon as it expresses a desire to return to the  international family.    [Robinson] The United Nations arms embargo against South  Africa is still in place. Are you going to take the initiative  to remove that?    [Insanally] That is a matter for the Security Council, and  again I do not wish to sort of tread on their prerogative. I  would think that in so far as it does not affect the general  purposes of the United Nations, such an embargo will be reviewed  with some...[pauses] with a new eye and in an attempt to respect  the sovereignty of South Africa. I am sure the Security Council  will take the necessary measures in that regard.    [Robinson] One of the bodies of the United Nations is the  Special Committee Against Apartheid. One might expect that the  duties of that particular committee will now lapse.    [Insanally] Oh yes, that I can say positively. I was,  myself, a vice president of the council for Namibia and that was  one body which I was very glad to see pass out of existence,  although it's left me without a particular job. The same will  occur for the Special Committee -- apartheid -- and as I said  we'll be very happy to see the end of it. It will take a little  time to dismantle, to redeploy, but that certainly will go now  that South Africa is now with us, fully, in the United Nations  family.    [Robinson] If South Africa reenters the United Nations, do  you see any specific or special role for South Africa in that  body?    [Insanally] Indeed I do. I see it as a sort of a two-way  street. I see, first of all, South Africa playing a very key  role in United Nations affairs, in all its aspects. South  Africa, indeed, is an important nation, not only within Africa,  and indeed I must say that we look upon South Africa as the  dynamo for development in the region, in all of Africa, and in  the political sense what South Africa has been able to  accomplish through excellent leadership, excellent vision for  the future, and the process of dialogue and reconciliation --  that can be a model for other countries in the region. At the  same time the United Nations, as I am sure the secretary general  may have mentioned to the president of South Africa, I think we  can look to South Africa also to making a contribution to  international affairs, in the areas of peace keeping, peace  making, technical cooperation. You are indeed, in this part of  the world, a very advanced country and, therefore, can play a  very preeminent role in the furtherance of peace and development  in the continent.     "

South Africa almost certainly conducted an atmospheric test of a low-yield  nuclear bomb off its coast in 1979, the documents state. Pretoria has never  acknowledged possession of nuclear weapons and the U.S. government has never  publicly stated that it believes South Africa is capable of producing them.    While most of the world has assumed that South Africa carried out the Sept. 22,  1979, test, which was detected by U.S. intelligence satellites, Pretoria has  clung to its ""longstanding practice of cloaking its nuclear intentions in  ambiguity,"" the CIA said.    The CIA report also said that Israel cooperated closely with South Africa in  the 1970s on nuclear weapons programs and provided ""various sorts of advanced  non-nuclear weapons technology to South Africa.""    Officials of the South African Embassy in Washington did not return telephone  calls seeking comment on the disclosures.    A spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy here said that Jerusalem repeatedly has  denied any cooperation in nuclear weapons matters with South Africa.    In March, 1987, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced it was suspending all  new weapons development contracts with South Africa, and the Israeli government  has strictly adhered to that decree, she said.    The CIA report, which was prepared in December, 1979, was released in heavily  edited form in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the  Natural Resources Defense Council.    ""This marks the first time that the U.S. government has confirmed that South  Africa has had a dedicated nuclear weapons program and the U.S. government knew  about it,"" Richard Fieldhouse, a senior researcher with the environmental  group, said Wednesday.    Fieldhouse added that the disclosures call into question South Africa's stated  intention to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying that it would be  ""an empty and cynical gesture because South Africa would maintain the ability  to produce nuclear weapons quickly.""    He said South Africa continues to seek nuclear weapons technology from a  variety of sources, despite international efforts to halt exports of sensitive  technology to the racially polarized nation.    Fieldhouse noted that the U.S. Customs Service last week raided a Boynton  Beach, Fla., firm for allegedly selling guidance components for nuclear-capable  ballistic missiles to South Africa.    The CIA report, entitled ""The 22 September 1979 Event,"" gives previously  classified details of the blast off the coast of southern Africa and explores  the question of who was responsible.    The explosion was assumed to be a nuclear blast with a yield of less than three  kilotons, about a quarter the size of the Hiroshima bomb and equivalent to the  yield of a nuclear-tipped artillery shell. The test was carried out in darkness  and under heavy cloud cover.    The report indicates that South Africa was the only likely source of the test,  noting that South Africa had an active nuclear weapons development program and  sufficient supplies of highly enriched uranium to build several small bombs.    The agency said that the South African government earlier suspended nuclear  tests planned for two years because ""strong U.S. pressure and other  international reactions appeared to have deflected South Africa at least  temporarily from testing.""    The 1979 explosion was carried out in secrecy over remote waters off South  Africa's southern coast after the nation's authorities declared the harbor and  the naval base at Simonstown to be off-limits to the public.

The multi-million dollar  programme focusses on a South African industrial trade expo in  New York City from September 20 to 23 where about 150 South  African firms are expected to show their goods and services.  ""South Africa and the USA: Strengthening the Link"", the expo is  being staged by the Department of Trade and Industry and the  South African Foreign Trade Organization (SAFTO).    Addressing a news conference in Washington, Mr Manuel said  the idea was to reintroduce South Africa--not as an emerging  market but as a emerging market with a highly sophisticated  physical and financial infrastructure. He said President  Mandela had set out a vision of South Africa's future based on  compromise, peace and stability. Now the ""battle royal"" was on  to give hard-won democracy some content. ""Now we have to ensure  that markets in South Africa are sharpened so that we can create  jobs and improve on our manufacturing, that we can move up the  value chain from our rich mineral endowment and re-position  South Africa in the global economy.""    Mr Manuel said South Africa's return to the Commonwealth,  while unlikely to make a significant difference in the narrow  sense of trade and economic terms, was part of the approach that  South Africa was back in the family.    Referring to government's Reconstruction and Development  Programme, he said South Africa had an enormous capacity to  build a consensus society in the context of partnership and  cooperation. This was the case between not only government and  business but also South Africa and its major trading partners.    A series of initiatives being worked about between the  United  States and South Africa would be announced in a few weeks, he  disclosed.    Mr Manuel said the development of southern Africa regional  trade and stability was an important element in South Africa's  drive into world markets. It was important for South Africa to  stimulate economic development across the region with its  100-million inhabitants. ""Any notion that you build an island  of prosperity in a sea ravaged by war is clearly a non-starter,""  he said.    South African Ambassador Harry Schwarz told the news  conference that trade was like a tango -- and it took two to  tango. With respect to the US and South Africa, one tango  dancer was a powerful economy and the other was a fast-improving  existing market. South Africans of all races were a proud  people, Schwarz said. ""We are not standing with a begging  bowl....We stand as a proud people wanting to build an economy  and saying that we have tremendous resources and the capacity to  become a major world power.""

Attorney Mary Kelly's question came during cross-examination of Laurence Victor  Harrison, a government-paid witness who had extensive dealings with both  Mexican law enforcement and drug traffickers. Harrison said there was a close  working relationship between the drug lords and prominent Mexican police  officials.    Harrison's testimony came during the fourth week of trial for four men who are  accused of involvement in the February, 1985, murder of Camarena, a U.S. Drug  Enforcement Administration agent.    The possible CIA link came after Kelly attempted to probe Harrison further.    At one point, Harrison testified that he had told drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca  Carrillo, for whom he had installed a sophisticated radio system, that law  enforcement might go after him (Fonseca).    ""He told me I was crazy,"" Harrison recalled. ""He told me there was no danger.""    Then the witness was asked, ""Did Fonseca say it (his feeling of safety) was a  political thing?"" Harrison replied, ""Yes.""    Kelly moved closer to the possible CIA link when she questioned Harrison about  Sergio Espino Verdin, a commander in Mexico's federal security directorate  (DFS), an internal security and investigative agency with close ties to the  PRI, Mexico's dominant political party. Harrison said he worked for Espino, a  close ally of Fonseca, who is currently in prison in Mexico after a conviction  for his involvement in Camarena's murder.    Harrison told the jury that Espino reported to Miguel Nazar Haro, who was DFS  director from 1977 to 1982, when he was forced to resign after it was revealed  that he was involved in a cross-border car smuggling ring.    The Nazar case was controversial in the United States and Mexico. William  Kennedy, then-U.S. attorney in San Diego, pressed the Justice Department in  Washington to indict Nazar, despite protests from U.S. officials in Mexico that  Nazar was ""an essential repeat essential contact for CIA station Mexico City.""    Kennedy was fired, but ultimately Nazar was indicted by a federal grand jury in  San Diego and is still considered a fugitive in the United States.    Harrison called Nazar his ""overboss"" and said Nazar was involved in drug  trafficking.    On Thursday, Kelly asked Harrison if Nazar was connected to the CIA. Prosecutor  Manuel Medrano objected on the grounds that the question was irrelevant to the  case. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie sustained the objection.    Later, however, outside the presence of the jury, Kelly told the judge why she  thought questions about the CIA were relevant to the Camarena case.    ""Fonseca thought his actions were condoned by the Mexican government, as well  as sanctioned by the CIA,"" she said. ""This goes to the issue of whether this  was an illegal enterprise"" and could help her client in her defense.    Among the charges against the four defendants who are on trial here are violent  crimes in aid of a racketeering enterprise.    Kelly said she wanted to reserve the right to call Harrison back for more  cross-examination. Rafeedie told her to submit a brief but no timetable was  set.    The defense lawyer said she was prompted to ask some of these questions because  of an interview that Harrison gave to DEA agents last September, a copy of  which was recently provided to the defense. In the interview, Harrison said  that Fonseca and another drug kingpin, Javier Barba Hernandez, talked to Cubans  in 1983 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Guadalajara about drug trafficking.    ""They told me about it,"" Harrison told the DEA. ""Barba also told me that they  could do whatever they wanted with the Americans or the Cubans. I took that to  mean they could do deals with the Americans or the Cubans.""    Harrison also told the DEA that Fonseca met with an American involved in drug  smuggling who said he was ""working with the Contras,"" a reference to  U.S.-financed rebel troops in Nicaragua. He said this man, who was unnamed and  told him he had been a mercenary in South Africa and also worked in El  Salvador, asked him a lot of questions about airstrips.    ""I told him if he got close to the border that he'd have trouble with U.S.  radar,"" Harrison told the DEA. ""He said he was the U.S., that he didn't have  any problem. He could do anything that they wanted.""    In another development Thursday, Rafeedie ruled that prosecutors could play  tapes of narcotics traffickers interrogating Camarena shortly before they  murdered him. Prosecutor Medrano indicated that the government would start  playing the Spanish tapes, accompanied by English translations displayed on a  screen, today.    Times staff writer John H.

Kennedy was fired, but ultimately Nazar was indicted by a federal grand jury in  San Diego and is still considered a fugitive in the United States.    Harrison called Nazar his ""overboss"" and said Nazar was involved in drug  trafficking.    On Thursday, Kelly asked Harrison if Nazar was connected to the CIA. Prosecutor  Manuel Medrano objected on the grounds that the question was irrelevant to the  case. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie sustained the objection.    Later, however, outside the presence of the jury, Kelly told the judge why she  thought questions about the CIA were relevant to the Camarena case.    ""Fonseca thought his actions were condoned by the Mexican government, as well  as sanctioned by the CIA,"" she said. ""This goes to the issue of whether this  was an illegal enterprise"" and could help her client in her defense.    Among the charges against the four defendants who are on trial here are violent  crimes in aid of a racketeering enterprise.    Kelly said she wanted to reserve the right to call Harrison back for more  cross-examination. Rafeedie told her to submit a brief but no timetable was  set.    The defense lawyer said she was prompted to ask some of these questions because  of an interview that Harrison gave to DEA agents last September, a copy of  which was recently provided to the defense. In the interview, Harrison said  that Fonseca and another drug kingpin, Javier Barba Hernandez, talked to Cubans  in 1983 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Guadalajara about drug trafficking.    ""They told me about it,"" Harrison told the DEA. ""Barba also told me that they  could do whatever they wanted with the Americans or the Cubans. I took that to  mean they could do deals with the Americans or the Cubans.""    Harrison also told the DEA that Fonseca met with an American involved in drug  smuggling who said he was ""working with the Contras,"" a reference to  U.S.-financed rebel troops in Nicaragua. He said this man, who was unnamed and  told him he had been a mercenary in South Africa and also worked in El  Salvador, asked him a lot of questions about airstrips.    ""I told him if he got close to the border that he'd have trouble with U.S.  radar,"" Harrison told the DEA. ""He said he was the U.S., that he didn't have  any problem. He could do anything that they wanted.""    In another development Thursday, Rafeedie ruled that prosecutors could play  tapes of narcotics traffickers interrogating Camarena shortly before they  murdered him. Prosecutor Medrano indicated that the government would start  playing the Spanish tapes, accompanied by English translations displayed on a  screen, today.    Times staff writer John H.

The results of the  first multiracial general election in South Africa showed that  the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa led by  Mandela will win a majority of the vote. In South Africa, a  ANC-led national unity government will be formed. The result of  the general election showed that the last apartheid system,  which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to  an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born.  The vast number of black people being oppressed under the  racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they,  together with white people, have become masters of the country.  The success of the first multiracial general election in South  Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of  the South African people and the African people as a whole, but  was also an event of great historical significance in, and with  far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in  this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just  struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice  at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We  extend warm congratulations to them.    In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people  of  South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In  particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black  people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting  struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to  fight for South African black people's equal political and  economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into  dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no  longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace  talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The  multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were  attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties,  underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many  obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest  conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the  white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts.  However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of  most political parties cherished the spirit of racial  reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make  joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and  eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process  of peace and democracy in South Africa.    Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also  inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other  African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance  and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern  Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations,  other international organizations, and the international  community as a whole have also made positive contributions to  supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because  the struggle of the South African people won extensive support  and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving  people inside and outside the country, the situation in South  Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's  progress.    The success of the first whole-people-involved election in  South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African  people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists  among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of  the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and  carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations  of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be  hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule  and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people  believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves  from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be  able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the  course of racial reconciliation and national peace and  stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace,  and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.     "

[Ebok] For 21 years of its existence, we as the OAU have  confronted the problems in South Africa. At the first meeting  of the OAU, one of the first decisions which was taken was that  on decolonization and which led to the establishment of the  Liberation Committee at the OAU. That committee has more or  less attained its mandate having contributed to the  decolonization process, and also in a very significant way to  the ending of apartheid. That committee is winding up, so it  means a lot to us who had been attached to it with a sense of  nostalgia. It's like one era has ended. Now we would look  forward to a period, you know, in which we can pursue economic  emancipation with the same vigor that we have pursued the  political liberation.    [Xhobule] Let's talk about current conflicts on the  continent. With regard to conflicts happening in various parts  of the continent at the moment, what role would you see South  Africa playing?    [Ebok] One of the things which has impressed people all over  the world, not just in Africa, is the way South Africans  resolved their problems through negotiations. It has opened the  doors to that possibility that every conflict could be resolved  through negotiations, because I mean, if you look at it, when we  came here about two years ago we never thought that the  elections would come off so peacefully. A few months back we  never thought that we would have such a peaceful election. So  one of the things which South Africa had experienced, which  South Africa would bring to the organization, are its experience  in conflict resolutions.    [Xhobule] In practical terms, what would this entail both  for  the OAU and for South Africa?    [Ebok] Well, for the OAU it means that our membership has  been enriched. South Africa comes to the organization with some  leadership role. South Africa is a very advanced country  technologically and even politically. And so those experiences  are the experiences which we'll learn, which our organization,  as we move into the 21st century....[pauses] For South Africa,  I believe that for once it has stopped being the (?burial) state  -- we will stop talking about South Africa in very negative  terms at meetings of the OAU, and South Africa will be in a  position to benefit from some of the experiences -- positive  experiences -- which the rest of the continent has. It would be  able to interact with the rest of the continent because South  Africa will first be an African country before it becomes a  member of any other international community. So for South  Africa, it is back in the fold as a member of the family. It  can reach out to the whole world from Africa as a legitimate  entity, and that is the benefit for both of us.     "

With respect to the African economic integration, an  encouraging sign is that the number of the countries has  increased to 34 that have ratified the treaty on the  establishment of the African Economic Community, which was  signed by the African leaders in Abuja, new capital of Nigeria,  in June 1991. With the ratification by one more country, the  treaty will come into force.    Besides, progress has also been made in regional economic  integration in 1993 in the western, eastern and southern parts  of the continent. Treaties on the establishment of regional  common markets have been signed to facilitate the inter-regional  trade and economic development.    In order to promote the intra-Africa trade, the African  Development Bank (ADB) took the initiative in establishing the  ""African Export-Import Bank"" in Cairo, while the U.N.  secretary-general has proposed the establishment of a commodity  diversification fund for Africa.    Those efforts have obviously demonstrated the eagerness and  determination of Africans to overcome the economic crisis and  step up the economic development on the continent.    As regards the economic situation of Africa in 1993, many  countries have appeared to set on course to harvest the benefits  of peace. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  estimated that the economic growth in Ethiopia might reach 9.3  percent, 5.3 percent in Mozambique and 7.1 percent in Uganda due  to the relative peace and stability in the countries.    However, the economic situation in Africa as a whole was  still marked by a meagre growth in 1993. According to an ECA  preliminary estimation, African economy grew by only 1.4 percent  in the year, representing an improvement over the 0.7 percent  growth of 1992. This is barely half of the regional population  growth rate.    Analysts pointed out, in addition to the deep-seated  problems  including lack of domestic resources, poor infrastructure and  domestic political deficiencies, there are three major factors  that are hindering the African economic growth.    First of all, it is the continuing civil conflicts and  political crises in several countries that restrained the  economic growth. For example, the economic growth in Zaire is  estimated to have dropped by 4 percent in 1993 following a more  severe decline of 12 percent in the previous year because of the  political unrest resulting from disputes over democratization  process in the country. Nigeria's economy may have only grown by  about 3.7 percent in 1993, far below the annual average of 6.2  percent in the 1988-1992 period due to political upheaval.    The natural disasters, especially the drought that struck  eastern and southern Africa in the year, are another factor that  has suppressed the economic growth. Due to the worst drought,  Zimbabwe's economy is estimated to grow by 1.4 percent in 1993  as compared with the 8.5 percent growth in 1992. Parts of  Ethiopia and Eritrea have also experienced crop failures because  of the drought.    The third factor is the unfavorable international economic  environment. The weak growth in major industrial countries led  to a sluggish demand for main African products. And the weak  demand in turn led to the continuing fall in prices of fuel and  non-fuel commodities. As result, Africa's export earnings are  estimated to have shrunk by about 2.7 percent to 72 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, following a drop of 1.1 percent in 1992.    Besides, external debt has further deteriorated in 1993.  According to the ECA, the share of multi-lateral debt of Africa  in aggregated debt stock has risen to 24.2 percent in 1993  compared to 20.5 percent in 1992 and 19.5 percent in 1991. This  shows that Africa's external debt will be above 275.15 billion  U.S. dollars in 1993.    Meanwhile, external resources flowing to Africa are  declining. According to the latest estimation of the World Bank,  sub-Saharan Africa's share of total official development  assistance of the bank has fallen from 37.1 percent in 1990 to  36.3 percent in 1992. Net lending commitments by the World Bank  to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 percent or 1.2 billion  U.S. dollars in its last financial year. Non-project lending to  sub-Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to 455 million U.S.  dollars from 895 million U.S. dollars the previous year.    IMF also reported a downturn in lending to Africa in its  latest financial year. The disbursements totalled some 525  million U.S. dollars in the year ending April 30, 1993 compared  with some one billion U.S. dollars for the previous year, a fall  of nearly 50 percent.    All those factors have added more difficulties to the lack  of  resources of African countries that need capital to develop  their economies.    With respect to the prospects for African economy in the new  year, it does not allow much optimism because all the factors  that have hindered the African economic performance in 1993 will  remain a constraint to the growth. Besides, with the loss of  some preferences conceded to Africa after the GATT Uruguay Round  agreement was signed and with the reduction of aid and resources  flowing to Africa from World Bank and other international  institutes, Africa will face more crises. In face of the  challenge, Africans have uttered stronger voice for  self-reliance and intra- Africa cooperation in developing the  continent's economy.     "

They also stress that the  success of this peace process depends on commitment to the basic  principles stipulated in the Madrid conference that unleashed  the peace negotiations between Israel and the Arab parties  directly concerned with the Arab-Israeli conflict.    If we review what the peace process has thus far achieved,  we  will simply find that it continues to face one major obstacle,  represented by the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories. Such a withdrawal is a basic principle.  Peace cannot be achieved or entrenched without implementing  this principle in accordance with the resolutions of  international legitimacy, particularly Resolutions 242 and 338.  Moreover, without a full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal  from all occupied Arab territories, any talk about peace will  continue to move in a vicious circle, so any achievement on the  path of peace will merely be like building peace on sand.    The repeated visits to the region by the U.S. secretary of  state and the Russian envoys, as well as the continued  consultations held bilaterally and collectively as part of the  bilateral and multilateral negotiations, have thus far failed to  effect a clear Israeli commitment to full withdrawal from the  occupied territories. The issue of withdrawal is still part of  the Israeli maneuvers designed to fragment the Arab side, set  timetables, propose phased solutions, and give only in  installments. This will deprive the land-for-peace principle of  both the meaning and legitimacy according to which the peace  process was launched in the first place. The issue of full  withdrawal in exchange for full peace is an essential link in  any comprehensive solution that will securely resolve all issues  pertaining to both the Palestine question and the overall  conflict in the Middle East. However, this fact, which is  ignored by the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors, has failed to spare  the peace efforts of the Israeli attempts designed to conclude  partial and separate deals.    The emphasis by the U.S. and Russian governments on their  good intentions, as well as the Arab parties' commitment to both  the peace process and its principles, are not sufficient to  force Israel into committing itself to the bases and principles  of peace as long as such statements are nothing more than  utterances of mere diplomacy. Political moves, whether U.S. or  Russian, should be serious in order to promote the peace process  in the right direction. These moves should be joined by the  Israeli side, which rejects the concept of full withdrawal in  exchange for comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict.  Otherwise, the visits, moves, and tours will continue to  revolve in a vicious circle of action and reaction, and they  will never succeed in pushing the peace process forward.     "

Bulger]    [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- An African National  Congress [ANC] government would downplay South Africa's role as  a regional power in southern Africa, ANC foreign affairs  director Thabo Mbeki said on Friday. Mr Mbeki was presenting a  discussion paper, Foreign Policy in a Democratic South Africa,  to members of the media and diplomatic corps at the World Trade  Centre in Kempton Park.    The document outlines South Africa's likely international  orientation after the April elections. Rather than projecting  itself as a regional power, South Africa would emphasise  co-operation as defined in agreements with fellow southern  African nations. It would attempt to address the marginalisation  of the African continent in the world economy and would join the  Organisation of African Unity.    ""Closer regional co-operation and economic integration after  apartheid will benefit the entire region,"" the document says. ""A  democratic South Africa should explicitly renounce all hegemonic  ambitions in the region. It should resist all pressures to  become the regional power at the expense of the rest of the  sub-continent. Instead it should seek to become part of a  movement to create a new form of economic interaction in  southern Africa based on principles of mutual benefit and  interdependence.""    South Africa would contribute to conflict resolution  mechanisms and peacekeeping in Africa. South Africa would also  take part in discussions about the United Nations and would  support efforts to ""democratise"" that body by giving  traditionally less powerful nations more scope and influence.    The foreign policy document stresses South Africa's role in  promoting human rights around the world. South Africa would  actively involve itself in international forums in pursuit of  this goal.    An ANC government would foster links with the Islamic  community of the Middle East and follow international law and  practice in its relations with Asian countries.

During his stay in the United States, Rao met chief  executives of major corporations and had talks with them about  Indian economic reforms and mutual economic cooperation, seeking  to convince everyone that the change in India was irreversible.    Despite the fact that Rao and U.S. President Bill Clinton's  summit involved some political differences, they did not allow  them to shadow their intention to strengthen economic ties.    Clinton recently has called for a pragmatic approach towards  the strain in Indo-U.S. relations over the situation in Kashmir  and human right standards in India. He said that political  differences ought not to color the gamut of Indo-U.S. ties.    He said India's on-going economic reforms offered exciting  possibilities for ""our bilateral trade and economic relations.""    For the U.S. companies, a major attraction in India is its  large untapped market of 200 middle-class consumers and a  growing industrial sector with an insatiable appetite for modern  technology and infrastructure.    In the short span of two years, multinational giants like  General Motors, IBM, and Coca Cola have already invested over  800 million U.S. dollars in India.    Since 1991 when Rao came to power and pursued an economic  reform policy, Indo-U.S. economic ties had made a great leap  forward despite their differences on Kashmir, human rights,  nuclear non- proliferation, etc. The U.S. exports to India had  risen from 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 2.4 billion in  1993, a 38 percent increase over the same period in 1992.  India's exports to the U.S. had increased from 3.8 billion in  1992 to 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.    And the U.S. investment also made big progress in the past  few years with an increase of more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars  in 1993 from less than 20 million U.S. dollars in 1990. Nearly  half of all investment approvals by the Indian Government last  year were from the U.S. companies while the value of the U.S.  investment last year exceeded the total of all previous years'  since India's independence in 1947.    After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the  end of Cold War, India shifted its foreign policy from  dependence on the Soviet Union to dimensional one. Rao's  economic reform in 1991 had made India to stress economic  diplomacy which focused on the Western countries, especially the  United States.    As India needs American investment and modern technology,  Rao  has time and again said that political differences should not  prevent India and the U.S. from developing friendly relations.    When all is said and done, both India and the U.S. are  optimistic about their future economic relations and agreed to  continue dialogue over their differences.     "
0,FT941-10895 ,"FT941-10895 _AN-EBGC7AFIFT 940207   FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (32): Figuring out the differences - Accounting and reporting      By ANDREW JACK   Of all the countries in all the world, very few offer investors a consistent or comparable set of accounting standards to help them interpret financial performance. The pitfalls in attempting to interpret different sets of accounts and negotiating through the widely varying tax structures pose considerable challenges. Many emerging markets have less formalised accounting standards, varying degrees of disclosure and different underlying philosophies which affect the figures. A number of commentators divide the world between tax-driven accounts and accounts more geared to investors. The former may often have the incentive to keep published profits low, the latter to boost them. For countries in the former category, the published accounts are those that are submitted to the revenue authorities. Countries often have relatively hidebound, fixed formats governed by legislation or 'charts of accounts'. The latter category includes the UK and the US, where tax returns are separate - and even contradictory - and accounts are geared primarily towards investors. Mr John Tetley, a member of the consultative group of the International Accounting Standards Committee (Iasc), who has particular knowledge of French and Portuguese-speaking Africa and South America, says the differences between countries can 'cause quite a lot of trouble'. 'If you are thinking of investing in family-owned local businesses, you have very little idea what the accounts mean,' he says. 'They report what they want to.' He argues that many have relatively few accountants or bookkeepers, let alone consistent standards which they can apply. Policies vary on the revaluation of assets, on depreciation and the treatment of foreign currency. In particular, he highlights the role of indexation in high inflation countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, which can make comparisons confusing. 'You are never quite sure what you are looking at,' he says. A survey conducted last year by the Centre for International Financial Reporting and Analysis (Cifar)* pointed out a number of difficulties in interpreting international financial statements. The information on companies in emerging markets is limited and often filed long after the year-end. Many subsidiaries conduct transactions with parent companies, adding to the awkwardness of extracting relevant, timely data. English translations of annual reports and other financial information are often unavailable or unreliable. Converting figures expressed in local currencies may prove problematic. Varying year-ends makes comparison difficult and auditing standards vary. That is before accounting standards. Cifar cites eight particular issues treated in vastly divergent ways across the globe: depreciation, inventory methods, deferred taxes, consolidation principles, discretionary reserves, inflation adjustments, foreign currency translation, and the valuation of fixed income and equity securities. Some see signs of optimism for the future from the work of the Iasc, which has been attempting over many years to establish a set of standards transcending national differences. Some countries have adopted Iasc standards wholesale, or developed their own versions based on the same international approach. For example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year issued new rules requiring foreign incorporated companies to present reports in line with Iasc standards. They have been incorporated into requirements in Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Malaysia, Kenya and India. The Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting have used Iasc standards. However, Iasc standards have been criticised for the political compromises necessary to build consensus between different countries' standards. The result has been a wide range of alternative treatments which did little to improve ease of interpretation for readers of accounts. That has now begun to change significantly, with the organisation's 'comparability/improvements' project designed to bring about greater harmonisation. The motivation has been partly to gain recognition for Iasc standards from the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), which would allow far wider recognition of the standards in different national stock exchanges. The strategy has begun to pay off, with Iosco now endorsing the Iasc cash flow statement standard, for example. But more wholesale ratification is likely to be a long way off. To add to the confusion, some of the national accounting standards setters are also beginning to become more interested in international collaboration, in a way that may threaten the Iasc's traditional role. Standards setters from the UK, US, Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere have in the past two years begun discussing sharing the workload for research and standards drafting on a number of topics. There are still wider concerns that Iasc and other national standards were devised in the developed world and may be far less appropriate without substantial modification in many of the emerging markets regions. Meanwhile, investors need to bear in mind tax issues within emerging markets. Mr Peter Dickinson, international tax partner with Coopers  Lybrand in London, says one of the key tax questions in emerging markets is 'how to get one's money out'. 'You need to understand the exchange control regulations,' he says. 'A lot of countries have very tight controls, such as South Africa and India.' In addition, he says there may be specific stipulations on how money is held through the banks. Within countries, there are often federal, regional, state or city taxes to be considered. Then there is the small print in the double taxation treaties agreed between the investor's country and the country for investment, which may impinge on returns. 'There is a much higher degree of risk in emerging markets,' says Mr Dickinson. 'Investors should think long and hard at their potential after-tax returns.' He says the most important factor for investors tends to be withholding taxes on dividends paid outside the country. In addition, the position is far from static. 'The rules keep changing,' he says. 'In some countries like China the rules on how much tax to pay move from one month to the next.' * International accounting and auditing trends. 3rd edition, 1993.

The Zimbabwean capital today played host to the meeting  of the Global Coalition for Africa and will tomorrow be the  venue for the meeting of the Frontline states. The body was  founded as a front of neighboring countries against South  Africa. Now that South Africa has shed its apartheid burden,  and is back with a vengeance in the international community and  the brotherhood of African countries, the organization has lost  the very reason for its existence.    However, it's believed that Zimbabwe is keen to see the  establishment of a new organization to replace the Frontline  states. But other parties feel that such a body would have  little value as most of the issues affecting southern African  countries could be dealt with by the Southern African  Development Community, SADC. Zimbabwean newspapers report that  the name Frontline States is expected to be dropped in  preference for something that sounds less confrontational.  Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, the future of  southern Africa will hopefully never be as divided as its past.    In recent years the world has increasingly turned its back  on  Africa. Any organization which unites South Africa with the  rest of the sub-continent in the interest of regional peace,  stability and economic growth, might just provide the impetus to  prove that this region can survive, and indeed prosper.

The injection was the biggest in Hong Kong's  history.    The overnight inter-bank market rate was pushed up to 4.5  percent because of the excessive demand for funds, causing the  Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to pump $2.676 billion into  the banking system at about 3.30 pm. The move softened the  overnight rate to 3.5 per cent at yesterday's close. The  banking sector ended up placing $225 million in surplus funds  with the HKMA when the market closed.    The stock market fared no better. The Hang Seng Index dived  233.52 points to close at 8,647.48, on the back of world market  crashes last Friday. Aggravating the situation was the weak  U.S. dollar, which has brokers fearing the U.S. Federal Reserve  might raise interest rates as a last-ditch attempt to shore up  the currency.    It was the third time in less than a week that the Monetary  Authority had moved to inject liquidity into the market, after  the overnight lending rate repeatedly touched the 4.5 per cent  offer rate of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) -- the  discount window facility run by the authority. The LAF offer  rate was kept at the same level as the Fed's discount rate so as  to maintain the stability of the territory's pegged exchange  rate system.    The HKMA injected $1.36 billion into the market last Friday  and $1.57 billion last Wednesday.    Although the exchange rate remained stable, hovering at  about  $7.728-$7.729 to the US dollar, the injections are considered  preemptive strikes to prevent the rising interbank market rates  from affecting the stability of the peg. ""If the interbank  market rates are higher than in the U.S., then money will start  coming in,"" said HKMA chief executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong.    The Hong Kong dollar bond market mirrored the fall in the  U.S., with the two-year government bond price dropping 37 basis  points and the three-year bond shedding 44 basis points. One  dealer said: ""The yield spread between the three-year Hong Kong  dollar bond and three-year U.S. dollar bond, which usually  ranges between 30 and 50 basis points, has widened to a  historical level of 75 basis points."" He attributed bearish  sentiment in the bond market to the upward pressure on U.S.  interest rates. ""One famous economist in the US even predicted  that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond would climb to 10  percent by the end of the year,"" he said.    However, Mr Yam said the tight interbank market condition  was  only temporary, caused by expectations on U.S. interest rates  and banks' need to shore up funds in preparation for mid-year  accounting. ""Banks that expect U.S. interest rates to go up  will borrow more in advance and sit on it,"" he said.     "

From  the point of view of the Israeli defense industry, these are two  countries that stopped being excellent customers after going  through changes of regime.    The tremendous arms purchases that Iran made under the shah  were cut off when Khomeyni took power. South Africa is in a  transitional period now, leading to transfering power to the  black majority, and from being an important customer of the  Israeli defense industry, it is turning into a serious rival. In  this race, it is making wide use of Israeli advanced technology.    Over the years, foreign sources published many reports about  the close ties that had been woven between the defense  establishments in Israel and South Africa. Israel--so it was  reported--helped South Africa to build an arms industry that  produces everything from light weapons to warplanes and missile  boats.    Not long ago, the president of South Africa announced that  his country had also produced six atomic bombs. Foreign sources  claimed that these weapons, too, were produced with active help  from Israel, and that in return South Africa had allowed the  Israelis to test their nuclear weapons within its boundaries.  THE WASHINGTON POST also claimed that the South African  authorities sent enriched uranium (which is used to produce  nuclear weapons) to Israel, so that it will not fall into the  hands of the blacks when they take power in April 1994.    But from a partner and an ally, South Africa has turned into  a serious commercial rival. Today, at almost every international  arms fair, it shows off the products of its defense industry. It  does not even try to blur the source.    Its Cheetah jet is a perfect copy of the Israeli Kfir; the  sea-to-sea missile it produces is the twin brother of the  Israeli Gabriel; the assault rifle its soldiers carry is another  version of the Israeli Galil; and even skilled professionals  have trouble distinguishing between the Israeli pilotless plane,  Pioneer, and the South African pilotless plane, Siker; or  between the Israeli pilotless bomber, Harpy, which sails toward  its target and blows it up, and the South African pilotless  bomber, Lark. Air-to-air missiles of the Kukri type,  manufactured in South Africa, are amazingly similar to the  Israeli Phaeton missiles. And this is just a partial list.    Even the advertising the South Africans do for their weapons  systems is Israeli in character. At the weapons fair that was  held at the beginning of November in the Emirate of Dubai, there  was an unusually large number of exhibitors from South Africa.  The leaders of the South African arms industry explained to  reporters covering the fair that the international embargo,  which had been imposed on their country, and was in force until  not long ago, forced them to develop many systems on their own.  This kind of advertising has been characteristic until now of  the sales representatives of the Israeli defense industry.    For many years, South Africa was not been able to sell the  weapons its defense industry produced, because of the  international embargo imposed on it in protest against its  apartheid laws. Now, with both apartheid and the embargo lifted,  markets have opened up for South Africa all over the world.    Sources in the Israel defense establishment say that the  South Africans operating an aggressive marketing system in many  countries around the world, and it seems that they are ready to  sell ""at any price""--mainly to establish their position as a  country producing advanced systems.    Looking back, was it a mistake to cooperate so broadly with  the South African arms industry? Opinions are divided on this.  There are those who argue that South Africa was a good customer,  and Israel also profited well from cooperation with it.  According to foreign sources, over the years South Africa  acquired weapons systems and know-how from Israel that were  worth more than 5 billion dollars. Others argue that we should  have taken into account the political changes that were going to  come in this country, and to maintain our defense cooperation  with it accordingly.    The reports about Israeli engineers who went to South Africa  to work after the Lavi project was canceled were perhaps a  little exaggerated, but for many years, South Africa absorbed  not only finished products from the Israeli defense industry,  but also much know-how. You see the results now at almost every  arms fair.    ""Although so far they have still not caused us any real  harm,  they are turning into more than just a mild headache,"" a senior  source in the defense establishment said.     "

According to military sources, on 6 May, the U.S.  imperialists dragged squadrons of fighter planes from its  overseas bases into the skies above South Korea and conducted  again a provocative aerial war exercise for a Northward invasion.    That day, the squadrons of fighter bombers and  pursuit-assault planes that moved out from U.S. bases in the  Pacific area to the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Taejon, and  Yechon frantically waged a surprise attack exercise against  strategic targets in the Northern half of the Republic.    Mobilized to this war exercise were those airplane squadrons  from overseas bases and some 180 various fighter bombers,  assault planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes of  the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea and of the puppet  Air Force.    This frantic war exercise under the command of E-3 airborne  warning and control planes that flew from a base in Okinawa,  Japan was aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of  cooperation among airplane squadrons from overseas bases, the  U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea, and the puppet Air  Force; and examining their capability of making a surprise  attack for a Northward invasion.    On the same day, An RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane  flew  from an overseas base into the skies above the area near the DMZ  and then carried out electronic reconnaissance on strategic  points in the northern half of the Republic while flying at a  high altitude for a long time.    At the same time, A P-3 off-the-shelf aircraft [panjamgi]  belonging to the Seventh U.S. Fleet flew into the skies above  the East Sea of South Korea and then ran wild in carrying out  espionage on our side's coastline and sea. A U-2 high-altitude  strategic reconnaissance plane madly photographed and carried  out electronic reconnaissance on areas in the Northern half of  the Republic while flying day and night in the skies above an  area near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL].    In the meantime, the South Korean puppets were frenzied in  firing bombs near the MDL in the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ], as  well as increasing armed troops there. On 6 May, the South  Korean puppets mobilized and deployed several tens of  large-caliber gun units in Kumsan-ri, Puju county, with their  barrels turned toward Songdong- ri, a western area of the front  line in front of us, and moved hundreds of rascals with heavy  arms [chungmujang aktangdul] forward from Hyon-ri, Imje county,  an eastern area of the front line, and deployed them in an area  adjacent to the DMZ.    On the same day, after occupying firing positions at  Chongja-ri in Paju county and Kangnae-ri in Yonchon county, the  puppet Army's large-caliber artillery units showed off a war  frenzy by firing tens of bombs at an area near the DMZ.    These war maneuvers are a grave challenge to detent and  peace  on the Korean peninsula.     "

At the Organisation of African unity summit in  Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow  African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his  aides to squash ""exaggerated"" hopes for financial aid and  intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take  sides in international disputes. In developments this week:    -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between  the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces.  Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace  fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to  Rwanda.    -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite  three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States,  led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for  military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the  Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in  Cape Town last week.    -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan  conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading  role in this initiative.    -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement  full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country  sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is  teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its  nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its  side.    -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the  Frontline States for their assistance in the war against  apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa  would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region.    -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion  backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United  Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU  meeting.    A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid  being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new  government was also aware that, as a ""newcomer"", it had to be  sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the  government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands  before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent.    In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz  Pahad  outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the  chief priority of securing resources for the country's  Reconstruction and Development Programme.    Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and  Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: ""It appears  that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to  exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve  better results if we fit in with the strategies already started,  instead of starting our own independent initiatives.""    He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with  the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to  mediate. There were three other ""perfectly competent"" African  leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he  added.    On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had  been  asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko,  he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique  President Joaquim Chissano.    After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member  of  the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had  not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the  economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear  that South Africa would not hand out material resources except  to help raise living standards.    On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and  delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual  would solve Africa's economic and social problems.    Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an  interview in Tunis: ""Of course they (African countries) have  expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South  Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts.    ""At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South  African delegation has been warning against expecting too much.""    OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were  being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to  strengthen the African economy. ""The best contribution South  Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then  gradually impact on the continent,"" he said.    However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He  said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace  fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount  of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle  against apartheid.

Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas announced that  the new budget proposal in Congress has raised the funds for his  ministry by 6 percent. He considers this increase good, when  compared with the 16 to 20 percent cuts in other areas.    Brazil has again received sizable funds from the World Bank  for the PADCT (Program in Support of Scientific and  Technological Development).    Those funds come from both the Brazilian Government and the  World Bank; but in October 1992, because of the lack of local  matching funds, the country received only 3.8 percent of the  PADCT appropriation.    ""The faucet was turned off during the Collor government,""  remarks Vargas. Now, the percentage has returned to a more  appropriate level, on the order of 70 percent, he claims.    The government is also negotiating a loan that could amount  to $300 million or even $400 million. Some of the funds from the  privatizations will go to science as well.    At the opening of the ""International Seminar on Evaluation  of  and Proposals for Brazilian Scientific and Technological  Development,"" at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), the  minister pointed out that private business firms contribute only  15 percent of the costs of research and development in the  country.    As early as this year, Vargas expects to raise the spending  on science and technology by over $700 million annually.  Brazil's total spending on the sector stands at approximately $3  billion per year. The ministry's budget amounts to $800-$900  million.    The background for the minister's statements consists of  three studies on the status of science in the country, the  purpose of which was to discuss proposals for the sector's  development.    Another point stressed by the minister was the improvement  in  relations with the U.S. Owing to the conflict over the patent  law, the computer science policy, and the construction of the  Brazilian rocket, which the rich countries fear may become a  military missile, the U.S. threatened drastic cuts in the  scientific cooperation with Brazil. The conflict has been  resolved.    Political scientist Simon Schwartzman, of the USP  [University  of Sao Paulo] and FGV, proposes the ""associated laboratories""  model, to provide a solid foundation for financing the leading  research groups operating at present.    Schwartzman points to the CNPq's (National Research Council)  estimate that Brazil has nearly 52,000 researchers, but that  only a quarter of them (between 12,000 and 13,000) have  doctorates, and hence are qualified researchers. Another quarter  of that total have only taken a course leading to a degree.    Military Research    Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari Filho, a professor at Unicamp  [Campinas State University] and colonel in the reserves,  advocated the next federal government's continuation of the  three main military research and development projects.    The three major projects that he cited are the parallel  nuclear program handled by the Navy, the goal of which is the  construction of a nuclear submarine in the country; the  Brazilian Complete Space Mission, including the installation of  a satellite launching rocket by the Air Force; and the  production of the AMX fighter-bomber by Embraer [Brazilian  Aeronautics Company].    According to Cavagnari, all three projects were ""mistakes,""  because the country could have found other means for achieving  technological development. However, he thinks that it would be  worse to end them now, when they are beginning to bring results.    According to the Unicamp professor, the dimensions of the  military projects can be gauged by the total cost of the nuclear  submarine project: $2.5 billion in 20 years. The launching of  the submarine is planned for the year 2005.    Another fact demonstrating the sector's importance to the  society: nearly 90 percent of the researchers employed by the  military are civilians, the cost of whose training has been  defrayed largely by the Armed Forces.    Another Unicamp researcher, Renato Dagnino, questions the  supposed financial benefits accrued from military research,  estimating that it consumes 20 percent of the country's total  research and development budget.    Dagnino notes that, in the U.S., military research carries  an  even greater weight (approximately 40 percent), but is more  effective in terms of value of the product. Whereas, in the  U.S., the military industry accounts for 4 percent of the GDP  (gross domestic product), in Brazil, during 1987, that  percentage was only 0.2 (a result 10 times worse in terms of  value of the end product).    [Box, p 1-12]    Physics in a Critical Situation    The picture of physics research in Brazil drawn yesterday at  the International Seminar is dismal, as was to be expected. The  physicists think that, to revive it, there must be a break in  its umbilical link with the university.    This viewpoint was upheld by Sergio Machado Rezende, aged  53,  a full professor at the UFPE (Federal University of Pernambuco).  According to Rezende, 84 percent of Brazilians with doctorates  in physics are in universities, and 2 percent are in private  business firms.    In more industrialized countries, nearly a third are in  industry. In the U.S., the proportion amounts to 50 percent.  There are 1,350 holders of doctorates in physics in the  country; and 33,000 in the U.S.    According to Rezende, the only solution is more investment  in  the sector. Whereas industrialized countries apply $50 per  capita annually, here the amount declines to $0.79.     "

However, since it has been shunned by the international investment community for so long, South Africa is playing hard to get with the numerous banks that have come courting. Although the gold and foreign exchange reserves have fallen, there is no urgent need for South Africa to raise funds internationally. An Dollars 850m loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be forthcoming by the end of the year and South Africa also has access to short-term credit lines from several banks. Nevertheless, bankers expect South Africa to launch its first international bond issue since January 1992 after the elections. South Africa is likely to test the waters with a Eurobond issue denominated in D-Marks. If the D-Mark Eurobond issue is successful, South Africa will then consider an offering in the higher-profile eurodollar sector. Offerings from parastatal issuers are likely to follow. The main bone of contention is the interest rate South Africa would have to pay to raise funds in the Eurobond market. Borrowers who want to raise funds in the Eurobond market have to pay a 'spread' or premium over the yield in the domestic government bond market. The size of the yield spread is determined by the market's perception of the borrower. The bigger the spread, the riskier the borrower. Bankers say that as long as South Africa is classified as an emerging market it will have to pay a yield spread of between 225 and 275 basis points over underlying government bonds. This is well above the yield spread of around 175 basis points which South Africa is prepared to pay. As a result, South Africa could refrain from coming to the international bond market until the pricing issue has been resolved.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

But they were also at war with the view_expressed later in the Secretary's     Hudson     reply brief_that a sentence-four remand order is a ``final judgment'' in the civil action.     Id.    , at 16. Essentially, the Secretary in     Hudson     wanted it both ways: He wanted us to regard retention of jurisdiction as proper for purposes of determining prevailing-party status, but as improper for purposes of awarding fees on remand.                4     Justice STEVENS says that our holding ``overrul[es]''     Sullivan     v.     Hudson    , 490 U.S. 877, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 104 L.Ed.2d 941, (1989).     Post    , at 2633, 2636. We do not think that is an accurate characterization.     Hudson     remains good law as applied to remands ordered pursuant to sentence six. And since the distinction between sentence-four and sentence-six remands was neither properly presented nor considered in     Hudson, see supra,     at 2630 and n. 3, and     infra    , at 2631, limiting     Hudson     to sentence-six cases does not ``overrule'' the decision even in part. See     Brecht     v.     Abrahamson,     507 U.S.     XXX    ,     XXX    , 113 S.Ct., 1710, 1718, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). We agree with Justice STEVENS that until today there has been some contradiction in our case law on this subject. In resolving it, however, we have not simply chosen     Melkonyan's     dicta over     Hudson    , but have grounded our decision in the text and structure of the relevant statutes, particularly section 405.          Schaefer's second argument is that a sentence-four remand order cannot be considered a ``final judgment'' for purposes of section 2412(d)(1)(B) because that provision requires the party seeking fees to submit an application ``show[ing] that [he] is a prevailing party.'' That showing, Schaefer contends, cannot be made until the proceedings on remand are complete, since a Social Security claimant does not ``prevail'' until he is awarded Social Security benefits. The premise of this argument is wrong. No holding of this Court has ever denied prevailing-party status (under section 2412(d)(1)(B)) to a plaintiff who won a remand order pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g). Dicta in     Hudson     stated that ``a Social Security claimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailing party within the meaning of the EAJA merely because a court had remanded the action to the agency for further proceedings.'' 490 U.S., at 887, 109 S.Ct., at 2255. But that statement (like the holding of the case) simply failed to recognize the distinction between a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six remand, which does not. The sharp distinction between the two types of remand had not been made in the lower-court opinions in     Hudson    , see     Hudson     v.     Secretary of Health and Human Services,     839 F.2d 1453 (CA11 1988); App. to Pet. for Cert. in     Sullivan     v.     Hudson    , O.T.1988, No. 616, pp. 17a20a (setting forth unpublished District Court opinion), was not included in the question presented for decision,    5     and was mentioned for the first time in the closing pages of the Secretary's reply brief, see Reply Brief for Petitioner in     Sullivan     v.     Hudson    , O.T.1988, No. 616, pp. 1417. It is only decisions after     Hudson    _specifically     Finkelstein     and     Melkonyan_    which establish that the sentence-four, sentence-six distinction is crucial to the structure of judicial review established under section 405(g). See     Finkelstein    , 496 U.S., at 626, 110 S.Ct., at 2664;     Melkonyan,     501 U.S., at     XXX        XXX    , 111 S.Ct., at 21622163.             5     As formulated in the Secretary's petition, the question on which the Court granted certiorari in     Hudson     was: ``Whether Social Security administrative proceedings conducted after a remand from the courts are `adversary adjudications' for which attorney fees are available under the [EAJA].'' Pet. for Cert. in     Sullivan     v.     Hudson    , O.T.1988, No. 616, p. I.              Hudson    's dicta that remand does not generally confer prevailing-party status relied on three cases, none of which supports that proposition as applied to sentence-four remands.     Hanrahan     v.     Hampton,     446 U.S. 754, 758759, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1990, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980), rejected an assertion of prevailing-party status, not by virtue of having secured a remand, but by virtue of having obtained a favorable procedural ruling (the reversal on appeal of a directed verdict) during the course of the judicial proceedings.     Hewitt     v.     Helms,     482 U.S. 755, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987), held that a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party merely by obtaining ``a favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in     judgment against the plaintiff    ,''     id.    , at 763, 107 S.Ct., at 2677 (emphasis added). (A sentence-four remand, of course, is a judgment     for     the plaintiff.) And the third case cited in     Hudson, Texas Teachers Assn.     v.     Garland Independent School Dist    ., 489 U.S. 782, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989), affirmatively supports the proposition that a party who wins a sentence-four remand order is a prevailing party.     Garland     held that status to have been obtained ``[i]f the plaintiff has succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some of the benefit *** sought in bringing suit.''     Id.,     at 791792, 109 S.Ct., at 1493 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Obtaining a sentence-four judgment reversing the Secretary's denial of benefits certainly meets this description. See also     Farrar     v.

A police source said Christopher Moore, 23, accompanied by  his attorney, turned himself in to the police and was arrested  and charged with possession of ganja, dealing in and taking  steps to export the drug.    Moore, son of Charles Moore who owns Moore's Transport Ltd.,  on Hagley Park Road, St. Andrew, is booked to appear in the  Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton Street this morning.       A Link    Moore's arrest is linked to the arrest Wednesday of Bryan  Bernal, the 20-year-old son of Jamaica's Ambassador to the  United States, Dr. Richard Bernal, and a juvenile relative, for  breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.    The young men were held with 45.45 kilograms of ganja  disguised as pineapple juice as they were being processed to  leave the Norman Manley International Airport for Washington D.C.    However, they contend that they were given the tins, packed  into two cartons, to deliver to the relative of an acquaintance  in Washington D.C. The police had been trying to find the person  who allegedly gave the young men the contraband.    In the meantime, the after-dark bail Wednesday of Bryan  Bernal and a juvenile relative has raised many eyebrows in legal  circles.       Unprecedented    Lawyers say it is unprecedented that persons charged in  connection with the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs  be offered ""station"" bail.    Although the police have the power to grant bail, they  invariably remand persons caught attempting to smuggle drugs and  allow the court to decide if bail should be granted and in what  amount.    Alleged traffickers, mostly foreigners have consistently  been  denied bail in the past, but some Jamaicans whose attorneys have  been able to convince the court that they will turn up for their  trial have been offered bail, usually with conditions attached,  such as surrendering travel documents and reporting to the  police each week.    At Hunt's Bay Police Station Bryan Bernal and the other  accused were each offered $500,000 bail Wednesday night.    They were freed on bail, about 10 hours after they were held  with the drug packed into 96 tins, labelled pineapple juice,  among their luggage.    When they appeared in the Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton  Street yesterday, Resident Magistrate Norma Von Cork extended  their bail until next Thursday, April 14.    Their Jamaican passports were seized as a condition of bail.    An application by defence counsel Richard Small for the two  to be given permission to return to the United States to  continue their studies was turned down by the magistrate. Mr.  Small submitted that Bryan, an architectural student, was due to  sit examinations this month.    Mr. Small and attorney-in-law Stephen Shelton are appearing  for the accused.

At a press  conference to mark the end of the two-day heads of state summit,  he said the committee would deal with African conflicts at  ambassadorial, ministerial and summit levels.    It would implement an early-warning system to identify  potential flashpoints and introduce measures to manage and  resolve conflicts throughout the continent.    Other African states serving on the committee are Tunisia,  Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Benin, Chad, Egypt and Ethiopia.    Dr Salim said the mechanism, established in Cairo last year,  needed financial support to function efficiently.    He said conflict resolution and peace-keeping had enjoyed a  high priority in the leaders' summit.    ""There was a clear determination to see an end to the  conflicts plagueing Africa. This culminated in the significant  achievement of the agreement by both parties in the Rwanda  conflict to introduce an immediate ceasefire.""    Dr Salim said the Rwanda Government and rebel forces were  both committed to ending the devastating civil war and allowing  the United Nations troops to provide protection and humanitarian  assistance to refugees displaced by the conflict.    Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia have each  contributed a batallion of 800 men to the UN mission in Rwanda  while Mali, Nigeria and Congo would send about 100 soldiers each.    South Africa had pledged humanitarian assistance and  possibly  logistical support in the form of approved personnel carriers.    Dr Salim also praised South Africa for paying its OAU  membership subscription in full and called on member states who  are in arrears to emulate their example.    He said the best contribution South Africa could make to  Africa was to remain a united, stable and peaceful society.    In the long term, South Africa would contribute  significantly  to the OAU and Africa, particularly in the sub-continent.    ""We can expect South Africa in the future to play a major  economic, political and security role in the continent,"" he said.     "

This follows a series of missions to South Africa by  representatives of the African Development Bank group since  1991. The Development Bank of South Africa [DBSA] said it had  been decided that the republic would officially enter into a  series of consultations with the African Development Bank group  on the terms and conditions of South Africa's membership.    These consultations would be pursued under the auspices of  the government of national unity and might eventually lead to  South Africa becoming a fully fledged member of Africa's premier  development financing institution, the DBSA said.    The group has earmarked between R720-million [rand] to  R1.26-billion a year over the next five years for financing  investment projects and programmes to both South Africa's public  and private sectors, to enhance economic and social development.  The funds could come in the form of long term loans to finance  public sector project investments in agriculture, public  utilities, transportation, education, health and industry, or  long-term lines of credit to national development banks to  finance private sector projects or medium- to long-term loans  and equity investments, in all productive sectors of the  economy, made directly to the private sector.    The DBSA said it was probable a significant portion of the  group's resources to South Africa would be targeted at  disadvantaged South Africans. However, it was up to South  Africa to decide finally on such resource allocation from  African Development Bank sources.    There were also opportunities for South African firms to  supply goods and services for the execution of the group's  projects throughout Africa. In addition, South Africa could  draw on the group's grant-based technical assistance.    South African representatives would attend the group's  annual  general meeting in Nairobi from May 11 to 13, at which the  declaration of intent would be tabled. A series of joint South  African/African Development Bank Group consultations would  follow the successful adoption of the declaration of intent, the  DBSA said.     "

The president,  who was opening the seventh Pan-African congress at the  conference center in Kampala today, told the congress  participants that in order to emancipate ourselves from foreign  domination we as Africans must know what to do. He described  the Kampala congress as a good moment to make a correct  diagnosis so that Africa gets an answer.    Mr. Museveni attributed Africa's problem to internal African  weaknesses both now and in the past and to external greed by  outside powers. He identified the main internal weaknesses of  Africa as lack of technology and poor organization but stressed  the question of poor organization as having played the most  crucial role. He said that countries such as China, Ethiopia,  and Japan, although inferior in technology, were able to defend  their sovereignty due to a high level of organization.    Mr. Museveni also attributed Africa's problems to Africa's  self- inflicted damage. He explained that one of the most  important factors to be independent is production, and yet  African governments have continuously interfered with production  by imposing various obstacles such as roadblocks, visas, and  marketing monopolies. He said African governments have  themselves interfered with sovereignty in Africa. He therefore  called upon the seventh Pan-African congress to examine their  self-inflicted damages and come up with solutions.    On the question of reparations to Africa by Europe and  America, Mr. Museveni said that these countries have a moral  responsibility to pay for the damage inflicted on Africa by  their ancestors. He stressed that Africa will emancipate  herself with or without the sympathy of her former oppressors.  However he was of the view that compensation for the past  injustices is likely to come when Africa demands it from a  position of strength not from one of weakness. He therefore  commended the seventh Pan-African congress slogan of Organize  But Do Not Agonize, saying that it is definitely within our  means to end domination.    Mr. Museveni elaborated that he personally had been fighting  to end domination for the last 29 years and, although he has not  ended domination completely, he has pushed it back. Elaborating  on who are the members of the Pan-African movement, Mr. Museveni  categorized these as the black Africans on the African  Continent, the Africans in the Arab region, the Africans in the  Diaspora, and whites in South Africa whom he referred to as a  new African tribe. He appealed to all Pan-Africanists not to  draw ideology into the movement but to accept all  Pan-Africanists, both radical and reactionaries, as members of  the movement. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT933-5755 ,"FT933-5755 _AN-DIAB3AGPFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at risk (17): A great risk of missing the boat - Southern Africa / The future of a region racked by political turmoil, civil war and social upheaval      By PATTI WALDMEIR   'IF YOUR neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep peacefully.' That adage, from veteran South African entrepreneur Anton Rupert, forms the rationale around the world for regional integration: the argument is that a sated neighbour is a stable neighbour, unlikely to turn belligerent. And with peace and stability come economic development. Four years ago, southern Africa's prospects looked unrelievedly bleak, with Angola and Mozambique sunk in civil war, Zambia in turmoil, Zimbabwe in economic decline and South Africa exhausted by decades of repression. Today hopes are high that South Africa will prove the region's economic saviour. But the post-apartheid government in Pretoria is likely to pay little attention to the problem of hungry neighbours until it can solve the far more dangerous problem of hungry citizens. And that could take until the end of the decade, even on an optimistic timetable, dampening hopes that South Africa will be the 'locomotive' of rapid growth in southern Africa - at least in the short term. First among the problems is the political transition in South Africa itself, where violence and instability have severely depressed economic activity and deterred foreign and local investors. Until South Africa is stable, accelerated economic growth in the region remains a pipe dream: and achieving stability in the republic may prove a lengthy process. Similarly, political upheaval in other countries of the region will inevitably delay growth. The most economically promising country outside South Africa - Angola - looks set to languish in civil war for the foreseeable future; Mozambique's future is far from certain, in spite of plans for multi-party elections; Zambia is struggling under the burden of decades of past mistakes, economic and political; Zimbabwe is weak economically. The economic basis for regional integration is also shaky. Prospects for significantly increasing trade within the region are uninspiring: first and foremost, because most of the countries of southern Africa simply cannot pay, at least not with hard currency. To get around the payment problem, South Africa could extend the rand monetary area to include other countries - a far too costly option, given the lack of monetary discipline exhibited by most of the region's central banks - or resort to countertrade. But it will be difficult to boost two-way trade links given the fact that South Africa's neighbours are far less developed than the republic (in a market worth Dollars 130bn, South Africa already has an 80 per cent share) and because regional complementarities are few, outside of a limited range of raw materials. Little can be expected from the lifting of sanctions in this area either: even under sanctions, regional states grouped together under the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (since renamed the Southern African Development Community) imported R2.4bn of goods from the republic, or almost 60 per cent of Pretoria's African exports. The most promising areas could well prove inter-regional trade in services, such as power and water, with Eskom, the South African electricity utility, proposing a southern African electricity grid; Pretoria already imports water from Lesotho through the Highlands Water project. But important as this co-operation is, the record to date suggests there is little evidence that SADC politicians in the region are prepared to relinquish enough economic autonomy to form a truly integrated regional community. In the longer term, there is no alternative to regional integration. In a world of economic and political power blocs, southern Africa cannot hope to prosper in its present fragmented state. The risk is that, unless the region achieves political stability soon, it will simply miss the boat.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

During the first 10 months of 1993, bilateral trade reached  US$1.631 billion, a 12.41 percent growth over the US$1.451  billion registered during the same period of 1992, according to  an official at the ROC embassy in Pretoria.    During the January-October period of 1993, the ROC imported  US$1.127 billion worth of goods from South Africa, up 17.92  percent over the same period of 1992.    Exports to South Africa totaled US$504 million, a growth of  1.78 percent from 1992 tallies. South Africa enjoyed a trade  surplus of US$623 million during the period, the official noted.    The official added that the ROC's booming trade with South  Africa was not affected by the 1993 lifting of a world trade  embargo placed on the country and he predicted an expansion in  overall economic and trade relations between the two countries.

The European Union says it plans to invest about 700 million  rands in South Africa to help the government fulfill the  expectations of the country's citizens. A member of the Union's  executive, Mr. Hans van den Broek, said in Pretoria that the new  government would need foreign aid for the difficult work that  lies ahead. He said people were justified in having high hopes  but that it would be a hard task satisfying them in the short  term.    Meanwhile, Canada announced the extension of General  Preferential Tariff treatment to South Africa, which makes it  easier to export to Canada. Application of the General  Preferential Tariff means that the rate of duty pay on eligible  imports from South Africa will be reduced by at least 33  percent. Australia announced that it would give an extra 17.1  million rands in aid to South Africa over the next three years.  This brings the total amount of aid to South Africa to about 90  million rands.    Promises of aid and support also came from Germany. The  German minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, said South  Africa's new government needs international confidence and  support. He pointed out that nowhere else in Africa were the  chances for development and healthy and continuous growth so  great as in South Africa. Other nations who announced plans to  boost relations with South Africa are Indonesia, Morocco,  Bangladesh, China, India, and Singapore.     "

In this regard, it has been disclosed  that the Japanese Government reached ""secret accords"" with  United States and Australia, in deciding to import amounts of  certain products which the United States and Australia produce  more of than do other countries, in the face of the  liberalization. The accords will be linked to giving priority  to actual purchases of certain milk products from both  countries. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  [MAFF] denies the allegation, saying that ""we did not promise  that we would import the goods from both countries."" However, it  is believed that the secret accords are de facto ""import  guarantees."" Therefore, it is expected that other milk-product  exporting nations will voice opposition.    So far the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation [LIPC]  has imported all types of milk products, including butter and  skim milk, to satisfy domestic demand. Following the Uruguay  Round agreement, importers will be able to freely import milk  products starting in 1995 if they pay high tariffs. At the same  time, the LIPC will be allowed to import 137,202 tons of milk  products annually with low tariffs as part of minimum access.    Of the LIPC's import quota, 20,000 to 30,000 tons will be  allocated to a milk product called whey, which is used in bread  and confections, according to the accord with the United States  which was agreed to last year at the bilateral Japan-U.S. talks.  Because the United States is strongly competitive in the  production of whey, the agreement may become a de facto  guarantee for its import from the United States. According to  the MAFF, Japan has not imported whey from the United States  since 1988.    Japan promised Australia in March that it would import  butter  and skim milk from that country in amounts equivalent to at  least three-fourths of the LIPC's total imports of butter and  skim milk. Japan and Australia have exchanged an informal  document that stipulates: 1) Japan will decide on the import  volume of butter and skim milk every year after considering the  domestic demand, and 2) Japan and Australia will hold  governmental dairy product negotiations every year and exchange  information on the milk products trade. It can be said that the  informal document is a de facto guarantee for imports from  Australia. The MAFF, however, has never made public the  informal document.    Commenting on the secret accord concluded between Japan and  the United States, a Japanese official in charge of the Uruguay  Round negotiations said, ""Japan and the United States agreed at  the end of their negotiations on opening the Japanese rice  market to postpone implementation of rice `tariffication,' and  Japan has conceded to the United States on whey.""    In principle, GATT bans country-by-country import quotas,  but  it permits the import quota system if all nations involved agree  on the import quota system. As for the secret Japan-U.S. accord  and the secret Japan-Australia accord, the MAFF has not notified  GATT of them, and the MAFF says, ""The accords do not constitute  a country-by-country import quota.""

0,FT942-14584 ,"FT942-14584 _AN-EDTEFAA2FT 940420   FT  20 APR 94 / Pretoria gets economic lift from Europe: Developing-nation status granted to S Africa on market access      By DAVID GARDNER      LUXEMBOURG   European Union foreign ministers yesterday agreed in principle to add South Africa to the generalised system of preferences (GSP) under which developing nations are granted virtually tariff-free access to the European market for their manufactured goods. The move should go ahead soon after South Africa's first universal suffrage elections on April 26-28, when the EU should have finalised its 10-year review of the GSP system, held up until the recent completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 'This is aimed as a substantial gesture of support for the elections,' said an aide to Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner. 'This is what both the government and the African National Congress have been asking us for.' But ministers resisted a British-led move to get the EU to commit itself now to a fully-fledged trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa as the next stage in closer links. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium prefer a more evolutionary approach, and got reference to yesterday's decision as an 'interim' agreement struck out of the Council of Ministers' conclusions. Behind their lukewarm enthusiasm is reluctance to treat South Africa as a developing country, although its relatively high average earnings mask huge income gaps within its population. Nevertheless, all 12 EU states agreed to treat South Africa as a special case. The EU runs a substantial trade deficit with South Africa, from which it largely imports minerals and precious metals, most of which already enter duty-free. In 1992, the Union had an Ecu3.7bn (Pounds 2.84bn) deficit on imports from South Africa worth Ecu9.1bn, over two-thirds of which were raw materials. For the first nine months of last year imports were Ecu6.7bn, against exports to South Africa of Ecu4.1bn, for a deficit of Ecu2.6bn. Because of the small flows of finished goods that South Africa exports, GSP treatment will at first be of limited benefit, even with, as ministers also agreed in principle, flexible rules on so-called accumulated rules of origin, or treating as South African goods which include components from neighbouring countries. However, along with recommendations that member states conclude bilateral investment protection and promotion pacts with South Africa, and a request to the European Investment Bank to extend its development financing to the republic, 'we are creating the climate for investors to take South Africa more seriously,' as a British official put it.

Together, they are responsible for 56 percent of all  cases of dumping reported in the current six-year period,  according to a study conducted by the Dumping and Subsidies  Investigations Directorate under the Unit of International Trade  Practices of the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat  (SECOFI).    The document says that in the current six-year period,  approximately 108 dumping investigations have been conducted to  detect cases in which foreign producers are selling products at  lower than normal prices in the Mexican market, which hurts  Mexican industries so much that they are driven to the verge of  bankruptcy.    Of a total of 108 cases investigated, 43 have to do with  products coming in from the United States and 17 from the PRC,  followed by 12 investigations into Brazilian products and five  into German products.    Figures show that 39.81 percent of all investigations have  been conducted against U.S. products brought into the country  under unfair trade conditions, while 15.74 percent of all  investigations involve PRC products.    The countries that have committed the least number of unfair  trade practices against Mexico have been those from the Asian  bloc and from Latin America, but in the case of Latin American  nations, the document notes that trade with these countries is  very limited.    The analysis conducted by SECOFI reveals that most of the  countries with which Mexico trades have been the object of two  or more dumping investigations, but in the case of the United  States, the number of unfair trade practices committed in the  Mexican market is extraordinary.    Among the countries that in the past five years have been  the  object of only one dumping investigation by the Mexican trade  authorities are Argentina, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, the  Netherlands, Pakistan, and Chile. Belgium, the EC, Colombia,  and Taiwan have been the object of only two dumping  investigations each under the current administration, the  document states.    As for the products involved, the ones that ""suffered"" most  from unfair trade practices were those from the chemical  industry, oil byproducts, and rubber and plastic products, and  these comprised 40 percent of the dumping cases reported during  the current administration. These products are followed by  those from the basic metal industry with 17 percent of all  investigations and the textile sector with 12 percent of cases  of unfair trade. In the same order of importance, metal  industry products, machinery, and equipment -- including, among  other products, microcomputers, telephone adapters,  transformers, and tools -- account for 10 percent of all  investigations.    Toys, shoes, and electrical appliances, including  refrigerators, account for 7 percent of the total number of  registered cases. Nonmetal products -- fluorite, cement,  artificial corundum, and ceramic coating [recubrimiento  ceramico] -- account for 5 percent of the total number of  dumping cases, followed by products from the paper and printing  press industry.    Food products account for the least number of  investigations;  cases of unfair trade practices have only been reported in the  marketing of fish meal, beef, pork, and cationic starch.     "

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting  simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the  officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns.    This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again  to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become  acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in?    Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South  Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows  about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror  sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color  lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites  love cricket.    If only every issue in South Africa were so simple.    The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back  into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the  solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South  Africa's legislators.    After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It  wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried  everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They  have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not  been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past.    ""We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no  one will meet with us,"" said Gert le Roux, director of the South African  Amateur Athletic Union. ""We are never welcome, and some of these people used to  be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel  lobbies.""    The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the  South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a  founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is  effectively banned.    ""Every year, South Africa is on the schedule,"" he said. ""Every year, no one  comes.""    In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a ""sports  ambassador"" from South Africa in London.    Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on  a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His  mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how  integrated it was.    Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job  was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international  anti-apartheid lobby.    In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant  discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid.  He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and  it was their lack of response that drove him to quit.    ""If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political  ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is  wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated,"" he said.    ""The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power  games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political  tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for.""    Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's  sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning,  South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the  world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have  been correct.    Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South  Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear  that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place --  apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that  hasn't been brought down.    So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports  officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give  either way.    ""In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the  pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the  past."" said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic  Committee. ""That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and  maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They  didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa  took over the United Nations, the IOC.""    Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the  mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in  favor of ""white"" countries in which it felt more kinship. Now, in an era of  reconciliation, African countries are not in the mood to overlook past slights  -- or present conditions.    But the delicate relationship with the rest of Africa is crucial to South  Africa's future in the Olympic movement, for Olympic officials have made it  clear that the way back for South Africa must wind through Africa.    Two workmen are sitting in a tin shed by the Eastbank Hall swimming pool in  Alexandra, waiting for the delivery of paint for the bottom of the pool. They  have been waiting for two weeks. When the pool was built, the wrong paint was  used, and ever since it hasn't been right. Sometimes someone comes by with some  paint for the pool, but it isn't right, either.    So, here in the middle of South Africa's summer, the only pool in this black  township is closed.    Alexandra's best soccer field was partially covered with brown grass and  potholes because residents weren't able to water, resod or bring in equipment  to grade it.    Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, relies largely on its schools to  provide sports facilities for the black children. It is a faint hope, however,  in a country where schools are segregated and the government spends five times  more money to educate its white children than its black.    ""They are telling you lies abroad,"" said a community activist in Soweto who  would give only his first name, Rapu. ""They tell you our facilities are equal.  You can see they are not. South Africa belongs to all who are in it. We must  work to make a country for all the people. Sport has a significant role to  play. But there are priorities. You can't have a society that has thousands of  sports facilities when you have people who are not healthy enough to play the  sports.""    Rapu is fully behind the sports boycotts, even though he acknowledges that  black South Africans are doubly punished: They are not allowed free and open  competition within South Africa, and, as South Africans, they are not allowed  to compete against the rest of the world.    There is an argument advancing the notion that rather than stifling sports in  South Africa, those who seek to bring about political change ought to encourage  sports and nourish them. This argument holds that the interaction among races  that sports bring, the camaraderie it engenders, is a far more effective tool  to bring people together than laws and edicts.    Jannie Momberg, a Member of Parliament from the Democratic party, agrees with  this view and says that in South Africa, sports has another role.    ""I would say that sport has been used by the South African government as a kite  -- to see which way the wind was blowing in the country,"" he said. ""If it  worked in sports, they put it in place elsewhere in society.""    This kite is difficult to fly in a wind so strong that it seeks to bring it  down. However, in the last year, three historic meetings took place that may  have changed the direction of the anti-South African wind.    On Sept. 11, Johan du Plessis and J.B. du Plessis, the director of the South  African National Olympic Committee, met in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Juan  Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. The topic:  How to get South Africa back into the Olympic movement.    Samaranch explained that for South Africa to get back, it must work through its  continent -- only the IOC members from Africa will be able to help South  Africa. ""If they accept you, the rest of the world will accept you,"" Samaranch  said.    Events moved swiftly. On Oct. 11, the Du Plessises (they are unrelated) met  with Judge Keba Mbaye, an IOC vice president from Senegal. Mbaye told them that  Africa was their ticket back, and expected no less than the abolition of  apartheid.    That paved the way for a meeting on Jan. 9 in Paris with Sam Ramsamy and Fekrou  Kidane, who are advisers to the IOC Commission on Apartheid and Olympism.  Ramsamy, in particular, has devoted his life to the anti-apartheid sports  movement. The South Africans were excited about the unprecedented meeting.    Obviously, apartheid was singled out as the biggest problem. Another was the  IOC's concern about lack of unity among South African sporting bodies. In some  sports, there are five or six governing bodies. The IOC, through Ramsamy, told  the SANOC to unify its sports bodies under one umbrella and get rid of any  discrimination.    The South Africans came away from the 5 1/2-hour meeting excited about the  future for the first time in decades.    ""It was the first time we had concrete suggestions,"" Johan du Plessis said. ""We  didn't talk about politics. We talked about sports. We know what we have to  do.""    Some sports administrators here are angry at what they see as the IOC's  selective boycott of South Africa. Ray Moore of the South African Tennis Union  said: ""Listen, in 1980 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the IOC saw fit to  hold the Games in the capital city of the invading nation. Where is the line of  demarcation? Is there a set of standards for Africa?"" Moore said.    ""If you want to go into human rights in Africa . . . most of the countries in  Africa are governed in tyranny. They have dictators. You have people who have  sworn themselves into a presidency or as king for life. Ethiopia . . . what is  happening in Ethiopia is unbelievable. And Uganda. They are in the Olympics.  They are a respected member of the IOC. This was during a time when Africa was  becoming more powerful internationally. They could turn the whole thing the way  they wanted it to turn.""    In their excitement about the opening of a dialogue with the IOC, South African  officials are overlooking other signs. Last month Samaranch was asked about the  possibility of South Africa being readmitted in time for the 1992 Olympics.  Samaranch said it would not be possible. And the African nations are no less  militant regarding their neighbor to the south.    Rise like Lions after slumber    In unvanquishable number --    Shake your chains to earth like dew    Which in sleep had fallen on you --    Ye are many -- they are few.     -- Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Mask of Anarchy    Despite political changes and some historic talks with the IOC, South Africa is  no nearer to being readmitted to the international sports community. And while  some officials in South Africa are optimistic, others note that only a month  ago, Samaranch rejected the notion that South Africa would be back in the IOC.  He called the changes ""cosmetic.""    Said Momberg: ""I'm very negative about being readmitted before South Africa  becomes an independent, non-racial democracy. We've done a lot in certain areas  to integrate, but then we have segregated schools. I would be most amazed if  the people in the Olympic movement, after so many years of successfully  pressuring South Africa, would give up and say, 'Come back, all is forgiven.' ""    One likely scenario for South Africa is for sports to be recognized piecemeal,  federation by federation. The IAAF could allow the South African track  federation back, for example, the international governing body for swimming  could recognize South Africa's federation, and so on. In this way, South  Africans may compete internationally before they compete as a team in the  Olympic Games.    South Africa has its friends within the IOC, proof enough that its years of  lobbying have not gone to waste. But others have read the IOC charter and see  no allowance for a country where apartheid is still the law.    ""We are all held hostage by apartheid -- the black athletes in South Africa,  the white athletes in South Africa,"" said Anita De Frantz, a U.S.  representative on the IOC. ""The black and white athletes in the rest of the  world are held hostage by that system. That's why it must be dismantled.    ""Our charter says you cannot discriminate. I don't know if it's politics and  sports not linking, but it's part of the rule of the Olympic movement. While it  may look to the rest of the world as politics and sport, it's our charter, it's  our document describing what it takes to be a part of the Olympic family that  prohibits them from being a part.    ""Of course, the rejoinder is, 'Well, what about places where there are human  rights violations?' Yes. But this is a country that openly, notoriously, says  that on the basis of the color of your skin, your rights are different. It's  just so clear. I use the word open and notorious -- there's just no mistake.""    This, then, is the rope South Africa clings to. Its end is in the isolation of  home; the other is in the freedom abroad. South Africa's inability to pull the  rope, or to allow itself to be tugged, has kept this athletic landscape static.    ""We have done all we can do,"" they say to the world. ""Let others compromise.""    While black and white athletes clamor to break free of the borders of South  Africa's exile, sports officials are held hostage by politicians who are held  hostage by apartheid.    And so South Africa remains, clenching its fist and stamping a tiny foot  against the world.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting  simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the  officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns.    This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again  to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become  acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in?    Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South  Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows  about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror  sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color  lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites  love cricket.    If only every issue in South Africa were so simple.    The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back  into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the  solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South  Africa's legislators.    After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It  wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried  everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They  have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not  been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past.    ""We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no  one will meet with us,"" said Gert le Roux, director of the South African  Amateur Athletic Union. ""We are never welcome, and some of these people used to  be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel  lobbies.""    The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the  South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a  founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is  effectively banned.    ""Every year, South Africa is on the schedule,"" he said. ""Every year, no one  comes.""    In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a ""sports  ambassador"" from South Africa in London.    Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on  a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His  mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how  integrated it was.    Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job  was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international  anti-apartheid lobby.    In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant  discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid.  He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and  it was their lack of response that drove him to quit.    ""If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political  ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is  wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated,"" he said.    ""The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power  games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political  tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for.""    Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's  sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning,  South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the  world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have  been correct.    Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South  Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear  that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place --  apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that  hasn't been brought down.    So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports  officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give  either way.    ""In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the  pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the  past."" said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic  Committee. ""That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and  maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They  didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa  took over the United Nations, the IOC.""    Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the  mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in  favor of ""white"" countries in which it felt more kinship. Now, in an era of  reconciliation, African countries are not in the mood to overlook past slights  -- or present conditions.    But the delicate relationship with the rest of Africa is crucial to South  Africa's future in the Olympic movement, for Olympic officials have made it  clear that the way back for South Africa must wind through Africa.    Two workmen are sitting in a tin shed by the Eastbank Hall swimming pool in  Alexandra, waiting for the delivery of paint for the bottom of the pool. They  have been waiting for two weeks. When the pool was built, the wrong paint was  used, and ever since it hasn't been right. Sometimes someone comes by with some  paint for the pool, but it isn't right, either.    So, here in the middle of South Africa's summer, the only pool in this black  township is closed.    Alexandra's best soccer field was partially covered with brown grass and  potholes because residents weren't able to water, resod or bring in equipment  to grade it.    Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, relies largely on its schools to  provide sports facilities for the black children. It is a faint hope, however,  in a country where schools are segregated and the government spends five times  more money to educate its white children than its black.    ""They are telling you lies abroad,"" said a community activist in Soweto who  would give only his first name, Rapu. ""They tell you our facilities are equal.  You can see they are not. South Africa belongs to all who are in it. We must  work to make a country for all the people. Sport has a significant role to  play. But there are priorities. You can't have a society that has thousands of  sports facilities when you have people who are not healthy enough to play the  sports.""    Rapu is fully behind the sports boycotts, even though he acknowledges that  black South Africans are doubly punished: They are not allowed free and open  competition within South Africa, and, as South Africans, they are not allowed  to compete against the rest of the world.    There is an argument advancing the notion that rather than stifling sports in  South Africa, those who seek to bring about political change ought to encourage  sports and nourish them. This argument holds that the interaction among races  that sports bring, the camaraderie it engenders, is a far more effective tool  to bring people together than laws and edicts.    Jannie Momberg, a Member of Parliament from the Democratic party, agrees with  this view and says that in South Africa, sports has another role.    ""I would say that sport has been used by the South African government as a kite  -- to see which way the wind was blowing in the country,"" he said. ""If it  worked in sports, they put it in place elsewhere in society.""    This kite is difficult to fly in a wind so strong that it seeks to bring it  down.

AFRICA;    MORE OF ITS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PRETORIA SINCE IT  BEGAN DISMANTLING APARTHEID. DIPLOMATIC TIES, THOUGH, MAY HAVE TO WAIT.      By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NAIROBI, Kenya      Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in  Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement  to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship  carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years.    But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of  Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It  is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa.    It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the  complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as  they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a  post-apartheid era.    The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in  September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de  Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African  countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast.  South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those  it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved  opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar  President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds  from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal  air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa.    These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing  until last year.    In the period of black independence, the only African government that  maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose  autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that  despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries  are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it.    That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy  whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new  Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's  rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil  war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas.    But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still  far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa  balloon in many places.    In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of  apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress  during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on  Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time  Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African  gasoline.    ""As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater  respectability,"" says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of  foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, ""for us to take up our role as an  important African country.""    There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from  supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except  informally.    Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they  could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may  disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might  also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside  investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking  for new investment opportunities.    South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up  for sale in Madagascar.    The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a  region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many  businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency  licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries.    ""The potential is enormous,"" says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's  regional vice president for Africa. ""If this part of the world became  acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world  scale.""    A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, ""Any (African)  businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down  there"" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African  companies.    Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official  disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries,  who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing  South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants.    With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South  Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of  industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa.    ""The whole of this area will stop looking to London and start looking to  Johannesburg"" for imported goods, says one East African businessman.    These include anything from military hardware, necessarily an industrial  specialty of sanction-beset South Africa, to automobile assembly kits for  plants in Zimbabwe and Kenya and fruits and vegetables that grow better in  South Africa's temperate climate than in the tropical zone girdling the rest of  the continent. South African wines, barred by trade sanctions from European and  American shops, are world-class.    ""A lot of things that Ivoirians consider indispensable to their lives, like  scrunchy apples, salad greens that don't grow here and wine, are cheaper coming  from South Africa than from France,"" says one diplomat in Abidjan, the capital  of affluent Ivory Coast.    Accordingly, planning in many countries for post-apartheid relations with South  Africa has been going on for far longer than their governments admit.    Kenya Airways's preparation for flights to Johannesburg began as long as a year  ago, sources say. The airline's purchase of three Boeing 757 aircraft, to be  delivered in January, was predicated partly on its ability to use two of them  to service the new Johannesburg route.    The World Bank's Jaycox says that not only the group of so-called front-line  states in southern Africa, but also the African National Congress and the  Pan-African Congress, have asked his institution to draw up economic forecasts  based on a new relationship between black-ruled Africa and South Africa.    But whether South Africa will be able to export prosperity to its neighbors is  open to question. Although some analysts suggest that South African  manufacturers might open satellite plants in neighboring countries to take  advantage of their cheaper labor, others note that these businesses will be  under pressure to first raise black South Africa's standard of living by  creating more jobs at home, not abroad.    So South African industry might view black Africa largely as an untapped market  for its exports. The net result of increased South African involvement in  Africa's economy could be harmful competition from its better-equipped and more  efficient manufacturers and growers.    A major victim could be Zimbabwe, whose once-impressive industrial structure,  built during its own period of isolated white-minority rule in the 1960s and  1970s -- is falling apart from old age and the total absence of outside  investment during its 10 years of black-ruled independence.    ""Manufacturing in Zimbabwe will crash,"" says one businessman with extensive  experience in Africa, ""because they can't compete with the efficiencies down  south.""    For all that, South Africa's apparent interest in reuniting with the rest of  its continent is based on more than just economics. One of the enduring  self-images of the Afrikaners of South Africa is that they are a white African  ""tribe,"" a view that underscores the group's discomfort at being so politically  isolated.    ""Yes, I am an African,"" De Klerk said last month during his state visit to  Senegal. ""My family fought in the first war in Africa against colonialism (the  Boer War), and I don't want to go anywhere else in my life.""    But the road to genuine political and economic cooperation will be marked by  large potholes; most business leaders and politicians knowledgeable about  improving ties choose to speak off the record, for political animosity to the  South African regime remains potent in black-ruled Africa.    ""There's lots of exploration going on now, but lots of countries are  constrained because they want their policies and actions to remain in harmony  with black South Africans,"" says Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a prominent African  banker.    Anyone seeking a hint of the pitfalls still confronting South Africa's desire  to become a regional player needs look no farther than the Kenya-South Africa  airline agreement.    The arrangement was announced in Nairobi on Oct. 4, with twice-weekly flights  set to begin Saturday. Travel agents began booking South African tourists into  Kenyan lodges, and seats on the first flights from South Africa quickly filled  up. Then African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela passed through  Nairobi's airport Oct. 14 in transit. He called an airport press conference to  blast the Kenyan government for what amounted to prematurely lifting sanctions.    Eleven days later, Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi, presumably cognizant that  the ANC could be ruling South Africa some day soon, unilaterally suspended the  airline deal until South Africa ""dismantles"" apartheid.    Kenya Airways officials privately acknowledge that they or the government  should have informed the ANC well in advance of the impending deal, in the  hopes of defusing any opposition. Business leaders and others in Nairobi now  regard the affair as a damaging lost opportunity to secure South African  goodwill and trade concessions.    ""It would be good to be first into South Africa,"" says one leading East African  businessman. ""You certainly don't want to be last.""    The Weekly Review, Kenya's most authoritative news publication, estimated the  potential lost revenue for Kenya Airways at nearly $23 million a year.    Perhaps the sector with the most to lose is tourism. Kenyan travel agents  estimated that easing travel restrictions could bring as many as 200,000 South  Africans annually to Kenyan game parks and, even more inviting, its beach  resorts. That would make South Africa the biggest source of tourists in Kenya  and increase total visits, which in 1988 came to 680,000 and brought $400  million into the country, by nearly 30%.    Prospects for reinstating the flight agreement are unclear right now -- the  suspension has still not been publicly acknowledged in Johannesburg -- but  Kenyan travel professionals say the important thing is to establish the flights  in time to attract beachgoers during the South African winter, beginning in  April or May.    Across Africa, open links with South Africa will bring to the surface plenty of  activity that has been going on quietly for as long as South Africa has been a  political pariah.    Sub-Saharan Africa's covert trade with South Africa has always been the  continent's worst-kept secret. In even the remotest up-country shops in Ivory  Coast, for instance, it is possible to buy a can of Coca-Cola with the legend  ""Keep South Africa Tidy"" embossed on the top. The labels of some consumer goods  found on the shelves in Zimbabwe supermarkets are written in Afrikaans.    Other ties are more subtle. Every Friday, a new, generally full Zambia Airways  plane takes off from Johannesburg for Lusaka, Zambia, and then continues to New  York. Few passengers ever get on or off the flight in Lusaka, and it is  considered largely a Zambia-assisted subterfuge allowing South Africans to  evade an American ban on direct flights to the United States from Johannesburg.    Of the 10 countries in the so-called Southern African Development Coordination  Conference (SADCC), a band of staunch anti-apartheid South African neighbors,  only two -- Tanzania and Angola -- officially bar all South African goods.  About 30% of the SADCC countries' total imports came from South Africa in 1986,  the latest year for which statistics are available. The share of SADCC exports  going to South Africa, 7%, exceeds the 4% that represents trade among the  conference members themselves.    About 32% of all South Africa's manufacture exports go north to black-ruled  Africa, says Kent Durr, the South African minister of trade and industry, and  the figure is growing. The South African government contends that of the 51  member nations of the Organization of African Unity, only one, Libya, has no  economic link with South Africa whatsoever. But only 13 of those countries  acknowledge having any ties.    Ivory Coast is perhaps one of the best examples of how a country can maintain  informal partnerships with South Africa. The country's main airport at Abidjan  has for years been one of the few permitted refueling stops for South African  Airways planes on the way to Europe.    Ivory Coast might be one of South Africa's most important diplomatic catches  because President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is considered the doyen of African  leaders, particularly in the set of former French colonies in West Africa.    Houphouet has never been a strict observer of political and economic sanctions  against the apartheid regime. For instance, South African Foreign Minister  Roelof F. (Pik) Botha was among the honored guests in September at the  consecration of Houphouet's massive new Roman Catholic basilica by Pope John  Paul II.    But diplomats and other political observers believe that Houphouet's opening of  official ties with South Africa will be a signal to other African leaders that  it is safe to move ahead on trade and diplomatic ties.    ""Once Houphouet's done it,"" says a diplomatic observer in Abidjan, ""quite a few  others will come scurrying in his wake.""

AFRICA;    MORE OF ITS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PRETORIA SINCE IT  BEGAN DISMANTLING APARTHEID. DIPLOMATIC TIES, THOUGH, MAY HAVE TO WAIT.      By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NAIROBI, Kenya      Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in  Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement  to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship  carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years.    But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of  Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It  is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa.    It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the  complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as  they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a  post-apartheid era.    The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in  September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de  Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African  countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast.  South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those  it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved  opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar  President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds  from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal  air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa.    These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing  until last year.    In the period of black independence, the only African government that  maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose  autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that  despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries  are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it.    That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy  whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new  Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's  rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil  war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas.    But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still  far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa  balloon in many places.    In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of  apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress  during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on  Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time  Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African  gasoline.    ""As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater  respectability,"" says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of  foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, ""for us to take up our role as an  important African country.""    There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from  supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except  informally.    Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they  could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may  disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might  also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside  investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking  for new investment opportunities.    South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up  for sale in Madagascar.    The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a  region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many  businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency  licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries.    ""The potential is enormous,"" says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's  regional vice president for Africa. ""If this part of the world became  acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world  scale.""    A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, ""Any (African)  businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down  there"" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African  companies.    Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official  disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries,  who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing  South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants.    With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South  Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of  industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa.    ""The whole of this area will stop looking to London and start looking to  Johannesburg"" for imported goods, says one East African businessman.    These include anything from military hardware, necessarily an industrial  specialty of sanction-beset South Africa, to automobile assembly kits for  plants in Zimbabwe and Kenya and fruits and vegetables that grow better in  South Africa's temperate climate than in the tropical zone girdling the rest of  the continent. South African wines, barred by trade sanctions from European and  American shops, are world-class.    ""A lot of things that Ivoirians consider indispensable to their lives, like  scrunchy apples, salad greens that don't grow here and wine, are cheaper coming  from South Africa than from France,"" says one diplomat in Abidjan, the capital  of affluent Ivory Coast.    Accordingly, planning in many countries for post-apartheid relations with South  Africa has been going on for far longer than their governments admit.    Kenya Airways's preparation for flights to Johannesburg began as long as a year  ago, sources say. The airline's purchase of three Boeing 757 aircraft, to be  delivered in January, was predicated partly on its ability to use two of them  to service the new Johannesburg route.    The World Bank's Jaycox says that not only the group of so-called front-line  states in southern Africa, but also the African National Congress and the  Pan-African Congress, have asked his institution to draw up economic forecasts  based on a new relationship between black-ruled Africa and South Africa.    But whether South Africa will be able to export prosperity to its neighbors is  open to question. Although some analysts suggest that South African  manufacturers might open satellite plants in neighboring countries to take  advantage of their cheaper labor, others note that these businesses will be  under pressure to first raise black South Africa's standard of living by  creating more jobs at home, not abroad.    So South African industry might view black Africa largely as an untapped market  for its exports. The net result of increased South African involvement in  Africa's economy could be harmful competition from its better-equipped and more  efficient manufacturers and growers.    A major victim could be Zimbabwe, whose once-impressive industrial structure,  built during its own period of isolated white-minority rule in the 1960s and  1970s -- is falling apart from old age and the total absence of outside  investment during its 10 years of black-ruled independence.    ""Manufacturing in Zimbabwe will crash,"" says one businessman with extensive  experience in Africa, ""because they can't compete with the efficiencies down  south.""    For all that, South Africa's apparent interest in reuniting with the rest of  its continent is based on more than just economics. One of the enduring  self-images of the Afrikaners of South Africa is that they are a white African  ""tribe,"" a view that underscores the group's discomfort at being so politically  isolated.    ""Yes, I am an African,"" De Klerk said last month during his state visit to  Senegal. ""My family fought in the first war in Africa against colonialism (the  Boer War), and I don't want to go anywhere else in my life.""

In an interview in Tunis, where he is attending the  Organization of African Unity conference, Nzo confirmed that the  Cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian assistance in  Rwanda, but had not yet decided on the form it would take. The  decision, he said, might be influenced by proposals emanating  from the OAU conference, which might assign specific tasks to  certain member states. The Minister said the types of  assistance contemplated by South Africa included helping to ease  the burden imposed on Tanzania's resources by the influx of  thousands of refugees from Rwanda. This could include food and  medical aid.    While South Africa was not ready to contribute to any  international military force sent to enforce peace in Rwanda, it  would inevitably become involved in such operations in future  crises, he said. South Africa would, however, place much  greater emphasis on mediation, recognising that peace could not  be imposed from outside, as had been demonstrated in Somalia.    ""That would be the ideal -- for African countries themselves  to try to resolve their problems in an African way, which would  mean that mediators should come from African countries. We have  expert negotiators in our country who could very well be  deployed to assist in negotiations.""    Asked whether these negotiators might become involved in the  Angola dispute, Nzo said this might happen if the Angolans  wanted it. The recent upgrading of diplomatic relations between  South Africa and Angola enhanced the opportunity to discuss the  situation with Angolan government representatives. The contacts  would not be with the MPLA government alone, however. ""Unita  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] must not  be made to feel that sides are being taken because that could  produce an unfortunate result ...that would be  counter-productive.""    On the question of changing the nature and title of the  Frontline states now that confrontation with South Africa was no  longer necessary, Nzo said exchanges were taking place at the  OAU conference as a follow-up to the recent meeting of Frontline  leaders in Harare, where agreement was reached in principle to  the changes. Whatever body was set up in place of the Frontline  states would be structured to deal primarily with regional  co-operation on security matters. He believed that while the  grouping should still be confined to southern African countries,  it should be enlarged to bring in states like Swaziland and  Lesotho.    He said no policy had yet been worked out by the Government  on membership of or relations with the existing regional  economic groupings: the Southern African Customs Union, the  Southern African Development Community and the Preferential  Tariff Agreement grouping.    Expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome given to  South Africa at its first OAU conference, Nzo said he saw this  not as a honeymoon that would fade but as a beginning that had  to be consolidated. He rejected any concept of South Africa  inevitably dominating its neighbours. ""There must be relations  of mutual benefit all the time. We want from the beginning to  have relations based on trust, on total friendship.""    Nzo confirmed that President Mandela would visit Morocco on  his way to Tunisia for the OAU summit next week. The purpose  was to complete talks that could not be finalised during his  previous Moroccan visit.     "

During the talks, Meles told the Chinese guest that Ethiopia  pursues a policy of good-neighborliness.    Qian expressed appreciation of the efforts Ethiopia has made  for the settlement of the Somali crisis and the maintenance of  regional peace and stability.    He said the Chinese Government is greatly concerned over the  Somali problem and holds its final settlement is up to the  Somali people.    Africa is facing a complex situation, the Chinese  vice-premier said, adding two tendencies -- neglect Africa or  interfere in Africa's internal affairs -- should be prevented.    The international community should show concern over Africa,  help Africa, he stressed, saying if the political situation in  Africa is unstable and its economy continues worsening, peace  and development in the world cannot be truly achieved.    Qian said China has always been attaching an importance to  strengthening its relations with african countries.    ""China is a developing country with a limited strength, but  we always cherish a stand on Africa. That is not to neglect the  problems appearing in Africa and at the same time respect the  will of the African people,"" he added.    The two leaders also discussed the way of further  strengthening and developing bilateral relations, with Meles  saying Ethiopia welcomes Chinese businessmen to invest and  create enterprises in Ethiopia.    Qian promised the Chinese Government will encourage Chinese  businessmen to enhance exchange of contacts and cooperation with  their Ethiopian counterparts.    On the same occasion, Qian conveyed the greetings of Chinese  president Jiang Zemin to Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi.

The ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Council session,  adopted a whole series of measures intended to offer support to  the new government that will emerge from the elections on 26 and  28 April 1994. The promise of aid to South Africa is a  Community action falling under the heading of European foreign  policy.    From the outset, however, the EU specified that respect for  human rights and democracy were an essential element of  relations between the EU and South Africa.    First of all, the Twelve promise to work toward canceling UN  sanctions against Pretoria, which are still being imposed.    The current support program for the peaceful transition to  democracy in South Africa is continuing provisionally, and the  Union must continue to earmark the funds required for this  action, maintained the ministers. They recalled that they  intend to contribute mainly toward improving the standard of  living of the poorest sectors of the population.    As for long-term relations, the Twelve emphasized that they  do not consider South Africa as a developing country, but that  they are inclined to allow it to benefit from the same  commercial advantages as such countries. They also promised to  contribute toward the establishment and development of regional  cooperation between southeast African and Indian Ocean  countries. The EU is calling for mutual investments, encouraged  and guaranteed by various agreements. To this end, it will ask  the EIB (European Investment Bank) to extend its activities to  South Africa.    The Twelve said they were ready to collaborate in a large  number of areas, such as education and training, industry,  trade, telecommunications, research, and technology.    As soon as the new government takes office, the EU intends  to  support the establishment of political dialogue and encourage  the South African cabinet to work toward social justice and to  eliminate all forms of racial, political, religious, and  cultural discrimination.    The Twelve also confirmed that they wanted to hold an  international conference on 6 and 7 September 1994 in Berlin,  gathering together all the countries of southern Africa.     "

The federal cabinet decided to end the 19-year-old ban and  has instructed public and private institutions that obstacles no  longer existed for dealing with South Africa, they sa?d.    Diplomats said the cabinet decision to end the boyco?t would  pave the way for establishment of diplomatic ties between the  UAE and South Africa.    The Dubai-based daily AL-BAYAN said the cabinet decision  cancelled a 1975 federal law banning any form of dealing with  South Africa because of its former system of apartheid.    The decision coincides with Pretoria's attempts to enter the  Gulf market, which is dominated by Japan, western countries and  other industrial powers.    South Africa's drive has already produced results. Its trade  with the UAE surged to around 150 million dirhams (40.8 million  dollars) in 1993 from less than 20 million dirhams (5.4 million  dollars) in 1992.    Officials from both sides expect trade to grow steadily in  coming years given their large business potential.    ""South Africa enjoys great economic and trade potentials,""  the director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  'Abd-al- Rahman al-Mutaywi, said after returning Saturday from a  business trip to Johannesburg.    He said South Africa planned another major trade exhibition  in Dubai in May following the success of its first Middle East  fair in 1992.    Officials said South Africa was still planning to open a  commercial office in the United Arab Emirate of Dubayy to boost  exports to Iran and the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,  Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE.    South Africa is also aiming at the region's growing arms  market and has participated in two international defence shows  in the UAE.     "

By SHARON BERNSTEIN      Claiming that the series ""South Africa Now"" is biased in favor of the African  National Congress, programmers at Los Angeles public-television station KCET  have decided not to carry the public-affairs program when its new season begins  in November.    The Committee on Media Integrity, a conservative media coalition, claimed  victory Friday for the decision. The group, led by David Horowitz, a former  Ramparts magazine editor who went on to co-author the book ""Destructive  Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s,"" has been waging a letter-writing  campaign and threatening legal action against KCET Channel 28 for airing ""South  Africa Now"" and other programs that it claims have a leftist bias.

""I felt that the show was posing as a news report, but it was really just doing  propaganda,"" Horowitz said.    Kulczycki denied Friday that pressure from Horowitz's group had anything to do  with his decision not to renew the series, which has been running on Sundays at  9 a.m. He said that ""South Africa Now,"" which is produced in New York by  Globalvision Inc. and is seen on 80 U.S. public-TV stations, gives only cursory  attention to views of liberal whites and blacks, as well as to the South  African government and others who differ with the policies of the African  National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela.    ""As time has gone by, it appears more clear that the main issue in South Africa  is not whether there will be apartheid, but what kind of anti-apartheid  government in South Africa would come into power,"" Kulczycki said. ""When it  ('South Africa Now') was an advocacy program and the only issue was apartheid,  that was something many people were willing to accept. But in recent weeks and  months, the story has become more complicated and the producers don't seem to  want to present a broad spectrum of views.""    Kulczycki said that KCET was planning to run a number of specials about South  Africa, which would present all sides of the issues there. And he said that if  Globalvision were to produce specials instead of a series, he would consider  them ""on a case-by-case basis.""

Direct investment in  South Africa has stagnated at around 2 billion German marks [DM]  since 1989. Martin Kraemer, manager of the Africa Association,  is content if German investors are able to keep their position  at all. Well-established companies, such as Bayer, BMW,  Hoechst, Mercedes, Siemens, or Volkswagen might manage a smooth  transition to the time after the elections. Yet, as many as 300  German companies, that is about half of all German investors in  Africa, are represented in South Africa, employing a total of  36,000 staff.    According to the Africa Association, the fact that German  exporters could maintain their business with the continent's  most important trading partner ""in spite of the reform process""  is a success. While German exports stagnated at DM3.27 billion,  German imports from South Africa declined by 18 percent, to  DM1.95 billion, last year. After sanctions were lifted, South  Africa increased its exports of gold, copper, manganese, and  other ores to the Far East, East Europe, and the Middle East.    The Federal Government, which will hold the European Union  [EU] presidency in the second half of 1994, is skeptical about  African National Congress politicians' attempts to join the Lome  Agreement with the EU. The accession process is too lengthy,  and the system for stabilizing raw materials prices would not  cope very well with the membership of raw-materials supplier  South Africa, Christian Democratic Party development expert  Volkmar Koehler said at the African Economic Day in Hamburg.  Also, membership of the threshold country would lower the  amount of aid for the total 69 poor countries in Africa, the  Caribbean, and the Pacific area (ACP). Not only would all ACP  and EU countries have to agree to membership, but it is also  doubtful whether South Africa would meet the criteria of a  developing country.     "

AFRICAN IMAGE GAINS FROM NAMIBIA REBELS' MISSTEP      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South African military intelligence detected a buildup of rebel forces across  the Namibian border with Angola back in January. South Africans monitored  guerrilla meetings, saw the arrival of fresh uniforms and heard talk of an  invasion to ""finally chase the Boers out.""    But when South African officials complained to the world, as they often do, few  believed them.    Just as South Africa had warned, though, the guerrilla buildup developed into a  major cross-border incursion by the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), beginning only hours after a U.N. independence plan went into effect  April 1.    SWAPO's violation of the peace accord shook the world's high regard for the  liberation movement. But, at the same time, it gave South Africa -- often  considered the chief destabilizing influence in southern Africa -- a rare  moment on the diplomatic high ground.    Long accustomed to international scorn, South Africa's white minority-led  government suddenly has found itself in the world's good graces. SWAPO, with  U.N. support, had battled for 24 years to end South African rule of this  territory, sometimes called South-West Africa. But, literally overnight, South  Africa's troops were fighting SWAPO with U.N. blessing. And, after some initial  skepticism, the United Nations and Western governments that are often critical  of South Africa began believing Pretoria's version of events here.    South African officials, in a smug, I-told-you-so mood, have jetted in and out  of Windhoek, capital of this vast territory, to bask in their new credibility.  Even though the fighting has diminished and SWAPO insurgents are said to be  crossing northward back to their refuge in Angola, South Africa has yet to tire  of reminding foreign journalists that South Africa abided by its agreement to  follow the U.N. plan for Namibian independence while SWAPO did not.    ""There is not a responsible government in the world today that does not know  exactly whatSWAPO has done,"" South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. (Pik)  Botha, said recently. ""We wish it had never occurred. If the result is that  SWAPO's leadership pays a heavy price for it, that was not of our doing.""    Any threat to SWAPO's image is welcome in Pretoria, where the country that has  governed Namibia for 74 years fears that a Marxist SWAPO government will come  to power in November's U.N.-monitored elections. Despite widespread  condemnation of SWAPO's invasion, the insurgent movement remains the probable  winner of Namibia's first free and fair elections.    SWAPO's political opponents, chief among them the multiracial, capitalistic  Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), have taken to the streets with a  well-funded campaign to discredit SWAPO.    Several hundred black Namibians wearing alliance T-shirts turned up this week  at a South African military base in the northern Namibia city of Oshakati --  SWAPO's political power base -- to protest the incursions.    The alliance supporters carried signs reading ""Don't Sabotage 435,"" referring  to the U.N. independence plan for Namibia, and ""SWAPO -- Don't Kill the Peace.""    Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's president, ""failed hopelessly in his attempt to take over  Namibia by force,"" said Barney Barnes, head of a small political party that  merged with Democratic Turnhalle this week. ""In the process, he annoyed the  whole international community.""      A Shifting Story    Nujoma first said his forces were already inside northern Namibia before the  peace process began, but few world leaders believed him. Later, Nujoma  acknowledged that some of his rebel forces did cross the border, but only to  turn themselves over to the U.N. peacekeeping troops. Now Nujoma has accused  South Africa of hiding its advance knowledge of the infiltration in order to  justify an attack on SWAPO and have an excuse to back out of the independence  process.    Many international leaders not accustomed to siding with South Africa admit  that they agree with Botha. And even SWAPO's most ardent supporters in Africa  have criticized Nujoma.    Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has provided sanctuary for the  rebels, said his country ""regrets that the SWAPO leadership could not exercise  total control over its guerrillas at the critical moment.""    Botha goes much further. ""I don't see how the SWAPO leadership could have been  so stupid,"" the foreign minister told viewers of state-run television recently.    But the insurgents' support among Namibians remains strong. Several thousand  SWAPO supporters turned out Sunday in a black township near Windhoek for a  memorial service for guerrillas killed in 10 days of conflict. The service was  for the 38 fighters that SWAPO says were killed, but Namibian security forces  say more than 275 guerrillas have actually died in the battles.    ""We are here to pay tribute to heroic Namibians who have lost their lives in  the north of our land,"" the Rev. Jackie Basson told the mourners. ""The  independence we have been fighting for for years is being threatened by  unprovoked attacks by South Africa.""    Botha has lately suggested that SWAPO's actions have made South Africa less  willing to negotiate with other liberation movements, such as the outlawed  African National Congress, the principal liberation movement in South Africa.    ""We have no more illusions,"" Botha said. ""This perfidy by SWAPO has dealt the  good and positive prospects of negotiation politics a blow. One doesn't know  anymore who one can believe.""    For all its newly charged rhetoric, though, South Africa has passed up several  opportunities to scuttle the peace process here.

The EU's Ministerial Council of Foreign Affairs said in a  statement: ""The Union intends to send a strong political signal  to the incoming government and to the South African population.""    The Council agreed in principle to include South Africa in  its general system of preferences (GSP) comprising low tariffs  on manufactured imports from developing countries.    The decision was the centrepiece of proposals for the rapid  deepening of economic and political relations with South Africa  pending the negotiation of a comprehensive new system of  political, trade and economic links.    A formal decision on the GSP issue is expected following the  EU's 10-year review of its GSP system in May, and consultations  with other developing countries linked to the EU in the Lome  trade-and-aid agreement.    The EU also agreed in principle to extend its ""rules of  origin"" to South Africa, which means that South African  components of goods partly manufactured in other countries of  the region would also benefit from low tariffs.    And the Council agreed to pursue schemes for promoting and  protecting foreign investments in South Africa, and to boost  cooperation in such areas as education, industry,  telecommunications, science and technology.    ""We want South Africa to become a motor of economic growth  in  southern Africa,"" an EU spokesman said, adding that the GSP  break would boost South African exports of manufactured and  high-tech goods.    The EU is South Africa's biggest trading partner, but most  of  its imports of South African products currently comprise raw  materials.    Trade between the two sides totalled ECU10.8 billion (12  billion dollars) over the first nine months of 1993, resulting  in a trade surplus of ECU2.59 billion (2.95 billion dollars) for  the EU.    The EU has already dismantled all economic sanctions against  South Africa, and Tuesday's decision is the first element of a  new era of EU-South African links to replace the frosty  relations of the apartheid years.    The EU Council also proposed to open negotiations for a  strong interim agreement with the new South African government  soon after the elections, linking comprehensive cooperation with  respect for democracy and human rights.    And it agreed to use its influence at the United Nations to  have lifted the last remaining sanctions against South Africa --  an embargo on arms sales and military cooperation.     "

He's on the third day of a week-long visit to the  country, and after the talks the South African Foreign Affairs  Minister Pik Botha stressed that the country must not become a  new headache for the rest of Africa.    [Begin recording] [Botha] I would urge all South Africans to  take note of the importance that Mr. Salim is attaching to this  country. He has come here. He's a man with great problems  himself that he must face in Africa, and he's come here with a  top delegation because of his interest in us, because of the  contribution that he wants to make to resolve our internal  problems amongst the parties. And it is against this background  that we have had a thorough exchange of the problems facing us,  and I can say that I'm impressed with his objective and clinical  analysis of the situation as he sees it.    [Salim] We think that it is very important for the leaders  of  South Africa and for the people of South Africa to look and  prepare beyond the coming elections. We want to see a strong  South Africa. We want to see South Africa as being one of the  key parts in the resolution of African problems -- not to be a  focus of Africa's attention in resolving South African problems.  We have had very, very useful, very extensive discussions with  the minister. We have known each other for a long time. Those  were difficult days, but it's such refreshing and such rewarding  to come and discuss in an atmosphere of understanding, of  concord, of almost identity of use on some or almost all the  major issues that face our continent, and also that face South  Africa.

The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to  supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for  the announcement of the results of the South African elections,  in order on that basis to organize relations with the next  government in Pretoria.    Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349  [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at  that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in  Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations  between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90  percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran.  Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National  Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in  South Africa. In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed  based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its  oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such  that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares  to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and  prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African  elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian  Government can resume its relations with this country.    These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian  regime's  oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa  made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner  after Israel.    The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa  cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium.  Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the  two countries were active importing and exporting and selling  Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.     "

In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed  based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its  oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such  that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares  to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and  prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African  elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian  Government can resume its relations with this country.    These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian  regime's  oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa  made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner  after Israel.    The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa  cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium.  Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the  two countries were active importing and exporting and selling  Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.     "

0,FT941-15081 ,"FT941-15081 _AN-EAQCKAEGFT 940117   FT  17 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets This Week: A growing trend towards Africa - The Emerging Investor      By PHILIP GAWITH   Will 1994 be Africa's year, the year in which international investors finally get the 'virgin' continent into their sights? Certainly there is a growing body of opinion, both in Africa and beyond, that believes this will be the case. Indeed, it can be argued that this trend is already under way. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange foreigners were prominent throughout 1993, initially in the gold and bond markets and later as buyers of industrial stocks too. Figures supplied by Barings Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthening in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. They have also been evident in Botswana, while foreign buying on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange between late June and December was enough to cause the Industrial index to more than double. Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Management, the London-based adviser to many of the world's largest emerging market funds, is one who believes that the continent's time has come. 'Looking at Africa is very much at the top of their (emerging market funds) agenda. There is a terrific willingness to believe in the African story.' This can be traced to three important structural changes. Clearly the catalytic event has been South Africa's rehabilitation as a respectable investment destination. This has caused great excitement in the US and the re-examination of the JSE has inevitably rebounded to the benefit of other regional markets. Without the JSE, it would be doubtful how much attention emerging market investors would devote to the other markets. Since Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, called for an end to financial sanctions against South Africa in September, there has been a veritable stampede of US visitors to Johannesburg. Significant investment flows have followed and the outlook for 1994 appears even more cheery. Mr Morland reckons that the first half of 1994 will see at least five South Africa or Southern Africa funds launched. Taken together with other African funds and country funds, he believes there will be at least 10 funds channelling money into South Africa next year. The second important change concerns Africa itself. If the 1960s saw the political winds of change blow through the continent, then the 1990s are witnessing some equivalent economic changes as governments increasingly embrace market economics after costly socialist experiments. The catalyst for these changes has been the end of the cold war, meaning no more eastern European bloc hand-outs, and the inexorable impoverishment of African economies through deteriorating terms of trade and poor economic management. Now, as Mr Morland comments, 'You either eat at the IMF's table, or you don't eat at all.' This has led to a huge shift in economic orientation, including a more favourable outlook towards equity markets. In 1983, for example, Mr Bernard Chidzero, the Zimbabwe finance minister, was able to extravagantly denounce the ZSE as 'the prostitute of the economy'. Ten years later the same Mr Chidzero used his budget to introduce reforms aimed at encouraging the development of the ZSE: foreign investors being allowed to buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE; reductions in capital gains tax on share market investment to 10 per cent from 30 per cent and the withholding tax on dividends declared by quoted companies to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. The final change concerns the burgeoning emerging market movement, particularly in the US, with an increasing portion of assets earmarked for emerging markets and offshore investment. A November survey by the US firm Kleiman International Consultants found that international institutional investment in emerging markets had risen by 3 per cent to 13 per cent of international funds in 1993, with allocation over the past five years rising more than five-fold. Even within this trend, Africa has a lot of catching up to do. A recent survey by Micropal of global emerging market funds found that the 54 largest of these funds had invested only about Dollars 40m out of Dollars 11.5bn (0.35 per cent). Clearly, if Africa in general and South Africa in particular becomes a focus for emerging market funds, then this in itself will be good reason to be invested there. To this rosy scenario, however, some cautionary caveats about Africa must be entered. Firstly, even by emerging market standards, Africa is an unusual beast. On the one hand, the JSE with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 105bn is much larger than the Dollars 20-Dollars 60bn average for emerging markets. On the other hand, most of the other African markets - Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe (with Zambia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania all on the point of opening) - are minuscule. A recent survey by Mr Michel ZhuParris of Morgan Stanley Asset Management found that between them Africa's newly emerging markets had only 12 liquid stocks with market capitalisations greater than Dollars 100m (with seven of these trading in Morocco). Second, although Africa is fairly cheap compared with many world markets, it has been cheap for a long time and for good reason. A major factor here is that investors are, with the exception of the Botswana pula, investing in very weak, devaluing currencies. Another problem is that the markets are shallow, illiquid and small. Also, in some cases, not the JSE, there is a dearth of domestic investors to piggyback on which can cause liquidity problems. Mr Mark Tunmer, chairman of the ZSE, comments: 'Our big problem is that we've got all the demand but nothing to sell.' He reckons that if the ZSE had been able to satisfy demand, foreign flows would have been four to five times larger. This problem has also affected the JSE, where buyers have had to get used to the idea that fulfilling a big order can take more than a week. These liquidity problems should, however, ease over time. If markets do enjoy a bull run this will stimulate new issues and rights issues, thereby increasing the amount of stock in circulation. A further factor to consider is that African markets are much more dependent on commodity prices and politicians than many other emerging markets. Investors not fully aware of developments could well burn their fingers. On the commodity front, developments are good. Important commodities like gold, cocoa and coffee have broken out of long bear cycles. The politicians may be behaving better, but in some cases the depth of commitment to financial discipline and good government remains to be tested. In the final analysis, what happens in South Africa will probably determine the extent to which other regional markets flourish.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Friday      Week on week change Stock                    Country      close          Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)     Brazil       0.02           0.01     67.6 Eczacibasi Ilac           Turkey       1.11           0.38     53.2 Kordosa                   Turkey       0.98           0.32     49.3 Banco Itau (Pfd)          Brazil       0.30           0.09     47.4 Alarko Holding            Turkey       2.44           0.76     45.4 Eczacibasi Yatirim        Turkey       0.95           0.26     38.9 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)      Brazil       0.02           0.01     36.9 Arcelik                   Turkey       1.90           0.42     28.4 Turk Demir Dokum          Turkey       1.52           0.29     23.3 Brisa                     Turkey       2.22           0.41     22.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

[Begin Robaina recording] (?The fact that) it is a meeting  with the continent that most contributes a presence of  supporting votes in whatever international battle Cuba wages, I  think also gives it special significance.

0,FT932-3836 ,"FT932-3836 _AN-DFKB5AG5FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (7): A crash course in running the country - Andrew Gowers finds it easier to predict what an ANC government is not likely to do to the economy      By ANDREW GOWERS   SELDOM can a liberation movement have been through such a fundamental political learning process as the African National Congress has undergone in the three years since Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Seldom can an opposition party have shed so much ideological baggage or been so confronted with the limits of its power before taking office - and in no area more than that of economic policy. Not surprisingly in the circumstances, it is easier to predict what an ANC-dominated government is not likely to do to the economy than what its economic priorities will be. To judge by the policy guidelines adopted a year ago and somewhat wishfully entitled Ready to Govern, wholesale nationalisation of the big private-sector business groups - centrepiece of ANC strategy in socialist exile - is out. So, in the light of the state of the government budget, is a drastic expansion in public spending. What remains may look perilously - or pleasantly, depending on your point of view  -like more of the same. A European investor with social democratic sympathies would have difficulty taking exception to the sentiments expressed in Ready to Govern: a mixed economy, redistribution, social partnership involving business and trade unions, sustainable growth - the whole guided by case-by-case pragmatism rather than doctrine. But he or she would also be hard-pressed to discern a distilled economic programme in which choices have been made, options costed and priorities set. The men who run the ANC's economics department are not much more enlightening. Mr Trevor Manuel, economic policy supremo, sketches out eight main areas which the organisation is studying - industrial strategy, trade and foreign investment policy, anti-trust laws, 'special treatment' for the financial sector, land reform, the government budget, monetary affairs and regional economic policy - but is vague on the details. Even on the central issue of the role of the state in the economy, the ANC has left its options wide open. Its document says that a future democratic South Africa will consider: Increasing the public sector in strategic areas through, for example, nationalisation . . . ; Reducing the public sector in certain areas in ways that will enhance efficiency, advance affirmative action and empower the historically disadvantaged . . . Such hedging is not difficult to explain. For as Mr Derek Keys, the finance minister, has relentlessly reminded the ANC and all his other audiences over the past year, the next South African government will in large part be confronted with the same economic constraints as bedevil the present one: static or negative growth, sluggish investment, a bloated and inefficient civil service, an external account squeezed by debt service payments, and the struggle against inflation. What is more, ANC policy-makers know full well that their only chance of breaking out of this vicious circle lies in re-establishing economic confidence, and for this they need to reassure both South Africa's powerful business community and the international financial institutions, whose approval will be vital in reintegrating the country into the world economy after years of sanctions and isolation. If one places these prerequisites alongside the pressures for tangible change - for example in jobs, housing and basic social services - on which the ANC is riding to power, the scale of the challenge becomes dauntingly obvious. Mr Tito Mboweni, chief economist, acknowledges that the international investment community is already uppermost in the ANC leadership's mind. Once a multi-party transitional executive council to oversee elections is in place, or before, the organisation will call for the lifting of international sanctions, and for the opening of formal relations between South Africa and the IMF and World Bank. 'We want their overall stamp of approval,' Mr Mboweni says, 'the kind of working relationship that will send a signal to private investors that we are pursuing policies that are not unsustainable.' This need above all underlies the cautious noises emanating from Shell House  -the ANC's headquarters - about fiscal policy. Mr Manuel insists that an ANC-dominated government will not seek a dramatic expansion in the overall budget, but will try to secure elbow-room to develop its own spending programmes through improving efficiency and trimming in other areas. 'If we say that there isn't much room for manoeuvre in the budget in its present form, we're being defeatist,' he says. 'But we're not talking about throwing money at the problem.' Even if savings on the scale Mr Manuel envisages are obtainable, however, he admits that the pressures for increased spending are potentially overwhelming. 'There is a clamour,' he says. 'People want to know how the quality of their life will improve after an election. So we have to build a consensus in the areas where we can affect the maximum tangible change in the shortest possible time.' Such quick fixes will be hard to identify. So will effective measures to deal with what the ANC believes to be the central structural problem of the South African economy: the concentration of power in the hands of a few large white-owned conglomerates. 'The ANC is not opposed to large firms as such,' says Ready to Govern. 'However, it will introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies in accordance with international norms and practices, to curb monopolies, continued domination of the economy by a minority within the white minority, and to promote greater efficiency in the private sector.' Mr Manuel says his organisation has been working on such a policy with experts from the US, the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission. But details have yet to emerge, and some leading businessmen suspect this exercise is merely an elegant way of disguising the retreat from nationalisation. Indeed, perhaps the best indication of the distance ANC economic policy has travelled in the past three years is the relatively relaxed attitude towards a future power-sharing government on the part of the business community. Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries, the country's largest consumer goods producer, expresses a view widespread among English-speaking businessmen when he says: 'We've not had good economic management in this country for 45 years of National party rule, so I'm not frightened by the prospect of a new government.' Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the former chairman of the Anglo-American/De Beers group and doyen of South African business, agrees: 'Certainly, I think this will be a government with which businesspeople can work comfortably. We've had a good deal of experience working with very, very difficult governments in Africa - a great deal more difficult than I think this one is likely to be.' A leading banker adds: 'Internationally, there is now an accepted code of economic conduct that is conducive to growth. I have no reason to believe that the new leadership will not adhere to that.' In all this, there is perhaps more than a little complacency, derived from the general expectation that the ANC will be slower in wielding real power than in assuming office, and from the strong hope that for the first few years at least someone like Mr Keys will retain a hand on the economic levers. The demands and expectations surrounding a new government, however, may mean that such confidence turns out to be misplaced, at least in the longer term. However sincere the ANC may be in vowing to subject itself to the disciplines of international capital, however vehemently it preaches the need for sustainable economic growth as well as redistribution, it will also face enormous pressure from its constituents to deliver once in power. The trade unions will want a say in industrial restructuring; their members will complain about the slow pace of black economic advancement or about uneven access to capital; the masses will cry out for government spending on expensive programmes such as township electrification. It would not be surprising if at some point the ANC and its only half-reconstructed allies in the South African Communist Party felt the urge to intervene more radically in the economy than its present reassurances suggest.

Mr. Reilly explained that as South Africa has the largest  population of the most productive ostriches left in Africa, it  has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted  overseas, in order to conserve and build up South Africa's  ostrich population. The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has  been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting  and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the  birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for  ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and  racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry.    Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be  used  in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well  as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa.  He said he had therefore agreed to assist the South African  Police in their investigations concerning ostrich flocks in  Namibia and a certain ostrich farm in Swaziland, currently  engaged in exporting ostriches to overseas markets.

Delivering a speech at the reception, CPAFFC President Qi  Huaiyuan said that the birth of new South Africa will usher in a  new era of national unity, social stability and economic  development and prosperity.    He stressed that Chinese people value very much their  friendship with South African counterparts.    In recent years, Qi said, the exchange of visits between the  people of the two countries from all walks of life has been  increasing. ""The exchanges between the two sides in the fields  of economy, trade and culture have grown steadily and mutual  understanding and friendship between the two peoples have kept  increasing,"" he added.    He expressed the belief that with the birth of new South  Africa, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and  South Africa, established on the basis of the five principles of  peaceful co-existence, will achieve further development.    L. B. Labuschagne, director of the South African Center for  Chinese Studies, also spoke at the reception.    Among those present on the occasion were Chinese  Vice-Foreign  Minister Tian Zengpei and diplomatic envoys of African countries  to China.     "

On the eve of his departure from Port Louis,  Qian Qichan discussed the situation in Africa and China's  African policy in an interview with XINHUA reporters.    Qian Qichen said: During the current African tour, he has  been deeply impressed by the African people's new sense of  awakening sparked by drastic changes in the international  situation. Many African countries, while seeking economic  development, have focused their attention on safeguarding  national stability and at the same time, strengthened regional  cooperation. Noting the establishment of security mechanisms by  OAU and the breakthrough achieved in peace in South Africa, he  pointed out that the struggle against foreign intervention and  for national independence and sovereignty is making headway. In  short, Africa is facing challenges as well as historic  opportunities and is not without hopes, he added.    He said: Under the new situation brought about by the end of  the Cold War, regions are interrelated in their endeavor for  peace and various countries have become more and more  interdependent on each other in economy. World peace is  inseparable from Africa's stability; and an underdeveloped  African economy is not conducive to the global economic  prosperity. For this reason, the international community should  show concern for Africa, and the developed nations are  duty-bound to help the African countries. Africa needs  attention, not indifference; it needs help, not intervention.    Discussing China's African policy, Qian Qichen emphasized:  To strengthen unity and cooperation with the African and other  developing countries is the basis of China's foreign policy.  China shares much common ground with the African countries as  far as the international and regional situations are concerned.  China wholly respects the social system and development mode  chosen by the African countries in light of their national  conditions, and firmly supports the African countries' struggle  to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. We support  the African countries' efforts to ensure internal unity, to  develop economy, and to improve the people's livelihood; and we  also support the series of rational proposals by African  countries for reducing and exempting debts, protecting economic  interests, and strengthening South-South cooperation and  South-North dialogue.    On China's economic and trade relations with African, Qian  Qichen said: China's economic cooperation with the African  countries symbolizes the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance  and common development. He added that although China's  assistance to African countries is limited, it is sincere and  without any political strings attached.    He pointed out: Amidst constant changes in the international  and African scenes, the friendship between China and Africa has  withstood tests of history and become more solid. China will  never forget Africa's profound sentiments of friendship in times  of needs. He reiterated that regardless of changes in the  international and African situations, China will never alter its  principle of developing unity and cooperation with the African  countries. We deeply believe that our friendship with Africa  will definitely continue to grow and strengthen in the days and  years to come; and the lasting, stable, and mutually  beneficially friendship and cooperation between China and Africa  will further solidify and develop.

As he was leaving  for South Africa to take part in the inauguration ceremony,  Buwayz clarified that Lebanon's relations with this country have  been normal and natural since it eliminated racism. However,  the application of this decision requires some time. We have  this report from our colleague Darwish 'Ammar from Beirut  airport:    [Begin recording] ['Ammar] Mr. Buwayz, you leave today for  South Africa to take part in President Nelson Mandela's  inauguration ceremony. What would you like to say on this  occasion with regard to Lebanon's participation in this ceremony?    [Buwayz] Of course, the election and inauguration of  President Mandela after the historic reforms in South Africa are  considered an international, nay, even historic event. This is  so because of the developments that have taken place there and  also because of the effects of this development on the political  and humanitarian level. By this I mean the cancellation of  racial discrimination and openness toward democracy and freedom.  There is no doubt that Lebanon should not stay away from this  event. It should not be kept away from the significance of this  event, both from the aspect of democracy, freedom, and  coexistence, and from the aspect of the extensive historic and  ancient Lebanese presence in South Africa, where there is a  large Lebanese community.    Proceeding from this, the visit on this occasion acquires a  special character. Therefore, Lebanon had to attend this  international celebration.    ['Ammar] When will the Arab League's resolution on ending  the boycott of South Africa come into effect in Lebanon?    [Buwayz] The resolution to cancel the boycott is a decision  that was made in the Arab League during the last session over a  month ago. The Lebanese Council of Ministers applied this  resolution in the session before last by canceling all aspects  of the political, economic, and trade boycott. Thus, relations  now between Lebanon and South Africa are natural and very normal.    ['Ammar] Will there be diplomatic representation between the  two countries?    [Buwayz] We now have a general consulate there. We have  made the decision to normalize diplomatic relations. Of course,  the implementation of this decision requires some material and  financial support which might not be available immediately.    ['Ammar] On the sidelines of the visit to South Africa, will  you hold meetings with the participants in the inauguration  ceremony such as representatives of various countries taking  part in the ceremony?    [Buwayz] As with every international meeting of this  caliber, the celebration will include a large number of heads of  state, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. This event might  provide the opportunity for side meetings with some officials.    ['Ammar] During your stopover in Paris, will you hold talks  and meetings in the French capital?    [Buwayz] No. Our stopover in Paris is purely mechanical.    ['Ammar] Mr. Minister, there are some rumors about a  possibility of your visiting the United States. Will you be  going to the United States?    [Buwayz] I was supposed to visit Florida in response to an  invitation from the University of Florida to deliver a lecture  on Lebanon and the peace process here. However, some events  have made me change my plans. It has been postponed to an as  yet unspecified date. [end recording]     "

In fairness, the desultory record of the African nations has been matched by  the African policies of the Western democracies, including the United States.  Washington was the driving force behind an economic reform program developed in  the U.N. General Assembly. More than 20 nations adopted the new programs,  usually at great political cost, only to discover that the Americans had  decided not to provide the aid that had been promised as a reward for the  reforms. Congress found it cheaper to impose sanctions on South Africa than to  provide adequate development assistance to struggling nations. Nor has  nation-building been easy in the wake of colonialism.

If Pretoria succeeds in its struggle for a peaceful transition to democracy, it  will be a model for the people of Africa as striking, tempting and attractive  as anything that has happened recently in Eastern Europe.

0,FT943-811 ,"FT943-811 _AN-EI0DNAGJFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (1): Tiger in the making - Successful as a manufacturing base, Mauritius needs to develop new skills and a stronger service sector      By TONY HAWKINS and MICHAEL HOLMAN   Within a generation, Mauritius has gone from gloom to boom. Some thirty years ago an eminent economist warned that the Indian Ocean island faced 'ultimate catastrophe' unless its rate of population growth was checked. Today Mauritius prospers. Once a sugar mono economy, beset with high unemployment and rampant inflation, it has developed a thriving, labour-intensive, industrial sector, heavily reliant on clothing exports, and a highly successful tourist business, while a start to the development of offshore financial services has been made. Population has stabilised at 1.1m, unemployment is negigible, and per capita income has doubled in 13 years. It should be a role model for Africa; instead it is leaving the mainland trailing in its wake. Ethnically, politically, culturally, and especially economically, Mauritius is not part of Africa. Attitudes could scarcely be more different: contrast Mauritian industry minister, Jean-Claud L'Estrac, extolling the virtues of foreign expertise, skills and investment, with the suspicion of expatriates displayed in so many parts of the continent. While Mauritius is anxious to be part of Africa - much store, especially from a marketing viewpoint, is laid on its membership of the Preferential Trade Area of East and Southern Africa (PTA), and it is negotiating entry to the (overlapping) Southern African Development Community - the island is far more outward-looking, in economic policy as well as in political attitudes, than its African counterparts. Today Mauritius is closer to newly industrialising country (NIC) status than to sub-Saharan Africa. The UN's Human Development Report lists the island in the top 25 developing countries, ahead of Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Since the mid-1980s, gross domestic product growth has averaged 6.5 per cent annually, and inflation 7.5 per cent; unemployment is estimated at 1.6 per cent, and the budget deficit is a modest 2.2 per cent of GDP. Finance minister Ramakrishna Sithanen's recent budgets bulge with first-world supply-side ideas designed to improve market efficiency, offer new incentives for savings and investment and improve the infrastructure. Refreshing, too, is the country's ability to pay its own way. The ubiquitous 'donors', dominating such discussions in Africa, seldom feature in Mauritius. External debt will fall to 30 per cent of GDP this year, while the debt-service ratio will be only 6.5 per cent of exports. Since 1982 Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, has presided over the transformation, based on economic measures to which all the main parties subscribe, ensuring policy continuity irrespective of who wins the next general election, to be held by 1996. All this means that the yardstick against which Mauritius must be assessed is Asian rather than African, although whether it can make the leap to NIC status will depend on practicising what it preaches. Most agree that the Export Processing Zone is unlikely to maintain its existing dominance of the economy. Mauritian businessmen accept the need to develop new skills and a capital-intensive growth path, while retaining their competitive strength, especially in garment manufacture, built up over the past decade. Some companies, the Floreal Group being the flagship, have taken the multinational route, setting up a labour-intensive plant in nearby Madagascar, while looking further afield to the possibility of manufacturing in China or India. Others, such as the New Island Clothing group, are manufacturing to Marks and Spencer specifications for the UK market. The strategy is crucial. Mauritius is increasingly at a competitive disadvantage, not just because it is a full-employment economy, where wage costs have doubled in the past four years, but also because of its location. The choice is between importing labour, going offshore as Floreal has done, or sharpening its competitive edge in manufacturing. Devaluation - 25 per cent in the past five years - has helped maintain competitiveness, but the zone must now implement structural solutions rather than temporary palliatives. 'We have to redesign the Mauritian citizen,' says a businessman, referring not just to the need for better and more relevant education and training, but also for a change in attitudes. Mauritius may be ahead of Africa in terms of work ethic, but when it comes to the Asian tigers it is not in the same league. Nor does investment efficiency measure up to 'tiger' standards. While ratios are high, an estimated 30 per cent of GDP in 1994, the capital-output ratio of 19.4 per cent in recent years is well below Korea's 29 per cent and Taiwan's and Thailand's 35.5 per cent. This is explained partly by weaknesses in the financial system, some of which were tackled in this year's budget, but also by structural factors - especially an inefficient labour market. Welfarist attitudes die hard, reflected in the readiness to abolish exchange control and to liberalise money markets, while retaining restrictive labour laws. With much underemployment, labour market deregulation would allow better use of scarce resources. Immediate growth prospects are good. GDP will grow 4.5 per cent in 1994-5, slower than the past two years because of the impact on sugar production of cyclone Hollanda early in the year. The current account deficit last year of MRs700m (1.2 per cent of GDP) will increase sharply to 4.2 per cent in 1994-5, but if aircraft purchases are excluded, it will be slightly lower at 1 per cent. With net capital inflows of some MRs3bn the balance of payments will be in healthy surplus. Inflation is expected to fall from 9.5 per cent to 5 per cent by mid-1995. Real interest rates are positive, with bank rate, tied to the treasury bill rate at 11.2 per cent, and the savings ratios (24 per cent of GDP) should be boosted by budget measures designed to increase the flow of investible securities. This includes privatising five parastatals, starting with Air Mauritius later this year. At the same time, the Stock Exchange is being opened up to foreign investors. With the EPZ facing a more competitive international environment, including the loss of Lome preferences ,growth will slow, while sugar prices will fall in response to Uruguay Round agreement. While tourism is most likely to fill the gap in the short term, physical and environmental limitations, mean the potential for tourism-driven growth beyond the turn of the century is hard to assess. This is why the drive to develop the services sector - embracing offshore banking, the free port, offshore companies, data capture, pre-press services for the printing industry, computer software - has assumed such importance. The number of offshore companies has risen from 150 a year ago to more than 1,000. Leaders, both in government and business have few illusions. Business and government are working more closely than in the past, while in the political sphere there is a shared vision of the future. But while the centre will hold, it is vital that the service culture, increasingly evident in tourism, becomes more entrenched in the economy, because that is where the island's future lies.  -------------------------------------------------- GDP PER HEAD (CONSTANT 1987 PRICES)  -------------------------------------------------- Year                        Dollars                       (1987 prices)  -------------------------------------------------- 1980                          1,650 1981                          1,750 1982                          1,825 1983                          1,820 1984                          1,900 1985                          2,000 1986                          2,170 1987                          2,350 1988                          2,475 1989                          2,560 1990                          2,710 1991                          2,800 1992                          2,975 1993                          3,100  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistical Office, Port Louis  --------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  MUZ  Mauritius, Africa.

On January 4, Barbados Foreign Minister Brandford Taitt and  South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha had exchanged letters  indicating their intention to establish formal relations.    For over 30 years, Barbados had maintained a firm distance  from South Africa because of apartheid. The thaw in relations  occurred after South Africa started dismantling the system of  racial segregation.

President Kim Il-song said  in the message that the Organization of Africa Unity is playing  a great role in strengthening the unity and solidarity of Africa  in conformity with the requirement of the complicated situation  after the end of the Cold War and solving the urgent problems  facing the continent.    He continued:    The efforts of the Organization of Africa Unity to  coordinate  and settle the disputes and establish the African economic  community conform to the desire and aspirations of the entire  African people to build a free, peaceful and prosperous new  Africa.    The African people are making all efforts to consolidate  political independence, expand economic cooperation and achieve  the independent development of Africa.    The African people will achieve the peace and common  prosperity of Africa by adhering to independence, strengthening  unity and developing South-South cooperation on the principle of  collective self-reliance.    The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  and the Korean people always stand on the side of the African  people who struggle to build an independent new life against all  domination and suppression and will actively strive to develop  the friendly and cooperative relations with the African people  in the future, too.

If the critics ignore other factors and simply denigrate the  first Budget of a majority government because of the 5 percent  transitional levy, they will do Keys and his collaborators an  injustice. Keys has produced a Budget designed to generate the  soundly based growth we need if the economy is to create jobs  and allow the fair distribution of wealth and the social  spending necessary for national stability. He had no choice but  to put growth above all other considerations, and with this  year's Budget he should succeed, while helping government avoid  the temptation of fiscal indiscipline.    There will be some gripes about the higher excise duties on  tobacco and alcoholic products. But the new intention that  increases in excise duties should match price increases is wise.    Keys trod a fine line over VAT [value-added tax]. He appears  sensibly to have resisted pressures to zero-rate more  foodstuffs. Variable VAT rates would add to the complexities of  collecting the tax which is likely to become an increasingly  important source of government income as economic restructuring  progresses. But the Finance Minister apparently had to pay the  political price of that by not increasing the overall VAT rate.    Realities    The decision not to change VAT highlights South Africa's new  political realities. The majority of people who elected the new  government are relatively poor. Until their standards of living  are raised, they will continue to oppose taxes like VAT which,  whatever their advantages, are regressive. Social services will  continue to be directed increasingly towards the most needy.    Some sleight of hand has cut the budgeted deficit before  borrowing to 6.6 percent of GDP [gross domestic product] from  last year's 6.9 percent. GDP has been increased by 5.6 percent  -- an estimate of the contribution of the ill-measured informal  sector. Calculated on the older, more conventional basis, the  Budget deficit would have been 7 percent -- visibly higher than  the 6 percent promised to the IMF but still an acceptable level  for a Budget that has to put growth above all else.    Growth cannot be achieved without investment, and the  proposed cut in the corporate income tax rate, in part offset by  the higher 25 percent secondary tax on companies (a tax on  distributed profits), should encourage it. The scrapping of the  import surcharge on capital and intermediate goods will also  help. Investment yields will be enhanced by the lower corporate  tax rate while companies will be encouraged by the higher STC  [secondary tax on companies] to retain and reinvest earnings.    Flexibility    Keys was right not to introduce a capital gains tax that  would deter investment. That will be addressed by the new Tax  Advisory Committee, but it will be addressed in parallel with  Inland Revenue's proposals to facilitate corporate unbundling  and rationalisation.    The Finance Minister would have done well to eliminate the  marketable securities tax that is regularly criticised by  foreign investors. He has, however, made a start on improving  the flexibility of financial markets with the new public debt  management proposals. Financing of government deficits as they  arise should create a more active market in government stock.  Couple that with the new system of depositing tax and loan  receipts with the commercial banks, and most of the market  distortions inherent in the previous system will be eliminated.  In addition, government funding should become more sensitive to  market trends.    Many investors here and abroad remain wary of South Africa's  new government. It has still to prove its credentials  conclusively and, as a result, it is likely to be under greater  scrutiny than its predecessor. This Budget has set the tone,  and has shown that government's financial planners believe the  business of South Africa can be business.     "

CONTENTS:    1. Call to Revive Islamic rule    2. Secularism Versus Islam    3. Antinormalization Committee    4. Roots of Jewish Thought Examined    5. Anti-Sudan British Conspiracy    CALL TO REVIVE ISLAMIC RULE    The 17 March issue of AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH devotes much of  its space to the struggle between secular and Islamic currents.    A 5,000-word report by Hani al-Makkawi on page 3 speaks of  the ills wrought by ""morbid secularism"". The article, which  bears the headline: ""What Has the World Gained by Drawing Away  From Islam? ... Destruction, Corruption, Humiliation, and the  Nations' Inability To Feed Themselves"", addresses the following  question to a large number of Islamic figures and academics:  ""What have the Muslims lost or gained by adopting secular  methods in various spheres?""    Among the answers cited is one by Dr. Fawzi Ta'il, who lists  the ills resulting from the abandonment of Islam, including the  spread of AIDS, illegal drugs, weakened family ties,  unemployment, spiritual emptiness, the specter of trade wars,  and ""moral catastrophes in the scientific field such as organ  transplants; genetic engineering; artificial insemination; the  right to end one's life, which they call suicide; and the right  to get rid of a fetus, which they call abortion.""    Noting that ""60 percent of the world's population are  idolaters"", Ta'il asks: ""If the West casts off its hostility to  Islam, it will benefit from this great message that brings  guidance to the people of the Earth.""    Dr. Salim Najm, chairman of the Egyptian Relief Committee  and  deputy president of the Physicians Association, comments on the  Islamic countries ""disgraceful"" attitude on the issues of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Kashmir, which, he says, would  be different if Islam ruled the world.    Islamic preacher Tal'at al-Shinnawi, from al-Daqahliyah  Governorate, says that the Islamic world's abandonment of  shari'ah has led to autocratic rule and produced a strong Israel.    Dr. Jamal 'Abd-al-Hadi, a professor of Islamic history, says  that as a result of its alienation from its religion, the  Islamic world suffered ""an obliteration of Islamic identity  following the collapse of the Caliphate [Ottoman Empire] and an  intellectual invasion via foreign educational curricula and  media, non-Islamic values, and foreign economic domination,  particularly after the Gulf war.""    'Abd-al-Hadi continues that alienation from Islam also  caused  the loss of Jerusalem, the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque, the chaste  land of Palestine, and al-Andalus [Spain].    Dr. Mahmud Himayah, professor of comparative religion and  head of Asyut University's Islamic Studies Department,  criticizes ""imported constitutions and laws,"" which fail to  punish ""immorality and corruption of the faith."" He attacks  secular writers who ridicule Islamic teachings and symbols. He  extols such figures as Shaykh [Muhammad] al-Ghazali, Shaykh  [Muhammad Mutawalli] al-Sha'rawi, and the Grand Imam of al-Azhar.    Himayah continues: ""It is strange that when al-Azhar uses  its natural right to confiscate the garbage of human thought  [zibalat al-fikr al-bashari], the secularists and communists  raise a brouhaha about freedom of belief and thought. It  appears as if freedom of thought among these people means to  attack sanctities and ridicule Islam.""    Dr. 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji, a professor at Suez Canal  University and secretary general of the Scientific Professions  Association, says that by drawing away from Islam, the Islamic  world lost its respect. He adds: ""We have become the world's  plaything. Muslim blood has become the cheapest blood. The  era's major tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina is two years old now  but the Islamic world remains complacent and unconcerned. The  European-U.S. West is fighting them by giving political, media,  and diplomatic backing to their enemy. Russia and Greece are  supplying the aggressors with soldiers and hardware. The  international organizations, in the absence of Islam, are even  worse.""    Dr. 'Abdallah Hilal, a nuclear energy professor, contrasts  Israel's early acquisition of nuclear power with the Islamic  world's lack of success in this sphere, which he blames on  inter-Arab differences and foreign intervention. Commenting on  Egypt's plans in this field, he says: ""When the Egyptian  Nuclear Energy Authority was established to boost the economy by  producing electricity and desalinating sea water, it had great  success in its first years. It brought good repute to Egypt and  other Arab and Islamic countries. Its cadres of trainees began  to carry this knowledge to Arab, Islamic, and African states.  Nuclear power plants were supposed to be built and feasibility  studies began for eight such stations. However, Zionist-U.S.  conspiracies did not allow the project to be completed. As a  result of Egypt's links with the U.S., there were no Egyptian  secrets. They let us make studies and plans, offer tenders, and  spend much money and efforts only to interfere at the last  moment to wreck our plans by using the weapons of aid, the IMF,  and the World Bank. In addition, we were given frank  instructions to abandon the project. As a result our trained  cadres emigrated.""    Shaykh al-Ghazali says that after the collapse of the  caliphate, the Islamic world's enemies multiplied and communists  and secularists became stronger. He remarks that alienation  from Islam has rendered the Muslims very weak and notes that if  the Islamic nation realizes what its role should be and returns  to its God and shari'ah, it will be ""qualified to lead the  world.""       SECULARISM VERSUS ISLAM    Under the headline ""The Atheistic-Secularist Onslaught on  Islam: Its Causes and Motives,"" Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub, in a  2,000-word column on page 2, brands Egyptian communists as  selfish and superficial opportunists who, having lost their  erstwhile Soviet master, are now attacking Islam and Muslims in  order to demonstrate their credentials to the ""rich new U.S.  master."" He notes that some of them are afraid of ""transferring  their loyalty directly to the West"" in order not to expose their  true opportunist nature. The column also defends Arab Muslims  who helped the Afghans against the Soviet invaders, noting that  most of them are not terrorists or extremists.    ANTINORMALIZATION COMMITTEE    A brief report by Hani al-Makkawi on page one discusses a  conference organized by the Cairo University Faculty Club, which  issued a statement announcing its determination to form a  ""committee for boycotting normalization with the Zionist enemy  in all spheres of life."" The conference appealed to every  Egyptian who has any information on individuals and companies  dealing with the ""Zionist enemy"" to submit it to the above  committee.    In a related item by al-Makkawi, a 3,000-word report on page  4 recounts protests against the Hebron massacre carried out by  students and faculty members at several Egyptian universities.    ROOTS OF JEWISH THOUGHT EXAMINED    A 2,000-word back-page article on page 10 offers an analysis  of the ""doctrinal and cultural roots"" that made a ""Zionist army  physician take the liberty of assassinating hundreds of  Palestinians,"" a reference to the shooting of Muslim worshipers  in Hebron.    The writer, Dr. Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, says the Talmud  teaches  that the Gentiles are not human beings, the Torah permits the  ""Semites"" to enslave the Canaanites, and Arabs have no right to  resist Jewish settlement in Palestine. He says ""Zionist racism""  drew sustenance from ""modern racist ideology in Europe and  America,"" which is based on Greek philosophy and Roman culture,  notably Aristotle's division of humanity into ""Greek humans and  non-Greek savages,"" a view which the writer says was adopted by  the Romans. He says this ideology was further strengthened by  Machiavellian thought.    The writer goes on to warn of possible nuclear attacks on  Arab capitals such as Damascus, Baghdad, Khartoum, or even  Mecca, especially as the United States has prevented the Arabs  from acquiring similar weapons.    He says: ""Such a possibility is not an illusion. The  conditions to which we have been reduced encourage the sons of  Israel and Judah to consider it.""    He concludes by urging the overthrow of ""the chains of  secular government"" because an Islamic government would respond  with whatever weapons it had at hand and would proceed ""on the  path of glorious victory.""    ANTI-SUDAN BRITISH CONSPIRACY    A 300-word report by Muhammad 'Urfah on page 1 notes ""a  secret document revealing a British conspiracy against the  Muslims in Sudan that is designed to seize the Nile sources"".  This document is a letter circulated by a group of British  opposition politicians and reportedly sent by British Prime  Minister John Major to his foreign secretary Douglas Hurd,  specifying Britain's position on Sudan and other issues,  including Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the letter Major reportedly advocates south Sudan's  secession with the help of media publicity, claiming that Arab  Muslims are oppressing the Christian southerners, the aim being  to ""confront political Islam"" in that country and Africa in  general.    The document is said to reveal a report about the Nile  water,  of which Israel hopes to have a share; the projected control of  all governments in the region in the 21st century; and the  ""Zionists' cooperation with the Turkish Government against Arab  regimes and Islamic organizations.""    The document reportedly discloses a British attempt to unite  south Sudan's rebel factions with the help of a  British-influenced local church to guarantee British, rather  than U.S., influence in the region.    The document is said to hint at ""extensive military  intervention in south Sudan under UN supervision.""     "

Fidel discussed possible Cuba-South Africa  ties, and Mandela's historic victory.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this  month,  an ANC [African National Congress] representative discussed the  preceding events, and explained that once Nelson Mandela was  inaugurated, South Africa would proceed to establish diplomatic  relations with Cuba. That is their intent. They even included  this in a document known as the New South Africa Foreign Policy  Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] [Words indistinct] of our relations with Mandela,  the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We have had  close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we are  family. Regarding foreign relations [words indistinct]  conditions, the closer our friendship with a country, the less  we ask to establish ties. We allow circumstances and the  appropriate moment to determine the establishment of ties to  occur. In the special case of South Africa at this time, we  could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son. We  have  not pressed the issue of formal ties, however. I believe that  perhaps tomorrow, it will be brought up in the talks with the  foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with the  foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps, he will bring this up and ties will be established  immediately. We will not bring it up however. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up like a demand or as a  request from us.    It seems something, however, [word indistinct] that those  ties will be established quickly because there are few countries  with whom we have stronger ties in common -- kinship and  fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I did not speak with  ministers from other countries. We talked like old relatives. I  am convinced all of them want the quick establishment of ties,  but out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    [Reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and South Africa  had great differences because of Angola. Did you ever think  then, or later, that you would be here today in the former  capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South African nations. We have  to return to its history. For specific reasons, strong clashes  took place. Now, however, there is a new South Africa in which  such clashes no longer exist, just peace, harmony, respect, and  affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. [Words indistinct] the independence of Angola. We were  in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning of intervention by  foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our support -- for 15  years. So many things happened. We did not have a strong  presence, but it was strong enough because we could not, nor did  it depend on us alone, to attain a position was the problem.  [sentence as heard]    In Angola, we fought with the greatest selflessness. The  rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would said that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted, difficult but not through our fault. Cuba fulfilled  its duty. Cuba contributed to solve the highly difficult  problems that arose. I do not want to criticize anyone. I  believe today is not a day to criticize. Perhaps history will  record this.

Trade and Industry Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said  the  resumption of trade ties with South Africa will jack up the  exchange of trade between the two countries to $200 million this  year from the existing cap of $50 million.    He added that Filipino businessmen can also use South Africa  as an entry point for exports to central African countries,  adding that Filipino exporters can already go into  oleochemicals, garments, electronics, and software.    South Africa can then ship in its exports of steel, coal,  phosphate rock, and capital equipment.    Moreover, the lifting of the trade embargo would also mean  the flow of South African investments into the country, said Mr.  Alcantara. [passage omitted]     "

The sources, with  whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq  has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the  following five main objectives:    1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells  not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells.  Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main  design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company  coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that  purpose.    2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South  Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies  (mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely  advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled  with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and  heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies  were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a  state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of  missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that  kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some  offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing  equipment.    3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has  been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a  complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery  shells.    4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim  has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources  said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South  Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and  London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the  visas were issued for ""the crescent state,"" the expression used  in official correspondence.    5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in  South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had  indeed received some offers in this connection.     "

That all state institutions, industrial, commercial,  financial, and transport enterprises, banks, and private  individuals under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation  shall proceed from the fact that the restrictions established as  of 1962 by the UN General Assembly on relations with the  Republic of South Africa in the political, economic, financial,  scientific and technological, cultural, sports, and other fields  are canceled.    2. That the abolition of the restrictions specified in  Clause  1 of this decree shall not extend to military and  military-technical cooperation prohibited by current decisions  of the UN Security Council.    [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation    [End box]    ""Russia, as distinct from the United States, where the 1986  Anti-Apartheid Act has been in operation, never adopted  independent decisions restricting trade relations between the  two countries--it subscribed to the sanctions imposed against  South Africa by the United Nations,"" was how Leonid Safonov,  chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Africa Desk, commented to  KOMMERSANT on the title of the Council of Ministers' decree.  Nonetheless, it is well known that (aside from the sanctions)  trade with South Africa in Soviet times was held back by one  further essential factor--ideology: relations were maintained  merely with the ANC, the opposition at that time, and its  leader, Nelson Mandela.    Now both the ideological and economic restrictions have been  lifted. But Boris Kolokolov, deputy minister of foreign affairs  of Russia, specified in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent that together with the restrictions on arms  supplies, the embargo on trade with South Africa in oil and  petroleum products imposed by the UN Security Council in 1977  remains in force also. It is expected that all restrictions will  be abolished only after the first free elections have been held  in South Africa, a black and white government of national trust  created, and a constitution adopted, that is, not before May  1994.    It should be observed for fairness' sake that trade between  Russia and South Africa, in spite of the international  sanctions, has been conducted, nonetheless, and particularly  actively in recent years. It is interesting here that the  information on the extent of bilateral trade made available to  KOMMERSANT by Russian and South African departments differs  considerably. According to data of the Russian side (the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Trade and  Industry Chamber of Russia), commodity turnover in the past year  was not in excess of $800,000, with the significant  preponderance of Russian exports ($500,000), what is more. South  African statistics, meanwhile, put reciprocal commodity turnover  in the first half of 1993 alone at $100 million.    Russian specialists see as the reason for this disagreement  in the data the fact that South Africa's statistics record  contacts at all levels--as distinct from the Russian statistics,  which only take account in practice of deals between major  (primarily state-owned) companies. Indeed, ""unclassified  commodities"" in fact representing nothing other than small-scale  wholesale consignments of wine (of excellent quality, in  experts' estimation) and a variety of consumer goods, costly and  not so costly, and not necessarily manufactured in South Africa,  what is more, account in the South African statistical summary  for a large part of the trade turnover--$80 million.    In the trade in ""classified"" commodities, on the other hand,  imports into Russia of products of agriculture and food industry  (approximately $3.5 million), textiles and wool ($7 million) and  electronic equipment and precision instruments ($370,000)  accounted for the bulk of these. In addition, a pronounced place  in trade is occupied by products of chemical industry (imports  from South Africa, $290,000; exports, $80,000).    Civil servants from the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations of Russia and the South African Embassy believe that  the very modest amounts of commodity exchange do not correspond  to the two countries' possibilities and interests. As Leonid  Safonov put it, ""One has the impression that Russian  entrepreneurs' ideas of Africa are shaped on the basis of the  novels of Louis Boussenard."" Meanwhile, according to him, not so  much merchandise as unique technology could represent the main  interest in South Africa for the Russian side. The knowhow of  the Sasol firm, for example, permitting the production of liquid  fuel from coal. It is this technology that under the conditions  of the embargo on oil supplies has enabled South Africa to  provide for 70 percent of the country's liquid fuel  requirements. The technology of South African mining companies  permits mining operations in very deep mines--up to 5 km. Many  of South Africa's medical developments are assessed as being far  above those of America and Europe. As we know, it was in South  Africa that the world's first human heart transplant operation  was performed, almost entirely with local equipment, what is  more.    In turn, as specialists of the Russian Trade and Industry  Chamber believe, national entrepreneurs also have things to  offer contracting parties in South Africa. According to  information from the Trade and Industry Chamber, the well-known  South African firms Strategic Material Supplies, Balmoral,  Feninx Steel, and Development Resource Group have given the  Russian side their requests for structural and high-alloy  stainless steel, pig iron, hot-rolled sheet steel, and billets  for rolled products. The firms Ace, P.B. International, Latitude  Links, Plumb Contracts, and Bregowa are interested in supplies  from Russia (and, possibly, other CIS countries) of cathode  copper, tungsten, aluminum, zinc, titanium, magnesium, electric  cable, and wire. Through the mediation of the Trade and Industry  Chamber office in Pretoria, they have established direct  contacts with the Tsvetmeteksport and Sovkabel all-Russia  joint-stock companies, the Inferkom group, and the  Zarubezhtsvetmet VAP [expansion unknown], and, according to  KOMMERSANT information, precontract agreements have already been  concluded. Interest is being shown in South Africa in Russian  cement also.    In addition, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has  reached agreement on the sale via the Rusaf Trading, MANNCONN,  Cinofoto, and Midas firms of test consignments of motorcycles,  Krasnogorskiy Plant cameras, experimental Aviatika airplane  models, and Vikhr boat engines, and also 3 million meters of  viscose fabric. As the Trade and Industry Chamber observed, the  prospects of supplies to South Africa of aviation equipment on  leasing terms and the creation of a system of its maintenance  are considered quite good, and there are opportunities for the  joint creation of a system of passenger shuttle helicopter  routes.    Purchases of tropical fruit and animal husbandry products  (which are not inferior in terms of quality to their American  and Australian counterparts, but which are cheaper) could be of  interest in South Africa to Russian importers.    Specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  advise entrepreneurs to think seriously of consolidating on the  South African market to consider the quite complex domestic  political situation in this country. Despite the fact that  President De Klerk and the leaders of the ANC are endeavoring to  avoid civil war, both white and black extremism is a reality,  nonetheless. And even after the elections on 27 April 1994 and  the formation of a coalition government, racial conflicts cannot  be ruled out. It would thus be advisable to take account of the  political instability factor when concluding contracts--and,  accordingly, stipulating the parties' responsibility in the  event of drastic changes in the political situation.    In addition, it is essential to take account also of the  following fact. An agreement on trade and economic cooperation  has been concluded between Moscow and Pretoria which proclaims  the principle of most-favored-nation status in trade. It was  signed on 22 October, that is, before the Council of Ministers'  adoption even of the decree on measures in connection with the  abolition of sanctions in respect to South Africa. But the  cooperation agreement is of a framework nature, that is, it  describes merely the most general principles of mutual  relations. Two documents of fundamental importance for the  development of business--on the protection of investments and  the avoidance of dual taxation--have yet to be signed. Mutual  contacts at expert level on these matters continue, but owing to  the general situation in South Africa, these documents will not  be signed before the elections. Thus, prior to the conclusion of  these agreements, a favorable customs tariff will operate in  respect to the commodities imported into Russia from South  Africa, but taxes on the profits obtained from commercial  activity will be collected by both sides. The same thing applies  to the income tax for persons who are not public servants--if a  citizen of Russia receives his earnings in South Africa, he must  pay tax both in Russia and in South Africa.    Foreign citizens working in South Africa are taxed here,  according to this country's laws, on a par with ordinary  citizens of the country and are required to pay a progressive  income tax. True, the interest computed for foreign individuals  and companies (which are not managed and not controlled by South  Africa) has since 3 June 1993 been exempted from income tax.    KOMMERSANT NOTE: According to information of the  Embassy of South Africa, foreign shareholders are taxed at the  rate of 15 percent of the sum total of the dividend. The maximum  rate of income tax in South Africa is 43 percent, and the level  of income subject to the maximum tax depends on sex and family  situation. Thus, for married men this income has to be 80,000  rand (approximately $27,000) or higher, and for single men,  $56,000 rand ($18,600). Value-added tax is 14 percent. The rate  of profits tax is 40 percent.    To return to the question of how promising South African  technology is for Russian entrepreneurs, it is worth mentioning  that the purchase thereof would seem highly beneficial from the  taxation viewpoint. The point being that in accordance with  Russian legislation--even with the absence of an agreement  excluding dual taxation--Russian entrepreneurs are exempted from  the payment of VAT when purchasing rights to technology. Customs  duty, on the other hand, may be paid off in equal installments  over the whole of the period of which these rights are acquired  (and in practice such terms make it possible to reduce annual  payments to negligible amounts).    And, finally, it is essential to take account of the fact  that there is in South Africa the concept of ""white"" and ""black""  business, and even the interests of entrepreneurs of different  races are represented by particular associations--the Afrikaner  Businessman Institute of Commerce (AHI, represents the interests  of ""white"" business) and the National Federative South African  Trade and Industry Chamber (NAFKOK, the association of black  entrepreneurs). The commercial interests of Russian businessmen  in South Africa are protected by the Trade and Industry Chamber  of Russia office, which opened in Pretoria in the summer of  1992. In the year that it has been working in South Africa, the  Trade and Industry Chamber office has concluded an agreement on  cooperation with both the above-mentioned associations, and also  with the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB). In addition,  protocols on cooperation with the South African Foreign Trade  Organization (SAFTO) and the Mining Chamber have been signed.  All these organizations represent the interests of about 80,000  South African companies--practically all which are of more or  less note among the country's entrepreneurs. Inasmuch as trade  relations between Russia and South Africa are as yet of a  sporadic nature and Russian entrepreneurs lack, as a rule,  permanent partners in South Africa, the Trade and Industry  Chamber office could help them in their search.

0,FT934-7738 ,"FT934-7738 _AN-DKRC7AGQFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (16): A dip in uncertain waters - France      By DAVID BUCHAN   A DELEGATION from the French employers federation was in South Africa last week to restore the country's position in South Africa's economy. The political turmoil and violence of recent years, coupled with strong French government backing for international sanctions against apartheid, had the effect of reducing France's share in foreign direct investment in South Africa from 8.6 per cent in 1980 to around 2 per cent today. Recent negotiation between South Africa and France of treaties on reciprocal protection of investment and avoidance of double taxation should encourage more French companies to dip their toes in South African waters. It is to help smaller French companies in the South Africa market that the French Patronat employers federation and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa last year set up a joint organisation, aimed at modernising South African industry and developing higher value-added exports by South Africa. There has long been a traditional French interest in South African gold stocks. Several South African gold stocks are quoted on the Paris Bourse and, for example, a majority of the shares in East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM) are held by French individuals, according to one French banker. 'But this traditional interest in gold has not spread to other South African shares,' the banker says. The latter are relatively expensive, with a high price/earnings ratio, he says. This is due to the controls on capital movements which mean that South African investors have difficulty investing abroad. But the French investor's main worry says Mr Christian Graeff, leader of last week's Patronat delegation, is 'the current image of violence and the prospect that there will be no coherence in policy for some time to come'.

Fifteen african countries were not party to any  drug-control treaty, according to the International Narcotics  Control Board (INCB) 1993 report.    It said the worldwide drug menace had outgrown its  traditional classification as a criminal and social issue to  penetrate international politics and economics.    Although the INCB recognised prevailing political, economic,  social and even climatic conditions that created obstacles for  African governments, it said limited law enforcement and weak  control over the pharmaceutical market had contributed to  increased drug abuse. Increased cultivation of dagga was  attributed to growing domestic demand and trafficking to  European markets. Supplies came from local cultivation and  regional trafficking, said the report, which annually reviews  the world drug scene and international compliance with three  major drug control treaties.    Heroin abuse, which a few years ago was a limited  phenomenon,  was increasing because African airports were being used to  smuggle the drug into mainly European markets. A similar trend  had been observed with cocaine, mainly in west Africa.    The current drug pattern in Africa showed how quickly abuse  and trafficking could spread in a region, notably central Africa  and most recently to southern Africa where the report  highlighted the illicit manufacture and distribution of  methaqualone (mandrax).    Established in 1968 as an independent and quasi-judicial  organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug  conventions, the INCB seeks to identify weaknesses in national  and international drug control.

Mr Nathan, director of the Cape-Town based Centre for  Conflict Resolution, said a number of arguments had been  presented in recent weeks for maintaining or increasing the  defence budget.    The argument that it was necessary to maintain a credible  defence capability was correct as a general principle, but its  application depended on circumstances. South Africa was  over-armed in the regional context as none of the Southern  Africa Development Community states was capable of posing a  military threat. There was no foreseeable military threat from  outside the region.    ""The potential in fact exists for a high level of political,  diplomatic and security co-operation in the post-apartheid  southern Africa,"" he said.    ""Disarmament in South Africa would facilitate disarmament  throughout the subcontinent, releasing resources for development  and potentially leading to greater internal stability.""    In South Africa the greatest threats to citizens' security  were non-military problems such as poverty, unemployment and a  lack of adequate social services.    ""The bottom line is that money spent on defence could  otherwise have been used for development programmes and welfare  services,"" Mr Nathan said.    To argue that South Africa's foreign policy, particularly in  southern Africa, would depend heavily on a military role was  dangerously close to South Africa's regional policy under  apartheid and would undermine regional confidence.    To claims that the defence budget, at 2.6 per cent of gross  national product, was not high by international standards, Mr  Nathan said the United Nations and World Bank considered two per  cent an acceptable figure for developing countries.    ""This benchmark should be regarded as a general guideline  rather than a fixed rule,"" he said. ""It may in fact be too high  in the case of South Africa since current defence spending is  several times greater than total military expenditure in the  rest of the region.""    Noting that in 1992/93 Armscor [Armaments Corporation of  South Africa] had made R110 million [rand] from domestic and  foreign sales and received a state subsidy of R10 million, he  said it was ""untenable"" to say ethical considerations should  play no part in the arms trade.    Weapons were not a neutral commodity and it was not ""overly  pious"" to ask whether South Africa wanted to boost its economy  through killings in other countries.    The defence establishment could not seek to maintain a large  budget on the grounds of international instability and  simultaneously contribute to that instability through arms  exports.    Mr Nathan said South Africa had to establish clear foreign  and national security policies and conduct a transparent  investigation of its arms industry before it could make rational  decisions about the defence budget.    It required a clear policy on arms exports and a way of  overseeing whatever criteria were laid down. Ways to cut the  defence budget should also be investigated.    All of these objectives should be open to public debate, he  said.     "

During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message  to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik  de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message  from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South  Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz  al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on  10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president.    The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the  abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation  laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing  equality for all citizens in accordance with the new  constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli  conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard,  the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just  and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian  Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon.    Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the  continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of  violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing  of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed  that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that  henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the  expense of its new relations with the Arabs.    The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future  prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after  the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab  and international embargo on dealing with South Africa.    The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual  concern about establishing good relations between the two  countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other  fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume  contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations  between them are established.    Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the  foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic  Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa  Department at the Foreign Ministry.

The attractions lie in the country's well developed industrial infrastructure, a cheap labour force and the market of 125m consumers in southern Africa. The downside is equally obvious and can be summed up in one word: instability. 'German companies will invest,' commented a German diplomat in South Africa earlier this year at a trade fair to promote trade between the two countries, 'but only when the framework is in place: that means stability, a market economy and the removal of the danger of nationalisation.' As the BDI, the Federal Association of German Industry, put it in a memorandum last month, the next government in South Africa will face massive challenges in restoring the country's economy. That government may indeed find itself on a collision course with the expectations of the black majority. For the moment German companies have less risky, highly attractive markets on their own doorsteps, in the countries of the former eastern block. China and other markets in the far east are growing so quickly that they form a central part of many Germany companies' medium-term expansion plans. That said, German investment in South Africa should not be underestimated: there are about 350 German businesses or subsidiaries of large German companies in the country, employing 50,000 people. German investors and trade-partners are well-liked in South Africa - not least because German companies adopted a pragmatic approach to sanctions. But that liking is unlikely to be reciprocated further until South Africa offers a degree of stability to investors.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

More than 2,000 peaceful  black demonstrators have lost their lives at the hands of South African police  since the most recent round of resistance and protest began in the early 1980s.  The courage of these martyrs focused the attention of the world on the brutal  state of emergency imposed by the government. Soon after, nations around the  globe imposed economic sanctions against South Africa. In October, 1986, the  U.S. Congress, over the objection of President Ronald Reagan, and led by Rep.  Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), passed a sanctions bill.    Today, this strategy bears fruit. According to a recent bank study, foreign  economic sanctions cost South Africa $32 billion to $40 billion between 1985  and 1989, including at least $11 billion in net capital outflow and $4 billion  in lost exports. South Africa's isolation during the 1980s has helped turn  around the thinking of its leaders, who now recognize that the course of  democratic change is irresistible and inevitable.

He made the  announcement at an ANC fundraising dinner in East London on  Saturday [19 March]. ""It is planned that the new president,  Nelson Mandela I think, will be installed, inaugurated on the  10th May, a big occasion in Pretoria."" It had to be in Pretoria  because Pretoria was the seat of power and government in the  country. ""For years we fought against the Pretoria regime. On  the 10th May we ought to be (talking of) the Pretoria  government.""    He said the ANC had been receiving numerous queries from  heads of state and of government in other countries asking  whether there would be victory celebrations after the April  election, or an inauguration of the new president. ""Everybody  wants to come,"" he said. The mayor of Pretoria and ""all sorts  of people"" were concerned about the prospect of having the  inauguration in the city. ""They are very worried not because  they don't want change,"" he said, to laughter from his audience,  ""but because they say Pretoria won't be able to handle the  volume of visitors that are going to come"".    Mr Mbeki said if South Africa failed to make the transition  to a peaceful and successful democracy, it would disappoint  millions of people across the globe. ""And that we can't do.  Too much has been invested by the rest of the world in ending  apartheid.""    There was a picture in many peoples' minds that Africans  were  incompetent, always holding out a begging bowl, had no respect  for democracy, were always at each others' throats and that  Africa was ""generally a disaster"". ""The rest of the continent  is expecting this new South Africa will change all that so the  rest of the world will see an African country that is a success  in terms of a political system, human rights, an absence of  conflict and prosperity...so the rest of the world can begin to  say our understanding of Africa was wrong.""    These expectations meant that in the end, South Africa had  to  make a success of the process of change. Other countries where  racism had raised its head, such as Sweden, France, Germany and  England, were hoping South Africa would provide the lessons that  would enable them to deal with their own problems. ""I'm saying  we've got to solve, we've got to succeed here in the interest of  making a better world for millions of people.""    He also said South Africa needed a strong ANC government to  ensure that the country's millions were all brought into the  settlement. If the ANC was too weak to do so, other people  would move into the vacuum. Some of them might preach revenge  against the whites who had oppressed them for three-and-a-half  centuries.    He said the country would also need a strong National Party  to bring white civil servants, the police and white business  into the settlement.     "

The committee, in a statement issued at the end of its  session, praised all parties to the peace process in South  Africa for the spirit of tolerance they showed, which  contributed to achieving this accomplishment.    In its final statement, the South African Committee  emphasized its overwhelming support for democratic process in  South Africa, which serves the great interests of whoever is  living there, regardless of any ethnic considerations. The  committee voiced its regret for the recent acts of violence in  South Africa and called on all parties to show tolerance and a  sincere spirit of reconciliation to put an end to the chaotic  massacres and provide the appropriate atmosphere for holding the  elections in the country. The committee paid tribute to the  urgent efforts exerted by the transitional executive council and  the Government of South Africa to contain the explosive  situation in Bophuthatswana.    The committee called on all political leaders in South  Africa  to take the necessary measures to safeguard and guarantee the  unity and territorial integrity of South Africa. It called on  the international community to continue its backing for the  process of democratic change in South Africa and reject any  attempt to partition the country.    On behalf of the OAU leaders, the committee expressed its  hope to welcome a ""new South Africa"" as a member in the  organization following the April elections and the formation of  a democratic government.    The following is the text of the statement:    The 10th session of the OAU's South African Committee of  heads of states and governments met in Harare, the capital of  Zimbabwe, on 19 March 1994 to review the developments in South  Africa on the eve of the first democratic and nonracial  elections in that country. Participating in the meeting were  Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the current chairman  of OAU; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, president of the  host country and head of the front-line states; Botswana's  President Ketumile Masire, Cape Verde's President Antonio  Mascarenhas, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, Mozambique's  President Chissano, Namibian President Dr. Sam Nujoma, Tanzanian  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, and Zambian President Frederick  Chiluba.    Also present at the meeting were Angolan Prime Minister  Marcolino Moco; Lieutenant General D. O. Diya, Nigerian Chief of  the General Staff and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive  Council; Benjamin Bounkoulou, Congolese minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation; Ahmed Djebbar, Algerian  minister of national education; Osman Kamaza, Senegalese  ambassador to Zimbabwe [name and title as received]; OAU  Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim; Johnson Mlambo, chairman of  the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania; Alfred Nzo, member  of the African National Congress [ANC] Executive Council [name  and title as received]; and in the capacity of observer, Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's representative in South  Africa.    The committee examined a report prepared by the OAU  secretary  general following his visit to South Africa and his extensive  discussions with all concerned leaders there.    The committee listened to reports on the current situation  in  South Africa presented by the leaders of the PAC and ANC  delegations.    The committee referred to the Harare Declaration, which it  adopted on 21 August 1989 during its third regular session and  which included the principles and directions for the negotiating  process, and the program for ending apartheid and establishing a  united, democratic, and nonracial state in South Africa.    The committee welcomed the considerable progress achieved  since its last meeting and the splendid success achieved by the  multilateral negotiations, which produced historic agreements  providing for democratic elections in South Africa on 26, 27,  and 28 April 1994 and the establishment of transitional  structures to hold those elections.    The committee praised the spirit of tolerance shown by all  parties involved in the peace process and the flexible attitudes  which made the above achievement possible.    The committee voiced regret at the escalating violence in  the  country and grave concern at recent reports about the  involvement of senior officers in South Africa's security forces  in the continuing violence. The committee urged all parties in  South Africa to show tolerance and sincerely seek reconciliation  to put an end to the reckless massacres and prepare a suitable  climate to hold peaceful elections.    The committee welcomed the PAC's decision to halt armed  struggle unilaterally as of 16 April 1994. The committee termed  this decision a contribution toward free and honest elections.    The committee applauded South Africa's Transitional  Executive  Council and Government for their prompt efforts to contain the  explosive situation in Bophuthatswana and urged them to continue  their task of maintaining order, security, and law and  guaranteeing free political action throughout the country so  that the April elections can be held in an atmosphere free from  violence and threats.    The committee voiced support for the efforts to bring about  national accord within the framework of an all-embracing  process. Thanking all the leaders and parties involved in the  electoral process, including those who joined it recently, for  their sense of responsibility and perseverance, the committee  regrets the decision by some parties to boycott the upcoming  elections.    The committee commended the Transitional Executive Council,  which took firm measures to involve Bophuthatswana in the  electoral process.    The committee welcomed the meeting held recently between ANC  Chairman Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi and urged both leaders to continue the  course of dialogue and cooperation, not just between themselves,  but also with all the other political figures to end the  devastating wave of violence and to pave the way for elections  in a secure and peaceful atmosphere to build a new, democratic  South Africa.    The committee categorically rejected and candidly condemned  recent threats and acts of violence by those who deliberately  wish to wear down the people and prevent the majority of South  Africans from exercising their lawful right to choose their  leaders and turn the page on the tragic chapters of the past for  the first time. It appealed to the patriotic spirit of party  leaders boycotting the elections and threatening to obstruct and  dismantle the electoral process to reconsider their position and  refrain from depriving their people of the right to partake of  the biggest and most serious change in the history of South  Africa. It also appealed to them to do their utmost to  guarantee freedom of political activity all over the country and  to hold the elections in a safe, peaceful atmosphere.    In this context, the committee expressed its deep concern  over recent statements by kwaZulu leaders, statements that seek  to destroy the country's unity. The OAU had rejected all  attempts to partition the country, since they dramatically  threaten peace and stability in the southern part of the  continent and the entire region, and viewed these attempts as  absolutely unacceptable.    The committee invited the South African Government and all  political leaders in South Africa to take the necessary measures  to protect and guarantee South African territorial integrity.  The OAU called on the international community to maintain its  support for the democratic process in South Africa and to reject  any attempt to divide the country.    The committee reiterated its firm support for the democratic  process in and the unity of South Africa, the process that  serves and protects the greater interests of those living in the  country, regardless of ethnic, cultural, or religious  considerations. The committee is eager to see a new, democratic  South Africa join the OAU house to enhance the organization and  play its natural role in the greater international community.    It welcomed the participation of the international  community,  including the United Nations, the European Union, and the  British Commonwealth, in monitoring the elections. It urged all  South African parties to cooperate fully with the international  observers in their mission. In this context, the committee  expressed its appreciation of the OAU member states that pledged  to send observers to monitor the elections and urged those that  have not done so to do the same.    On behalf of all OAU member states, the heads of states and  the heads of delegations taking part in the 10th ordinary  session of the Southern African Committee welcome the new South  Africa as a member of the OAU after the April 1994 elections and  the establishment of a democratic government.    The heads of states and governments and delegation chairmen  expressed their deep appreciation and gratitude for His  Excellency President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the  government and people of Zimbabwe for their hospitality and the  excellent facilities they have provided to them during their  meeting.

AFRICA;    LARGEST REMAINING U.S. FIRM BELIEVED TO BE SELLING ASSETS      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Mobil Oil Co., the largest U.S. company remaining in South Africa, is selling  its operations at bargain prices to the oil subsidiary of a South African  mining conglomerate, newspapers reported today.    Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United States declined to comment  on the reports.    Business Day of Johannesburg quoted ""banking and other sources"" as confirming  the sale of about $400 million in assets for $150 million and said the Mobil  properties would be sold in separate deals over a period of time.    Mobil has been in South Africa for 90 years, and its four subsidiaries employ  almost 2,800 people. The oil company has been a symbol of foreign business  reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the  white-minority government's suppression of the black majority in the system  known as apartheid.    Partly because of South Africa's race policies, more than 170 American  companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Most have sold their  operations at low prices to South African-controlled businesses.    Since Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil concern, pulled out of South Africa in  1986, Mobil had insisted it would not bow to pressure to disinvest, despite  pressure on the company by anti-apartheid groups in the United States.    The South African Broadcasting Corp. reported Wednesday that Mobil may have  changed its stance on disinvestment because of a bill passed by the U.S.  Congress in its rush to adjourn before Christmas in 1987. The bill by Rep.  Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) removed the right of U.S. taxpayers to credit taxes  paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S. government.    At least two shareholder resolutions exhorting Mobil to vacate South Africa are  on the agenda at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for May 11.    The Star of Johannesburg, the nation's largest daily, reported that ""industry  sources confirmed"" Mobil was selling its South African assets for an estimated  500 million rand, roughly $125 million.    The Citizen, another Johannesburg daily, quoted ""local and overseas"" sources as  saying Mobil was considering disinvesting. The paper said Mobil is the largest  non-South African controlled employer in the country with 1,000 gasoline  stations, a $225-million investment in an oil refinery and a distribution  network.

AFRICA;    LARGEST REMAINING U.S. FIRM BELIEVED TO BE SELLING ASSETS      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Mobil Oil Co., the largest U.S. company remaining in South Africa, is selling  its operations at bargain prices to the oil subsidiary of a South African  mining conglomerate, newspapers reported today.    Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United States declined to comment  on the reports.    Business Day of Johannesburg quoted ""banking and other sources"" as confirming  the sale of about $400 million in assets for $150 million and said the Mobil  properties would be sold in separate deals over a period of time.    Mobil has been in South Africa for 90 years, and its four subsidiaries employ  almost 2,800 people. The oil company has been a symbol of foreign business  reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the  white-minority government's suppression of the black majority in the system  known as apartheid.    Partly because of South Africa's race policies, more than 170 American  companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Most have sold their  operations at low prices to South African-controlled businesses.

The court records of the trial of Brigadier Johann Blaauw in  1989 show that De Klerk's statement to parliament contained  three direct lies about South Africa's collaboration with other  countries in the nuclear programme. It also indicates that he  underplayed the extent of the programme when he told of the  existence of no more than six crude atomic bombs. The record  also puts on display the level of corruption in the government  in the 1980s, allowing former minister of mines Fanie Botha, a  perpetual insolvent, to sit in parliament and the cabinet and  even serve as leader of the House. Judge J. Friedman said that  in order to hide his state of affairs Botha was ""prepared to  commit perjury, fraud and deceit; he was prepared to become  involved in political chicanery of the most despicable kind ...  he was prepared to lie to the prosecutor ... he was prepared to  lie deliberately under oath ... no reliance can be placed on his  evidence.""    Botha was later jailed for one year. Transcripts of the  trial confirm South Africa and Israel collaborated on the  development of nuclear weapons -- and prove De Klerk lied on  three counts:     -  He stated South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons  technology or material from another country.    -  He stated that South Africa had never provided material to  another country.    -  He stated that South Africa had never co-operated with  another  country in this regard.       The September 1989 Supreme Court judgment, in the ""in  camera""  case of former South African Air Force [SAAF] Brigadier Blaauw,  reveals startling details of South African-Israeli swaps of  nuclear weapon technology and material and extensive  collaboration between the two. Until now reporting on the  judgment has been banned under the Nuclear Energy Act and the  Criminal Procedure Act. As recently as last week, the  government tried to block the story threatening the SUNDAY TIMES  with an interdict if it printed it.    In October 1987, Blaauw was charged with attempting to  extort  mining concessions from Botha, by threatening to reveal that he  was financially bankrupt. During the trail it emerged that  Blaauw had in fact shored up Botha's finances with the help of  the Israelis and brokered many of the key nuclear deals between  South Africa and Israel. Blaauw was found not guilty on all  charges.    After his retirement from the SAAF in 1975, Blaauw acted as  a  go-between for Israel and South Africa on military matters. In  1976, he was approached by a member of an Israeli council  involved in the clandestine purchase of nuclear materials and  asked to obtain South African ""yellow cake"" for Israel. Yellow  cake is an uranium oxide which, when enriched, can be used for  the production of nuclear weapons.    Blaauw got agreement for the sale of 50 [metric] tons of  yellow cake from the then prime minister B.J. Vorster, and the  former head of the Bureau of State security, Hendrik van den  Bergh, despite resistance from the then minister of mines, Piet  Koornhof. Koornhof was replaced by Botha who was instructed to  ensure the deal went through. Blaauw arranged a tour of Israeli  military installations for Botha and the Israelis quickly struck  up a good relationship with Botha.    Said the judgment: ""Blaauw testified that there was, at that  stage, a high degree of confidence developing between the South  African and Israeli governments which involved the exchange of  military technology, joint aeronautic ventures and the supply of  `knowhow' by Israel to South Africa in regard to the manufacture  of weaponry.""    After the yellow cake deal went through, Blaauw was asked by  Van den Bergh to see if Israel would supply tritium to South  Africa. Tritium boosts the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The  Israelis agreed to supply 30g of tritium to South Africa --  enough for 12 atomic bombs. In exchange, South Africa delivered  two more consignments of yellow cake, of 50 [metric] tons and  500 [metric] tons, to Israel.    Details of the transactions are recorded in CRITICAL MASS, a  recently published book by William Burrows and Robert Windrem,  which investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons among  developing countries. While the deals were going through, Botha  slid into bankruptcy and his political career was threatened by  a R[rand]1.7-million overdraft he owed Volkskas. But help was  at hand.    Said the judgment: ""The Israelis were interested in keeping  Botha in the portfolio of mines because the yellow cake  transactions had not yet fully materialised. There was every  possibility of Botha becoming the minister of defence and they  would have preferred Botha to hold that portfolio.""    The Israelis gave Blaauw $1-million -- then worth R800,000  --  as a ""gift for what I had done for them."" With the money,  Blaauw gave Botha cash transfusions and kept him financially and  politically alive. Blaauw and Botha fell out after Botha failed  to deliver valuable mining concessions promised to Blaauw as a  reward for his services to South Africa's nuclear programme,in  July 1979.    In court, Botha alleged Blaauw attempted to force him to  hand  over the concessions by threatening to reveal details of Botha's  illegal attempts to get evidence of corruption from his rivals  in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party, after  the fall of Vorster in 1979.    In his speech to parliament in March last year, when he  announced he had ordered the dismantling of South Africa's  nuclear arsenal, De Klerk baldly stated: ""I wish to emphasise  that at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear weapons  technology or materials from another country, nor has it  provided any to any other country, or co-operated with another  country in this regard.""    When confronted with the court records by the international  London based magazine, AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, which first broke  the story, the office of the state president replied: ""South  Africa did not acquire nuclear weapons technology from another  country. Although tritium many be used in initiators of nuclear  explosive devices, (although not in the devices produced by  South Africa) it has many other commercial uses. South Africa  has been active in the commercial exploitation of tritium for  some time and has procured this material from various sources in  the past.""    Despite De Klerk's 1993 announcement, details of South  Africa's nuclear programme remain shrouded in secrecy. Said ANC  [African National Congress] science and technology head Roger  Jardine: ""They are prepared to give a tour of the complex but  have never given details of the programme. A senior official  once offered to tell me everything -- but only if I signed the  Official Secrets Act.""     "

At the same time, two local cable systems have stepped in to try to fill the  void. Cencom Cable, which serves the Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley areas, and  Century Cable in Los Angeles said that they will begin carrying ""South Africa  Now"" when it leaves KCET.    KCET station manager and programming chief Stephen Kulczycki, who last week  decided to drop the program, said Thursday that he stands by his original  objection that the program was slanted in favor of the African National  Congress but that he will monitor it in coming weeks to see if it becomes more  balanced.    ""We will continue to monitor the series on the satellite feeds and try to get  some sense of whether the concerns we've expressed might show up in the  program,"" Kulczycki said. ""If (the producers) address the concerns we have  talked about, we might reconsider the choices we have made.""    ""South Africa Now"" producer Danny Schechter said that he was pleased Kulczycki  had opened the door to reconsideration but that he will not do anything  differently because he feels the program has always been fair.    ""If he's going to monitor, he'll find that the same program he rejected will  have a balanced presentation of what's going on in South Africa,"" Schechter  said.    For now, however, ""South Africa Now"" remains scheduled to leave KCET after the  last installment of the current 13-week batch runs Sunday at 9 a.m.    KCET's decision not to renew the program has enraged members of the Los Angeles  African-American community and anti-apartheid groups, who have threatened to  picket the station.    Several brought their complaints to the regularly scheduled meeting of KCET's  Community Advisory Board on Wednesday, and the board, whose volunteer members  are appointed to provide community feedback to station management, took up the  cause.    The advisory board issued a statement Thursday demanding that "" 'South Africa  Now' be returned to the air with a discussion panel or other vehicle to broaden  the range of issues covered; and/or (that KCET) immediately provide additional  (regular) programming on South Africa and the entire continent of Africa.""    Unhappiness with KCET's decision increased after a conservative media watchdog  organization claimed credit for having brought the show's alleged bias to  KCET's attention. David Horowitz, chairman of the Committee on Media Integrity,  met with station executives as many as half a dozen times and conducted a  yearlong letter-writing campaign against ""South Africa Now"" and other programs  broadcast on KCET.    KCET has vigorously denied Horowitz's contentions, but relations with community  members did not improve when the station canceled a scheduled meeting with  concerned leaders that was to have been held Wednesday. That evening, the  organizers who had planned to meet with Kulczycki and KCET president William  Kobin appeared instead before the Community Advisory Board.    ""African Americans are appalled,"" said Quincy Beaver, representing the  California Democratic Council. ""We are stunned.""    Michael Zinzun, the executive director of Friends of the African National  Congress and Front Line States, disputed Kulczycki's contention that because  there was no longer a press blackout in South Africa, the program was no longer  necessary.    ""It has just been 24 hours since George Bush vetoed the Civil Rights Act,""  Zinzun said. ""We are not in a position where we can let down our guard about  racism.""    In its statement Thursday, the advisory board said that it wanted to be  consulted about future programming decisions that might affect the community  and requested that the meeting with community leaders be rescheduled.    The board also said it did not believe that Horowitz had in any way influenced  management's decision regarding ""South Africa Now.""    Kobin said Thursday that he could not respond to the board's demands because he  had not yet read the statement.    ""I'm really gratified that they believe we acted for the reasons we said we  acted,"" Kobin said. ""Obviously, I'm disappointed that they don't agree with the  decision.""    The move by the local cable systems to pick up ""South Africa Now"" comes at a  time when cable -- through its non-commercial community access channels -- is  taking more of a role in airing alternative programming.    ""If the end result is that a program that doesn't have any other outlet can  turn to cable, that works out for the common good,"" said Craig Watson, general  manager of Cencom Cable.

The move by the local cable systems to pick up ""South Africa Now"" comes at a  time when cable -- through its non-commercial community access channels -- is  taking more of a role in airing alternative programming.

Speaking at a seminar on promotion of economic ties with  Africa, the commerce minister said: The government should  prepare the grounds for the establishment of extensive economic  ties with Africa by providing transport, banking, and insurance  facilities as well as export guarantees and information. He  said: The fact that there are 450 million Muslims living in the  African continent makes it imperative to broaden Iran's ties  with that continent on the basis of mutual interest. He added:  The Iranian airlines and shipping companies are ready to invest  in this field in an effort to promote economic relations between  Iran and the African countries.

0,FT933-1422 ,"FT933-1422 _AN-DIXCIABDFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Reform 'failing' in African states      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PETER NORMAN      LONDON, WASHINGTON   ECONOMIC reform is failing in sub-Saharan Africa and its crisis will deepen unless finance ministers at the IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington help resolve the region's 'crushing' external debt burden, officials of Oxfam, the international aid agency, warned yesterday. 'After a decade of structural adjustment programmes implemented under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, Africa remains trapped in a downward spiral of economic and social decline and poverty is increasing,' the agency said in London. 'There is now overwhelming evidence that existing adjustment policies have failed in two ways,' it said. 'They have not created a platform for sustainable recovery and have not addressed the central challenge, correctly identified by the World Bank, of alleviating poverty.' However, the Bank's policies 'suffer from inappropriate design, inadequate funding and poor implementation', the statement continues. Some of the sharpest criticism is reserved for the IMF, whose role in Africa should be reviewed by an international committee reporting to the United Nations, Oxfam said. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, strongly defended its role in Africa against Oxfam's charges, while admitting that the situation in Africa was 'a matter of immense concern'. But he said there were countries in Africa that were growing - ones that had followed IMF economic reform programmes that had allowed increased output and exports. Countries such as Mozambique, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia were all benefiting from IMF-inspired policies. More could be done, he added. There was scope for greater regional integration in Africa. Those countries which had not embarked on structural adjustment programmes must put their macro-economic policies in order. Mr Camdessus said there was much that industrialised countries could do to improve the situation. Africa would benefit most from early conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Oxfam says the speed at which IMF programmes require governments to reduce budget deficits is 'totally unrealistic and destructive'. The statement calls for longer time frames and 'more selective introduction of trade liberalisation measures.' Debt servicing takes up a quarter of the region's exports, although only half of scheduled payments are being met. Arrears currently exceed Dollars 11bn and are building up at an alarming rate. Oxfam called on the IMF to create a special fund to write off part of Africa's debt through the sale of gold stocks.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Investment funds are characterized mainly by:  collective investment, expert operation, decentralized risk, and  joint benefits. Investment funds, through orderly and  decentralized investment packages, optimize investment  efficiency, risk-dispersion efficiency, and expert-operation  efficiency.    In today's China, where our socialist market economy is  developing rapidly, investment has become a keen undertaking for  the Chinese public and enterprises. All sorts of investment  activities, such as buying stocks and bonds, and investing in  self-run enterprises, joint ventures, partnerships, and trusts,  are unfolding. The public asks: Of the many investment forms,  which option is actually the more ideal? In response to readers'  inquiries, I interviewed Xu Zhantao, a young economist studying  this business.    Reporter: While investment is a hedge  against inflation to proliferate assets and earn higher returns,  which makes sense, can the current decentralized, industrial, or  securities direct-investment options achieve this goal?    Xu Zhantao: The popularization of investment  subjects shows that investment subjects have shifted to a deeper  level. The profit-forces incentive of investment to proliferate  assets as a hedge against inflation, the drive of entreprenurial  creativity and aspiration, and the conversion of investment  operating forces, have sharply strengthened the public oversight  and restraint mechanisms for investment, promoting a steady  increase in investment microeconomic efficiency. In contrast to  a single financing means, this is a great advance.    But it needs to be noted that for the ordinary small and  midsize investor, these investment means also involve many  adverse factors. 1. In industrial investment, as the public  lacks the knowledge and skill to do feasibility studies of  projects, the ability to make accurate market analyses and  projections, modern business management techniques, and the  capability to utilize advanced ST, this unavoidably creates  unchecked and duplicate investment in enterprises, thus making  it hard to avoid poor investment efficiency, and even the risk  of bankruptcy. Moreover, as such investments are small, it is  hard to make decentralized and package investments, thus making  it difficult to disperse and reduce investment risks. Also, due  probably to the ulterior motives and fraudulent fundraising of  certain private enterprises, it is hard to keep public investors  from being cheated and engulfed by unfortunate evil  consequences. 2. In securities investment, as small investors  have no stock market knowledge, and inadequate investment might  for repeated investment in many securities, the investment risks  are obvious. 3. Macroeconomically, small investments are adverse  to a rational pooling of construction funds, the control of  investment scale, the upgrading of investment structure and  improvement of efficiency, the optimum disposition of resources,  the stability and growth of stock markets, and even social  stability.    Reporter: Prosperity leads to thoughts of  investment. Since reform and opening, China's productive forces  have been developed sharply, with public and enterprise  self-accumulation growing steadily. Incomplete statistics show  the Chinese public to now have over 2 trillion yuan in financial  capital, an average of nearly 2,000 yuan a person, and almost  4,000 yuan a person in coastal zones, with enterprise self-owned  assets-accumulation also quite sizeable. What investment means  would you choose to effectively avoid risks and earn higher  returns?    Xu Zhantao: I hold that the development of a new  public pooled trust and investment means--investment funds, is  the more ideal option.    Investment funds are a unique means of fundraising,  differing  from fundraising through either bank savings and various bonds  or through stocks and stock rights, rather using fund shares or  beneficiary documents to raise funds from small and midsize  investors. While they have set terms (which stocks do not), they  do not have fixed, advance-set returns (which deposits and bonds  do). Moreover, they give investors some powers similar to  shareholders.    Investment funds are a unique investment means, being  neither  a simple credit investment or one in the shares of a single  enterprise, but rather a comprehensive investment integrating  creditor rights, property interests, and stock rights.    Investment funds are a unique investment-operation system.  While bank loans are a bonded debt credit system, and stock  investment is an ownership system, investment funds are a pooled  trust system, an expert agent investment-operation system in  which ""agents are entrusted with money management.""    Investment funds are a unique financial commodity and  investment instrument, being a financial commodity somewhere  between savings, deposits, bonds, and stocks, or a borderline,  composite financial commodity, and a comprehensive investment  instrument integrating stock rights, property interests, and  creditor rights.    Investment funds reflect unique, diversified economic  relations. Financial allocations reflect voluntary distribution  relations, bank deposits and all types of bonds reflect  intermediary relations between bonded debt and credit, and  stocks or stock rights reflect the relations between owners and  operators, while investment funds reflect diversified economic  relations among the four parties of investors, sponsors,  managers, and custodians.    It could be said that investment funds create a public,  pooled, trust-agent investment means between bank-credit  intermediate investment and public and individual direct  investment, being a popular, democratic, and collective  investment means. Their appearance will inevitably set off  another investment-system change, being bound to speed up the  formation of a new fundraising and investment mechanism, to make  the disposition of public resources more efficient and optimal.  This means will be more suited to the public investment needs  of a country like China with a huge population that is just  beginning to prosper, where individual assets are relatively  decentralized, and where most investors are small and midsize.    Reporter: It is understood that China now  has 45 investment funds of all types, with funds topping 4.2  billion yuan. What do you believe is the significance and impact  of the birth and development of this new investment means suited  to public investment?    Xu Zhantao: While its significance is multiple, it  is mainly: 1. It will contribute to further investment-system  change, strengthening public oversight and restraint forces for  investment; 2. It will help to intensify financial reform,  promoting a rational adjustment of our national  financial-capital structure, and lowering commercial-bank risk;  3. It will be favorable to stock market stability and  development, reducing blind with-the-wave transactions by and  short-supply manipulation of small and midsize investors; 4. It  will benefit the attraction of foreign investment, expanding  foreign-investment scale, limits, and targets, without turning  China's foreign-currency debt into a case of killing many birds  with one stone; 5. It will be advantageous to macroeconomic  regulation and control. As investment funds are a standardized  means of public fundraising, the state can regulate, control,  and guide them to regulate, control, and guide stock markets. In  contrast to regulating hundreds of thousands of small and  midsize investors to stabilize stock markets, this will be much  easier and produce much better results.     "

Speaking at a conference in Johannesburg, Mr Modise said South Africa would support the establishment of regional security alliances to help prevent armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. But he noted that South Africa would not undertake any peace-keeping duties unilaterally. The announcement, which marks the first time South Africa has publicly committed itself to a military role outside its borders, has fuelled speculation that the country, which has by far the most powerful army in the region, might share in a peace-keeping force in Angola to help bolster the peace treaty signed last weekend between the Angolan government and the rebel Unita movement.

South African nationals such as Gary Player, Mark McNulty, Fulton Allem and  David Frost come and go as they please. International players play on South  Africa's thriving Sunshine circuit, which runs during South Africa's winter --  the Northern Hemisphere's summer.    For the most part, there are no restrictions on golfers. But there are  exceptions. In 1988, the Spanish government banned all South Africans from  competing in sports events in that country, sending the Spanish Open into  controversy when the tournament director refused to bar six South African  golfers. New Zealand, Canada and most of Asia and Africa have similar policies.    Sweden's prohibition is more broad -- the country denies a visa to any athlete  who has competed in South Africa. Sweden's two tour stops are minus several  dozen players because of this.    Many players don't mind the restrictions and say they will never give up the  South African tour.    Mark James, a European Ryder Cup player from Great Britain, is a longtime  player on the Sunshine circuit. He played in the Protea Assurance South Africa  Open in Cape Town in January and had no apologies for being there.    ""First of all, I'm no politician,"" James said. ""I'm a golfer and I go where I  can play golf in civilized conditions. And despite what views people have of  South Africa, it is a civilized country both on the golf course and off it.    ""I've been coming to South Africa during our winters for the past eight or nine  years and I find it prepares me for the tough European tour. I can relax in the  winter sun of South Africa, and unless I'm formally ordered not to tour, I will  continue to spend my winters here.""    There are only a few sports left where international sanctions don't exist.  Boxing is one, auto racing another.    Professional boxers may compete anywhere they please and frequently fight in  South Africa or Sun City, a nominally independent area. Not all choose to do  so, however. Lloyd Honeyghan relinquished his World Boxing Assn. welterweight  title in 1987 rather than fight South African Harold Volbrecht.    Of the five international governing bodies for professional boxing, the World  Boxing Council is the only one with an official policy toward South Africa. The  WBC will not sanction South African fighters, and any WBC boxer who fights in  South Africa will be dropped from the WBC rankings, never to be ranked again.    The WBC even extends its policy to non-active boxers: In 1988, the WBC voted to  censure former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta because he visited South  Africa.    South African heavyweight Gerrie Coetzee, a former WBA champion, sidestepped  much potential criticism during his career by condemning apartheid early on.  Coetzee, who is white, frequently fought black boxers and hated the  color-conscious reference of ""Great White Hope.""    ""I want to be the people's champ,"" Coetzee told Sports Illustrated in 1984. ""I  want to get rid of this rubbish of black champion, white champion. We're all  human, praying to the same Lord, going to the same place if we are good.""    Auto racing has only one place to go in South Africa, the Kyalami race track,  which has been on the Formula One circuit. In fact, Kyalami is the only  licensed motor racing circuit in Africa and has been refurbished this year to  conform to Formula One safety standards. Kyalami has not staged a Grand Prix  since 1985, because of safety problems.    If it reopens, Kyalami might stage its future Grand Prix with neighboring  countries, so it might be called an African, not South African, event.    ""Within the world political context, the feeling of a new era of reform in  South Africa will make it easier for our application to be considered,"" the  track manager said.

Sweden's two tour stops are minus several  dozen players because of this.    Many players don't mind the restrictions and say they will never give up the  South African tour.    Mark James, a European Ryder Cup player from Great Britain, is a longtime  player on the Sunshine circuit. He played in the Protea Assurance South Africa  Open in Cape Town in January and had no apologies for being there.    ""First of all, I'm no politician,"" James said. ""I'm a golfer and I go where I  can play golf in civilized conditions. And despite what views people have of  South Africa, it is a civilized country both on the golf course and off it.    ""I've been coming to South Africa during our winters for the past eight or nine  years and I find it prepares me for the tough European tour. I can relax in the  winter sun of South Africa, and unless I'm formally ordered not to tour, I will  continue to spend my winters here.""    There are only a few sports left where international sanctions don't exist.  Boxing is one, auto racing another.    Professional boxers may compete anywhere they please and frequently fight in  South Africa or Sun City, a nominally independent area. Not all choose to do  so, however. Lloyd Honeyghan relinquished his World Boxing Assn. welterweight  title in 1987 rather than fight South African Harold Volbrecht.    Of the five international governing bodies for professional boxing, the World  Boxing Council is the only one with an official policy toward South Africa. The  WBC will not sanction South African fighters, and any WBC boxer who fights in  South Africa will be dropped from the WBC rankings, never to be ranked again.    The WBC even extends its policy to non-active boxers: In 1988, the WBC voted to  censure former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta because he visited South  Africa.    South African heavyweight Gerrie Coetzee, a former WBA champion, sidestepped  much potential criticism during his career by condemning apartheid early on.  Coetzee, who is white, frequently fought black boxers and hated the  color-conscious reference of ""Great White Hope.""    ""I want to be the people's champ,"" Coetzee told Sports Illustrated in 1984. ""I  want to get rid of this rubbish of black champion, white champion. We're all  human, praying to the same Lord, going to the same place if we are good.""    Auto racing has only one place to go in South Africa, the Kyalami race track,  which has been on the Formula One circuit. In fact, Kyalami is the only  licensed motor racing circuit in Africa and has been refurbished this year to  conform to Formula One safety standards. Kyalami has not staged a Grand Prix  since 1985, because of safety problems.    If it reopens, Kyalami might stage its future Grand Prix with neighboring  countries, so it might be called an African, not South African, event.    ""Within the world political context, the feeling of a new era of reform in  South Africa will make it easier for our application to be considered,"" the  track manager said.

0,FT944-618 ,"FT944-618 _AN-ELXAIADSFT 941224   FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (International Equity Markets): Players and stayers in a game of extremes - There was money to be made on global equity markets for those quick on their feet, but the unwary found a multitude of traps      By MICHAEL MORGAN   Is playing the markets worthwhile - or should you just get a broad spread and stay put? Anyone investing in the World Index in January would have seen little return from their initial stake. But an inspired trader could have done far better. Michael Morgan's hypothetical Foresight Fund shows how an international manager who made all the right switches would have trebled his money.  But don't get too excited: the equally hypothetical Hindsight Fund shows his accident-prone colleague losing almost 80 per cent of his initial capital. It has been the best of times, and the worst, in the world equities markets this year. Those able to read political runes, forecast currency movements and spot improving economic trends found there was money to be made. But sudden and aggressive shifts in asset allocations by some of the big global investors, and the recurrent theme of rising US interest rates, have hovered in the background to trap the unwary. The Foresight Fund has, however, lived up to its name: indeed, it could not have done better. The fund ignored the blandishments of those proffering bonds, cash and commodities as alternative investments and remained full-bloodedly in equities. Allocations were switched each month, with returns calculated in dollar terms, as measured by the FT-Actuaries world indices. The strategy has been, quite simply, to be invested fully in the month's best market. JANUARY: Finland, Europe's best performer in 1993, had more miles to run as a sharp slide in interest rates prompted a shift out of bank deposits and into mutual funds. Optimism grew about the economic outlook, and foreigners continued to buy as a strengthening local currency also increased substantially the market's attraction for the dollar investor. FEBRUARY: There was a switch to Malaysia, 1993's best market overall, as Kuala Lumpur put in a renewed spurt after the previous month's profit-taking. MARCH: Hopes of a political re-birth grew in Italy as media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi arrived on the scene ahead of the general election at the end of the month. Enthusiasm for Italian shares seemed unbounded, with some analysts talking in extravagant terms of the market's potential to rise. APRIL: South Africa came into focus, also on the election theme. European funds, which had begun flowing in after Nelson Mandela was released from prison, were augmented by American money around the turn of the year as the last of the US city, county and state restrictions on pension fund investment in South Africa were lifted. April's spurt accompanied the appearance of specialist funds for South African investment from several leading US money managers. MAY: Hong Kong was good value after the ravages of the early part of the year. Worries about the health of the senior Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, were put aside as US and European investors returned, cheered by US interest rate developments and plans to resume Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's airport. JUNE: Austria went to the polls to decide whether to join the European Union and the market rose strongly ahead of the result, anticipating (correctly) a 'yes' vote. JULY: Finland re-asserted its presence, powered higher by Nokia, the world's second largest maker of mobile phones, which accounts for more than a quarter of Helsinki's total FM180bn market capitalisation. Nokia's share price has more than doubled this year in response to booming sales and surging profits. AUGU Malaysia rallied after the declines in previous months on expectations of a good corporate profits outlook, take-over speculation, and moves by the central bank to spur investment, particularly by foreigners. SEPTEMBER: Singapore had its moment of glory on the prospect of new foreign money coming into the market in the form of Asian equity mutual funds. OCTOBER: Finland was again the best performer. NOVEMBER: Mexico's appearance at the top of the league table, as President Carlos Salinas de Gotari prepared to hand over power to President-elect Ernesto Zedillo after the election, was not so much a reflection of a strong run in the country as an indication of poor performance elsewhere. DECEMBER: Norway's vote against membership of the European Union at the end of November at least dispelled one important source of uncertainty and had been largely factored into the market already. The removal of remaining laws discriminating against foreign shareholders was another positive factor. Not a bad year overall, however, and as the chart (above/below) shows, each Dollars 100 invested in January has now grown to Dollars 305.22. Regrettably, the best that can be said for the Hindsight Fund is that it is easy to see now where it went wrong. It has, on a monthly basis, shown an unerring ability to select the world's worst-performing market. JANUARY: Kuala Lumpur was the world's best market in 1993, rising by 126 per cent. But it then fell prey to worries that it had risen too far, too fast. Comments to this effect by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister, were followed by central bank measures to sap liquidity and flush out hot money in the banking system. FEBRUARY: Hong Kong, the world's second-best performer in 1993, traditionally rallies into the lunar new year, and this seemed a safe bet again after the traumas of January when a number of US and Japanese banks and brokers advised clients to cut their holdings. But hopes were not fulfilled as US speculators played the futures market, destabilising the cash markets, and worries about higher US interest rates put a cap on the market's advances. MARCH: Renewed life in Kuala Lumpur during February raised hopes that it might be back on the upward path. The opposite proved true as the Pergau dam row with Britain erupted and foreign investors again took the opportunity to cash in some of their massive profits from 1993. APRIL: Hong Kong took another tumble over such worries as US interest rates, who might succeed Deng Xiaoping, the outlook for Sino-British relations, and US renewal of most-favoured nation status for China. MAY: Italy turned back from an eight-year high as election euphoria waned and protracted negotiations over the composition of the new government gave a hint of problems to come. JUNE: Political traumas as Mexico began to prepare for August's presidential election, on top of a sliding currency, took their toll. JULY: Foreign investors took advantage of the strength of the yen to take profits in Tokyo, while domestic Japanese investors worried about the depressing effect of the high currency on the country's exporters. AUGU A raft of disappointing corporate results, including the 85 per cent drop in pre-tax profits reported by Den Dansk Bank, Denmark's largest, took Copenhagen lower. SEPTEMBER: Weak German bonds, particularly in the second half, and the shadow of the coming Federal election, left Frankfurt wanting. OCTOBER: Re-evaluation of Mexico's political situation after the murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, unnerved the market early. Worse than expected third-quarter results from Telmex, the market bellwether, compounded the misery later. NOVEMBER: Hong Kong started the month with its biggest one-day rise in two months. But recurrent worries about the outlook for US interest rates, and asset re-allocations by a number of banks and brokers, took the colony back into negative territory. DECEMBER: Mexico was back in the frame as the financial crisis facing the new government intensified and the peso fell sharply, undermining the value of any attempt at a rally by the stock market. By Thursday night, Dollars 100 invested in January was down to just Dollars 21.47. So, what are the lessons to be learned from this year's experience? First, that past experience really is no guide to future performance. Second, perhaps, that while hindsight usually is beneficial, a little foresight can prove a great deal more profitable.  ----------------------------------------- YEAR'S BEST PERFORMING MARKETS (DOLLARS TERMS)  ----------------------------------------- Country                 Per cent  ----------------------------------------- Finland                   +43.88 South Africa              +23.96 Japan                     +18.89 Sweden                    +17.02 Norway                    +14.93  ----------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  -----------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------- YEAR'S WORST PERFORMING MARKETS (DOLLARS TERMS)  ----------------------------------------- Country                 Per cent  ----------------------------------------- Mexico                    -40.28 Hong Kong                 -31.66 Malaysia                  -17.94 France                     -6.71 United Kingdom             -5.47  ----------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  -----------------------------------------   Countries:-  FIZ  Finland, West Europe.

In Washington yesterday, Mr Trevor Manuel, South African trade and industry minister, said that the US and South African governments are working on various bilateral initiatives, including an investment pact, a double taxation treaty, and a conference in Atlanta to start tomorrow. South Africa plans to hold its largest trade exposition ever, on September 20-23 in New York City's convention centre. This will feature 150 South African businesses from a broad range of industries, including clothing, textile, furniture, domestic appliances, base materials, agricultural and industrial equipment, banking and financial services. Mr Manuel said the new government expects companies doing business in South Africa to adhere voluntarily to affirmative action plans for women and black people. The US commerce department, believing South Africa to be the key to trade in all of southern Africa, has marked the country for special attention by putting it on its list of 10 Emerging Markets, where it expects exports to grow the most. Also, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation is increasing its investment insurance in South Africa to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m).

0,FT933-556 ,"FT933-556 _AN-DI1CRAGYFT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): The man who beat the widow's curse - Economics      By ANDREW TYRIE   AUSTIN ROBINSON: THE LIFE OF AN ECONOMIC ADVISER Sir Alec Cairncross St Martins Press Pounds 40 198 pages THIS BOOK has a strong flavour of autobiography. Sir Alec Cairncross has drawn heavily on Austin Robinson's personal papers, supplemented by long letters from him, commenting on the draft. Much of the best in the book comes from the horse's mouth. It is the story of one of the last of the great Cambridge economists who worked closely with Keynes between the wars. No theorist, Robinson's lasting contributions came mainly as an organiser, helping to found the Central Statistical Office, launching the International Economic Association, participating in the creation of the Overseas Development Institute, editing the Economic Journal for over a quarter of a century. He also flew the earliest flying boats, taught a juvenile Maharajah, and advised governments for over a decade. Drawn to Keynes' Cambridge circus (as it afterwards became known) Robinson made his mark by, among other things shattering the 'Widow's Curse' fallacy which had caught Keynes' imagination. This held that when a businessman made profits, those profits would not be depleted because by spending them they would force up prices, creating profits for other businessmen. Robinson is generally supposed to have been the one who pointed out that output might rise instead of prices. As he said: 'If an entrepreneur loaded with profits decided on his way home to have a shoe shine, was the effect solely to raise the price of shoe shines, rather than affect the number of shoes shone?' Although he contributed a good deal to the economic debates of his time, not least with his book Monopoly and early work on development economIcs, an interest stirred by two years in India and an extended visit to the Zambian Copper Belt, he has not left a clearly indelible mark on economic thought in the way that has his more theoretical wife, Joan. His gift was for rigorous analysis of a particular problem without recourse to an overarching theory but with the clear determination to find answers which could be translated into policy. So it is right that this book should be subtitled The Life of an Economic Adviser. It seems he first flirted with the idea of working in government as early as 1931. That came to nothing, and it was the war which brought him in. He was influential in the preparation of the first set of national accounts and heavily involved in translating lessons learnt from war-time planning into peace-time purposes. Robinson doubted that investment could be directed by price signals alone. Planning could regulate disequilibria 'by administrative and budgetary action and by control of investment, more quickly than would happen through the ordinary operations of the price mechanism'. In this, and in other ideas, such as his espousal of import controls and complacency about the sustainability of growth, he marched with the times. It is as a product of his times that some of his observations make entertaining reading. On a comparison of Indian and African servants: 'These (African) people are incredibly inept and noisy servants and clat around the room . . . in India where servants are perfect we say 'this is evidently a servile race. They can't rule themselves'; in South Africa we say 'these people can't even lay a table. How can they run a country?'' There is less about his wife than might have been expected. From the war time on it seems they lived apart in a large Cambridge house. We learn that this most famous of female economists 'slept, summer and winter, in the garden shed, which was open to the winds, while the tits lined their nests with her hair'. In spite of some repetition this is a useful guide to the atmosphere of inter-war and post-war intellectual economic life. It is not hagiography but a tribute, enlivened by the diaries and letters of the man himself.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.

0,FT932-477 ,"FT932-477 _AN-DF2CGABKFT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / South Africa and EC begin reconciliation: The shaping of post-sanctions relations      By PHILIP GAWITH   AS South Africa moves into the post-sanctions era, aid, trade and political relations are being shaped with a crucial partner - the European Community. At a conference under way in Brussels both the European Commission and the South African government are laying out their stalls. Notwithstanding the tortuous progress of constitutional negotiations, Community officials accept that a new South Africa is emerging, and they are determined to be an important player in the post-apartheid process. There is already a substantial base of trade and investment relations to build on. Figures from the department of customs and excise show that in 1992 38.5 per cent, R46bn (Pounds 9.5bn) of a total R119.4bn visible trade, was with Europe. This compares with 34 per cent in 1985, before sanctions were implemented in earnest. European countries also account for most of the foreign investment in South Africa. The most recent available figures from the Reserve Bank (end 1988) show that of the cumulative R70bn foreign investment in the country by individuals and corporations, about 50 per cent came from Europe. The EC is also a significant donor to South Africa. The 1993 EC aid budget to South Africa is Ecu90m (Pounds 70.7m), its largest budget in Africa. Diplomatic links between South Africa and the EC are less developed. There is no formal diplomatic treaty and the EC is not formally present in Pretoria other than to administer its aid programme. Upgrading these links is important to South Africa, however, as the imprimatur of full diplomatic relations will improve the climate for trade and investment. Recent years have seen increasing efforts at diversification, mostly eastwards, of South Africa's trading links. Thus 20 per cent of South Africa's total trade in 1992 was with Asia, compared with 14.7 per cent in 1985. Taiwan has risen from nowhere to be one of South Africa's top 10 trading partners. Among South Africa's priorities in talks with Brussels will be what sort of trade preferences it should seek from the EC, which could affect 20 per cent of exports, most notably those from labour-intensive agriculture. The extent of preferences will depend on what sort of trading status South Africa is granted. Although a per capita annual income of about Dollars 2,300 ranks it as an upper middle-income developing country, other indicators - such as infant mortality, literacy, and reliance on a few commodity exports - are associated more with developing countries. At the conference yesterday Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve (central) Bank, said South Africa should consider seeking developing country status. 'I do not think that will decrease our credibility, but it will help us to develop the country much faster,' he said. His remarks, which were made in a personal capacity, echo the view on this issue held among others by Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president. At recent Gatt discussions in Geneva, however, Japan and the US gave notice that they would not support South Africa being given developing country status. It was advised to seek 'economy in transition' status, such as has been given to various east European countries, which affords similar benefits granted to developing countries, but on a less permanent basis. Given this background, South Africa will probably try to negotiate some specially tailored package of preferences with the EC rather than try to join the Lome Convention, a trade concession deal between a grouping of developing countries and industrialised countries. The latter route would cause all sorts of complications, as Lome's existing 80 members, all of whom are smaller and less developed than South Africa, would understandably oppose granting benefits to South Africa which, to some extent, would come at their expense. Included in this group are all of South Africa's neighbours. The EC has already made clear that its policy towards South Africa will be premised on viewing South Africa as part of the southern Africa region. Although there are growing ties between South Africa and its neighbours, the issue of how to integrate it into regional structures, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) is fraught with excessive expectations of what South Africa can do for the rest of the region and fears that it will dominate the others. South Africa accounts for about 75 per cent of regional gross domestic product. Although the shape of future South Africa/EC relations lies mostly in the hands of Brussels - where the extent of any concessions will be decided - their success will be determined in Pretoria. For South Africa's future will ultimately turn on whether its politicians can create a favourable climate for investment. If they fail in that, the rest will count for little.

Rwanda and Burundi were listed as being extreme cases, and in need of continued international aid and 'extreme agricultural rehabilitation'. The report also said famine conditions were emerging in several parts of the Horn of Africa including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan. Mr Diouf, a Senegalese who is the FAO's first African director-general, will address a 49-nation governing council, which is meeting for 10 days to discuss and vote on a range of agency business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     South Africa is currently under a mandatory arms export embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council, and is a proscribed destination for exports of defense articles and services pursuant to 22 CFR 126.1. However, it is contemplated that the embargo may end once certain events take place. Because of this, the Department of State will now consider, on a case-by-case basis, granting licenses and approvals for proposals to sell defense articles and defense services to South Africa and to export the minimum amount of basic operations and maintenance technical data necessary to support such proposals, so long as assurances are received that this data will be used in support of such proposals and for no other purpose. Approvals for the export of the aforementioned technical data will only be granted if the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, receives reliable assurances from the foreign end-user that it will only use the technical data for evaluation and informational purposes related to the proposed sale, and not for any other purposes. The Department of State will not grant licenses for the actual sale or export of defense articles and defense services (other than for the aforementioned technical data and for exceptions in accordance with current policy as provided for in 126.1(c)) while the U.N. arms embargo against South Africa and U.S. regulations prohibiting the export to South Africa of defense articles and services are in force.           Section 126.1(e) also provides that any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposal to sell or transfer to a country referred to in 126.1, or to any person acting on its behalf, any defense articles, defense services or technical data subject to the ITAR must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Effective immediately, this requirement no longer applies to South Africa. However, the obligation to inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls of actual sales or transfers to South Africa remains in place.     The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include proposals, within the meaning of 22 CFR 126.1(e), to sell or transfer defense articles and services. This policy also covers licenses and approvals to export the minimum basic technical data in the form of operations and maintenance information related to a defense article or service which is necessary to support a sales proposal. For this purpose, a proposal is defined as the communication of information in sufficient detail to permit an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into a manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. This would include a presentation which describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery. This policy does not cover technical data which discloses the details of design, development, production or manufacture of any defense item. Nor does it permit the use, with respect to articles originating in or for export to South Africa, of any exemptions except those already permitted by 126.1 (i.e., 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13)). Furthermore, the requirements of 126.8, regarding proposals to foreign persons relating to significant military equipment, remain in place.     This action has been taken pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and 126.7 of the ITAR in furtherance of the foreign policy of the United States.

The offer to privatise 12 medium-sized and 31 small oilfields is part of the government's policy to involve private investment, particularly direct foreign investment, in the hydrocarbon sector, to supplement the inadequate resources of the government-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Oil India. Foreign oil exploration companies would get income tax relief and would be levied 50 per cent income tax without surcharge, as opposed to 65 per cent in other lines of business.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Keith Diepraam was 20 years old in 1964 when he competed in his first Davis Cup  tennis match. Norway was playing host to South Africa. There had been some  trouble with anti-apartheid protesters before the South African team arrived,  but no one had any idea the situation would get so out of hand.    The security around the competition site was massive, but so was the group of  anti-South African protesters. Spectators had to walk through a hail of  leaflets to get into the stadium. It didn't stop inside -- the protesters had  bought tickets, too.    Diepraam was warming up for his match on center court when he heard a whistle.  Suddenly, there was a rush of people around him. In moments, anti-apartheid  activists were sitting all over the tennis court, forming a sea of protesters  through which Diepraam and his Norwegian opponent appeared to be be wading.    Diepraam still has a news photograph taken at the time. In it, he is looking at  all the people and laughing, with a slightly bewildered look.    Twenty-six years later, tennis officials in South Africa are still bewildered,  but they are no longer laughing. Some believe they have been betrayed by their  international federation, abandoned by professional tennis players and  manipulated by sports administrators with an agenda heavy on politics and  personal ambition.    Tennis in South Africa is an interesting study of the before and after of  international sanctions. While other sports, primarily those in the Olympic  Games, faced elaborate bans and boycotts, South African tennis players at one  time were free to travel the world to compete. And although there were some  protests, they were mainly restricted to Davis Cup competition, in which  players represented their countries.    So, in a nation of sports isolation, South African tennis and its professional  players happily globetrotted while other athletes stayed home. In fact, given  South Africa's mild climate, tennis thrived. South Africa has produced such  stars as Frew McMillan, Bob Hewitt, Ray Moore, Kevin Curren, Johan Kriek, Cliff  Drysdale, Ros Fairbank and Christo van Rensburg.    That was the before. The after began last January, when the International  Olympic Committee ruled that any tennis player who played in South Africa would  not be eligible to compete in the Olympics. Tennis became a medal sport in  1988.    The ruling has forced many of the world's tennis players to make a difficult  decision. South African tennis tournaments have not only tradition and  hospitality but also very competitive purses. Also, in the past, the South  African Grand Prix tournaments were important to players because they award  points that go toward determining who will play in the men's year-ending  Masters tournament, in which only the top eight singles players in the world  compete.    American Brad Gilbert came under fire in 1987 for playing in a tournament at  Johannesburg two weeks before the Masters, to earn enough points to qualify for  the latter event. American Tim Mayotte was battling Gilbert for the eighth and  final spot but chose not to play in South Africa. And because of previous  commitments, Mayotte could not play in another tournament the next week, the  last week to earn points, thereby failing to qualify for the Masters.    These very different decisions were subjected to intense scrutiny.    Mayotte chose not to play in South Africa because he had already drawn the ire  of anti-apartheid groups when he played there several years previously. For  that, Mayotte had been placed on a United Nations blacklist, but he was not  alone. Some of tennis' brightest stars have at some point been on it, including  Chris Evert and Boris Becker.    Gilbert argued that his decision to play in South Africa had nothing to do with  politics, but everything to do with his job.    ""I'm a tennis player and not a politician,"" he said in an interview in New York  in 1987. ""I don't think sports and politics should be mixed. I went to  Johannesburg because I needed points to qualify for the Masters. I'd have gone  to the moon to get here. If I hadn't gone to Johannesburg, I'd be sitting on  the sidelines now.""    South African tennis did not have a good year in 1989. First, the revamped  Assn. of Tennis Professionals, the men's pro tour now run by the players,  scheduled two stops in South Africa for the following year. Then the ATP  canceled the tournaments for ""moral and practical reasons,"" according to ATP  President Vijay Amritraj.    The ATP's player council was widely criticized for scheduling the events and in  August held a five-hour discussion on the subject. Leading the group arguing to  remove the tournaments from the 1990 schedule was former Wimbledon champion  Arthur Ashe.    After the decision to pull out, Amritraj said: ""For the last six or eight  months, we had this question asked of us everywhere, all around the world. It  overshadowed everything we had done with the tour. These two events were  canceled for the good of the tour. The Olympics are a major factor, so is the  United Nations boycott, and the fact that South Africa is not a respected  member of the world sports community.""    Meanwhile, satellite events in South Africa, lesser tournaments for which  players receive points in the ATP rankings, continue.    About a month after the ATP decision, the International Tennis Federation  suspended South Africa as an associate member until the country dismantles  apartheid.    When tennis joined the Olympic family, it also got its rules. Ray Moore, a  former touring pro from South Africa and a former chairman of the Men's  International Professional Tennis Council, said the day tennis entered the  Olympics was the day South African tennis was dealt a deadly blow.    ""There are a lot of negative things that have come down on our heads directly  because of tennis getting into the Olympics,"" Moore said. He lives in Palm  Springs and was back in South Africa for a brief meeting with the South African  Tennis Union regarding a junior program he is coordinating.    ""We certainly didn't need it. We were going along quite nicely. Yes, our  players overseas were restricted from playing in some countries. They weren't  happy about it, but they were grateful. They could play in half of Western  Europe. They could compete in 50-60 tournaments a year. They could accept that.    ""We've been lucky in our sport. We've escaped the wrath of SANROC (South  African Non Racial Olympic Committee, a London-based anti-apartheid lobby) and  the other organizations that have tried to stop international sport in this  country. Now, that's changed. Tennis is in the Olympics, and all of a sudden,  professional tennis in this country comes under the microscope of the Olympic  Charter. I have very, very strong views about that. I think it's steeped in  hypocrisy. What the ITF has done is hypocritical in the extreme.""    Moore believes that ITF President Phillipe Chatrier worked with Juan Antonio  Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, to get tennis into  the Games because Samaranch loves tennis. He had promised to help Chatrier  become an IOC representative. So, the personal agenda of these two men changed  tennis forever.    South Africa was a founding member of the ITF in 1913 and has been in Davis Cup  competition since its inception. Yet since apartheid was installed in South  Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis  community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by  default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history.    India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years  later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition.    American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic  of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South  Africa.    McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never  play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who  have U.S. citizenship.    Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the  Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli  players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing  apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa.    A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he  didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge.    The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently.  Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as  targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had  worked out a ""secret strategy"" to do this.    The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a  combination of increased vigilance and louder protests.    The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure.    Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on  center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament  were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South  African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security  guard.    There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have  been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a  policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals.  There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South  African athletes.    ""We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have  competition,"" Moore said. ""If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A  good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer  send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's  participation in international tennis events.    ""They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union).  They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced  nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first  round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their  minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis.  From that time forward, they have produced players.""    South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial.    By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from  playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular  among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game  financially out of reach for most black South Africans.    Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU  has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric  and reality is vast.    Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of  2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts.    The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto.  Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished.    In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away,  and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged  shoulders.    A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a  wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view.    But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims  that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little  evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and  Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair.    ""They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how,"" said  Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand  at a cracked and peeling court. ""Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on  that.""    Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and  coping with sanctions take their toll.    He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure.    ""It's like you have a naughty child,"" he said. ""You have a naughty child and  you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time  when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a  monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and  spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done  everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've  come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?""    Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning  with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis  courts in white areas.    They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until  apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white  areas only further segregates the sport, they say.    All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current  situation.    ""South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that,"" Moore said. ""I'm not  proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which  I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category,  and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human  rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that  are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya  to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of  the sky.    ""Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S.  will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in  those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no  way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?""      Photo, Keith Diepraam (right) and Norway's Fin Dag Jagge watch anti-apartheid  protest at 1964 Davis Cup match at Oslo.

Some believe they have been betrayed by their  international federation, abandoned by professional tennis players and  manipulated by sports administrators with an agenda heavy on politics and  personal ambition.    Tennis in South Africa is an interesting study of the before and after of  international sanctions. While other sports, primarily those in the Olympic  Games, faced elaborate bans and boycotts, South African tennis players at one  time were free to travel the world to compete. And although there were some  protests, they were mainly restricted to Davis Cup competition, in which  players represented their countries.    So, in a nation of sports isolation, South African tennis and its professional  players happily globetrotted while other athletes stayed home. In fact, given  South Africa's mild climate, tennis thrived. South Africa has produced such  stars as Frew McMillan, Bob Hewitt, Ray Moore, Kevin Curren, Johan Kriek, Cliff  Drysdale, Ros Fairbank and Christo van Rensburg.    That was the before. The after began last January, when the International  Olympic Committee ruled that any tennis player who played in South Africa would  not be eligible to compete in the Olympics. Tennis became a medal sport in  1988.    The ruling has forced many of the world's tennis players to make a difficult  decision. South African tennis tournaments have not only tradition and  hospitality but also very competitive purses. Also, in the past, the South  African Grand Prix tournaments were important to players because they award  points that go toward determining who will play in the men's year-ending  Masters tournament, in which only the top eight singles players in the world  compete.    American Brad Gilbert came under fire in 1987 for playing in a tournament at  Johannesburg two weeks before the Masters, to earn enough points to qualify for  the latter event. American Tim Mayotte was battling Gilbert for the eighth and  final spot but chose not to play in South Africa. And because of previous  commitments, Mayotte could not play in another tournament the next week, the  last week to earn points, thereby failing to qualify for the Masters.    These very different decisions were subjected to intense scrutiny.    Mayotte chose not to play in South Africa because he had already drawn the ire  of anti-apartheid groups when he played there several years previously. For  that, Mayotte had been placed on a United Nations blacklist, but he was not  alone. Some of tennis' brightest stars have at some point been on it, including  Chris Evert and Boris Becker.    Gilbert argued that his decision to play in South Africa had nothing to do with  politics, but everything to do with his job.    ""I'm a tennis player and not a politician,"" he said in an interview in New York  in 1987. ""I don't think sports and politics should be mixed. I went to  Johannesburg because I needed points to qualify for the Masters. I'd have gone  to the moon to get here. If I hadn't gone to Johannesburg, I'd be sitting on  the sidelines now.""    South African tennis did not have a good year in 1989. First, the revamped  Assn. of Tennis Professionals, the men's pro tour now run by the players,  scheduled two stops in South Africa for the following year. Then the ATP  canceled the tournaments for ""moral and practical reasons,"" according to ATP  President Vijay Amritraj.    The ATP's player council was widely criticized for scheduling the events and in  August held a five-hour discussion on the subject. Leading the group arguing to  remove the tournaments from the 1990 schedule was former Wimbledon champion  Arthur Ashe.    After the decision to pull out, Amritraj said: ""For the last six or eight  months, we had this question asked of us everywhere, all around the world. It  overshadowed everything we had done with the tour. These two events were  canceled for the good of the tour. The Olympics are a major factor, so is the  United Nations boycott, and the fact that South Africa is not a respected  member of the world sports community.""    Meanwhile, satellite events in South Africa, lesser tournaments for which  players receive points in the ATP rankings, continue.    About a month after the ATP decision, the International Tennis Federation  suspended South Africa as an associate member until the country dismantles  apartheid.    When tennis joined the Olympic family, it also got its rules. Ray Moore, a  former touring pro from South Africa and a former chairman of the Men's  International Professional Tennis Council, said the day tennis entered the  Olympics was the day South African tennis was dealt a deadly blow.    ""There are a lot of negative things that have come down on our heads directly  because of tennis getting into the Olympics,"" Moore said. He lives in Palm  Springs and was back in South Africa for a brief meeting with the South African  Tennis Union regarding a junior program he is coordinating.    ""We certainly didn't need it. We were going along quite nicely. Yes, our  players overseas were restricted from playing in some countries. They weren't  happy about it, but they were grateful. They could play in half of Western  Europe. They could compete in 50-60 tournaments a year. They could accept that.    ""We've been lucky in our sport. We've escaped the wrath of SANROC (South  African Non Racial Olympic Committee, a London-based anti-apartheid lobby) and  the other organizations that have tried to stop international sport in this  country. Now, that's changed. Tennis is in the Olympics, and all of a sudden,  professional tennis in this country comes under the microscope of the Olympic  Charter. I have very, very strong views about that. I think it's steeped in  hypocrisy. What the ITF has done is hypocritical in the extreme.""    Moore believes that ITF President Phillipe Chatrier worked with Juan Antonio  Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, to get tennis into  the Games because Samaranch loves tennis. He had promised to help Chatrier  become an IOC representative. So, the personal agenda of these two men changed  tennis forever.    South Africa was a founding member of the ITF in 1913 and has been in Davis Cup  competition since its inception. Yet since apartheid was installed in South  Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis  community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by  default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history.    India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years  later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition.    American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic  of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South  Africa.    McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never  play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who  have U.S. citizenship.    Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the  Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli  players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing  apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa.    A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he  didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge.    The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently.  Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as  targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had  worked out a ""secret strategy"" to do this.    The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a  combination of increased vigilance and louder protests.    The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure.    Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on  center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament  were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South  African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security  guard.    There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have  been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a  policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals.  There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South  African athletes.    ""We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have  competition,"" Moore said. ""If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A  good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer  send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's  participation in international tennis events.    ""They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union).  They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced  nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first  round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their  minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis.  From that time forward, they have produced players.""    South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial.    By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from  playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular  among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game  financially out of reach for most black South Africans.    Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU  has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric  and reality is vast.    Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of  2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts.    The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto.  Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished.    In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away,  and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged  shoulders.    A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a  wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view.    But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims  that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little  evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and  Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair.    ""They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how,"" said  Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand  at a cracked and peeling court. ""Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on  that.""    Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and  coping with sanctions take their toll.    He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure.    ""It's like you have a naughty child,"" he said. ""You have a naughty child and  you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time  when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a  monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and  spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done  everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've  come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?""    Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning  with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis  courts in white areas.    They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until  apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white  areas only further segregates the sport, they say.    All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current  situation.    ""South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that,"" Moore said. ""I'm not  proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which  I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category,  and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human  rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that  are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya  to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of  the sky.    ""Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S.  will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in  those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no  way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?""      Photo, Keith Diepraam (right) and Norway's Fin Dag Jagge watch anti-apartheid  protest at 1964 Davis Cup match at Oslo.

President Museveni on his part said he is pleased that  Austria is assisting Uganda in the rehabilitation of the water  system in Kampala and hospitals around the country. He  emphasized that trade and investment, rather than aid for  Uganda, are more durable and sustainable forms of cooperation  between the two countries, and in this regard looks forward to  increased Austrian collaboration, which he said will be centerd  on business as well as other investment, to top up the abundant  potential the country has.

As of 1990, approximately 196 million tons of municipal solid waste were generated annually in the U.S., 16 percent of which (32 million tons) was combusted. The states with the greatest municipal waste combustion capacity are Florida, New York and Massachusetts. There are approximately 150 municipal waste combustors in the U.S., 80 percent of which are waste-to-energy facilities. The remaining 20 percent incinerate waste without recovering energy.  Approximately 25 percent (by weight) of the waste that is combusted remains as ash, amounting to around eight million tons of municipal waste combustor ash generated annually. Generally, these combustion facilities generate two basic types of ash_bottom ash and air pollution control residuals, commonly referred to as ``fly ash.'' Bottom ash collects at the bottom of the combustion unit and comprises approximately 7580% of the total ash. Fly ash collects in the air pollution control devices that ``clean'' the gases produced during the combustion of the waste and comprises around 2025% of the total. Based on several analytical studies, fly ash generally contains the highest concentrations of inorganic chemical constituents.  Studies also show that ash (usually fly ash) has sometimes exhibited EPA's Toxicity Characteristic (``TC''). Typically, ash that ``fails'' the TC leaches lead or cadmium above levels of concern. Because a number of factors can influence whether ash passes or fails the TC (e.g., the nature of the incoming waste stream, the type of combustion unit, the nature of the air pollution control device and the ash sampling location), EPA cannot predict an overall failure rate for ash from municipal waste combustors.      III. Extension of Permit Deadline Due to Substantial Confusion      A. Permit Requirements and Deadline Extensions      RCRA requires any person treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste to obtain a permit or a pre-permit authorization called ``interim status.'' Section 3005; 40 CFR 270.1(b). To qualify for interim status a facility must meet criteria set out in RCRA section 3005(e), which include filing a permit application.  When EPA promulgates RCRA rules subjecting a new group of facilities to hazardous waste permitting requirements, the permit regulations provide 6 months for the filing of part A of the permit application. 40 CFR 270.10 (e). EPA routinely publishes in the     Federal Register     the specific permit deadline for persons regulated by the new rules. See 270.10 (e), note. Section 270.10(e)(2) provides that EPA can extend the date for permit applications by     Federal Register     notice if it finds that there has been ``substantial confusion'' as to whether the owner or operator was required to file a permit application and the confusion was due to ambiguities in EPA's regulations. For the reasons explained below, EPA today is exercising its discretion to extend the submission dates for part A permit applications for facilities treating, storing and disposing of ash from waste-to-energy facilities that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste.      B. Regulatory History of Waste-to-Energy Ash      In 1980, EPA promulgated a rule exempting household wastes from all RCRA requirements for hazardous wastes. 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1). EPA interpreted this exemption to extend to residuals from the treatment of household wastes, including ash from the combustion of household wastes. The exemption, however, did not address ash from the combustion of household wastes combined with nonhazardous commercial and industrial wastes.  In 1984 Congress added to RCRA a new Section 3001(i), entitled ``Clarification of Household Waste Exemption.'' This provision addressed waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial and industrial wastes to produce energy. In July 1985, EPA promulgated a rule that codified this provision. In the preamble accompanying this rule, EPA announced that it interpreted the statute and the rule to exempt the facilities_but not their ash_from Subtitle C, 50 FR 28702, 2872526 (July 15, 1985). EPA did not publish any statement informing owners of facilities managing ash of any deadline for obtaining RCRA permits.       "
0,FT943-14820 ,"FT943-14820 _AN-EGMDEAA1FT 940713   FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: UK seeks to recoup South Africa ground      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Britain's trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, and 60 businessmen are in South Africa this week to try to recoup lost ground in what was once a leading trade partnership. Partly as a result of the UK Conservative party's resistance to sanctions during the apartheid era, British relations with the new government are weaker than with the old. At the same time the UK finds itself fourth in South Africa's trading league behind the US, Germany and Japan. Mr Heseltine's visit follows ones by US commerce secretary Ron Brown and French president Francois Mitterrand which have been seen as part of a drive to reap possible commercial rewards for those countries' support for sanctions during the anti-apartheid struggle. 'South Africa is now perceived as a country with which to do business,' says Mr John Doble, British consul-general in Johannesburg, who says British companies have made more than 60 investments since 1990. On the investment side, the UK has for more than a century remained unchallenged as South Africa's single biggest foreign investor with about R50bn (Pounds 8.8bn) in stock and assets. South Africans hold about R35bn in Britain. Two-way trade between the UK and South Africa amounted to R10.25bn in 1993 slightly in the UK's favour. Britain's imports are primarily of raw materials and food and vegetable products. It exports mostly pharmaceuticals, machinery and, more recently, telecommunications equipment. The UK Export Credits Guarantee Department already has Pounds 1.3bn in export credits outstanding in South Africa, the agency's fourth-biggest commitment. In the first four months of this year British exports to South Africa grew by 20.2 per cent. Imports from South Africa increased only 2.3 per cent, although some sectors, such as fruit and wine, are expected to grow by about 30 per cent for the year. In the defence sector, South Africa is known to be in the market for up to six navy corvettes worth about Pounds 1bn, and if Britain could secure the contract it might help save the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. At the same time Britain is considering buying South African Rooivalk attack helicopters as part of a total order for 90 helicopters costing about Pounds 2bn and there is speculation that a reciprocal arrangement could be worked out. Mr Heseltine discussed the issue yesterday with Mr Joe Modise, South African defence minister, and an announcement may be made before the end of the week. 'We're cautiously optimistic that something will be achieved,' said a British defence official.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-466 ,"FT922-466 _AN-CF0AFAB7FT 920627   FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance  the Family: Not just a black and white choice - Investing in . . . South Africa      By JOHN AUTHERS   SOUTH AFRICA forces a personal investor to face a unique dilemma. Any decision you make will not just be based on investment merits, for in the past two decades the climate of world opinion about the country has ensured that any such move must involve ethical and political judgments as well. Even those who had no qualms about investing in a nation governed by apartheid still had to assess the stability of the regime. The effect of sanctions imposed on the nation's economy also remains to be weighed. The ideal scenario is for South Africa to transfer peacefully to a regime which the rest of the world can stomach. This would leave the strengths of the nation's economy intact and, by allowing sanctions to be lifted, allow greater economic vigour. Optimism that this could happen has grown since the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, in early 1990. However, it remains only a vague sentiment as far as big UK investors are concerned. Trustees of charity funds have slowly begun to warm towards South Africa - for example, David Edwards, of the charity investment management service at Henderson Crosthwaite, says: 'What has tended to happen over the last year is that trustees have become less averse to the inclusion of South Africa, and that mirrors the sentiment of the average private client.' However, this mood has not translated into active investment. Edwards continues: 'Now that trustees are relaxing their attitude to South Africa, investment fundamentals come back in. And I don't think many fund managers have put money into South Africa because it hasn't looked right, even though the political situation looks better.' Stuart Bell, of Pensions Investment Research Consultants, surveyed UK pension funds in 1990 and found that about half had some restriction on investment in South Africa. Nothing much has happened since then - the only local authority pension fund to change its policy was that of the London borough of Brent, following loss of control by the Labour party. 'Basically, it's still a political football,' says Bell. 'From the commercial outlook, there has been no reason for them to amend their views anyway.' As a legacy of South Africa's pariah status, there are few ways to buy direct exposure to the country in the UK. Unit trusts are authorised by the Securities and Investments Board to invest up to 100 per cent of their funds in the Johannesburg stock exchange, but there are no 'South Africa' unit trusts. Funds in a commodities or gold unit trust, however, must almost inevitably have a considerable stake in the country. MG's Gold  General fund, for example, has a holding of 32.8 per cent. But the commodity and energy sector is not one of the unit trust industry's stars. Over the year to June, the average trust in the sector lost 11.4 per cent, according to Finstat. Over two years this figure was 22.6 per cent, and over five years, 33 per cent. Mary d'Eon, manager of Providence Capitol's Gold unit trust, views the current situation as a long-term negative, but adds: 'Any sort of strife in South Africa may make the gold price rise, which is good for the companies as well. I have a holding of 20 per cent in the major companies, and I will not be selling it.' A less risky route is to gain exposure via companies quoted in the UK. Even 'ethical' investors are now prepared to do this. The Merlin Ecology unit trust polled its unitholders and found a large majority against direct investment in South Africa until a 'one man, one vote' system has been achieved. However, they were prepared to invest in a company which did more than its competitors to introduce good employment practices, and so the fund has invested in Reckitt  Coleman. Reinvestment in South Africa has only just started, which may explain the market's muted reaction to the massacre in Boipatong last weekend. Mandela's subsequent decision to withdraw from talks on democracy with the government seemed to confirm the worst fears of the watching world, but the Johannesburg Stock Exchange index fell a modest 42 points to 3,639, while companies with overseas assets, such as Lonrho and Minorco, actually rose. So, ethical arguments aside, is this the time to buy into South Africa? The answer must be: definitely not. Jonathan Martin Smith, of the South Africa and mining department of stockbrokers Williams De Broe, is positive about the country, but says: 'You have a deep recession in South Africa and the timetable for recovery is put back by this violence. I'm not saying it's not at the bottom. I'm just saying it's wise to wait.' For the longer term he remains confident: 'The will is there on both sides to make this succeed. We are not entering into a civil war situation. Violence will not disappear. But the government and the ANC are powerful enough to control it.' South African exchange controls are another reason for staying put. There is a separate currency for external investors, the financial rand, which is usually at a substantial discount to the main commercial rand. Foreign investors thus have a strong disincentive to sell, particularly in troubled times, when the discount grows - it went up to 27 per cent following the news of Boipatong. So, South Africa needs to be watched.

0,FT932-4285 ,"FT932-4285 _AN-DFJB6ABJFT 930610   FT  10 JUN 93 / Bolivia rewards radical reformer: Christina Lamb on an unlikely victor in presidential elections      By CHRISTINA LAMB   MR GONZALO Sanchez de Lozada is living proof that radical economic reform can bring political rewards. Since implementing a tough structural adjustment programme as Bolivia's planning minister in 1985, he has twice finished ahead of his rivals in presidential elections and this time seems assured of winning his prize by actually being named president. After polling strongly in the popular vote on Sunday, he found his way virtually clear yesterday when former military ruler General Hugo Banzer, his nearest rival, withdrew from a run-off vote in Congress in August. Gen Banzer said that Mr Sanchez de Lozada would be named president. He is an unlikely head for South America's poorest country. Raised in the US, 62-year-old Mr Sanchez de Lozada owns Bolivia's largest private mining concern and is one of the country's richest citizens. He jokes: 'When I was campaigning in the interior, many people thought I was a foreigner who'd got off a plane in La Paz and decided to run for president.' But he is deadly serious in his desire to build on his neo-liberal reforms of 1985 which brought down inflation from 24,000 per cent and created a market economy - the first Latin American country to do so under democratic government. After eight years of austerity, Bolivia now has inflation of 9 per cent - the lowest in South America and both democracy and stability seem consolidated. But growth has been minimal and poverty is described by the World Bank as at sub-Saharan Africa levels. 'The problem now is to get the economy moving again, get the money to the people and make sure no one steals it,' says Mr Sanchez de Lozada. His ambitious targets are for 8 per cent annual growth for the first three years in office and 11 per cent in the last, creating 500,000 jobs and practically wiping out unemployment. An obvious way to start raising investment would be to privatise the main utilities following the lead of neighbouring Argentina. But it was Mr Sanchez de Lozada's party, the MNR, which nationalised these companies in the 1950s and privatisation is sensitive in highly unionised Bolivia. He explains: 'The state oil company was born out of the Chaco war in which 50,000 Bolivians died. How can I sell it to foreigners?' Instead, he has devised an innovative 'capitalisation' plan under which investors can buy 49 per cent of the companies. While this leaves control nominally with the state, the companies will be run by a foundation comprising 'notables' and the private investors. Once the companies are running efficiently, the state's part will be handed back to the Bolivian people as freely tradeable shares worth an estimated Dollars 4,000 per person - five times per capita income. Mr Sanchez de Lozada believes in this way he can transfer 50 per cent of gross national product to the people in five years, easing the massive income gap. To carry out this 'popular capitalism' will require foreign investment. Although local businessmen are doubtful about the attraction of investing in companies of which they do not have control, they say that Mr Sanchez de Lozada with his native English, sharp mind and considerable charisma is the best possible salesman for the country. Pointing out that 'in a country with just 7m people, a small amount of investment has tremendous impact', he believes that capitalisation of the six largest state companies will be 'like a motor to start up the economy'. Estimating their assets at Dollars 2bn, he hopes to attract as much again, boosting state and private investment, including borrowings, to Dollars 8bn over four years - double the current rate. Before he can do all this, Mr Sanchez de Lozada must be formally approved as president by Congress. In the 1989 elections, he narrowly topped the polls but a deal between the runners-up led Congress to choose the third-placed candidate. This time his main rival has cleared the path by stepping out of the run-off. 'I'd like to be president, not just the guy who keeps winning elections,' he says.

The decision was announced in a joint  communique which was released on Friday.    The two countries' decision about the resumption of  political  ties, which came following talks between officials of the South  African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting  the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country,  brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties  with South Africa.    Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the  victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that  country's racist policies.    The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and  political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign  policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South  African nation for achieving independence.    The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation  has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old  white domination over that country.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of  return of peace, together with independence and restoration of  the rights of the black majority, considers the recent  developments in South Africa as being to the removal of  obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties  with that country and has announced its willingness for the  resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage  as received]    From a political point of view, the recent developments in  South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races  to have direct and active participation in running the country's  affairs and making political and economic decisions, are  significant in that they can have positive impact and  consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework  for South Africa's future ties with other countries.    In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of  Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the  groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to  Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory  of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of  the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will  continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about  the own fate.    As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid  regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa  now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making  political decisions in this regard.

0,FT934-6162 ,"FT934-6162 _AN-DKZCOABAFT 931126   FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: S Africa mission marks change in US stance      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, arrives in South Africa tomorrow for a visit which signals the opening of a more constructive era in economic relations between the two countries. His trip comes only days after President Bill Clinton signed the South Africa Democratic Transition Support Act, formally bringing to an end the era of federal US sanctions aimed at ending apartheid. Although Mr Brown's visit will probably have limited practical impact in the short term, it conveys a powerful symbolic message. Mr Princeton Lyman, US ambassador in South Africa, comments: 'It signifies a very basic change from a negative to a positive relationship with South Africa. The whole tone shifts.' This shift from isolation to engagement was confirmed on Tuesday by Mr Clinton. He noted that removing sanctions was not enough. 'Americans who have been so active in toppling apartheid must remain committed to building South Africa's non-racial market democracy.' 'The visit confirms a real interest in South Africa's potential as a viable trading partner and bulwark of economic strength and stability in the region and on the continent,' said Mr Brown. Despite the impact of sanctions, there is a substantial base upon which to develop US-South Africa trade relations. South Africa is only the US's 34th largest export market, but it remains the largest in Africa, a continent where, Mr Lyman concedes, 'the US has not done very well'. The US recently surpassed Germany as South Africa's largest trade partner. Mr Lyman estimates bilateral trade now to be in the region of Dollars 5bn. Commerce Department figures show that in 1992 US exports to South Africa totalled Dollars 2.4bn, 14 per cent of South Africa's total import market, with US imports from South Africa of Dollars 1.7bn. The US has fared less well in terms of investment. Figures from the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) show that as of September only 135 US companies had employees or direct investment in South Africa, compared to 267 in May 1986. The stock of US investment in South Africa is put at about Dollars 1bn. Certainly, however, the trend has started to turn. The past two months have seen food manufacturers Pillsbury and CPC International enter the market, following such other companies as Mars, Microsoft and Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM has recently confirmed it will probably be returning, Procter  Gamble is known to be taking a close look and McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch and Hyatt are all expected to establish a presence. A focus of Mr Brown's visit - his 50-member delegation contains representatives of many large US companies - will be an attempt to establish links between US companies and the emerging black business community in South Africa. Another issue sure to be discussed is South Africa's offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay round of trade talks. Aspects of the offer - particularly the high protection, and longer phasing-in period for tariff reductions for the clothing and textiles, motor and electronics industries - did not meet with approval from South Africa's trading partners.

Preliminary election results show that the ANC, led by  Nelson  Mandela, has built an insurmountable lead, which indicates that  South Africa will form a new government of national unity  centered around the ANC.    The election has provided South African black people their  first chance to exercise democratic rights in the history of  South Africa, the spokesman noted.    The birth of a new South Africa where all races are equal  marks a new epoch in the country, he said.    The victory is the result of the hard, long-time struggle of  the South African people, supported by the international  community. The ANC and other black liberation organizations  have played a crucial role in propelling South Africa toward  this historic change, he said.    ""We appreciate the positive contributions made by the  National Party led by F.W. de Klerk, in moving with the tides  and implementing reforms,"" he said.    The Chinese Government and people sincerely hope that under  the leadership of the government of national unity, all parties  there will strengthen unity and cooperation and make joint  efforts in the building up of a new South Africa enjoying racial  equality, stability, democracy and prosperity, he said.    The Chinese Government and people have firmly supported the  just struggle of the South African people against apartheid and  are proud of the historic victory of the South African people,  he noted.    ""China is willing to establish and develop friendly ties of  cooperation with the new South African Government on the basis  of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence,"" he stated.    He expressed the belief that the traditional friendship of  the Chinese and South African peoples will be consolidated and  developed on a new basis.     "

On this issue, the United States and Britain do  not agree with countries such as France and Russia. The former  two are in favor of continuing the oil sales embargo, while the  latter maintain that, since the Iraqi Government is cooperating  with UN weapon inspectors and showing some progress in its  attitude, lifting the embargo should be considered.    The oil sales embargo on Iraq was an important part of the  overall sanctions against Iraq imposed by the UN Security  Council when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Oil is the  main source of Iraq's foreign exchange income and an important  underpinning of the national economy. Cutting off its oil sales  channels undoubtedly spells disaster to the recovery and  development of Iraq's national economy and its people's  livelihood.    To solve its predicament and break the blockade, Iraq has  repeatedly called for the Security Council to end the sanctions  and has adopted a positive, cooperative attitude in accepting  the United Nations' destruction of its long-range missiles and  chemical and biological weapons, as well as the organization's  long-term supervision of its ordnance production. Not long ago,  Iraqi culture and information minister Hammadi made a public  statement to the outside, saying that Iraq has long dropped its  territorial claim on Kuwait, and the Iraqi National Assembly has  also withdrawn its decision to annex Kuwait, which was approved  by Iraq's supreme power organ, the Revolutionary Command Council.    It was in the hope that the Security Council would end its  sanctions against Iraq at an early date that Iraq made those  efforts and took those positions. What is worth mentioning here  is that the Security Council initially also cited the  above-mentioned conditions, stating that, as long as Iraq could  meet those requirements in its behavior, it would lift the  sanctions. The relevant sources pointed out: The efforts Iraq  has made in the above-mentioned areas have reached and satisfied  the conditions set down by the Security Council at that time;  therefore, lifting the oil sales embargo should be considered  and Iraq should be released. France argues that the Security  Council must stand by the agreement. In other words, once  Baghdad has satisfied the requirements raised at that time, the  oil embargo should end. At present, the Iraqi side is launching  a new diplomatic offensive and is sending out important  officials in all directions to explain that Iraq's efforts have  met the requirement for scrapping the sanctions, thus putting  pressure on the Security Council.    But the United States and Britain have taken exception to  the  positions of France, Iraq, and other relevant parties. They  have ignored all dissenting views and have insisted on  continuing the oil embargo against Iraq, splitting opinion on  the matter. Some say that Iraq deserved the sanctions earlier  because it had invaded Kuwait and was in the wrong, but, now  that Iraq has admitted defeat and bowed to justice, if one again  made a futile effort to convince people with one's arguments or  was actually scheming about something else, it would indeed be  absurd. [sentence as published]    The Western media pointed out: The Americans want to use  sanctions to stop the Iraqi Government from persecuting the  Kurdish people and the southern Shiite Muslims in the country,  but the oil embargo resolution did not cover these issues. It  is common knowledge that the Kurdish and Shiite Muslim problem  is purely Iraq's internal affair.     "

0,FT933-5769 ,"FT933-5769 _AN-DIAB3AGBFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (3): At the edge of prosperity - Foreign investment      By TONY HAWKINS   SUB-SAHARAN Africa has missed out on the surge in global foreign direct investment (FDI) during the 1980s. Investment inflows into Africa, relative to GDP, are half the level of those elsewhere. After averaging Dollars 1bn annually during the first half of the 1980s - of which three quarters went to oil exporting countries - FDI accelerated during the 1987-91 period averaging Dollars 1.7bn. Almost half (Dollars 830m) went to Nigeria, and another Dollars 190m to other oil exporters. The region's stock of foreign investment was estimated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at some Dollars 11bn, with South Africa accounting for a further Dollars 11bn. Zimbabwe and Nigeria each account for 19 per cent, with Gabon in third place (13 per cent), followed by Liberia with 12.5 per cent and Cote d'Ivoire with just under 10 per cent. Between them, these five countries accounted for three quarters of the region's foreign-owned capital stock. Not only is the region's foreign-owned capital stock small and highly concentrated, but it has also been falling. Excluding South Africa, the inward stock of foreign capital fell 45 per cent in the 1980s, mainly reflecting currency devaluation. In 1980, the sub-Saharan share of global inward investment was 4.5 per cent, but 10 years later it was 0.7 per cent. Inward investment declined from 7.5 per cent of the third world total during the 1981-86 period to 5.5 per cent, two thirds of which was oil sector investment. One reason is Africa's failure to broaden its investment base. While FDI flows to other continents have diversified into manufacturing and services away from resource-intensive activity, Africa's chief attraction remains its energy and mining potential. Sluggish economic growth, poor returns, a shortage of skills and small markets continue to deter investment. The key to attracting foreign inflows is the availability of relatively cheap skilled, technical and supervisory labour, crucial to meeting quality standards that are increasingly important in global marketing. Africa is also at a serious disadvantage in terms of both location and infrastructure. But the greatest deterrent to FDI inflows has been government hostility towards multinationals. That is changing, but the results - outside the energy sector - have been disappointing. Hardly surprising, for in the late 1980s, the return on capital was lower than anywhere else in the third world, except Latin America.

In his message President Masire said it is a victory  that the people of South Africa have yearned for, fought for,  and died for over the centuries. He said Mr. Mandela's own  personal struggle against apartheid is the epitome of the  suffering South Africans had to endure for freedom and human  rights.    President Masire expresses the hope that as South Africans  celebrate their election victory and remember their fallen  heroes, they will at the same time dedicate themselves to a  future free of racial bigotry and the tyranny of the majority.  Sir Ketumile expresses the hope that under Mr. Mandela's  leadership the struggle for economic integration of the  underprivileged people of South Africa will be carried out  smoothly and with due regard to the interests of everyone. He  says he looks forward to working with Mr. Mandela at the  bilateral, regional and international levels.

It is particularly  significant for us that this summit should take place in South  Africa, and Cape Town in particular, so soon after the  epoch-making changes that have taken place.    That we can meet at this level, at the southern tip of the  continent, is tribute to a mission fulfilled. We once more  express our profound gratitude to your excellencies, the  business leaders and the world at large for the generous  solidarity you extended to us during the dark days of apartheid.    The rebirth that we celebrate in South Africa is indeed a  rebirth of the region and the continent. This is our collective  achievement which has opened up new opportunities for us to  exploit our great potential and, indeed, to boldly cross the  threshold to a new and great era. At last, Africa in general and  southern Africa in particular, can build a new all-inclusive  partnership based on freedom, democracy and social justice.    For us in South Africa, this is a time of great joy. Joy at  the rediscovery, as a united people, of our common humanity, our  common interests and our common destiny.    Ours is a delicate transition. But we are confident that we  have entered it with a new national spirit. The first democratic  elections which we have just conducted and the atmosphere of  peace that has prevailed in this period inspires us with  confidence that we shall succeed in our endeavours.    Lest we forget: the transformation we are living through is  the result of years of intensive and protracted struggle. It is  a result of difficult and sometimes harrowing negotiations. A  process that ultimately resulted in the meeting of minds among  the major political players.    We are heartened by the progress already made by the  government of national unity in reaching consensus on the most  important challenges facing the nation.    Differences do remain. But they manifest themselves within  the context of non-racial democracy. There is a spirit abroad to  ensure that we achieve the common objectives that we have set  ourselves, primarily to build a better life for all our people  and ensure peace, stability and economic growth. The  constitutional assembly will soon sit to draft a new  constitution for the country. And we are confident that the  spirit of consensus-seeking which characterised the multi-party  negotiations will display itself fully in this regard.    Quite certainly, transitions everywhere do breed  uncertainty.  And South Africa is no exception. In particular, we experienced  significant outflows of capital, and we still experience caution  among domestic and foreign investors. But the tide is turning,  occasioned by the manifest display of a national togetherness  that South Africa has hitherto never experienced.    We face a long and hard road to address the havoc wrought by  decades of apartheid. The challenge to ensure social justice and  stability is as urgent as it is crucial.    Put in brief, this means building a people-centred and  caring society. It requires that we use all our resources and  skills to broaden the base of the economy and ensure that it  serves all the people.    It demands that we enlarge the pool of skills and unleash  the  energies of the people, as a whole, to contribute to the twin  processes of nation-building and economic development.    It also entails addressing the disparities in residential  infrastructure, income distribution, provision of health  facilities and educational opportunities.    The government of national unity is of the unanimous view  that all this needs to be done and done urgently. But also that  the reconstruction and development targets that we set ourselves  should not upset macro-economic balances and undermine fiscal  discipline.    All of us recognise that peace and stability are crucial for  economic growth and development. We are determined to ensure  that all South Africans, including those who fear democracy, can  rest assured in the knowledge that change is in their interest  too.    This challenge is as much a South African one as it applies  to the region as a whole. Now that we have redeemed our pledge  with destiny, the people of southern Africa can start in earnest  to build a peaceful and developing sub-continent. We have to  urgently resolve the problems of conflict in parts of the  region, whilst we undo the effects of apartheid destabilisation.    Now we can together address the legacy of colonial under-  development and imbalances within and among countries of the  region. We can together galvanise the human and material  resources that the region commands, to serve the people. We can  together develop the physical infrastructure necessary for  development across all countries.    For these goals to be achieved, we need to start setting out  the integrated strategies required. This also means urgently  addressing the merging patterns that would, in the long run, not  benefit the region.    The lop-sided development bequeathed us by our colonial past  has resulted in the relative under-development of many countries  of the region. Related to this is the danger of unhealthy  migration of capital as well as skilled personnel to areas with  developed infrastructure. It is to the overall advantage of the  region that this trend is arrested and reversed. More  accurately, it needs to be obviated through strategies for  regional economic integration.    In the more distant future, our common objective is the  realisation of the Treaty of Abudja, the creation of an African  common market. In the near future, we are faced with the task of  ensuring that the programmes of both the SADC [Southern African  Development Community] and Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and  Southern Africa] are realised in the new political and social  context. With regional integration will emerge a mutually  beneficial arrangement regarding movement of goods, capital and  labour.    Such regional integration will need to address the broad  task  of reconstruction and development in the entire region.    We will venture to say, that modern economic planning  dictates that inter-national co-operation requires more that  just agreements on macro-economic imperatives and broad  development projects. For, impacting on these factors is the  basic question on how the partners jointly and severally create  an economic environment which attracts investments and benefits  ordinary people.    This means jointly grappling with issues such as:    Delivery of employment, shelter, nutrition, health,  education  and training for some 100-million people on a sustainable basis;  prioritising the areas, within our own countries, most in  need, and doing it in such a way that we stimulate sustainable  growth and development; seeking and finding the balance  between our noble goals and the resource opportunities and  constraints; avoiding economic and financial arrangements,  including the debt-trap, which can only have the effect of  eroding our countries' sovereignty.    We who are only starting to take the first steps out of the  mire of racial subjugation, are well aware that the experience  countries of the region have gathered will stand us in good  stead. We can only benefit from the new relationship that is  emerging.    As we take our rightful place among nations of Africa, South  Africa commits itself to join our neighbours in rising to the  mammoth challenge presented by a growing affliction in many  parts of the world known as ""Afro-pessimism"" -- loss of  confidence in our continent's capacity to overcome  under-development and declining standards.    It is a task which we are called upon to undertake with a  singleness of purpose and with confidence, remembering that the  thriving countries of Asia, the socalled Asian Tigers were only  20 years ago written off as hopeless basket cases. This can only  be achieved if there is purposeful interaction among our  countries.    Democratic South Africa enters this new partnership as one  player amongst many. We harbour no desire to be the dominant  partner, for the region and South Africa itself would lose in  the long run. We entertain no illusion of becoming the regional  benefactor because such capacity we do not possess.    Rather, we seek to join governments of the region in taking  up the cudgels on behalf of all the peoples. We seek to join  them in attracting significant investment flows and in reaching  beneficial trade agreements. Along with countries of the region  we are determined to ensure that the goods mined, harvested and  manufactured in the region become internationally competitive.  We are committed to strengthen regional institutions such as the  SADC and Comesa and at the same time strengthen bilateral  relations with each of our neighbours.    This we resolved to do both as a government and in  partnership with various institutions of civil society such as  business houses, trade unions, as well as educational, health  and other bodies.    We are confident that South Africa will soon achieve the  rates of growth necessary for us to meet our objectives. The  last two quarters have demonstrated that GDP [gross domestic  product] growth is on the upswing. This will be of benefit not  only to South Africa's people but will help the movement towards  greater southern African prosperity.    The path that South Africa has traversed might be unique in  many respects. But, to the extent that we have based ourselves  on the experiences of southern Africa and Africa as a whole, it  is a common achievement and common heritage.    One month into post-colonial Africa, in the true sense of  the  word, we are confident that regional and continental efforts  will ensure that the injunction -- God bless Africa -- finds  full expression in our prosperity.

The deal marks the biggest re-investment in South Africa since the lifting of American sanctions. It follows the return of a number of US companies to South Africa this year, including International Business Machines and Kodak. Pilsbury, a rival US foods group, set up a partnership with local producer FoodCorp last year, and Heinz is understood to be investigating a South African partnership, possibly with the Premier Group. CPC has exercised its option to buy a 50 per cent stake in Tongaat's consumer foods division. The option was part of a licensing and technology agreement signed by the companies in October 1993. The new company - CPC Tongaat Foods - will invest R10m in a new dry foods plant. The deal is complicated by CPC's disinvestment from South Africa in 1987, when it sold the rights to a number of its brands - including Knorr, Hellmann's and Marmite - to Hunt Leuchars  Hepburn, a local foods supplier. CPC Tongaat Foods will be restricted to marketing these brands outside South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. However, it plans to introduce and produce the rest of CPC's product range in South Africa for the local and sub-Saharan export markets. Mr Mohammed Wahby, vice-president of CPC Europe Consumer Foods, admitted South Africa and many neighbouring countries faced severe political troubles. However, he said: 'One should not wait for a solution to all political problems before launching a sound business proposal.' Mr Cedric Savage, managing director of Tongaat, said it was vital for South Africans to establish joint ventures with international companies.   Companies:-  CPC International.

The  spate of violence and vandalism in the latest so-called  ""peaceful"" protest is ""unacceptable and inexcusable under any  circumstances. Such behavior should not be tolerated.""  According to the editorial, the organization claiming to  represent the prisoners, the South African Prisoners  Organization for Human Rights, ""has this time either overplayed  its hand, or it has no control over its members....The decision  by the government to give all prisoners a six months' remission  is a mistake."" It is high time the government sent out a loud  and clear message: ""The season of violence and lawlessness is  gone for good.""    Help for Africa -- A second editorial on the same page of  the  paper notes: ""It is becoming all the clearer that African  countries, especially those south of the Sahara, are waiting  with optimism that South Africa will rescue them from the  economic quagmire in which they find themselves due to  corruption and bad management....Western countries have written  them off. The former Communist Bloc has forgotten about them  and are themselves in economic misery. South Africa must now  jump to their rescue."" According to the paper, President Mandela  is handling this sensitive issue ""well."" At the recent World  Economic Congress in Cape Town he assured African countries that  South Africa did not intend to dominate them, but as a  copartner, wanted to play a role in trying to reconstruct and  develop Africa south of the Sahara. The editorial goes on to  suggest: ""If South Africa could help its neighbors in creating  jobs for themselves, for instance, its own problem with illegal  immigrants could be minimized."" There must be caution against  too big expectations. ""The government's task of upliftment lies  here first of all, and only thereafter can it direct its efforts  elsewhere in Africa.

SOWETAN    Government Action -- An editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 15 June on page 10 warns that ""people are starting to  loose patience"" with the slow pace of government action on its  promises. ""Most people are reasonable and do not expect the  Reconstruction and Development Programme to take off at once. A  start, however small, has to be made. The important thing is to  place some projects physically on the line. For instance, even  if one area is prepared for housing, the streets tarred and the  infrastructure put in place, people will be mollified.

By SHARON BERNSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      The decision by Los Angeles public-television station KCET to label the  news-magazine ""South Africa Now"" a ""point of view"" program is unfair because it  calls into question the show's credibility, the program's producer and  community supporters say.    ""It puts the onus on us to prove that we're not biased, and I think that's  unfair,"" said producer Danny Schechter, who with partner Rory O'Connor produces  ""South Africa Now"" for Globalvision in New York. ""Public television is loaded  down with programs that reflect conservative and right-wing perspectives. To my  knowledge, not one of them has been labeled 'point of view' or 'commentary'  programs.""    For example, Schechter said, William F. Buckley, host of ""Firing Line,"" and  Louis Rukeyser, host of ""Wall Street Week,"" present avowedly conservative  philosophies on their shows.    Channel 28 spokeswoman Barbara Goen confirmed that ""South Africa Now"" will be  the only program on its schedule to carry the ""point of view"" label.    KCET's decision is the latest move in an ongoing controversy over the 2  1/2-year-old program. Station officials drew fire from community groups and  members of its own advisory board in October, when vice president Stephen  Kulczycki canceled the series, saying it was biased in favor of the African  National Congress. Program supporters complained that they would be deprived of  one of the few regular sources of information about the lives of black South  Africans. Kulczycki changed his mind and decided to keep the series on the air  for a six-week trial period, saying that the most recent installment had not  shown the favoritism he'd seen earlier.    On Tuesday, the station announced that it would continue broadcasting the  program this season, but, beginning this week, it would be labeled a ""point of  view."" The series airs Sundays at 9 a.m.    ""Because 'South Africa Now' does not consistently meet KCET standards for  fairness and balance in news programming, the station will identify it on the  air as a 'point of view' program as long as we feel such identification is  appropriate,"" KCET president William Kobin said in a press release.    The label will appear on the screen at the beginning of each program. Goen said  that the station had not yet decided on the precise wording, but she said it  would likely identify the point of view expressed on the show as that of  Globalvision's.    David Horowitz, chairman of a conservative media watchdog group called the  Committee on Media Integrity, who earlier had claimed credit for bringing the  idea that the show was biased to KCET's attention, said that while he would  prefer that ""South Africa Now"" be taken off the air, it should be labeled if it  is broadcast. He said that he had suggested as much in letters and meetings  with station executives.    Ron Wilkins, a Los Angeles anti-apartheid activist who has tangled with KCET in  the past over ""South Africa Now,"" said that he thinks KCET is labeling the  program in an effort to save face after making public claims that the program  was biased.    ""It's not a point of view,"" Wilkins said. ""KCET is wrong. It's just news and  nothing else.""    ""South Africa Now"" will be producing new programs until April. The show had  been expected to run out of money in January, but last month, supporters,  including Bill Cosby, donated enough money to keep it on the air.

Station officials drew fire from community groups and  members of its own advisory board in October, when vice president Stephen  Kulczycki canceled the series, saying it was biased in favor of the African  National Congress. Program supporters complained that they would be deprived of  one of the few regular sources of information about the lives of black South  Africans. Kulczycki changed his mind and decided to keep the series on the air  for a six-week trial period, saying that the most recent installment had not  shown the favoritism he'd seen earlier.    On Tuesday, the station announced that it would continue broadcasting the  program this season, but, beginning this week, it would be labeled a ""point of  view."" The series airs Sundays at 9 a.m.    ""Because 'South Africa Now' does not consistently meet KCET standards for  fairness and balance in news programming, the station will identify it on the  air as a 'point of view' program as long as we feel such identification is  appropriate,"" KCET president William Kobin said in a press release.    The label will appear on the screen at the beginning of each program. Goen said  that the station had not yet decided on the precise wording, but she said it  would likely identify the point of view expressed on the show as that of  Globalvision's.    David Horowitz, chairman of a conservative media watchdog group called the  Committee on Media Integrity, who earlier had claimed credit for bringing the  idea that the show was biased to KCET's attention, said that while he would  prefer that ""South Africa Now"" be taken off the air, it should be labeled if it  is broadcast. He said that he had suggested as much in letters and meetings  with station executives.    Ron Wilkins, a Los Angeles anti-apartheid activist who has tangled with KCET in  the past over ""South Africa Now,"" said that he thinks KCET is labeling the  program in an effort to save face after making public claims that the program  was biased.    ""It's not a point of view,"" Wilkins said. ""KCET is wrong. It's just news and  nothing else.""    ""South Africa Now"" will be producing new programs until April. The show had  been expected to run out of money in January, but last month, supporters,  including Bill Cosby, donated enough money to keep it on the air.

The supplement should be compulsory reading for the western finance ministers attending this month's IMF/World Bank annual meeting in Washington. A potential African recovery hangs by a thread. The meeting has the power to throw Africa either a lifeline or a noose. The last G7 summit in Tokyo failed to act on Africa's crushing debt.

The agreement, which was signed in a ceremony at Pretoria by Sir Leon and Mr Thabo Mbeki, South African deputy president, is primarily concerned with boosting co-operation in trade and development, although it also deals with questions of human rights and democracy. It will also allow the European Investment Bank, which currently has Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) earmarked for South Africa, to begin lending activities in the country as well as setting the legal basis for the expansion of EU-South African economic links. Both the agreement and Sir Leon's visit testify to the growing prominence of the EU in South Africa as an institution separate from its member states. More importantly, they lay the groundwork for the negotiation of a formal trade agreement between the EU and South Africa. The EU is currently South Africa's biggest trading partner and receives more than 40 per cent of South African exports, while providing 33 per cent of the country's total imports. Two-way annual trade amounts to R63bn (Pounds 11.5bn). Although South Africa was admitted to the Generalised System of Preferences in September, there is currently a debate over whether the country should also seek accession to the Lome Agreement, which provides 69 developing countries with preferential access to EU markets, or whether it should instead draw up a separate agreement with the EU. Speaking at the signing, Mr Mbeki said he hoped that the resolution of this question could be reached as 'quickly as possible' but warned that any final deal would first require consultation with other states in the region. Sir Leon echoed these sentiments and said that he hoped that the EU also hoped to contribute to broader regional development. However, he warned that urgent action first needed to be taken by South Africa to dismantle its existing trade barriers if it wished to become an attractive market for European investment. 'Such a protectionist system (as South Africa's) makes no sense today,' he said. 'I have stressed that further liberalisation is essential for both trade and investment.' Earlier on his trip, Sir Leon announced plans to form a joint EU/South Africa Business Council to help promote business ties and trade links. Meanwhile, on the aid front, the EU has long been South Africa's largest single donor of unattached grant assistance for development, having spent R1.2bn since 1986. It plans to spend a further R440m a year on various development programmes, especially in education and health.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his  official residence where they held talks behind closed doors.    In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro  pointed out that the rise to power of the African National  Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between  the two countries. ""Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples,"" Castro said.    After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted  an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting  Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel  where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation  that accompanied him.    Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation,  whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for  independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: ""There  are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South  Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now  there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and  affection for Cuba.""    The statesman confirmed he has been treated very  respectfully  by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit  here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to  harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results  of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the  entire world.    He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural  ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the  Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state  and heads of government from approximately 40 countries.    Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he  also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from  Africa and the Middle East.     "

0,FT934-7734 ,"FT934-7734 _AN-DKRC7AGUFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (18): Continental launchpad - A look at the industrial potential      By TONY HAWKINS   SOUTH AFRICA'S return to legitimacy coincides with the growing regionalisation of foreign investment decisions. As multinationals rationalise and integrate their foreign operations to secure scale economies and improve co-ordination, so they are looking more carefully at regional, rather than national, markets. Invariably this means consolidating operations at one, or a few, locations to serve a regional market, especially where trade flows are being liberalised. By any yardstick, South Africa is the logical launchpad for penetrating the sub-Saharan market, worth some Dollars 250bn, of which South Africa itself accounts for more than Dollars 100bn or more than 40 per cent. The South African market, although small by global standards, is the only African market large enough to justify a broad range of manufacturing activities. The next largest is Nigeria, worth Dollars 34bn and set to shrink in foreign currency with devaluation next year. While few companies have yet rationalised their operations with the establishment of regional headquarters in South Africa, this is likely to be a pervasive trend, once the violence subsides and business confidence returns. BP is one company that will establish a regional headquarters in South Africa, while a number of manufacturing companies, such as Nissan, are known to be actively considering developing their South African factories as the platform for exporting into the region. The reasons are obvious; South Africa has the best infrastructure on the continent with first-world service industry back-up in banking, insurance, capital markets, hotels and information technology. It has spare capacity in energy and transport, a vast pool of unskilled labour, a rich natural resource base, a better skills endowment that anywhere else in Africa - though way behind Asian levels - and a large enough domestic market to justify most industrial investments. By African standards the environment is investor-friendly and there are few African locations that can match South Africa's quality of life. The disadvantages are essentially socio-political - political and criminal violence, allied with the worry that, even if they are papered over in 1993/4, ethnic tensions will re-surface later in the decade. Labour relations are also a possible reason for steering clear of South Africa given the high cost of labour relative to that elsewhere in the region and far higher levels of unionisation. Against that is the relentless decline in the relative importance of direct labour costs in most business activities, with raw materials, capital and transport costs assuming far greater significance. These costs are likely to be lower in South Africa than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. International business is likely to adopt one of two main strategies for serving the African market in the 1990s: It will export into the region from offshore using agents, licensees or franchisees as a vehicle; or It will use South Africa as the mode of entry, manufacturing or assembling in the country primarily for domestic consumption while exporting residual amounts to the region. Clearly, neither strategy will work if African countries maintain tariffs and other barriers against imports. But with the march of economic reform, regional economies are being liberalised, thereby encouraging foreign firms to sell into the usually-tiny markets from outside rather than setting up shop behind high tariff barriers as was the pattern in the 1950s and 60s. There are two polar views of how trade and investment flows will evolve in Southern Africa. On the one hand, the locomotive theory holds that South Africa will become the region's economic dynamo that helps turn the sub-Saharan economy around. The alternative school holds that South Africa, certainly for the immediate future, has more than enough on its domestic plate to make much of a contribution to the regional turnround. Indeed, there are even those in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe who predict that relocation will, in fact, go the other way, with firms emigrating from South Africa to escape political violence and industrial relations unrest, and exploiting more tranquil labour market conditions - and lower costs - elsewhere. This is an unlikely scenario given the growing tendency for manufacturers to locate as close as possible to their main markets. The more likely scenario is one in which South Africa becomes the platform for exploiting market opportunities in east, central and southern Africa. South African business is well placed, too, to participate in rebuilding the region's physical infrastructure, on which massive amounts - much of it aid money - will be spent. South Africa aside, there is little indigenous capacity in the region to handle major physical infrastructural projects. South African businesses will have the edge, too, in some African privatisation programmes - their investment banks and mining houses are already active in countries such as Mozambique and Zambia where privatisation moves are gathering speed. African leaders will be perturbed less at the prospect of growing South African participation in their economies, than with the potentially one-way traffic that this implies. Few countries in the region have much to sell to Pretoria other than raw materials (oil, copper, coffee, cocoa, tobacco) and tourism. The saving grace - though this will depend on close links with multinationals, often with regional headquarters in South Africa - could be the development of sub-contracting and components manufacture for final assembly in the south. This would turn launchpad South Africa into a positive sum game in which there are winners all round.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

They aim to put European Union [EU] trading nations firmly  in  the front line in the threecornered fight between Europe, the  United States and the Far East over access to the resources-rich  nation.    The EU delegation will be made up of representatives from  several major directorates-general and will be in South Africa  from 27 June to 2 July. Trade, investment and tariffs are to be  discussed in depth as part of a comprehensive package earlier  agreed by the Council of Ministers.    Britain's trade and economics group, which will be at least  60-strong, will be headed by board of trade president Michael  Heseltine and is believed to be one of the largest delegations  to leave the UK this year.    During the visit -- from 10 to 15 July -- the British group  will meet business people and politician; in Johannesburg,  Durban and Cape Town. Britain has already pledged a $150  million loan the largest amount from any European country.    The EU delegation will arrive in Cape Town for talks with  Trevor Manuel, South Africa's minister for trade and industry  and other senior ministers, before going on to Pretoria and  Johannesburg. Apart from wider issues, the talks are crucial  because South Africa's status as a trading partner and as a  suitable investment prospect has to be clarified.    If firm future trade links are to be set up, a bilateral  agreement between Brussels and Pretoria is seen as a matter of  urgency. So far, the EU has left it to member states to enter  into investment protection, double taxation and bilateral trade  agreements with South Africa, but has now accelerated the pace  at which it feels agreement must be reached with South Africa in  the face of American initiatives.    With the total U.S. commitment of $420m in loans towards  economic and social regeneration in South Africa both from  public and private sectors, the pledges of $179m this year from  the EU and member countries apart from the UK may look small in  comparison. However, EU contributions will be grants, without  strings attached.    In April, the EU foreign affairs council finalised its  policy  on a joint trade and aid measures programme and following the  South African elections, this is a priority issue on the  delegation menu.    The visit is seen as the first of a two-phase thrust to  establish future relations. The second phase will begin with a  conference in the EU with delegates from all southern African  countries. Mandela has already agreed in principle to the  creation of a Southern African Economic Community and this will  be actively pursued.    The EU wants to prepare the way for other areas of  cooperation in education and training, industry and commerce,  telecommunications science and technology.     "

In the Republic of South Africa, where sport often appears to lack a human  face, this strange society is at once a birthplace of achingly talented  athletes and the burial ground for their dreams.    There is a road there and it is a true path for only those whose skin color  gains them entrance. For the remaining -- for the many -- there is only a  chance to run alongside the path, never on it.    Unless they choose to run away.    Mark Plaatjes brought the woman who now is his wife and their child to America  last year to find if there was another path. What he has found is that everyone  is allowed access to the path here, but there is a cost. In this year away from  his country, the rest of his family and much of his heart, Mark Plaatjes,  another hopeful citizen-to-be, believes he has paid the price.    Plaatjes, 27, formerly of Johannesburg, is now stateless. When he runs Sunday,  as one of the favorites in the Los Angeles Marathon, his new life will have  come full circle from the time a year ago that he stepped off a plane with two  suitcases, money enough for three weeks and dreams enough to fill this new  land.    Imagine that you have a back yard in which to play and it is large and  beautiful. Imagine also, though, that never, ever are you allowed to leave your  yard to play with anyone else.    At some point it was not enough for Plaatjes, South Africa's best marathoner,  to be only that. He longed to run outside of South Africa and that was not  possible for him.    So he tried something. He went with some other track athletes to Swaziland to  establish residency and become citizens. Then, after some time, they could run  anywhere in the world.    That did not work out. Plaatjes went home to his country, the outcast of the  world community. Not since 1960 has South Africa been welcome in the Olympics.  Since 1976, that ban has extended to virtually every other international  sporting event. Nor will most of the world come to South Africa to play,  because of the country's policy of racial separation or apartheid.    If you are a South African athlete and you are possessed of rare ability, this  is an unhappy circumstance. If you are a nonwhite athlete, living in a nation  that has an official policy that declares you are somehow less a citizen than  whites, this is what drives you to boldness.    ""Being competitive is an innate response of any human being,"" said Plaatjes  said, whose family is temporarily settled in Boulder while he prepares for  Sunday's L.A. Marathon.    ""Being an athlete in South Africa is very frustrating. You compete against the  same people all the time. You compare times with a person (not in South Africa)  but it is not the same as when you run against that person. You can't call  yourself the best or know how good you are when you can't compete against the  rest of the world.""    Plaatjes had a special problem in this sporting equation. Because he was  successful, he was accepted to an unusual degree by white South Africans, who  classify people as white, black or colored, those who are neither. But there  were some who did not like this man winning so much. Because he was colored --  half black and half white -- he was beloved by the nonwhites in South Africa.  But there were some who did not like this man winning so much white money.    He was living on both sides and there were people on each side who objected.  Plaatjes was doing well and he was winning, but when he left the country there  was still talk that he left to make quick money overseas. They thought he would  return.    This makes Plaatjes angry. Why, if he wanted to get rich, would he have left  South Africa? He had a big shoe-company contract. He owned a five-bedroom house  in the colored suburb of Fleurhof. He supported an extended family, paid his  medical school tuition and bought a car, all on the money he made from running.    Money wasn't his motivation for leaving his yard.    ""It was simple things, like being able to look in a real estate book and be  able to choose a house from all the houses in the book and say, 'What a nice  house.' And not worry, if we are allowed to live in this neighborhood,"" he  said.    ""That doesn't even exist for black people in South Africa. You are told where  to live. You can't choose. I think it was the determining factor -- I felt my  family needed to have choices for determining its own future.""    If he left, Plaatjes would certainly sacrifice his family's financial future.  But life was growing so unbearable in South Africa that the prospect of leaving  behind family, friends and security didn't seem a difficult choice.    ""People started giving me honorary white status because I was the sole non-pure  black winning major national events,"" he said.    ""This treatment really bothered me. To give you an example, in 1986, when they  had independence celebrations, they asked me to carry the flag and give a  speech. That bothered me. I could never do that. But as soon as the word  filtered out that they had made this offer, my family started getting phone  calls, threatening that they would find me dead in the street when I went for  my run. They threatened my mom that they would burn down the house and kill  me.""    ""They"" never identified themselves, Plaatjes said, but black groups exist in  South Africa to punish those seen as collaborators with the white government.  To some, Plaatjes, who had white friends as well as nonwhite, who was well off,  who was more quiet and scholarly than radical, was in league with the  government. Another aspect of apartheid's damage has been to make combatants  out of the victims of the policy.    Plaatjes was being watched. After he had run a marathon in 2 hours 8 minutes 58  seconds, it was worse. He was even more popular and had even more endorsements.  There was even more pressure to speak out. He was criticized for even  competing, because the competition, although integrated, was organized by the  South African Amateur Athletic Union.    ""What these people don't understand is that for a lot of guys, especially the  black athlete in South Africa, it's a way out of the situation they are in. If  you want to compete, there is no alternative. These groups don't provide an  alternative. If they were to put up races, have meetings, start clubs and  things like that, then you've got an alternative. But now if you don't compete  for the SAAAU, you don't compete.    ""They don't want people to make their own decisions. They draw a line and if  you take one step off that line, they condemn you.""    Sometimes they try to kill you.    Plaatjes and a friend were running in a grassy meadow between Fleurhof and  Soweto. They were returning to Plaatjes' home when they began to hear chanting.    ""It happened to be Labor Day and on Labor Day you had to stay home from work,""  he said. ""We heard this noise and we looked across this little stream and there  were maybe 10,000 people standing there chanting.    ""I said to my friend, 'I wonder what they are chanting at. They're probably  watching a soccer game.'    ""He said, 'It doesn't look like that to me.'    ""They were all facing our direction. We took a corner and it was like maybe  2,000-3,000 of them coming straight at us. They were throwing bricks. Have you  ever heard of necklacing? (To be necklaced is to have a tire hung around your  neck and then set afire.) They had tires and they had gasoline. They obviously  had something planned for us.""    They escaped that time, but it was during that period, June to December 1987,  that three of the top black athletes in South Africa died under mysterious  circumstances. One, who had been a soldier, supposedly shot himself in the leg  while running. Another was stabbed to death by his politically-radical brother.  A third was run down by a truck on a sidewalk while he was jogging.    Plaatjes says he had a similar close call. He was running with Bruce Fordyce,  who is white, and some other runners on the sidewalk of a broad, four-lane road  in Johannesburg.    ""This guy was driving a van with tinted windows,"" Plaatjes said. ""We were  running on the sidewalk and he was riding in the outside lane. The next minute  he was right behind us on the sidewalk, coming straight at us. If Bruce hadn't  turned around and looked, the guy would have wiped us out.""    Plaatjes was getting close to the emotional end of his rope. He believed that  he was doing good in his own way, talking with black athletes and encouraging  them to seek endorsements and a better education. But it was clear that he  would have to cave in to the racial separation that some powerful people on  both sides advocated.    ""I'm the type of person who believes that if you want to solve the next  person's problem, there has to be a line of communication,"" he said. ""I have to  be able to come to you and say, 'Look, what is wrong?' Then you and I can agree  or not agree. But if you turn your back on me and I turn my back to you, how  are we going to ever solve anything?    ""I don't think that by never talking to whites and never associating with them  and never competing with them is ever going to solve anything. I have to  compete against the best, whether they are black, white, or whatever.""    Mark Plaatjes and Shirley, who would soon be married, and their 4-year-old  daughter Gene arrived in the United States for a three-week vacation in  January, 1988. Mark intended to have a job interview in Chicago and perhaps try  to get into a race.    This country was not new to Plaatjes. He had already spent two years at the  University of Georgia on athletic scholarship. He flourished as a pre-med  student, but had to return to South Africa because of his father's illness. Now  he was back, for a short visit.    Plaatjes found out that if he wanted to compete he would have to renounce his  citizenship. Glenn Latimer, his adviser, arranged a meeting in Chicago with an  administrator of The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track.  They contacted an immigration attorney in Philadelphia. Suddenly they were  setting something very serious in motion. Something they had never considered.    ""Shirley and I started speaking about it,"" Plaatjes said. ""We were so isolated.  (They were living in Lake Villa, Ill. with Latimer and his wife.) At night,  when everyone was asleep, Shirley would wake me up and we would talk.""    Shirley mostly remembers crying in the dark.    ""I'd cry, thinking about the family,"" she said.    But they did decide.    ""We thought it was good for a number of reasons,"" Plaatjes said. ""We both are  young, we have our whole futures ahead of us. Gene would be able to grow up in  a society other than South Africa. We wanted to give her the choices we didn't  have.    ""Running really wasn't part of my decision. After I made the decision (to give  up the passports) and if TAC would have said no, we still would have stayed.""    They sent their passports to their attorney, who sent them to the South African  embassy in Washington.    ""I felt like I lost something, like something was missing,"" Shirley said.    They knew that if their asylum was denied, they would become stateless persons,  citizens of no country. The attorney had advised them to expect the interim  period to be difficult. The uncertainty lingered in the weeks before the 1988  Los Angeles Marathon. What if they were not welcomed by the U.S. State  Department?    Each turned to the other and burst out laughing at the memory. It was both a  nervous and relieved laugh.    ""We're laughing because it was just . . . "" Plaatjes said. ""People will never  understand how horrendous that period before L.A. was. I don't know how I ran  at L.A., really.""    They were granted asylum, based on Plaatjes' occupation, physical therapist,  was on a priority list. Political asylum would have been granted, based on the  death threats Plaatjes faced in South Africa, but that waiting list was two  years long.    Plaatjes came to run in last year's Los Angeles Marathon. He was a stateless  person and, therefore not a South African, so he was issued a TAC card. It was  the first time Plaatjes had ever run outside South Africa. It was an  overwhelmingly emotional time and the running was only part of it.    ""We felt extremely frightened,"" Plaatjes said. ""Shirley was frightened and  nervous. We were thinking of our own futures and our families in South Africa.  What would happen to them now? Would we ever see them again?""    Plaatjes finished third in 2:10:41 and was happy. He had finally run free.    The Plaatjes family was moving again. In the 13 months they have been in this  country, they have been shuttling between Boulder and various Chicago-area  suburbs. Now there was 5-month-old Luz, their second daughter. The money was  tight, and this last summer was the worst.    ""We had absolutely no idea how much this was going to cost,"" Plaatjes said of  the ever-escalating legal fees for citizenship. ""Shirley was pregnant. We had  to pay $1,000 a month for the attorney and try to put away some money for the  baby. Everything I would make would go to doctors, attorneys, Gene was growing,  she had to have clothes.""    The family had been living with various people, camping out on floors and  trying not to be in the way. It was not wearing well. Finally, this winter,  they settled in Lake Villa for four months, the family record for living in one  U.S. city. Mark was working in Lake Forest as a physical therapist at a school  for handicapped children. Life was hectic.    ""Our life style this last year has had an effect on all of us, especially  Gene,"" Plaatjes said. ""Every time we go to a new place she would start making  friends. In Waukegan, she was going to school and she got to know all the kids  in the neighborhood. She could visit and establish her own social pattern with  kids.    ""With the moving, every time we pack bags, Gene says, 'Where are we moving  now?' The minute she gets to know somebody we leave. She's not really attached  to anything. I think she needs that. You can see in her behavior, she behaves  like a big person, not a child. I think that's due to the fact that she's  always in the company of adults and she's always hearing adult conversations.""    For Shirley, who had never been to the U.S., it was the isolation. She was at  home without transportation and no one to talk to. Also, she was used to  working but now stayed home all day.    ""I just didn't have friends or people to talk to,"" she said. ""We were staying  so far from everything, we couldn't go out, really. There was no privacy. We  have been living with people (so long) I got to a stage where I couldn't bear  it. When you have a child, you must have a home. You must have privacy and be  free to do what you want.""    And with all of that, Plaatjes was injured and not running well. He was  depressed and not sure what was wrong with him. Finally, he went through a  series of tests and it was discovered that his iron stores were almost totally  depleted and that he had an allergy that made him feel sluggish.    Still, he entered the Columbus Marathon in November.    ""The race was very important to me for a number of reasons,"" he said. ""I had to  prove to myself, first of all, that I could still do it. After seven months of  running like a dog, I started getting worried.""    He felt great before the race, but the conditions on the day of the race did  were not conducive to great times. The last half of the race was run into a  28-m.p.h. head wind. On no part of the course was the wind less than 15 m.p.h.  Plaatjes, and the rest of the elite field, backed off the pace. He won, in  2:12, and was satisfied.    For Plaatjes, it was a kind of vindication. He had been snubbed by race  directors and shoe companies. Many of them wondered if he was going to go back  to South Africa. Some were just doing business in a manner to which Plaatjes  was unaccustomed.    ""That's one of the big problems I had in this first year,"" he said. ""I learned  that when you talk to people over here and they say they are going to do  something or they intend to do something, it doesn't necessarily mean they are  going to do it or that they intend to do it.    ""I come from a society at home where if I sit down with somebody and we are  discussing a contract and they say, 'We'd like to have a two-year contract and  this is how we would like to structure it,' and then I would say, 'I'm happy  with that.'    ""Then we go away from that meeting and we assume that that is what both parties  agreed upon. Over here, they agree to things and they don't really mean it. You  phone the next day and they have forgot completely about it.""    Plaatjes figures he needs the contracts if he is to finance medical school.  When he quit Georgia and returned to South Africa, school was put on hold. His  father died and Plaatjes stepped forward to care for his family of nine  brothers and sisters, as well as Shirley and Gene.    He eventually did return to school, and was accepted as one of four nonwhites  admitted to the medical school at the University of Witwatersrand in  Johannesburg. He went through three years and, discouraged with the power South  African pharmaceutical companies held over the school, Plaatjes changed to  physical therapy. But he never gave up his dream of being a doctor.    ""Since I was 12, I wanted to be a doctor,"" he said. ""Just being in our  community where one hospital served one-half million people. You see what kind  of care they get. My father was treated so badly there, at the nonwhite  hospital. That contributed to his death. My brother died from neglect at the  hospital.    ""When I was young, I did volunteer work there. The main reason I wanted to  become a doctor at home was because I wanted to help the people there.""    Plaatjes has applied to several schools, including Johns Hopkins, Georgetown,  Howard and Duke. He expects to hear about school acceptance in the next two  weeks. It will mean at least one more move for the family, but it is important,  for the future. Running may take a secondary role for Plaatjes.    Primary for the family is U.S. citizenship. On April 22, they will become  permanent residents and the clock starts running on the citizenship. Plaatjes,  if he continues competing at this level, will become the top American  marathoner. Last year he ran two minutes faster than any other American. Also  in April he will be able to represent the U.S. in international competition.    With citizenship a real dream now, Plaatjes is able to talk about his political  beliefs. During the last year, he was advised not to speak out in case it  affected his asylum case. Now, when he does speak out, it's with an awareness  that some people in South Africa are angered at his stance against sporting and  economic boycotts.    ""If you speak to the everyday black in South Africa, you will find that they  disagree with boycotts because they are the first people it will affect,"" he  said. ""Then you get the radicals, or the people who have been driven to become  radicals by the government, and they will always be for the boycotts because  they say they are already treated like dirt, and if they lose a job because of  a boycott, they can't get any poorer.    ""That is the view the radicals take. I don't agree with that. Boycotts have  their place. I believe that companies that do business in South Africa and  don't pay equally for equal qualifications, and treat blacks poorly, they are  there because they can make a huge profit by paying less for labor -- they  should be boycotted.    ""I don't believe in total disinvestment from all companies that are doing  business in South Africa. You are just making it worse. A lot of companies are  selling out, and who is buying? It's definitely not blacks that are buying.""    If that makes Plaatjes unpopular in South Africa, look at the irony. He has  renounced citizenship in a country that denied him the rights of white  citizens. He's attacked by both blacks and whites. He's struggling to support a  family in a new land where he's not a citizen, either. What else is there?    He has escaped from the big, beautiful yard. A lovely prison. Now Plaatjes is  free to run on his own path.

In the Republic of South Africa, where sport often appears to lack a human  face, this strange society is at once a birthplace of achingly talented  athletes and the burial ground for their dreams.    There is a road there and it is a true path for only those whose skin color  gains them entrance. For the remaining -- for the many -- there is only a  chance to run alongside the path, never on it.    Unless they choose to run away.    Mark Plaatjes brought the woman who now is his wife and their child to America  last year to find if there was another path. What he has found is that everyone  is allowed access to the path here, but there is a cost. In this year away from  his country, the rest of his family and much of his heart, Mark Plaatjes,  another hopeful citizen-to-be, believes he has paid the price.    Plaatjes, 27, formerly of Johannesburg, is now stateless. When he runs Sunday,  as one of the favorites in the Los Angeles Marathon, his new life will have  come full circle from the time a year ago that he stepped off a plane with two  suitcases, money enough for three weeks and dreams enough to fill this new  land.    Imagine that you have a back yard in which to play and it is large and  beautiful. Imagine also, though, that never, ever are you allowed to leave your  yard to play with anyone else.    At some point it was not enough for Plaatjes, South Africa's best marathoner,  to be only that. He longed to run outside of South Africa and that was not  possible for him.    So he tried something. He went with some other track athletes to Swaziland to  establish residency and become citizens. Then, after some time, they could run  anywhere in the world.    That did not work out. Plaatjes went home to his country, the outcast of the  world community. Not since 1960 has South Africa been welcome in the Olympics.  Since 1976, that ban has extended to virtually every other international  sporting event. Nor will most of the world come to South Africa to play,  because of the country's policy of racial separation or apartheid.    If you are a South African athlete and you are possessed of rare ability, this  is an unhappy circumstance. If you are a nonwhite athlete, living in a nation  that has an official policy that declares you are somehow less a citizen than  whites, this is what drives you to boldness.    ""Being competitive is an innate response of any human being,"" said Plaatjes  said, whose family is temporarily settled in Boulder while he prepares for  Sunday's L.A. Marathon.    ""Being an athlete in South Africa is very frustrating. You compete against the  same people all the time. You compare times with a person (not in South Africa)  but it is not the same as when you run against that person. You can't call  yourself the best or know how good you are when you can't compete against the  rest of the world.""    Plaatjes had a special problem in this sporting equation. Because he was  successful, he was accepted to an unusual degree by white South Africans, who  classify people as white, black or colored, those who are neither. But there  were some who did not like this man winning so much. Because he was colored --  half black and half white -- he was beloved by the nonwhites in South Africa.  But there were some who did not like this man winning so much white money.    He was living on both sides and there were people on each side who objected.  Plaatjes was doing well and he was winning, but when he left the country there  was still talk that he left to make quick money overseas. They thought he would  return.    This makes Plaatjes angry. Why, if he wanted to get rich, would he have left  South Africa? He had a big shoe-company contract. He owned a five-bedroom house  in the colored suburb of Fleurhof. He supported an extended family, paid his  medical school tuition and bought a car, all on the money he made from running.    Money wasn't his motivation for leaving his yard.    ""It was simple things, like being able to look in a real estate book and be  able to choose a house from all the houses in the book and say, 'What a nice  house.' And not worry, if we are allowed to live in this neighborhood,"" he  said.    ""That doesn't even exist for black people in South Africa. You are told where  to live. You can't choose. I think it was the determining factor -- I felt my  family needed to have choices for determining its own future.""    If he left, Plaatjes would certainly sacrifice his family's financial future.  But life was growing so unbearable in South Africa that the prospect of leaving  behind family, friends and security didn't seem a difficult choice.    ""People started giving me honorary white status because I was the sole non-pure  black winning major national events,"" he said.    ""This treatment really bothered me. To give you an example, in 1986, when they  had independence celebrations, they asked me to carry the flag and give a  speech. That bothered me. I could never do that. But as soon as the word  filtered out that they had made this offer, my family started getting phone  calls, threatening that they would find me dead in the street when I went for  my run. They threatened my mom that they would burn down the house and kill  me.""    ""They"" never identified themselves, Plaatjes said, but black groups exist in  South Africa to punish those seen as collaborators with the white government.  To some, Plaatjes, who had white friends as well as nonwhite, who was well off,  who was more quiet and scholarly than radical, was in league with the  government. Another aspect of apartheid's damage has been to make combatants  out of the victims of the policy.    Plaatjes was being watched. After he had run a marathon in 2 hours 8 minutes 58  seconds, it was worse. He was even more popular and had even more endorsements.  There was even more pressure to speak out. He was criticized for even  competing, because the competition, although integrated, was organized by the  South African Amateur Athletic Union.    ""What these people don't understand is that for a lot of guys, especially the  black athlete in South Africa, it's a way out of the situation they are in. If  you want to compete, there is no alternative. These groups don't provide an  alternative. If they were to put up races, have meetings, start clubs and  things like that, then you've got an alternative. But now if you don't compete  for the SAAAU, you don't compete.    ""They don't want people to make their own decisions. They draw a line and if  you take one step off that line, they condemn you.""    Sometimes they try to kill you.    Plaatjes and a friend were running in a grassy meadow between Fleurhof and  Soweto. They were returning to Plaatjes' home when they began to hear chanting.    ""It happened to be Labor Day and on Labor Day you had to stay home from work,""  he said. ""We heard this noise and we looked across this little stream and there  were maybe 10,000 people standing there chanting.    ""I said to my friend, 'I wonder what they are chanting at. They're probably  watching a soccer game.'    ""He said, 'It doesn't look like that to me.'    ""They were all facing our direction. We took a corner and it was like maybe  2,000-3,000 of them coming straight at us. They were throwing bricks. Have you  ever heard of necklacing? (To be necklaced is to have a tire hung around your  neck and then set afire.) They had tires and they had gasoline. They obviously  had something planned for us.""    They escaped that time, but it was during that period, June to December 1987,  that three of the top black athletes in South Africa died under mysterious  circumstances. One, who had been a soldier, supposedly shot himself in the leg  while running. Another was stabbed to death by his politically-radical brother.  A third was run down by a truck on a sidewalk while he was jogging.    Plaatjes says he had a similar close call. He was running with Bruce Fordyce,  who is white, and some other runners on the sidewalk of a broad, four-lane road  in Johannesburg.    ""This guy was driving a van with tinted windows,"" Plaatjes said. ""We were  running on the sidewalk and he was riding in the outside lane. The next minute  he was right behind us on the sidewalk, coming straight at us. If Bruce hadn't  turned around and looked, the guy would have wiped us out.""    Plaatjes was getting close to the emotional end of his rope. He believed that  he was doing good in his own way, talking with black athletes and encouraging  them to seek endorsements and a better education. But it was clear that he  would have to cave in to the racial separation that some powerful people on  both sides advocated.    ""I'm the type of person who believes that if you want to solve the next  person's problem, there has to be a line of communication,"" he said. ""I have to  be able to come to you and say, 'Look, what is wrong?' Then you and I can agree  or not agree. But if you turn your back on me and I turn my back to you, how  are we going to ever solve anything?    ""I don't think that by never talking to whites and never associating with them  and never competing with them is ever going to solve anything. I have to  compete against the best, whether they are black, white, or whatever.""    Mark Plaatjes and Shirley, who would soon be married, and their 4-year-old  daughter Gene arrived in the United States for a three-week vacation in  January, 1988. Mark intended to have a job interview in Chicago and perhaps try  to get into a race.    This country was not new to Plaatjes.

""I don't believe in total disinvestment from all companies that are doing  business in South Africa. You are just making it worse. A lot of companies are  selling out, and who is buying? It's definitely not blacks that are buying.""    If that makes Plaatjes unpopular in South Africa, look at the irony. He has  renounced citizenship in a country that denied him the rights of white  citizens. He's attacked by both blacks and whites. He's struggling to support a  family in a new land where he's not a citizen, either. What else is there?    He has escaped from the big, beautiful yard. A lovely prison. Now Plaatjes is  free to run on his own path.

With the growing number of ODA recipients, it  has become increasingly difficult for Japan to undertake  assistance alone due to linguistic or technical problems. Japan  will, therefore, aim at more effective aid through joint  international ODA projects. It will discuss new joint projects  in African and Asian countries with Canada, Sweden, South  Africa, Israel, and the EC Commission, while also increasing  existing joint international ODA efforts with the United States,  Britain, and other countries.    Japan's ODA has again surpassed the United States in 1993,  becoming the world's top aid donor for three consecutive years.  While ODA from the Western nations has leveled off, Japan's ODA  has been increasing not only in Asia, but also in Africa and  Latin America, where it used to give minimal assistance. Plans  for ODA in East Europe and the Central Asian states of the  former USSR have also come up for consideration since 1993.    However, there are problems such as the shortage of Japanese  technicians who can speak the local languages. Japan will  attempt to solve these problems by cooperating with other  advanced nations. Furthermore, this will also ensure more  efficient management of ODA, the appropriations for which have  not been increased as expected due to Japan's financial  difficulties.    Japan is considering a joint aid program with South Africa  for the economic reconstruction of Mozambique, Lesotho, and  other neighboring countries of South Africa. Such a joint aid  program with South Africa will also express the Japanese  Government's approval of the democratization efforts in South  Africa, which has succeeded in instituting a general election  with black participation for the first time in history.    Joint ODA efforts in Africa are also being considered with  Sweden and Canada, while joint projects will be implemented in  Africa or Vietnam with Canada. Sweden and Canada are advanced  nations in terms of ODA. Japan also hopes to acquire ODA  knowhow from these countries.    Cooperative efforts in the area of refugee relief in the  Philippines, and agricultural development in Thailand have  already been undertaken with the United States. Japan wants to  cooperate with the United States in a wildlife conservation  program in Indonesia.     "

To stay on the world's summit requires much more than brute  force and technical, military, and media superiority. This  requires a humanitarian message that convinces the world's  peoples. This is something Washington does not have, as U.S.  circles admit.    Some confused people do not see the U.S. slide, but continue  to see the old upward trend. These people do not see the  opportunities in the region and the international arena.    Even more serious is the fact that these people have seen  the  U.S. progress, but they did not note -- due to their horror and  blindness -- that this climb to the summit of global positions  was due to notable collapses. This means the United States  moved forward because there was no resistance, or, let us say,  it moved ahead as a result of multiple absences. The collapse  of the Soviet Union was basically due to self-motivated reasons,  and the same was the case with countries of former Socialist  bloc. The collapse of Somalia was due to famine and fighting.  The official Arab journey to Madrid was the result of the  collapse of rulers and officials. Therefore, the U.S. rise  cannot be viewed as a victory over heroic and persistent  resistance.    The only exception during the short years of the U.S. rise  was Iraq. Iraq has been and still is the one voicing the  pan-Arab and humanitarian 'no', with faith in God, people, and  objectives. That was the reason for the 30-state aggression and  all its destruction and siege. Despite everything it did, the  United States stood helpless and defeated under the walls of the  Iraqi fortress while in the zenith of its rise.    Now, the image is different. The U.S. downfall is becoming  clearer. Iraq remained and its leadership and determination  continued without change. The Russian awakening is clear.  Somalia is witnessing the triumph of its resistance. The  people of Palestine were not deceived by the false peace and its  agreements and negotiators. Palestinians continue to throw  stones and to fire bullets, rejecting the results of the  collapse of officials and rulers.    None of us denies Washington owns huge quantities of  sophisticated weapons and possesses advanced media. We all  suffered from the air, missile, and media shelling, but this did  not undermine the Iraqis and the Arabs, and did not deceive the  Somalis and Russians for long. Army occupation does not mean  occupation of the will. Monopolizing the media does not  necessarily mean occupying the mind.    At the peak of the hostile media campaign that took part in  the destructive aggression and siege, the faith of the Arab  nation in Iraq -- leader and people -- increased, even though  Iraqi media did not reach all Arab lands.    At the peak of the military and media invasion of Somalia,  the Somali people rejected the invasion and its pretexts, even  though the Somali people did not have enough bread and lack even  modest mass media.    When all the hostile media that targeted Iraq mobilized  against the Palestinian people, and inundated them with the  promises of peace, prosperity, and stability, the Palestinian  people -- who lack their own media that believe in national and  pan-Arab constant -- were not deceived. They continued to fight  the enemy as an alternative to negotiating with the enemy.    The changes demonstrated much of what Iraq had said and  predicted during the peak of the collapses that shocked the  world, but did not move Iraq.    The United States is in the downfall stage, and Iraq --  leader and people -- and Palestine -- people and resistance --  are in the rising stage amid a clear awakening that is  demonstrated in the division in the Security Council.

But SA [South African] Foreign  Minister Alfred Nzo says membership is part of South Africa's  strategy to end its international isolation.    Speaking in Cairo on the eve of a four-day NAM conference,  Mr  Nzo said international networking was critical for the success  of his government's internal development policy: ""The contact  we have trade-wise and economic-wise with various countries of  the world is bound to assist our process (of restructuring).""    According to Mr Nzo, South Africa is expecting to be  accepted  as an NAM member on Tuesday. He said that joining the  108-member organisation was also a ""natural development"", since  the movement had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and had  given SA ""liberation movements"" observer status.    Mr Nzo is attending the summit in Cairo at a critical moment  in the movement's history. The NAM was created in the 1960's to  help developing nations assert their independence from the  United states and Soviet superpowers. Now that the Cold War is  over it is trying to recast itself as a pressure group fighting  for third world interests.    The future of the movement is one of the items members are  scheduled to discuss this week. They are expected to advocate  focussing on ""more of an economic role"".    South Africa has also just been accepted into the  Organisation of African Unity and Mr Nzo said it hoped to join  the United Nations in the coming months.    The end of isolation means South Africa will be expected to  get involved in efforts to contain regional conflicts, like that  in Rwanda. Mr Nzo said that for now however his government  would stick to humanitarian aid while it got its own military  house in order. ""We are engaged in the process of rebuilding a  new army in our country...and we can't therefore be expected  before that process is completed, to let our soldiers march (in  peacekeeping operations).""    The Cold War superpowers, particularly the US, have  traditionally barred NAM countries from developing nuclear  weapons. Mr Nzo said South Africa would not use its nuclear  capacity to equalise the imbalance in the nuclear equation but  would ""certainly participate in the peaceful uses of nuclear  energy"".     "

But the ""Cape route"" for  shipping and the 3,000 km of South African coastline are still  of prime geostrategic importance and a major economic asset.  Located at the confluence of major commercial routes, the  country has port, road, and rail infrastructure that is both a  gateway to the rest of the African continent and a natural  outlet for southern African countries that have no direct access  to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.    Despite--or perhaps because of--the relative international  isolation forced upon it as a result of its policy of ""separate  development,"" South Africa also has become a true regional  economic power. Sitting on a vast heap of gold (the country has  50 percent of global reserves) and diamonds (25 percent), it  furnishes 52 percent of the electricity, 83 percent of the  steel, and 97 percent of coal products for the whole continent,  and provides half its industrial production.    Now that the country is committed to the path of  democratizing its institutions and opening up to the outside  world, the wealth that was built on a foundation of racial  inequality and discrimination is both seductive and worrisome to  its neighbors, who are frightened at the hegemonic tendencies  that might emerge in the ""new South Africa.""    The international community, deaf to misgivings frequently  articulated by experts on the region--""Southern Africa stands to  South Africa in the same relationship that Europe would stand to  Germany, if Germany were all Europe had""--is trying once again  to evoke that ""Afro-optimism,"" which so often miscarried in the  past as one African country after the next fell into insolvency.  And it dares to hope that this ""politico-socio-economic  laboratory"" with its eyes turned (at least for the moment)  toward Europe, its principal trading partner--a laboratory  situated midway between two high-growth zones, Asia Pacific and  Latin America, whose future seems assured at least for a  generation---will be the engine of economic development that  sub-Saharan Africa so desperately needs. ""Nigeria and South  Africa are the only big economic powers capable of stabilizing  the African continent,"" says one observer familiar with these  countries.    It is an observed fact that South Africa's trade with its  neighbors comprises only a very small part (less than 7 percent)  of its total external commerce--the country's inward looking  orientation was deplored by the African Development Bank in a  recent report prepared at the request of Egypt's Husni Mubarak.  All the more reason to expect, now that South Africa has turned  over a new ideological leaf and the former so-called frontline  states opposed to apartheid have done the same, that trade will  expand among the southern African countries with their combined  population of 115 million inhabitants--who represent 115 million  potential consumers--however slowly the economic capacity of  their respective countries might grow.    Regional Integration    The next phase should be real regional integration, in  stages, by means of economic cooperation instruments whose role  now needs to be reexamined. This is the working hypothesis  advanced by Alan Hirsch, assistant director and economics  instructor at Cape University, one of the architects of South  Africa's future commercial policy, which was drawn up for  Mandela's ANC.    ""Our neighbors have no reason to fear economic domination  from our side. On the contrary, it is in our interest to help  them expand their own economies,"" he says. This white official,  head of Cape's development policy research unit, developed the  theory at the meeting in Gaborone (Botswana) last February, in  collaboration with the ANC's ""external trade relations"" team and  representatives of the southern African countries.    This regional miniconference afforded an opportunity to see  the extremely cautious approach taken by both sides. While the  other countries in the region may favor increased cooperation  with Pretoria, they realize very clearly that in many product  areas, competition is likely to prevail over complementarity.  ""There is such a gulf between South Africa and its neighbors  that there is a risk of killing embryonic industries in Namibia,  Botswana, and Zimbabwe,"" one expert confirmed.    On the South African side, the ""Mandela team,"" and hence the  future government of national union, although describing itself  as intensely interested in relations with its neighbors, does  not intend to be diverted from the top priority of the hour,  amelioration of the country's domestic situation. However,, the  ANC has not ruled out consideration of other partners. ""We do  want access to other markets besides Europe and southern  Africa,"" says Mr. Hirsch, adding that ANC already has made  contacts with the United States to ask for most favored nation  [MFN] status. The big lesson learned from the Gaborone meeting  was that if integration is going to happen, the panoply of  regional accords now in force will have to be revised.    These agreements come in several different forms, from  simple  free trade area to customs union, and even the beginnings of  what might evolve into a regional common market--""our own  version of the European Union,"" as President de Klerk puts it.  Already the region has a Common Monetary Area (CMA); a monetary  union comprising South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland; and a  South African Customs Union (SACU) that includes South Africa,  Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia (since its independence in 1990), and  Swaziland.    In addition to these monetary and customs institutions,  there  are economic cooperation agreements. The most important of these  is the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) that encompasses 18 central  and east African countries but until now has excluded South  Africa. The Southern Africa Development and Coordination  Conference (SADCC) composed of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,  Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe  has set its sights higher. Revamped in 1993 as the South African  Development Community (SADC), it intends to put its political  past behind it.    Immigration Issue    In all likelihood, the future integration of the region,  with  Pretoria as catalyst, will be grafted onto PTA and SADC. But do  not forget: It is not going to happen in the immediate future.  ""Hopes of seeing South Africa play a major role in the region  are probably exaggerated,"" says the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a study on the country's  future that appeared in the house magazine, OBSERVER. ""The  private sector is clearly less committed to investing in the  region than was hoped, if only in terms of the small volume of  investments in South Africa itself,"" add the authors of the  article, underscoring the country's need to resolve its own  internal problems before anything else.    One of these is the increasing volume of immigration from  neighboring countries, which certainly will add new  complications to future commercial or economic negotiations  among the southern African countries. Mandela warned some time  ago that South Africa could not afford to become ""the job market  for the entire region."" More bluntly, his entourage has openly  admitted it will be necessary to ""deport 2 million undesirables""  hailing from such places as Zaire and Mozambique. The future  government of national union may adopt legislation to this end.    Meanwhile, an ANC delegation visited France early this year  for talks with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. No doubt  Pasqua's lieutenants provided the ANC representatives with some  ""tried-and-true"" prescriptions in this domain.     "

Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the UK wanted to work with South Africa and other African countries to 'turn the tide' against violence and war on the continent. Mr Major announced the initiative during an historic address to an informal joint sitting of parliament at the beginning of the first official visit to South Africa by a British prime minister since 1960. Earlier, he met South African President Nelson Mandela for talks on rebuilding the two countries' traditionally close relationship, which was weakened during South Africa's international isolation under the former whites-only government. Officials said the talks were conducted in 'an atmosphere of great warmth', suggesting that the ANC-led government of national unity has forgiven Britain for its less than enthusiastic endorsement of sanctions against the former regime. Mr Major urged South Africa to join the international community in bringing prosperity to the whole of Africa by helping to pre-empt outbreaks of violence, rather than trying to limit trouble after it had started. 'An entirely new effort at preventive diplomacy is long overdue. With our friends in Africa . . . Britain wants to develop new mechanisms to head off conflicts before they become unstoppable,' he said. 'We have in mind, for example, setting up regional peacekeeping cells. We need more people trained to mediate and act as peace brokers. We would not need a cumbersome bureaucracy, but a tight and properly resourced infrastructure in Africa.' The British proposals will be spelled out in more detail to the United Nations next week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has long sought a bigger role for pre-emptive mediation in international peacekeeping efforts. However, officials said the plan was intended to build on a recent resolution by the Organisation of African Unity calling for better conflict resolution procedures on the continent. They said the initiative was not intended to involve large numbers of troops, although the final shape of the peacekeeping force was likely to be determined by the UN and the OAU.

We are deeply confident, the statement goes on,  that the new South Africa under the leadership of the  president-elect, Nelson Mandela, his ANC, and all other  peace-loving people in that country will erect an unshakeable  foundation on which peace, freedom, and unity will be built.  Uganda, the statement concludes, welcomes the new nation of  South Africa to its rightful place among the international  community and looks forward to many years of mutual and friendly  cooperation in all fields of common endeavor in order to make  the world a safer and more prosperous place to live in.

After years of  sworn enmity between Cuba and South Africa, President Castro  arrived on his first visit to South Africa, and what a moment it  was. Pieter Theron asked him about impressions of South Africa.    [Begin recording] [Castro] It is wonderful to be in South  Africa. It grabbed my imagination. It is indeed an  extraordinary country in every respect -- the organization,  nature. I have only been here for a short while, but I have  spoken to many people. I was impressed by their hospitality and  the warmth with which I was received. I felt a sense of harmony  and unity, quite the opposite of what a stranger would have  expected. I followed the news every day and was impressed by  the country's people. They are well brought up. I realized  that what has taken place over the past few days was without  doubt an historic event for South Africa, for Africa, and for  the world. It has been a privilege to witness the events. I  was really impressed by what I saw. It is something I will take  with me when I return to Cuba.    [Theron] How do you see future relations between South  Africa  and Cuba?    [Castro] I would like to believe we are more than friends.  We are like family. A family does not discuss formal  relations. The ties which have grown between the people of Cuba  and South Africa are so deep that we feel at home here. My  visit has also provided the opportunity for even better  relations between the two countries in the future. This could  be of mutual benefit.    [Theron] What has South Africa got to offer Cuba, and what  has Cuba got to offer South Africa?    [Castro] Regarding trade, there is a long list of products  which South Africa could offer to Cuba. We do not want gold, as  we have no use for it. Apart from that, we could use almost  anything you could imagine. South Africa has advanced  technology. In many areas such as agriculture, you produce  everything. There are many areas for cooperation between our  two countries. South Africa will play an important role in  Africa and in the Third World. We have been doing it for many  years now, and I believe our experience could be of great value  for South Africa. South Africa is now involved in a great  experiment, and the whole world would like this experiment to  succeed. It is important to mankind, which is involved in  serious conflicts in many places.    [Theron] Cuba was involved in the conflict in Namibia and  Angola. You were engaged in war against South Africa. Do you  think your involvement contributed towards the changes that took  place in South Africa?    [Castro] Our involvement in Angola led to many sacrifices.  But we took the decision on our own, without the Soviet Union's  knowledge. We did it out of sympathy and historical ties. It  was not without risk. One always runs the risk of being  defeated.    [Theron] President Castro, communism collapsed in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union. Why do you think communism is  still the right system for Cuba?    [Castro] Communism was not imported to Cuba. It was our own  creation, and it developed differently from the way it developed  in other countries. It was the result of our own struggle  against a dictator. No one brought socialism to Cuba. Rather,  it was a case of Cuba finding its own solutions. We achieved a  great deal, but we lost 80 percent of our trade -- many of the  things we imported from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless we  overcame that setback. Not many countries could have achieved  that. But Cuba is a united country, with a spirit all its own.  This is the spirit which emerged in Angola. At one point,  without any assistance, we supported more than 50,000 troops  almost 10,000 kilometers from home. That is proof of a strong  nation driven by certain principles.    [Theron] Will the future system of government still be  communism for Cuba?    [Castro] We see it as socialism. We want to maintain it, but  we have left an economic opening. We lost capital markets and  technology, which we now need in order to develop our country.  So there is room in the economic field. We need investments in  many areas. There is a process of change under way in our  country, to keep us in touch with the present realities of the  world. But we have not given up our principles. [end recording]     "

All of Africa seems  to be spread out below as the plane zigzags its way to Johannesburg on a  curious route. The plane must burrow through endless clouds, for although its  presence in African airspace may be tolerated, the plane may not land unless  invited.    Mt. Kilimanjaro, snow-capped and majestic, juts abruptly from the desert floor,  rising like a kingdom in the clouds. Miles later, the outline of Nairobi's  airport comes into view. Landing there, the jumbo jet spits out streams of  khaki-clad tourists with a clattering of cameras.    After spending a long night on the plane, passengers continuing their journey  are eager to get out and stretch their legs during the two-hour layover. But an  announcement from the captain puts an end to that glad possibility. Those  passengers bound for Johannesburg, South Africa, the captain said, are asked to  remain on board, at the request of the Kenyan authorities.    Viewed from the plane's window, the Tarmac shimmers in the summer heat. The  plane bound for South Africa sits alone on the runway, like an unwelcome  insect.    In a very real way, getting to South Africa is a metaphor for being there.  International sanctions do not make it easy. It can be circuitous. If you are  going to South Africa, for whatever reason, there are places where you no  longer will be welcome. The country's own consulate advises against having a  South African stamp on your passport. It can be infinitely complicated.    Having gotten there, through the tsk-tsking of international opinion, it  doesn't take long to sense the isolation. The world does not want to come here,  and people here aren't free to move about the world. In a sports sense, it is  as if South Africa is a nation of children, possessing a beautiful playground  and wondrous toys, but no friends come to play. And every day they watch and  wait.    But South Africa has grown weary of waiting. Three generations of athletes have  stood by and watched. Now they want to play. After decades of boycotts --  economic, diplomatic, cultural and sporting -- this nation says it deserves the  right to play with the rest of the world.      APARTHEID: ""A Terrible Dream""    The root of South Africa's isolation is apartheid -- the country's legislated  and systematic policy of racial separation that has been the law of the land  since 1948. And, although some reform has occurred in 42 years, the basic  tenets of apartheid are still firmly in place. The world's response to  apartheid has been to punish and shun South Africa through a series of measures  aimed at disrupting the country's status quo.    The longest, and to some the hardest hitting, of all sanctions has been South  Africa's sports isolation. It began, perhaps, in 1956, when the International  Table Tennis Federation expelled the South African Table Tennis Union, and for  the past 30 years, South Africa has been the pariah of sporting nations.    No country has been subject to anything remotely like the sports isolation  South Africa has experienced. South African athletes have not been allowed to  compete in the Olympic Games since 1960. There is an international ban that  forbids any athlete in any Olympic sport from competing in South Africa. There  is an international ""contamination rule"" that forbids competition against a  South African athlete anywhere in the world. South African citizens who wanted  to watch the 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea were told to leave. South  African journalists wanting to cover the Games were denied credentials.    The state-run South African Broadcasting Co. is not permitted to buy the  broadcast rights to many of the world's premier sporting events.    South African society has helped fashion its own noose, however. Three decades  of isolation has come solely because of what has been called ""a terrible dream""  -- apartheid. Apartheid is the mechanism that has kept South Africa's nonwhite  athletes from an opportunity for comparable competition, training, coaching and  facilities within the country. Apartheid classifies South Africa's people into  four strict groups -- African for the black population, Asian for the East  Indian population, colored for the mixed-race, and white.    The open oppression of the majority -- of South Africa's 36 million people, 27  million are black, 5 million white, 3 million colored and 1 million Asian --  has been enough to keep the world away. The international bans forbidding  sporting contact with South Africa have been thorough and steadfast. In fact,  the solidarity that members of the international sporting community display on  this issue makes it unique. Where else can the United States and Soviet Union  line up in complete agreement?    Officially, South Africa's isolation is complete. However, sports officials and  leaders in the private sector occasionally finance so-called rebel tours --  athletes from ""outside"" are brought in at tremendous expense to perform in much  the same way as entertainers such as Frank Sinatra sing in nearby Sun City for  $2 million a night.    There is incentive for the promoters, too. The Income Tax Allowance Bill of  1986 allows a promoter of an international sporting event a maximum deduction  of 180%. The law asks that qualifying events must show a material advantage to  South Africa. The government views this tax break as a small price to pay to  encourage international visitors and ease the sense of isolation.    Companies are lining up to take advantage. In 1988, it was estimated that South  African businesses spent $120 million in sports sponsorships and promotions.  Sports-related advertising accounted for about 15% of the total ad sales in the  country.    So starved are South Africans for contact that money is seemingly no object  when it comes to luring athletes. Money has to be the incentive, because most  athletes who defy the bans and compete here are themselves banned for years  from their sports, thus ironically completing their solidarity with South  Africa.    The system of pay-for-play is an interesting example of market efficiency:  South Africa creates a market for foreign athletes by offering them enough  money to compensate for bans or suspensions. Once banned, the athletes are  bonded to South Africa because there is no other place in the world that will  allow them to compete. So, they return year after year, and the system steams  forward.    South African sports leaders have been creative in providing incentive for  athletes to stay here, because there are methods for South Africans -- using  false passports and names -- to travel and compete abroad.    Money has been an effective motivator. In this, South Africa is no different  from any other nation. For top athletes, especially top white athletes, there  is a lot of money to be made in amateur sports. Aside from prize money, which  is awarded at even the smallest competition, there is a large pool of  endorsement dollars available to the athlete who markets himself with savvy.    Large South African companies are looking for a black athlete to use as a  spokesman, too, but corporate executives say too often a poor education and  difficulty with the language limit the opportunities for black athletes. Others  note the irony here, since it is precisely limited opportunities, especially in  education, that keep blacks from sharing in South Africa's wealth.      SPORTS: South Africa's 'Soft Underbelly'    The various international sports organizations knew what they were doing when  they cut off South Africa. The nation has weathered the economic and cultural  boycotts with some hardship, but with ingenuity and an inward turn. South  Africans aren't allowed to see Woody Allen or Spike Lee films, but the  country's own film industry is thriving.    The problem for sports is more complicated. Whereas South African artists and  writers, for example, have flourished, athletes -- who almost by definition  must compete -- have been retarded in their growth. Athletes become weary of  facing the same competition before the same spectators, able to compare only on  paper their abilities against foreign athletes, and then only in certain  sports. They long to see new faces or even the colors of a different uniform.  There is talent here, but there is also stagnation.    The international sports boycotts have hit at what one official here called  ""South Africa's soft underbelly,"" for sports are the embodiment of South  African pride and culture.    Observed David Tothill, South Africa's ambassador to Australia: ""Denying South  Africans the means of expressing their own feelings of nationalism through the  medium of sport is probably one of the sports boycott's hidden objectives.""    In the rest of the world, where participation in the Olympic Games is taken for  granted, sports surely have their place in society, but a jaded public may fail  to be impressed with Olympic medals in colors other than gold. In South Africa,  sports are held on a higher plane. Perhaps the very act of denying this nation  the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a  heightened regard for the things they cannot have.    What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand.    ""Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you  have never seen before,"" said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African  National Olympic Committee. ""Because of our climate and because of our  inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily  life of a South African.    ""You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the  motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the  outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is  applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the  colored.""    At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate  for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a  multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa  couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last  South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host  to an international multisport competition.      SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship    It is popular to speak of ""the marriage of sports and politics"" in the context  of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had  political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936  and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history  shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's  knee.    ""The people who married sports and politics were South Africans,"" said Jannie  Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former  official in South Africa's track and field federation. ""This country has banned  Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of  government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last  to complain.""    South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it  came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South  African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out  unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they  must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team  as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable.    The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal  sport in an abnormal society.    The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No  participation in any government-sponsored event or program.    Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa,  that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school  sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial.    And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and  provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their  own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to  compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South  Africa.    Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened  with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for  ""collaborators"" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with  gasoline and set afire.    Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile  nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing  for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track  and field.    ""What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative,"" Plaatjes said of the  anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and  his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has  applied for citizenship.    ""They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as  supporting the government,"" Plaatjes said. ""Fine, but they offer no form of  competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a  finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think  that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show  the whites how good we are?""    An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the  drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks  to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another  way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are  boycotted daily by their own government.    Apartheid's grand scheme of ""separateness"" of races has been realized to such a  degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible.    However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the  rule of law.    Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to  sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For  example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to  laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they  wish. That was circumvented by the granting of ""honorary white"" status to  nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay.    A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain  hotels as ""international hotels,"" where whites and nonwhites would be allowed  to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too.    The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended  to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among  spectators, which had been forbidden by law.    Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all  times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them  to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose  course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a  photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest.    Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February,  apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to  some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict  segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and  recreation facilities are common sites for segregation.    Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was  allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The  Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit  blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them.    Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national  government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the  first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous  opposition.    Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the  political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been  the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made  all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at  last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so  delicate.      THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns    Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria. While keeping one  eye on her charges before a meet one night recently, she listed the  difficulties of coaching athletes who can never go anywhere to compete.    ""To keep them going and motivated is really hard,"" she said. ""They never have  any competition. My attitude is to never run them against anyone in practice,  only (against) the watch. That way they can learn to push themselves.    ""I must tell you, whenever I get an athlete who can make it, really make it, I  have two feelings at once. First, I am excited, because this is what a coach  works for. Then, I am sad. I know they will never get the competition, they can  never go to the Olympics. They are not allowed. This is the way we have in  South Africa. It is the hard way.""    The frustration is evident in nearly every athlete and coach. Myrtle Bothma,  ranked No. 1 in the world this season in the 400-meter hurdles, has still not  quietly accepted her plight. Bothma, who is white, echoes the popular sentiment  from athletes -- why hold us responsible for a political system we can do  nothing about?    ""I don't see how hurting me, not allowing me to run against the best 400-meter  hurdlers in the world, is going to help anything,"" she said. ""If they don't  want the white sportsmen to take part, why don't they take the black man? We  would love to see it.    ""You get a feeling, a kind of anger towards people who sit around a table in  their little suits and look at a little bit of paper and say, 'South Africa,  no.' They don't know what it's like to be a sportsman, to struggle, to work.  They can decide my future.    ""One day, I wish I was a fly with a sting. I could sit in that boardroom with  the (International Olympic Committee) in their meeting. When they decide not to  let South Africa compete, I would give them one sting, to make them think what  are they doing. I think they see the issue as something on a piece of paper,  not people.""

Apartheid classifies South Africa's people into  four strict groups -- African for the black population, Asian for the East  Indian population, colored for the mixed-race, and white.    The open oppression of the majority -- of South Africa's 36 million people, 27  million are black, 5 million white, 3 million colored and 1 million Asian --  has been enough to keep the world away. The international bans forbidding  sporting contact with South Africa have been thorough and steadfast. In fact,  the solidarity that members of the international sporting community display on  this issue makes it unique. Where else can the United States and Soviet Union  line up in complete agreement?    Officially, South Africa's isolation is complete. However, sports officials and  leaders in the private sector occasionally finance so-called rebel tours --  athletes from ""outside"" are brought in at tremendous expense to perform in much  the same way as entertainers such as Frank Sinatra sing in nearby Sun City for  $2 million a night.    There is incentive for the promoters, too. The Income Tax Allowance Bill of  1986 allows a promoter of an international sporting event a maximum deduction  of 180%. The law asks that qualifying events must show a material advantage to  South Africa. The government views this tax break as a small price to pay to  encourage international visitors and ease the sense of isolation.    Companies are lining up to take advantage. In 1988, it was estimated that South  African businesses spent $120 million in sports sponsorships and promotions.  Sports-related advertising accounted for about 15% of the total ad sales in the  country.    So starved are South Africans for contact that money is seemingly no object  when it comes to luring athletes. Money has to be the incentive, because most  athletes who defy the bans and compete here are themselves banned for years  from their sports, thus ironically completing their solidarity with South  Africa.    The system of pay-for-play is an interesting example of market efficiency:  South Africa creates a market for foreign athletes by offering them enough  money to compensate for bans or suspensions. Once banned, the athletes are  bonded to South Africa because there is no other place in the world that will  allow them to compete. So, they return year after year, and the system steams  forward.    South African sports leaders have been creative in providing incentive for  athletes to stay here, because there are methods for South Africans -- using  false passports and names -- to travel and compete abroad.    Money has been an effective motivator. In this, South Africa is no different  from any other nation. For top athletes, especially top white athletes, there  is a lot of money to be made in amateur sports. Aside from prize money, which  is awarded at even the smallest competition, there is a large pool of  endorsement dollars available to the athlete who markets himself with savvy.    Large South African companies are looking for a black athlete to use as a  spokesman, too, but corporate executives say too often a poor education and  difficulty with the language limit the opportunities for black athletes. Others  note the irony here, since it is precisely limited opportunities, especially in  education, that keep blacks from sharing in South Africa's wealth.      SPORTS: South Africa's 'Soft Underbelly'    The various international sports organizations knew what they were doing when  they cut off South Africa. The nation has weathered the economic and cultural  boycotts with some hardship, but with ingenuity and an inward turn. South  Africans aren't allowed to see Woody Allen or Spike Lee films, but the  country's own film industry is thriving.    The problem for sports is more complicated. Whereas South African artists and  writers, for example, have flourished, athletes -- who almost by definition  must compete -- have been retarded in their growth. Athletes become weary of  facing the same competition before the same spectators, able to compare only on  paper their abilities against foreign athletes, and then only in certain  sports. They long to see new faces or even the colors of a different uniform.  There is talent here, but there is also stagnation.    The international sports boycotts have hit at what one official here called  ""South Africa's soft underbelly,"" for sports are the embodiment of South  African pride and culture.    Observed David Tothill, South Africa's ambassador to Australia: ""Denying South  Africans the means of expressing their own feelings of nationalism through the  medium of sport is probably one of the sports boycott's hidden objectives.""    In the rest of the world, where participation in the Olympic Games is taken for  granted, sports surely have their place in society, but a jaded public may fail  to be impressed with Olympic medals in colors other than gold. In South Africa,  sports are held on a higher plane. Perhaps the very act of denying this nation  the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a  heightened regard for the things they cannot have.    What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand.    ""Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you  have never seen before,"" said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African  National Olympic Committee. ""Because of our climate and because of our  inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily  life of a South African.    ""You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the  motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the  outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is  applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the  colored.""    At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate  for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a  multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa  couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last  South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host  to an international multisport competition.      SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship    It is popular to speak of ""the marriage of sports and politics"" in the context  of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had  political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936  and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history  shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's  knee.    ""The people who married sports and politics were South Africans,"" said Jannie  Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former  official in South Africa's track and field federation. ""This country has banned  Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of  government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last  to complain.""    South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it  came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South  African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out  unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they  must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team  as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable.    The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal  sport in an abnormal society.    The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No  participation in any government-sponsored event or program.    Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa,  that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school  sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial.    And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and  provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their  own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to  compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South  Africa.    Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened  with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for  ""collaborators"" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with  gasoline and set afire.    Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile  nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing  for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track  and field.    ""What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative,"" Plaatjes said of the  anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and  his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has  applied for citizenship.    ""They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as  supporting the government,"" Plaatjes said. ""Fine, but they offer no form of  competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a  finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think  that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show  the whites how good we are?""    An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the  drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks  to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another  way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are  boycotted daily by their own government.    Apartheid's grand scheme of ""separateness"" of races has been realized to such a  degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible.    However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the  rule of law.    Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to  sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For  example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to  laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they  wish. That was circumvented by the granting of ""honorary white"" status to  nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay.    A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain  hotels as ""international hotels,"" where whites and nonwhites would be allowed  to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too.    The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended  to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among  spectators, which had been forbidden by law.    Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all  times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them  to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose  course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a  photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest.    Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February,  apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to  some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict  segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and  recreation facilities are common sites for segregation.    Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was  allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The  Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit  blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them.    Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national  government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the  first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous  opposition.    Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the  political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been  the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made  all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at  last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so  delicate.      THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns    Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria. While keeping one  eye on her charges before a meet one night recently, she listed the  difficulties of coaching athletes who can never go anywhere to compete.    ""To keep them going and motivated is really hard,"" she said. ""They never have  any competition. My attitude is to never run them against anyone in practice,  only (against) the watch. That way they can learn to push themselves.    ""I must tell you, whenever I get an athlete who can make it, really make it, I  have two feelings at once. First, I am excited, because this is what a coach  works for. Then, I am sad. I know they will never get the competition, they can  never go to the Olympics. They are not allowed. This is the way we have in  South Africa. It is the hard way.""    The frustration is evident in nearly every athlete and coach. Myrtle Bothma,  ranked No. 1 in the world this season in the 400-meter hurdles, has still not  quietly accepted her plight. Bothma, who is white, echoes the popular sentiment  from athletes -- why hold us responsible for a political system we can do  nothing about?    ""I don't see how hurting me, not allowing me to run against the best 400-meter  hurdlers in the world, is going to help anything,"" she said. ""If they don't  want the white sportsmen to take part, why don't they take the black man? We  would love to see it.    ""You get a feeling, a kind of anger towards people who sit around a table in  their little suits and look at a little bit of paper and say, 'South Africa,  no.' They don't know what it's like to be a sportsman, to struggle, to work.  They can decide my future.    ""One day, I wish I was a fly with a sting. I could sit in that boardroom with  the (International Olympic Committee) in their meeting. When they decide not to  let South Africa compete, I would give them one sting, to make them think what  are they doing. I think they see the issue as something on a piece of paper,  not people.""

By Yossi Melman, Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist and Nieman Fellow at  Harvard Unviersity, is the author of Every Spy a Prince: The Complete History  of Israel's Intelligence Community (Houghton Mifflin).      CAMBRIDGE, MASS.      Three years ago I asked a colleague who worked in network television why the  American media was so fascinated with Israel. Even then, the Israeli Cabinet  was on the brink of collapse. Television news, along with major and minor  newspapers, were saturated with stories and commentary about the unfolding  events. ""Israel is always a good story for us,"" my friend explained, ""because  you are a democracy, our strategic ally, sharing our values and have a dynamic  political system.""    Today, another Israeli Cabinet has disintegrated and Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir has lost a vote of confidence in Israel's Parliament, plunging the  country into a search for a new government. The crisis, set off by a Bush  Administration plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, marks a historic  watershed: Will Israel embark on the road to peace or will the countdown for a  new war begin?    Unlike the past, these events are not dominating U.S. air waves or receiving  much more than perfunctory coverage in America's newspapers. This shift  reflects a waning American interest in Israel, in particular, and in the Middle  East, in general. The Tyndall Report, which monitors the amount of time network  news devotes to stories, ranked the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 10th in 1989.  The previous year it was in the top five.    Even militarily significant defections fail to attract much media attention in  the United States. Five months ago, the three major networks each devoted  roughly 15 seconds of their nightly newscasts to the defection of a Syrian air  force pilot and his MIG-23 fighter to Israel. When an Iraqi pilot landed his  MIG-21 in Israel in August, 1966, the American media's appetite seemed  insatiable. This shift in treatment cannot be explained by differences in the  military-intelligence value of the defections, since there were none.    Although signs of Americans' fading interest in Israeli affairs could be  detected in the early 1970s, the turning point came in December, 1987, when the  Palestinian uprising began. Israel was unrelentingly depicted in the U.S. media  as an uninspired, oppressive force with a government that adamantly refused to  talk peace with the Palestinians. Many Americans were shocked by the Israeli  security forces' treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Israeli disregard for Palestinian human rights undermines the values that are  the moral basis of Americans' attraction to Israel, the only democracy in the  Middle East.    Talking to American friends and officials of the Reagan Administration in late  1988, I detected a deep sense of disappointment in Israel's unwillingness to  reciprocate for the newly moderate declarations of the Palestine Liberation  Organization. I also sensed a growing American fatigue with the indecisiveness  of Israeli domestic politics. Those impressions linger to this day.    The sensational events unfolding in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, South  Africa and Nicaragua rightly captivate the world's and America's attention. But  sudden reconciliations in some countries also reinforce the frustration many  Americans feel toward Israeli reactions to various Middle East peace proposals.  Israel is seen by the U.S. media and increasingly by its most loyal American  friend -- Congress -- as sinking deeper and deeper into its own political heart  of darkness, most of its leaders as unmovable objects.    Even the attitude of American Jewry, always a constant source of sympathy and  staunch support for Israel, has undergone a major change. A recent public  survey of Jewish leaders in the United States not only showed a sharp decrease  in support but also a readiness (80%) to criticize Israel in public.    Yet most Israelis are unaware of these shifting attitudes. They think and  behave as if Ronald Reagan were still in the White House. The former President  went farther than any predecessor to make Israelis feel secure. His  Administration never fully protested Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.  Although his State Department railed against the construction of Jewish  settlements in the occupied territories, it took no diplomatic action. The  White House enthusiastically blessed a joint American-Israeli memorandum on  strategic cooperation. And in the 1980s, Israel received close to $40 billion  in economic and military aid from the United States. That kind of generosity  and kid-glove treatment understandably leads Israelis to believe they can do no  wrong in American eyes.    Abundant writing is on the wall, however. President Bush and his secretary of  state, James A. Baker III, lack their predecessors' emotional and ideological  commitment to Israel, the heart of the alliance. Their language and deeds  depart from past practice.    Over Israeli protests, the Bush Administration is continuing a dialogue with  the    PLO. In a recent visit to Los Angeles, the President said that no new Jewish  settlements should be built in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem. His  inclusion of East Jerusalem was unprecedented, raising serious doubts about  Israel's claims to sovereignty there. Earlier, Baker suggested that building  new Jewish settlements or expanding old ones in the occupied territories must  stop before the United States would consider guaranteeing an additional $400  million in loans to pay for housing newly arrived Soviet Jews.    In Congress, the movement away from Israel is no less discernible. The proposal  by Minority Leader Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- to cut foreign aid for five  countries, including Israel, by 5% -- is a case in point. I have little doubt  that Dole's suggestion was coordinated with Baker and Bush. The senator's words  were carefully chosen to remind Israel to get more serious about peace  negotiations with the Palestinians. Additionally, they were an indication of  Administration impatience with Israeli leaders.    If my fellow Israelis do not soon recognize the gravity of this situation --  that unquestioning American support can no longer be assumed -- they will wake  up one day in horror to discover what I have already detected: The party may be  over for Israel in the United States.

While the African continent traversed some of the most  difficult times in the last year, it also witnessed moments of  triumph and hope.    The Cairo Declaration adopted by the OAU in June last year  on  the establishment of the mechanism to resolve African disputes  peacefully represented a landmark achievement of the  organization in the political sphere.    The treaty establishing the African Economic Community, that  came into effect last month, was the first step Africa has taken  toward economic integration and it is expected to have a  significant impact on the revitalization of the African economy.    The summit also acquires its special significance as it  comes  in the wake of the first all-race elections in South Africa, and  the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as its president.    Reforms to end apartheid in Pretoria have brought about  world  acceptance and South Africa was formally welcomed as the newest  member of the OAU on May 25.    But there are new challenges that the African continent is  still facing.    Despite the political and economic progress in the past  year,  some African countries are still suffering from war and domestic  disputes.    The conflict in Rwanda has shocked the world by its scale,  brutality and savagery, which is expected to call urgent  attention of the African leaders.    Besides, the accumulated crucial economic and social  problems  are hindering development of the African countries.    Over the recent years, African countries suffered greatly  from the low prices of primary commodities in the international  markets. The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing  foreign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S.  dollars, or three times the figure in 1980.    The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6  billion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47  least developed countries in the world.    Perhaps more devastating are Africa's exploding population,  which now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU  estimates, at the region's current average annual growth rate of  3.1 percent, Africa's population will reach approximately 1  billion by the year 2005.    In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual  average growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been  a mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African  population growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita  income and a further slide into poverty in Africa.    It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution  of ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent.  And the second most important problem is finding ways and means  of combating the rising tide of economic problems.    African conflicts and economic development will top the list  of concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15.    Given the changing international situation, it has become  increasingly important for African countries to maintain  political stability for the benefit of economic development.    In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic  development will appear to be the main theme of the African  summit.     "
0,FT923-1945 ,"FT923-1945 _AN-CIUDDAABFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (14): A continent drifts into crisis - Natural and man-made disasters, disease and debt are racking Africa / Poverty and Hunger      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   'THE challenge facing Africa is exceptional . . . the cost of failure would be appalling,' warned the World Bank nearly three years ago. The challenge - to reverse the economic decline of the region - turned out to be overwhelming, and the cost of failure is proving catastrophic. Without a combination of further debt relief, additional resources assisted by better management, and an upturn in the world economy, recovery in the foreseeable future is out of reach. Today sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 500m people, is racked by natural and man-made disasters, disease and the burden of foreign debt exceeding Dollars 175bn. From Somalia to Zaire, from Mozambique to Sudan, economies and social structures are collapsing, symptoms of the continent's seemingly irreversible decline. In its seminal analysis of the continent's plight - Sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth - the bank said that 'overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago'. To register 'a modest improvement in living standards', the report calculated, 'sub-Saharan economies must grow by at least 4 to 5 per cent annually'. Highly ambitious, given the region's past performance, the report's authors acknowledged, 'but we believe it can be achieved'. Nothing like that target has been reached, and nor does the bank's own forecast of growth in the 1990s suggest that it will be attained in the years to come. Aggregate GDP for sub-Saharan Africa rose by 1.3 per cent in 1990, and around 2.4 per cent in 1991: 'Not sufficient, in the context of Africa's high population growth rate (3.2 per cent),' observes the bank's 1992 annual report, 'to prevent per capita income from falling 0.6 per cent.' Earlier this year the bank was expecting growth of 3.4 per cent in 1992  - now being revised downward as the full affects of drought and a weak international economy are taken into account - and projected an average annual growth for the period 1990-2000 of 3.5 per cent. 'By 2,000, per capita gain in real income will be minimal for the region as a whole', warned the bank in its report, Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries, 'and may be negative in some countries.' 'Although relief can be expected from real increases in commodity prices and debt and debt service reduction measures,' the report continued, sub-Saharan Africa's limited stock of capital in equipment, infrastructure, and human resources precludes any sharp improvements in living standards.' Behind this detached analysis lies a tragedy of a dimension only partly revealed by some of the grim statistics carried in the bank's annual report. It calculates the number of poor at 228m - more than half sub-Saharan Africa's population. Per capita income of Dollars 340 in 1990 is 'exceeded by all the world's regions except South Asia'. For many of the poor, their hold on life is tenuous. War and drought have left 21m people at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa. In southern Africa, enduring its worst drought this century, some 19m people need food aid. But what the statistics conceal is the extent to which the infrastructures and institutions have been disintegrating, leaving a generation of Africans without the resources to implement blueprints for recovery. With few exceptions, civil services are inefficient, schools and universities ill-equipped, and management weak. Whether the existing levels of aid can be sustained in the 1990s is open to doubt. Africa's worries that concessional assistance might be diverted to eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, are valid, acknowledges the bank: 'Unless donors' aid budgets are increased,' it warns, 'other developing countries may be affected.' No significant help is likely in the form of external investment. One of the most telling yardsticks of the loss of confidence in sub-Saharan Africa is the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Official figures show that non-oil exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa received on average less than Dollars 0.5bn a year during the second half of the 1980s - 'roughly what Papua New Guinea alone attracted during the same period', a UN report wryly notes, and concludes: 'The low levels of FDI flowing to Africa underline the increasing marginalisation of the region.' Meanwhile, the spectre of Aids hangs over a continent already debilitated by malaria, bilharzia, guinea worm and other parasitic diseases. Estimates of the impact of Aids vary, but a conference last December in the Senegalese capital Dakar was told that even at the most conservative official estimates of the infection rate, at least 25 per cent of Africa's workforce could be affected by 2010. One in every 40 adults in Africa is already infected with the HIV virus that causes Aids. These victims are part of Africa's economic engine - 15 to 49-year-old farmers, mine workers, even the educated elite. Research presented at the conference on Aids in Africa found that the labour-intensive agricultural and mining industries, the two pillars of the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, are already suffering the impacts of Aids. Some economists warn that the Aids pandemic poses a threat of unprecedented economic disruption as the disease takes its toll. Some experts forecast that Aids will kill 5m or more adults in the next eight years. African officials argue that the world has a stake in helping their countries stem a disease that could, they fear, cripple the key economic sectors of the continent. 'Africa must not be abandoned,' says Dr Kekoura Kourouma, head of Guinea's national Aids programme. 'Remember, a sick population will not be able to work, will not be able to pay its debts.' Whether such an appeal to self-interest in the west will have a greater impact than humanitarian appeals remains to be seen. What seems certain is that the worst of Africa's anguish may be yet to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GROWTH OF REAL PER CAPITA INCOME IN HIGH INCOME AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (average annual percentage change of real per capita GDP)                    1960-70   1970-80   1980-90   1990    1991  1990-2000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All developing    countries           3.3       3.0       1.2   -0.2    -0.2       2.9 Sub-Saharan Africa     0.6       0.9      -0.9   -2.0    -1.0       0.3 East Asia              3.6       4.6       6.3    4.6     5.6       5.7 South Asia             1.4       1.1       3.1    2.6     1.5       3.1 Latin America          2.5       3.1      -0.5   -2.4     0.6       2.2 Middle East and     North Africa       6.0       3.1      -2.5   -1.9    -4.6       1.6 Eastern Europe         5.2       5.4       0.9   -8.3   -14.2       1.6 All high income   countries            4.1       2.4       2.4    2.1     0.7       2.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: The former Soviet Union is not included in the totals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank data  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page XIV  "

In reply to a question as to what led Iran to decide to  establish ties with South Africa, Mahdavi says: ""It should noted  that diplomatic ties have not been established with South  Africa. After the elections in April 1994, when the deprived  and suffering people of South Africa have attained their rights  and taken over the management of the country, we will, God  willing, establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. But what  was recently approved in the country and brought to the  attention of the people was the lifting of the restrictions we  had on our economic ties with South Africa.""    Mahdavi then comments on the events leading to the  forthcoming free elections and abrogation of apartheid in South  Africa.    On the reason for Iran's decision, he says: ""What led us to  decide to establish economic ties with South Africa was, first,  the recent events in South Africa and, second, the direct  request of the combative groups in South Africa, who wrote to us  and asked us to lift the restrictions on trade with South  Africa. However, we have deferred the establishment of  diplomatic ties, which will be the main basis of relations  between our country and South Africa, until after the elections,  when every black person has attained his rights there.""    Asked about Western media propaganda about Iran's u-turn in  its policy on Israel and South Africa, Mahdavi says: ""They,  themselves, know that they are not being truthful and that what  they are saying is not correct. We have declared our stance on  these two from the start. About South Africa, we said that when  racism is abolished there and the oppressed and innocent people  of South Africa take over power -- on the basis of one man one  vote -- we would establish diplomatic and economic ties with  that country. And we are moving in that direction now.  However, our stance on the Zionist regime has been clear from  the start. His holiness the imam said that the Zionist regime  must be destroyed. Yes, when the Zionist regime is destroyed  and the people of Palestine take over power, our relations with  the people of Palestine -- which is now occupied, but will then  be free -- will be established.""

Armed conflicts, which  have a destructive effect on international stability, social and  ethnic upheavals, massive famine and pandemic diseases,  terrorism and the narcotics business, are threats on a global  scale and objectively cannot but affect the interests and  security of other regions and states, Russia included.    The contemporary world, and above all the  industrially-developed countries, are faced with the growing  realization that one can hardly isolate oneself from the  problems of the African continent, which are already leading to  an increase in the influx of emigrants from Africa to Europe and  other regions: such as, the growth of Islamic extremism; and the  spread of diseases, including AIDS. It is no coincidence that in  this connection Prime Minister of France Balladour stated, that  the interests of his country ""are suffering greatly from African  crises, whether it is a question of development of trade,  reliable supply of raw materials, the dangers of uncontrolled  emigration, or conflicts which threaten to upset the balance of  power on the entire continent.""[.sup]1[/]    Obviously, for these same reasons, Russia too cannot wall  herself off from Africa behind the palisades of her own  difficulties. The moreso since, while acting judiciously and  with knowledge of affairs; and while structuring relationships  with the African states on a genuine, mutually advantageous  basis, with equal rights, without the previous distortions in  the ideological and military sphere--it is possible that  cooperation with Africa, which is still a rich and independent  region despite its severe crisis, can be put to use in  overcoming our own specific problems.    At the very same time, if we withdraw from Africa, we are  then in essence acknowledging our inability to engage in  positive, constructive cooperation, and we are confirming the  opinion which is still heard from time to time, that our policy  in Africa was founded merely on the negative values of the ""cold  war.""    The warm breeze of change, which is breaking up the ice of  many years of confrontation in the world, is blowing over Africa  as well. Many countries on this continent have set about making  democratic transformations: elections have been held on a  multi-party basis, fundamental rights of citizens have been  proclaimed, and more attention is being devoted to human rights.  The changes taking place in the world, and in African states as  well, along with those transformations which are being carried  out in Russia, force us to look anew at the development of  Russo-African relations as well. A thorough ""inventory"" must be  made of the experience of our over 30 years of ties, singling  out all that is of value and useful, and decisively rejecting  the approaches which were dictated by the market conditions and  ideological considerations of the past.    At the same time one can properly set the priorities in our  relations with Africa, discover the most promising areas for  cooperation, and determine the circle of reliable partners, only  on the basis of precise analysis and forecasting of the economic  and political development of African countries, taking into  consideration those factors which have decisive influence on the  formation of a political and economic climate both for the  African continent as a whole, and for the individual  countries.[passage omitted]    I believe that it is also in the Russian interest,  especially  in the economic plane, not to lose sight of the potential of  Africa as our partner, the more so since we have already  established a firm foundation for cooperation in our relations  with many African countries.    For the most part, future Russo-African relations are seen  precisely in all-round development of mutually-advantageous  economic ties; however, it will hardly be possible to achieve  this until military-political stability is assured on the  African continent, and until the prerequisites are established  for stable socio-economic development. Orienting herself on the  prospects which lie in the plane of economic and trade  relations, Russia, employing political means, will strive to  support the processes of democratization in Africa, and will  take part in settling existing conflicts and forestalling  potential conflict.    Within the framework of the given approach, we should  obviously focus special attention on activating political ties  with this continent. At the same time, it is necessary to pay  attention to its specific nature, when quite often cooperation  in all other sectors depend upon the level of political  relations and with establishing contacts with the leadership of  a country. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the ruling  circles of many African states still take a cautious attitude  toward the political processes and reforms in Russia, lack  confidence in their successful outcome, and doubt that our  country, at the present stage, is capable of playing a  definitive role in the international arena.    African leaders, as practical experience shows, apart from  discussing questions of bilateral relations, are prepared for  dialogue with us on a broad range of problems associated with  strengthening international peace and security, and primarily  among those who are either directly influencing the situation on  their continent, or who are promoting the acceleration of  positive global transformations. From this point of view certain  directions in Russo-African interaction are seen to be  promising, such as certain aspects of disarmament, creation of  nuclear-free zones, formation of regional security systems,  strengthening international mechanisms for forestalling and  settling conflicts, and formation of an international economic  climate that is beneficial for Russia and Africa as well.    The political assistance of Russia to settlement of the  basic  ""hot spots"" of Africa, to include support in the UN Security  Council, is directed toward fulfilling the global mission of  assuring a more secure world. We also consider this assistance  an important part of our political partnership with the African  countries, which strengthens the basis for mutually-advantageous  cooperation with them.    Russia is taking a most active part in the Angolan  settlement, and together with the United States and Portugal is  joining a ""troika"" of observers over the process of carrying out  the Bisesskiy (Lisbon) Agreements (May, 1991). Russian military  and civilian observers have been sent under UN auspices to a  number of other conflict zones in Africa (Mozambique, Liberia,  Somalia and Rwanda).    On the whole it is obvious that in analyses of the prospects  for stabilization of the situation in the ""hot spots"" of Africa  and around them, one should avoid excess optimism. In this  connection, Russian proposals made at the 48th Session of the UN  General Assembly are considered timely ones. The essence of  these proposals is--to establish within a United Nations  framework additional mechanisms which will permit significantly  increasing the success rate for peacemaking operations, to  include the African continent as well.    Experience in operations in support of peace implemented by  the international community on the African continent is  important for us, for application to Russia's own efforts on the  territory of the former USSR.    At the same time, while cooperating with the West on the  African continent, one should proceed from the fact that the  commonality of approaches noted for a number of problems does  not at all signify that they are completely identical. Russia  must operate above all in consideration of her own national  interests, as well as the reality of the multipolar world that  is taking shape.    In spite of a certain slump in the sphere of trade and  economic relations, prospects for developing cooperation with  Africa exist, and above all in the extraction of minerals; in  geology; and in construction, fisheries, woodworking and  agriculture. Constructing and utilizing major new  facilities--such as the bauxite extraction complex in Dian-Dian  (Guinea); expanding the scale of independent activities of state  and commercial structures; setting up joint enterprises;  establishing new zones for trade and economic activities, for  example, in Namibia and the South African Republic--can  genuinely raise the overall qualitative level and scale of  Russia's economic ties with Africa.    The interests of Russia are served not only by maintaining,  but also by expanding existing ties. It is at the same time  necessary to purposefully and consistently place them on a new  basis: to establish multi-level forms of cooperation with the  countries which remain, chiefly for ideological motives, beyond  the sphere of our attention. At the same time we should above  all examine the possibilities for developing relations with  those states which represent a promising market for acquiring  Russian products, or suppliers of the goods and raw materials  which we need.    Intensification of Russo-African interaction will to a large  extent also depend upon transition to new forms and methods of  cooperation--granting of licenses and know-how, rental of  machinery and equipment, collaboration between industrial  sectors, and scientific-production cooperation.    In recent years, while overcoming significant difficulties,  the processes of integration have intensified in Africa. One may  quite confidently assume that in the future, inter-African  economic cooperation, aimed at the creation of an African  economic community and regional economic structures, will become  more significant. Such intentions have already appeared very  vividly in a number of regions on the continent.    Russian foreign economic structures could also take  advantage  of trends for integration in Africa for increasing her own  exports to the corresponding markets, which will apparently be  expanding as a result of the aforementioned trends. Our  participation is possible at the level of enterprises,  investment banks, and in the form of joint ventures.    In resolving African problems of development, for the  continent as a whole, for subregions and countries, Russia is  devoting significant attention to the role of the UN Economic  Commission for Africa [ECA] and, in particular, to the fact that  ECA could stimulate and attribute a truly international  character to its programs in such areas as transportation, power  engineering, development of natural resources, and environmental  protection, as well as support of small and mid-level  entrepreneurship.    Russian organizations are completely capable of  participation  in implementing projects within the framework of the second  decade of industrial development in Africa and the second decade  of transport and communication of the UN's ECA. It would appear  that Russo-African cooperation, taking into consideration the  peculiarities of the continent, could promote the solution of  problems of employment and the development of facilities in the  infrastructure; and could have as its ultimate goal the  involvement to the fullest of African countries in the system of  international division of labor on a fair basis.    An important element of bilateral relations between Russia  and countries of Africa, which requires a weighty and  well-thought-out approach, is the problem of their obligations  for credits issued by the former USSR. In terms of state credits  alone, the volume of indebtedness of sub-Saharan African  countries amounts to nearly $14 billion. The situation is  aggravated by the fact that the domestic political situation in  many of the countries which are the principal debtors is  unstable, and the economy is in a state of crisis. Therefore,  the task consists of finding ways and means of restoring the  debts, without straining political relations, and without  breaking existing mutually-advantageous ties.    It is most important to proceed from the fact that the  search  for solution of this problem must not rest on narrow  departmental considerations. It is necessary to take into  account all aspects of political and commercial-economic  relations with each country, individually. The question of  indebtedness should be examined comprehensively, employing  various strategies: partial payment in freely-convertible  currency and local currency, compensation for debt by deliveries  of goods, or reinvestment; taking things one step at a time,  using part of the debt for covering the expenses of Russian  missions, and so on.    The sphere of military-technical cooperation remains an  important link in Russia's foreign policy and economic ties with  Africa. This form of interaction appears to be quite promising  in the context of increasing its profitability and placing it on  an exclusively commercial basis. A number of African states have  an appropriate degree of interest in this.    One must not fail to consider that a prolonged pause in the  given sphere of relations with Africa can have a negative effect  on Russian interests; since the vacuum formed as a result of  breaking military-technical ties with the Soviet Union, and then  with Russia as well, is being energetically filled by other  countries--including those which produce weapons under Russian  licenses, of greatly inferior quality than that which Russia  herself could offer. It is evident, incidentally, that Russian  arms deliveries should not appear in regions of existing and  potential armed conflicts, nor in countries with openly  dictatorial regimes.    Apart from solving the urgent problems cited above,  developing stable relations with African countries demands  long-term humanitarian and political investment in the future of  our ties. In this context one should, obviously, be thinking  about the possibility of continuing, in modern conditions, the  training of African national cadres in the VUZ's of our country.  Such a practice provides its own positive results. It is another  matter, that this cooperation should be for the most part placed  on a compensatory basis. At the same time it should remain  advantageous and attractive for our African partners as well.    The question of future Russo-African relations continues to  attract the attention of the Russian and world community. Today,  it is true, few people doubt whether or not we need Africa in  general. On this account, it would appear that at last a  more-or-less unified point of view is taking shape--Yes, it is  necessary, since Russia, even with her present difficulties,  cannot allow herself the luxury of turning her back on Africa,  nor to all the other regions of our planet. Russia must assure  herself a fitting role in the world balance of influence, and in  the multilateral processes for regulating the world economy and  international relations.    By preserving all that is rational in bilateral political,  economic and cultural ties with Africa; applying to them content  appropriate to the realities of today; and by developing  cooperation in new directions, to include those countries which  previously lay beyond the bounds of our active policy, Russia  will support her own state interests, and will obtain greater  freedom in the choice of foreign policy alternatives. In this  manner the prerequisites will be laid down for more solid  positions for our country, not only on the African continent,  but in the world arena as a whole.  Footnotes    1.

However, Standard and Poor's, the other big US agency, awarded a lower rating. Mr Chris Liebenberg, South Africa's minister of finance, last night welcomed Moody's Baa3 rating, saying it demonstrated 'confidence in the coherence of the economic policies and political stability brought to the country by the government of national unity'. He noted that Standard and Poor's, which awarded a BB or sub-investment grade rating, had also said it saw a 'positive outlook' for the country. South Africa had been seeking an international credit rating since April's elections brought President Nelson Mandela's government to power. However, its first formal rating, from the European agency IBCA, was a disappointing BB, putting it on a par with countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Officials said they were pleased with Moody's higher rating, which rates South Africa ahead of both Mexico and India. Moody's said the rating was based on the country's low external debt, and on the commitment by the new government to redirect spending to a comprehensive development programme while reducing the public sector deficit. Mr Carlos Cordeiro, a partner with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank which is advising the government, said he was 'delighted' with the rating. It would allow South Africa to 'access a wider range of capital around the world', he said. South Africa has borrowed money in European markets without an official rating, but yesterday's news will permit it to re-enter the US market. In its June budget, the government said it would raise R1.8bn (Dollars 504.8m) from the international capital markets in the current financial year. External debt has been paid down in net terms since 1985, when international banks refused to roll over loans to the republic, in response to political unrest. South Africa's return to the international bond markets could be in the form of a global bond of around Dollars 500m, said Mr Liebenberg, Reuter adds from Madrid. However, Mr Liebenberg, in Madrid for the IMF/World Bank meeting, said that no firm decisions had been made and it was up to the markets to set the parameters for the issue. He said that apart from the global format, South Africa was considering a plain eurobond and even a yankee bond.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     ESZ  Spain, EC.

Qian told a reception marking the 31st anniversary of  African  Liberation Day hosted by heads of African diplomatic missions in  Beijing that this year's celebration of liberation day has a  special significance, for a new South Africa led by President  Nelson Mandela has just been born. ""It is a victory not only for  the people of South Africa, but also for the peoples in the  whole of Africa,"" he said.

The Chinese foreign minister also extended his  congratulations on the achievements that the African countries  have made in the past 31 years in promoting the process of  economic integration in the continent and in other fields, under  the banner of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

To the workers at St. Louis, Fort Worth and Boston, where  major export items like F-15, F-18 aircraft, F-16 fighters and  Patriot missiles are made, closing plants is the least they want  from President Clinton.    Controlling 57 percent of the global weapons market, the  U.S.  sold 35 billion U.S. dollars of weapons last year to the world's  volatile regions, 10 times greater than Russia and more than 100  times greater than China.    ""The real scandal at the heart of American foreign policy is  that the U.S., the world's leading democracy, has become the  world's number one arms dealer,"" said William Hartung, author of  ""And Weapons for All"".    U.S. officials point to the commercial interests in such  deals: weapon sales volume in 1993 is about one third of the  U.S. merchandise trade deficit during the period, some 150,000  jobs will be lost if arms sales are reduced.    A recent study by the New York-based World Policy Institute,  however, finds that the preoccupation with the economics of arms  trade is one-sided. Arms exports provide ""marginal, short-term""  gains for the economy.    Over the past 10 years, total U.S. arms exports averaged 19  billion dollars a year. During the same time, government loans,  grants, cash payments and other subsidies averaged over six  billion dollars a year.    This figure includes the costs of security assistance  programs that support arms exports, U.S. Government involvement  in air and trade shows, the 20,000 U.S. Government personnel  involved in arms exports and the costs of writing off bad  foreign military sales loans.    ""This seriously undercuts the net gains to the U.S. economy  from foreign military sales,"" the study says. In fiscal 1994,  arms export-related subsidies accounted for 43 percent of the  entire U.S. foreign aid budget.    Once the impacts of arms sales in stimulating arms race and  undermining the economic growth in developing countries are  taken into account, arms sales may even be a net drain on the  U.S. economy, observers say.    The International Monetary Fund, in a study released last  month, says that if the world arms expenditure is cut by one  fifth, the world's consumer market will be 190 billion dollars  larger, which is about four times the revenue of global arms  market.    On defense-related employment, a Congressional Budget Office  study in 1992 estimates that a substantial cut in U.S. arms  sales to the Middle East will affect less than two percent of  all defense workers and less than one in every thousand workers  across the country.    This is hardly a figure to cause serious damage to the  overall economic growth of the U.S., especially when only five  states -- Texas, California, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts  -- suffer the bulk of defense conversion, observers say.    However, despite of the promise to curtail world arms trade,  the Clinton administration and congress have repeatedly passed  up the moral, political and even economic concerns that such  trade may raise, observers say.    The Commerce Department has taken a hands-on role in  promoting arms exports even as the State Department has opposed  an industry proposal to create a new one billion dollars  guarantee fund for weapons exports.    Although a few deals have been scaled back or withdrawn  under  the threat of congressional action, the vast majority of 50 to  100 major arms deals made by the U.S. each year sail through  congress with little or no scrutiny.    ""If last year is any indication, America's arms sales  addiction is alive and well,"" said William Hartung. ""A change  in policy is possible, but it's not going to happen unless the  public and congress demand it, loudly and clearly.""     "

After the first democratic elections in South Africa, it is  not a matter of if, but when and how South Africa will sever  ties with its trading partner Taiwan and establish diplomatic  relations with China, Greg Mills said.

The article said: `In the throes of its own deepening  isolation, Taiwan, on the other hand, saw the opportunity as  providing a further anti-communist ally as well as an expansion  of trade.'    `South Africa's trade with China grew by 170 percent between  1992-93, and it is expected to double again this year. Also the  People's Republic of China is alleged to have been one of the  major gold buyers in recent times with about 25 percent of the  world's total (population),' the article added.    `Simply put, given the political and economic realities of  the situation, South Africa does not have any options.'    The article further stated dual recognition was a  non-starter.    `The need to make alternative arrangements with Taiwan  should  not delay a decision on the central political issue. Any  unnecessary delays or crude attempts to devise unique solutions  will only temporarily avoid the inevitable and anger Beijing,'  Greg Mills said.     "

In a move aimed at bringing the country back into the mainstream of the world energy markets, Pretoria solicited bids for licences to explore virtually all the country's coastal areas, divided into 18 blocks. Mr Pik Botha, the former foreign minister, who is now minister of mines and energy, told a launch seminar attended by oil and gas companies in London that his government 'sees this licensing round as a major step forward in exploring our offshore potential. 'We cannot guarantee that you will discover gas or oil or both,' he said. 'But we are setting in motion an intensive - and extensive - process of exploration never undertaken before'. Bids for licences have to be submitted by April next year, and Mr Botha said he hoped to have the allocation process complete by November 1995. Exploration programmes will have to be for a minimum of three years and a maximum of seven. International oil companies were active in South Africa until the early 1970s when most of them withdrew for political reasons. Since then, there has only been a small amount of exploration, mainly by Soekor, the state oil company. South Africa produces a third of its liquid hydrocarbons artificially from coal, and imports certain amounts of oil, mainly from Iran. Mr Botha said yesterday that the tariff protection given to the local oil and gas industry would continue because of its important contribution in saving foreign exchange. But he said South Africa was keen to widen its trade relations with energy-producing nations, and deals were pending with various OPEC countries which he declined to name. So far, 19 companies - 17 of them from abroad - had asked for information packs about the blocks on offer. Mr Botha said he was 'very encouraged' by the attendance at yesterday's seminar, which included many of the world's major oil companies. Asked whether South Africa was more secure than other new energy markets that are opening up, such as Central Asia, Mr Botha said: 'As secure, if not better' because of the well-developed state of South Africa's mining technology and infrastructure. 'I can assure you,' he added, 'that the rules are not only reasonable but will also be stable.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Relations with Germany occupy an important place in our  entire policy, Meksi said at the beginning of his speech. This  is based on the special economic assistance and the full  political support that your country has rendered to Albania so  far and in the good wishes and will of both sides further to  strengthen our friendly relations.    Talking concretely about the present level of cooperation in  the economic, political, technical, scientific, and cultural  spheres, Meksi considered these to be successful and stressed  that, nevertheless, there exist more favorable possibilities so  that these relations be more intensively developed in other  fields as well. Important positive factors are the good progress  of the economic reform in Albania in its main indices and the  completion of the fundamental legal framework to attract foreign  investment. Overall production has increased and there is a  decrease in the budget deficit and inflation. Stability can be  noticed in the lek's exchange rate with foreign currencies. We  can say that we have left behind the most difficult period. We  have approved the main laws on investment, business, and the  banking and credit system, and the civil and penal codes are in  the process of being approved.    Meksi further stressed that the completion of a series of  bilateral agreements that are in the process of being drafted,  such as the abolition of double taxation, tourism, road and  maritime transportation, and scientific and cultural  cooperation, will create a more facilitating legal framework to  expand relations between our two countries.    Focusing on the problem of foreign investment, Prime  Minister  Meksi said that German capital is involved in Albania in special  investment, such as that of Siemens for Rinas Airport, and in  the form of joint ventures. However, he said, we expect German  investment to grow considerably during 1994 and beyond and to  include such fields as infrastructure and telecommunication,  road constructions, such as the east-west road, aqueducts,  energy, etc.    We greatly appreciate Germany's role both on the bilateral  level and within the framework of the European Union [EU], in  which Germany is the main contributor.    Mr. Meksi also dwelt on the problem of the foreign debt of  our banks and discussed ways of settling it, as another  guarantee for attracting foreign investment. He stressed that  contacts with German partners have been strengthened and hoped  that with the Paris Club Agreement, this problem will find the  way to solution in the framework of the general debt.    For his part, Mr. Kinkel said that Germany understands quite  well the difficult problems that you are encountering during the  transitional period and that Germany is committed to help as  before on the bilateral and the EU level. Albania is a country  that has suffered the most in the past. That is why you fully  deserve special assistance on our part, Kinkel stressed.  Germany will fully support you in your goals for an the  quickest possible political and economic approach to the EU,  membership into the Council of Europe, the cooperation with BEP  [expansion unknown], and the strengthening of the security of  your country, both with the NATO integration and the bilateral  level.    For this reason, we are ready to exchange high-level visits  and sign a joint statement to display our very good relations  and the goals of cooperation in the future.    In the economic level, our assistance will be increased and  will be concentrated on the system of energy supplies, the  construction of roads, economic development, etc. Though we  have to face our problems with eastern Germany, our attention  toward Albania will be increased. I also agree to abolish visas  for diplomatic and business trips.    Further on, Kinkel appreciated the achievements in the  sphere  of the institutional and legal reform and expressed his pleasure  that the judicial system is functioning well. He was ready for  assistance in this direction as well.    To conclude, Meksi said that Albania is a small country and  with a little investment, it can overcome this situation. We  have understood that the main factor of development is within  us, our work, which, with your assistance, can give rapid  positive results.    They also discussed German assistance in education, culture,  and science, the problem of Albanian refugees, and the situation  in the region.     "

0,FT944-4620 ,"FT944-4620 _AN-ELGCWAGOFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (2): Sense of drift in economy - A look at the disappointing impact of structural adjustment      By TONY HAWKINS   As Zimbabwe's first five-year structural adjustment programme nears its end, it is impossible to escape the sense of drift and vacuum in economic policymaking. In part, this is a function of the political cycle, with elections scheduled for March next year, and also of the prolonged illness of Mr Bernard Chidzero, the long-standing finance minister, who did so much to launch the programme. Political change in South Africa is leaving its mark as major multinationals ponder restructuring their African operations. There could be far-reaching consequences for Pretoria's neighbours, especially Zimbabwe, which is particularly vulnerable to marginalisation. Nor will it be easy in the run-up to the elections for the politicians to sell a second instalment of a politically unpopular programme, though another five years, followed almost certainly by a third phase of ESAP (Economic Structural Adjustment Programme) will be needed to finish the job. Above all, structural adjustment in Zimbabwe is being re-examined as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and politicians criticise the programme's failure to alleviate poverty. Indeed, just about any index shows that poverty has deepened since the programme took off four years ago. Real incomes are lower now than at independence 14 years ago, unemployment has quadrupled and now exceeds 30 per cent, and non-farm real wages are at their lowest level for a quarter of century. While much of this can be blamed on the 1992 drought, and on a sluggish global economy, many in the NGO constituency, in academia, the trade unions and on the political left, blame ESAP. The programme is flawed: the assumption that manufacturing industry would 'lead' economic growth in the 1990s has turned into an angry debate over deindustrialisation. The preoccupation with short-term goals, laying off 25,000 civil servants, ignores the software side of the structural adjustment equation and the country's deteriorating institutional capacity, especially in the public sector. The neglect of regional issues has now been cruelly exposed by South Africa's return to respectability, as well as by Zimbabwe's optimistic projections of macroeconomic targets for exports, growth, inflation and public sector deficit reduction, none of which has been met. The flaws have been compounded by sluggish implementation, especially in the public sector, while institutional reforms are behind schedule. Deregulation and liberalisation are on, or ahead of, target in respect of prices, labour relations, investment, the exchange rate and some foreign trade reforms, with quantitative import controls having been abolished and most current account payments freed, though dividend remittances for pre-1993 companies are still restricted to 50 per cent of after-tax earnings. In both the public sector and, especially, manufacturing industry, structural change has been minimal. Scarcely a week goes by without fresh calls from industrialists for new export incentives and a cut in interest rates, while the politicians proffer repeated excuses for their failure to bite the bullet of fiscal reform. Privatisation, the central plank of ESAP II, has got no further than the drawing board. The recent decision to shift surplus funds from Noczim, the state monopoly fuel procurement company, to the financially-strapped state-owned cargo airline, Affretair, illustrates the lack both of coherence and transparency in public sector finances. Under ESAP, the budget deficit should have been reduced to 5 per cent of GDP by mid-1995 and although this remains the target, it assumes that ZDollars 1bn of state assets will be sold off by next June, and, more importantly, ignores some ZDollars 2bn of parastatal losses. If these are taken into account, the deficit would rise to over 10 per cent of GDP. The key to fiscal reform is reduced state spending, rather than increased revenue. Although personal and corporate tax rates have been cut since 1991, high inflation and fiscal drag have ensured that the tax burden continues to deter initiative and investment. Modest progress has been achieved on spending, which is down to 40.8 per cent of GDP from 45 per cent at the start of the programme. But the government's reluctance to slash military spending - the third largest item in the budget (3.5 per cent of GDP) and restructure the parastatal sector to eliminate losses, has plunged Zimbabwe into a classic debt-trap situation. Public sector debt now exceeds GDP, while interest charges are estimated at 14 per cent of GDP; central government interest payments absorb 18 per cent of the budget, second only to education. Without debt reduction and parastatal reform, there is little room for manoeuvre on the fiscal front, other than the cuts in military spending promised by Mr Mugabe last May, but unlikely to see the light of day until after the elections, if then. The promised sale of state assets, presumably some of government's shares in such companies as Delta Corporation (beverages, retailing and tourism), Astra Corp (former Zimbabwe subsidiary of the South African Barlow group) and Zimbabwe Financial Holdings (one of the top three commercial banks), to fund recurrent spending rather than reduce debt underlines the precarious fiscal balance. The government claims to have cut subsidies but only by leaving some ZDollars 2bn of parastatal losses off the balance sheet while classifying numerous other payments to parastatals as loans and investments. If all these are taken to account, the subsidy bill exceeds ZDollars 3bn or 6.5 per cent of GDP. Clearly there are major savings opportunities here, but only when parastatal reform goes beyond the cosmetics of setting up 100 per cent state-owned companies. The two major lossmakers are the Grain Marketing Board, partly because it is required to stockpile 945,000 tonnes of maize as a food security reserve, and the state-owned steel company, Zisco. Official attitudes towards privatising Zisco are seen in a recent parliamentary select committee report which, after lambasting political interference and mismanagement, calls for a 'limited' sale of equity in Zisco and the flotation of the company on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. But Zisco, with over ZDollars 2bn in debt and negative net worth is in no shape for flotation, especially if control is to remain in state hands. Meanwhile privatisation and the sale of state shares in public companies are becoming entangled in the increasingly acrimonious debate over indigenisation. Nearly 15 years after independence, black business claims that 90 per cent of the economy is still in white and foreign hands. The numbers are spurious given that the state accounts for a third of GDP, but though blacks are increasingly in charge managerially, they have little direct ownership control. Given the challenges facing Zimbabwe for the rest of the century and beyond, it is a depressingly sterile debate, with vociferous black organisations - the Indigenous Business Development Centre and the Affirmative Action Group  -preoccupied with shuffling ownership of existing assets rather than the creation of new wealth, output, exports and, above all, jobs. The government, while happy to champion indigenisation, a surefire votewinner, is doing little to help. When (rather than if) it comes to privatise, it will face intense pressure to sell to black investors and entrepreneurs, most of whom will not have the funds. Some type of investment trust linked to a more vigorous venture capital industry is needed to satisfy the business community's aspirations, but here too there are few signs of vision or leadership. Monetary growth (46 per cent so far this year) fuelled by offshore borrowings, capital inflows and the fiscal deficit, is being sterilised by ZDollars 3bn in central bank issues of special and treasury bills. The net result is real interest rates of about 10 per cent and a fall in real private sector borrowing. It is hardly surprising that investment, outside mining and tourism, is flagging and that, once again, GDP growth will fall behind target. Exports should surge next year, mainly in mining and agriculture, resulting in a further improvement in the balance of payments on current account. Part of the explanation is limp import demand, itself a consequence of flat investment, especially in manufacturing. Official forecasts predict growth of 4 per cent since GDP will not regain its 1991 levels until 1996, while per capita incomes will return to pre-ESAP levels only in 2000. Growth should exceed 5 per cent in 1995 on the strength of the commodity price rebound, expansion in gold mining, firmer tobacco prices and continued recovery in manufacturing. But unless the authorities get to grips with excessive monetary growth, interest rates and inflation - projected to average 24 per cent this year against an ESAP target of 10 per cent - the investment response will remain weak. A sound infrastructure, considerable potential in mining, agriculture and tourism, and a vibrant private sector give Zimbabwe a better chance than most sub-Saharan countries to make a success of structural adjustment. But the 1990s strategies needed to penetrate global markets, especially in manufacturing, and the commitment and leadership necessary to tackle public sector reform are missing. In the absence of new blood and a more market-driven culture, reform will be hamstrung by the combination of inertia and the ideological baggage of past commitments to 'socialist transformation'.

Qhobela,  foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, here this afternoon.    During the talks, Qian and Qhobela exchanged views on  bilateral relations and on the international situation.    Qian congratulated the Basutoland Congress Party on its  success in last year's general election and the consequent  establishment of the new government of Lesotho, and wished the  new government well in making new achievements in maintaining  domestic peace and in the construction of the country.    Qian said that the resumption of diplomatic relations  between  China and Lesotho laid a foundation for the development of  bilateral relations, adding that he was confident that the  current visit to China by Qhobela would further promote  bilateral relations and cooperation.    Touching on the situation in the Southern African region,  Qian noted that the first general election without racial  discrimination is to be held in South Africa on April 27, and  that a new South Africa of racial equality is to be set up.    This was the result of the long-term struggles of the South  African nations and peoples, said Qian, and China supports the  peace process in South Africa.    The Chinese vice-premier noted that China is willing to  develop cooperative relations with the new South Africa in  various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Qhobela said that the restoration of diplomatic relations  between Lesotho and China will inject new strength into the  promotion of bilateral relations.    Qhobela invited Qian to visit Lesotho again at his  convenience.    Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as Qian's  guests.     "
0,FT944-13875 ,"FT944-13875 _AN-EJZDWAA9FT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, NICHOLAS SHAXTON and PETER STANLEY   If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this week. The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades, secure peace. Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400 years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are taking place. It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack, for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and the end of superpower rivalries. In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and external aggression. In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general. Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the 1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of the regional settlement falls into place. And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by newly democratic South Africa. Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves. But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go wrong before the edifice is finally complete. In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat at the polls. Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'. The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms, unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies. The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries. 'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not an opposition in ideological terms.' Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls. Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers. Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of colonialism and 30 years of war. Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the people in Luanda. 'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by October 31. Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991 accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new hatreds. The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups hunted down and killed Unita supporters. The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under the new peace plan, a difficult exercise. The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful, however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale and provide the manpower required. Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds. Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main diamond producing areas. Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for peace. Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent. Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment  -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether. For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to harness the power of South Africa. If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy, the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as the start of a new and more prosperous era.  --------------------------------------------------------       THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including       Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began       in early 1960s.  Portuguese flee, and civil wars       break out.  South African troops invade Angola;       Cuba begins troop build-up.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1976  Mozambique closes border with Rhodesia, where white       minority had unilaterally declared independence       from Britain in 1965.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1976  Guerrilla war in Rhodesia escalates as forces led       by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo infiltrate from       bases in Mozambique and Zambia.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1979  Lancaster House settlement on Rhodesia paves way       for the independent state of Zimbabwe; elections       in 1980 won by Mugabe's Zanu party.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1988  US-brokered deal secures independence for Namibia       from South Africa in return for Cuban troop       withdrawal from neighbouring Angola.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1989  Sam Nujoma, leader of South West Africa People's       Organisation, wins Namibia's independence election.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1990  South Africa releases long-imprisoned black       nationalist leader Nelson Mandela  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991  Ceasefire in Angola civil war.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1992  Angolan elections confirm President Eduardo dos       Santos' MPLA in power, but opposition Unita leader       Jonas Savimbi refuses to accept outcome.  Civil       war resumes.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1992  Ceasefire in Mozambique civil war.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1994  Mandela's African National Congress wins first       all-race elections in South Africa.  --------------------------------------------------------                          ANGOLA  -------------------------------------------------------- The 1974 military takeover in Portugal brought Angolan independence the following year but not peace.  Civil war continuedm exacerbated by South African invasions and the arrival of Cuban troops.  A ceasefire resulted in elections in 1992, with the ruling MPLA defeating the opposing Unita movement.  Unita refused to accept the outcome; war resumed.  Now, peace talks may be close to success.  --------------------------------------------------------                         NAMIBIA  -------------------------------------------------------- A 1988, US-brokered settlement saw the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in return for South African acceptance of multi-party elections in Namibia.  These took place in the following year and were won by the South West Africa People's Organisation, which is still in power.  --------------------------------------------------------                        ZIMBABWE  -------------------------------------------------------- Once the fiefdom of the British South Africa Company, the territory (then Rhodesia) became a British colony at the turn of this century.  The settlers won self government in 1923, unilaterally declared independence in 1965, but bowed to sanctions and guerrilla war in 1979. In 1980 elections, the Zanu party came to power, where it stays today in partnership with the Zapu party.  --------------------------------------------------------                       MOZAMBIQUE  -------------------------------------------------------- As in Angola, independence in 1975 was traumatic, marked by the exodus of more than 200,000 settlers of Portuguese origin and a civil war encouraged first by white Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and then by white South Africa. A 1992 peace pact brought the war to an end.  This Thursday and Friday, 6.5m voters go to the polls in the country's first multi-party elections.  --------------------------------------------------------                     SOUTH AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- More than 350 years after Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck founded a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, white rule and its apartheid racial policies finally gave way in the face of sanctions and domestic opposition with the release from prison in 1990 of Nelson Mandela.  He was elected president of South Africa this year in the country's first all-race elections.  --------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  AOZ  Angola, Africa.

The estimated $20 billion project will be completed in  15 years. Guo Xuyan, president of the Three Gorges project, will  arrive in Brazil next month to visit Itaipu and hold talks with  construction companies and capital goods suppliers (turbines and  electricity generators).    The Brazilian trade offensive is being prepared by the  Itamaraty Trade Promotion Department in reply to the Asian  countries' interest in increasing trade with Brazil. At least  two official Chinese trade missions have visited Brazil in the  past six months, contacting government officials and business  leaders. Currently a mission of 30 Brazilian businessmen is  touring Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia looking for business  deals and partnerships. In May, a business delegation will  accompany President Itamar Franco to the PRC, and in September  another business mission will travel to China, South Korea, and  Indonesia.    Priority    Southeast Asia is one of Itamaraty's priorities. ""It is the  fastest growing region in the world, and China is the largest  country in the region,"" a diplomat said. In the past few years,  trade with China has been increasing at 20 percent annually, and  trade between the two countries surpassed $1 billion in 1993.    Brazil's main interest is to participate in hydroelectric,  mining, and telecommunication projects, as well as in  pharmaceutical industry, software [preceding word in English],  and satellite launching and manufacturing technology deals. Some  deals already are well under way. A Brazilian company will  supply the Chinese Government with digital centrals for rural  telephone systems -- a contract whose negotiations started in  November 1993.    A Sao Paulo enterprise will sell banking automation  equipment  to the PRC. The CBPO, Mendes Junior, Andrade Gutierrez, and Vale  do Rio Doce construction and mining companies already have set  up offices in Beijing. This year Brazil and the PRC will  commemorate 20 years since the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations between the two countries. ""Businesses tend to  increase given the large size of the two countries in the  international context,"" an Itamaraty source said.    South Africa    Another market in which Brazil is interested is South  Africa,  which intends to invest nearly $5 billion in a reconstruction  and development project. A Brazilian business delegation visited  South Africa and returned very optimistic about future business  opportunities. South Africa is a rich country with considerably  developed technology, which is concentrated mainly on the white  minority.    Elections will be held there on 27 April, and African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is expected to win and  introduce a deep transformation in the country.    A Brazilian company closed a deal to export tow trucks, and  other Brazilian companies will participate in the duplication of  telephone circuits, thus expanding telecommunications routes  between the two countries.    According to a diplomatic source, the South African  Government is particularly interested in obtaining intermediary  technology in the fields of steel mills, mining, electricity,  petrochemical, and agribusiness.    Some Brazilian construction companies will be able to  participate in a project to build 1 million low-income houses.  ""In the mid-term, 20 million people, mainly blacks, must become  consumers,"" a diplomat said. In 1993, trade between Brazil and  South Africa was $280 million.     "

The dirty and unspoken secret of American foreign policy is the ""R"" word. It is  not uttered in polite society, but nothing else can explain our government's  often cruel and contradictory policies. Racism disregards black lives, and  black lives are being lost daily in southern Africa because of callous policy  decisions made by the Bush Administration.    The United States and South Africa have contributed weapons, money and other  resources to Renamo, the right-wing rebels in Mozambique, and to UNITA, a rebel  organization in Angola. Both are terrorist groups that have caused not only  widespread death and misery in those countries but also an extraordinary $40  billion in property damage over the past 10 years, according to a recent United  Nations report. The price of American and South African foreign policy is the  blood and the lives of black Africans.    While we seem to have money for war, we give no money for peace. For the coming  year, eight African nations -- Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi,  Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- are expected to get a pitiful total  of about $50 million in American foreign-development aid. These countries,  which are part of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference,  contain 76 million people, most of them poor, many of them starving or losing  their lives to disease, many more of them dying in U.S.- and South  African-supported violence.    All over southern Africa, hundreds of thousands of children die every year from  malaria, yellow fever, influenza, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases.  In Tanzania alone, 250,000 children die every year of sicknesses that in the  Western world have been effectively abolished. Hunger and starvation are  rampant in these countries. The health-care systems are overburdened to the  point of collapse.    Not all of the causes of misery in southern Africa are found in nature. The  apartheid government in South Africa has engaged over the past several years in  a systematic campaign of terrorist aggression, destabilization and sabotage  against neighboring countries. In the past decade, this strategy for regional  military dominance has caused the deaths of 1.5 million people in southern  Africa, more than half of them children under 5 years old.    A senior State Department official told a United Nations Conference on  Mozambique in early 1988 that the Renamo campaign was ""a systematic and brutal  war of terror against innocent civilians through forced labor, starvation,  physical abuse and wanton killing.""    According to UNICEF, 494,000 children under age 5 in Mozambique died from  war-related causes between 1980 and 1988, and 331,000 Angolan children under 5  lost their lives to UNITA's war.    According to testimony during a congressional hearing last year, the United  States sends the bandits of UNITA an estimated $80 million a year in covert aid  to wage their unpopular and futile war of death and destruction.    Thus, we Americans spend more of our money causing bloodshed in Angola than we  do on promoting development in the states of the Southern Africa Development  Coordination Conference, nations that are all struggling to create democracy  and diversify their economies. If we can support important processes of  liberalization and economic reconstruction in Europe, why not in Africa? What  is the difference?    Opponents of aid to Africa assert that Africa has less ""strategic"" importance  to us than Europe. Then, it must be asked, why have we spent hundreds of  millions of dollars supporting South Africa's dubious foreign policy by  encouraging destruction and terror in the region? What justifies our  participation in these guerrilla wars?    The aftermath of the invasion of Panama and the end of the Cold War in Europe  show us how quickly America can mobilize to give foreign aid to a people in  need. It only took Congress days after the shake-up in Eastern Europe to  authorize more than $900 million in development aid for Poland and Hungary over  the next three years.    The swift passage of aid to these countries was morally right. We have an  obligation to help the people of Panama recover from the damage caused by our  invasion and the Noriega dictatorship. Similarly, the whole world is cheering  for democracy and freedom in Europe.    But if we can help white people in Europe to improve their quality of life and  their political system, we can do the same for black people in Africa. If we  can contemplate a second Marshall Plan for the relatively wealthy nations of  Europe, we can develop a first Marshall Plan for the impoverished nations of  Africa.    The fact is, now that we have helped to create so much misery and chaos in  southern Africa, we have an obligation to help the people of the region find  their way to economic development, freedom from starvation and political  democracy.

The decision eliminates all economic sanctions against South  Africa with the exception of a blanket ban on the export of  weapons to all countries.    The decision, effective from January 28, will release for  export a range of previously restricted products including  computers and four-wheel-drive vehicles for use by the South  African military and police forces.    The government has already lifted bans on flights between  Japan and South Africa and on investment in that country.    A new South African Constitution, drawn up after two years  of  negotiations, guarantees a formal end to the legalized system of  racial discrimination known as apartheid following the nation's  first all-race elections on April 27.

""Individual governments have to increase their input and  intensify community involvement in the vaccination programmes,""  said Kebba Jobe, a Gambian participant, said. Speaking before  the start of the seminar Jobe, who manages his country's  expanded programme on immunization, said the Gambia had attained  69 percent immunisation for children aged below one year. He  said donors must continue supporting Gambia to reduce the cost  of vaccines and thereby increase the percentage of immunisation.    A Mauritanian delegate, Dr. Pradbodh Munbodh, said managers  of immunisation programmes in Africa should adopt private sector  working methods to reduce bureaucracy. He told delegates from  South Africa that by 1992, Mauritania had attained vaccination  of between 75 and 80 percent of all pregnant women, 85 percent  of children against measles and 90 percent against diphteria,  whooping cough and tetanus. ""Since you face an enourmous  vaccination task in your country, the best thing is to motivate  the paramedical personnel directly involved in the field,"" he  told Ray Mabope, the African National Congress' (ANC) national  chair on vaccination and immunisation and Bonginkosi Mhlanga of  the Pan-Africanist Congress' (PAC) health directorate. Mabope  said that with its three vaccine manufacturing institutions,  South Africa should be able to vaccinate all its children within  the next few years and become a vaccine supplier to countries in  the southern African development community.    This, he said, would entail rationalising the activities of  the South African Institute for Medical Research, the State  Vaccine Institute and the National Institute of Virology ""to cut  down wastage.""    Mhlanga said that although the South African Government  claimed it had achieved 80 percent immunisation of its children,  ""we have to unify the country first before analysing the  situation in South Africa, especially in the homelands, where  the situation is not clear."" South Africa is due to form its  first democratic government after the country's first non-racial  elections on 26-28 April.    The four-day seminar, which has attracted vaccination  experts  from Africa, Europe and the United States, is to be opened later  today by Cote d'Ivoire's health minister, Maurice Guikahue. The  theme is: ""To build a durable partnership for immunisations for  Africa."" It is the fourth of its kind, after those of Bamako in  1974, Dakar in 1981 and Niamey in 1987.    South Africa, which is taking part for the first time, is  represented by an eight-person multiracial delegation, including  representatives of government and the former liberation  movements -- ANC and PAC.

But his lofty assertion that the newly formed Freedom Alliance's leaders (Inkatha, Conservative party, Afrikaner Volksfront, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei) have poor credentials as demo-crats cannot pass without comment. I will not attempt to claim that Africa produces state-of-the-art, western-style democrats. But as many well-informed South Africa correspondents, human rights campaigners (including Helen Suzman) and political commentators have observed, the two most blatantly undemocratic organisations in South Africa are the ANC-South African Communist party alliance and the ruling National party. It is difficult to determine which of them has the more shameful human rights record or which, in the past, had the firmer resolve to squash free speech or criticism. Many now feel the ANC-SACP alliance is the greater offender, since left-wing 'censorship' is now so virulent. Either way, one wonders what on earth Joe Rogaly is trying to say. He cannot be implying that Nelson Mandela's or President F W de Klerk's democratic credentials are impressive, can he? They are both good public relations men, not democrats.

Next year the country will get 30  million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last  year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization  process, education, ""marginalized"" youth and employment.    This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday  by  Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister  Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The  Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when  a new government has been formed on the basis of the  parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April.    The ministers' document covers political relations, economic  relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with  South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form  would depend above all on developments in the near future. They  have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up  with the country because the Netherlands ""has historical and  cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good  contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight  against apartheid.""    The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship  with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private  organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary  before the end of the year to consult the new South African  Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a  country in transition, and consequently will receive no  large-scale or long-term aid.    Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the  ""South African economy, which in principle is very promising.""  Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment  delegations and -- ""when the time is ripe"" -- more flexible  policies on export credit insurance.     "

AFRICA;    SAYS THAT HOLDING LINE AGAINST SANCTIONS MAY HINGE ON PROGRESS      By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer      LONDON      If acting South African President Frederik W. de Klerk fails to quickly use his  election mandate for political reform, ""then holding the line against punitive  sanctions will be infinitely more difficult,"" Britain's deputy prime minister,  Geoffrey Howe, cautioned Thursday.    The remark, seen as a thinly veiled warning that British patience with  Pretoria's apartheid policy may be running out, is considered significant  because Britain has been the most adamant major Western nation to oppose  economic sanctions as a method of trying to force South Africa to dismantle  apartheid, its system of racial segregation.    At the same time, Foreign Secretary John Major called the results of  Wednesday's election in South Africa ""a very formidable mandate . . . for  progressive change.""    ""It has no friends left these days, apartheid, and the sooner it goes the  better,"" Major said.    South Africa's ruling National Party won its 11th straight victory in  Wednesday's whites-only elections, but lost ground to opponents on both the  left and right.    National Party leader De Klerk, who took over as acting president last month  from the ailing Pieter W. Botha, is seen by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  government as representing the best chance for reform in the country. Officials  here have said privately for weeks that they had reason to expect dramatic  moves after Wednesday's balloting.    Thatcher is believed to have made such moves a condition for a state visit to  South Africa -- a visit much desired by the white regime there.    London has steadfastly opposed economic sanctions against Pretoria, arguing  that they would not work and that the West has a better chance to influence  positive change in South Africa by keeping open its lines of communication to  the government. Britain's position has helped to soften punitive moves against  Pretoria by other Commonwealth and North Atlantic Treaty Organization  countries, including the United States.      Defends Sanctions Stand    Major, in a radio interview Thursday, defended Britain's stand on sanctions and  carefully skirted the question of what specific reforms London wants. Howe, a  former foreign secretary, was more direct when he spoke at a meeting of the  Assn. of American Correspondents in London.

AFRICA;    SAYS THAT HOLDING LINE AGAINST SANCTIONS MAY HINGE ON PROGRESS      By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer      LONDON      If acting South African President Frederik W. de Klerk fails to quickly use his  election mandate for political reform, ""then holding the line against punitive  sanctions will be infinitely more difficult,"" Britain's deputy prime minister,  Geoffrey Howe, cautioned Thursday.    The remark, seen as a thinly veiled warning that British patience with  Pretoria's apartheid policy may be running out, is considered significant  because Britain has been the most adamant major Western nation to oppose  economic sanctions as a method of trying to force South Africa to dismantle  apartheid, its system of racial segregation.    At the same time, Foreign Secretary John Major called the results of  Wednesday's election in South Africa ""a very formidable mandate . . . for  progressive change.""    ""It has no friends left these days, apartheid, and the sooner it goes the  better,"" Major said.    South Africa's ruling National Party won its 11th straight victory in  Wednesday's whites-only elections, but lost ground to opponents on both the  left and right.    National Party leader De Klerk, who took over as acting president last month  from the ailing Pieter W. Botha, is seen by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  government as representing the best chance for reform in the country. Officials  here have said privately for weeks that they had reason to expect dramatic  moves after Wednesday's balloting.    Thatcher is believed to have made such moves a condition for a state visit to  South Africa -- a visit much desired by the white regime there.    London has steadfastly opposed economic sanctions against Pretoria, arguing  that they would not work and that the West has a better chance to influence  positive change in South Africa by keeping open its lines of communication to  the government. Britain's position has helped to soften punitive moves against  Pretoria by other Commonwealth and North Atlantic Treaty Organization  countries, including the United States.      Defends Sanctions Stand    Major, in a radio interview Thursday, defended Britain's stand on sanctions and  carefully skirted the question of what specific reforms London wants. Howe, a  former foreign secretary, was more direct when he spoke at a meeting of the  Assn. of American Correspondents in London.    ""As De Klerk himself has said, he has a mandate for reform,"" Howe said. ""We  certainly hope, and I have reason to believe, he wants to use that (mandate).  If he doesn't, then holding the line against punitive sanctions will be  infinitely more difficult.""

[Begin recording] [Rodriques] Well, I mean that depends on  the schedule of President Castro. You know that Cuba is a very  far country and the president of course has a lot of engagements  to attend, and that's why it's a normal procedure.    [Kendall] This was not for security reasons?    [Rodriques] Well, it's part of the procedures for the  president. (?They) take into consideration the distance between  Cuba and South Africa, and the engagements of the president.    [Kendall] How important for Cuba are ties with the new South  Africa?    [Rodriques] I think this is very important for Cuba. There  have been long historical relations between Cuba and the  patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this  victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great  importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy  towards President Mandela and his post.    [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa  following the inauguration of President Mandela?    [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our  government to keep very close ties with the new Government of  South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field,  and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from  the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view,  and many other fields. We feel very optimistic that this kind  of relations will become greater. [passage omitted] [end  recording]     "

These remarks were made by Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas during a telephone interview with FIDES NEWS AGENCY's  central offices at Government House. The vice president is  heading a national delegation in Cape Town. The mission  participated in Nelson Mandela's inauguration together with 150  other missions and nearly 5,000 world rulers and personalities.    ""What we are doing in Bolivia, (the reforms), through much  pain and sacrifice, is very important for the future. The  entire world, not just Bolivia, is working to build  multicultural democracies where different ethnic groups,  cultures, and customs form part of the fabric of democracy,""  Cardenas said.    During his two-day visit to South Africa, Cardenas held  short  meetings with representatives of various countries. He met with  U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Hilary Clinton. He also met  with Cuban President Fidel Castro Ruz, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat,  and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize  winner.    ""The central issue of all dialogues with these important  world leaders was the outcome of South African democracy and  improving relations with that nation,"" the vice president  explained.    ""Bolivians must think very seriously about normalizing  relations with South Africa and opening a Bolivian special  mission in this country,"" Cardenas said, stressing the  importance for Bolivia of the changes that are being experienced  by one of the African continent's more powerful nations.    At 2000 (Bolivian time) on 18 May, Victor Hugo Cardenas will  have ""an exclusive meeting"" with President Nelson Mandela to  discuss issues relative to the democratic process and the ethnic  factor in both nations.    Cardenas said there is full awareness that the change  process  in South Africa was very painful and full of sacrifice, ""but  there is also the fact that Bolivia can participate in the  construction of a multiethnical and multicultural democracy,  that this is no longer a dream.""    Cardenas said some South African countries ""are interested  in  details of the recent reforms introduced by Bolivia through laws  on popular participation, capitalization, and education reform.  They are very interested in the Bolivian case, a country where  people from many ethnical backgrounds have integrated.""    The vice president said that during his short meeting with  Cuba's President Fidel Castro, the two leaders recalled the  outstanding moments of the Cuban participation in Sanchez de  Lozada's inauguration last August. ""Castro again thanked the  Bolivian people for their affection and warmth during his  historic visit.""    Cardenas said that during his meeting with Vice President Al  Gore, the U.S. official said he felt gratitude and happiness  over his visit to Bolivia last March. ""The wife of the U.S.  president, Hilary Clinton, told us that Mr. and Mrs. Gore are  really happy, particularly after visiting Lake Titicaca and the  adjacent settlements.""    The vice president said: ""Bolivia is remembered by these  distinguished friends. They asked about the capitalization  project, education reform, and people's participation.""    ""South Africa is building a multiethnic, multicultural, and  multilingual democracy, just as Bolivia. These are common  aspects from which Bolivians can learn a lot.

0,FT924-1503 ,"FT924-1503 _AN-CLQCFAFVFT 921217   FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (4): Grasping the nettle - The privatisation of ZCCM      By PHILIP GAWITH   QUESTIONS hang over whether, when and how the Zambian government will privatise Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the giant copper producer. Although the new government has shown a commendable willingness to take unpopular decisions, it is doubtful whether there is a larger nettle to grasp than the privatisation of ZCCM. Not only does the company remain the single dominant economic entity in the country - it has often in the past been referred to as a 'state within a state' - but it is also the repository for much emotional and ideological baggage. Within the miserable economic legacy of President Kaunda, the nationalisation of the copper industry probably ranks as the greatest act of folly. It took place in two stages: In January 1970, the industry was reorganised with the government taking 51 per cent of the two companies running the industry - Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines and Roan Consolidated Mines (merged into ZCCM in 1982). In late 1974, the government also took over the management of the mines, hitherto provided by companies associated with the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and AMAX. Nationalisation was disastrous. Strapped for cash, the government placed ever greater burdens on ZCCM forcing it into all sorts of peripheral activities at the expense of investment in the core business of mining metals. The result was a steady decline in production, slumping to a nadir of 387,000 tonnes of copper in the 1991/2 financial year from an average annual 600,000 tonnes combined production of Nchanga and Roan before they were merged into ZCCM. The Chiluba government came to power in November 1991 on a platform which included privatisation as a vital component of its economic programme. However, scepticism has persisted about its strength of conviction - fuelled a few months ago when vice-president Levy Mwanawasa said he favoured taking '20 to 30 years' over ZCCM's privatisation. Supporting this view, is the fact that the company's restored profitability gives the government less incentive to proceed with a sell-off. Second, many senior figures in government are intimately connected with the initial decision to nationalise the mines. Indeed, Mr Humphrey Mulemba, the incumbent minister of mines, presided over the nationalisation in 1970 in the same capacity as minister of mines. No matter what such men say in public, privatisation would involve a considerable humiliation. Furthermore, the government has already been accused of seeking to make a quick buck and may be anxious to dispel such accusations. However, the government will not want to compromise its hard-won economic reform credentials by bending to the wind over ZCCM. Baulking over the sell-off could also prompt the World Bank to make this a necessary condition for the provision of further aid. Ministers also appear committed, albeit for different reasons. Although Mr Mulemba cautions that the government must be 'very, very careful not to move carelessly', he adds that the privatisation of ZCCM is 'one of those things we would like to push as quickly as possible'. His reasoning is simple: maximising government spending options depends on putting ZCCM on a path of sustained profitability. This requires new private sector investment, which is most likely assured by withdrawing the spectre of government interference and control. Dr Mathias Mpande, deputy minister of mines is unequivocal that his priority as a minister is to achieve the turnaround of ZCCM through privatisation. 'If you're an economic nationalist, you're just a lost economic dinosaur in the world,' he says. Dr Mpande argues that whereas he originally envisaged a protracted debate of about a year, things are now going 'very quickly. All parties want to get it over'. The World Bank will be conducting a study, during the first quarter of 1993, which will come up with an action plan for ZCCM's privatisation. The other issue is what shape a sell-off would take. Mr Mulemba believes the government should maintain a minority stake, but says he is flexible depending on what will best foster investor confidence. Dr Mpande favours breaking up ZCCM into smaller units to attract as many foreign investors as possible, allowing the government to profit from competition between them. Although many of South Africa and the world's main resource groups have shown interest in the Zambian mining sector - RTZ, BHP, Phelps Dodge, Gencor and JCI among them - Anglo American, holder of a 27.3 per cent minority stake in ZCCM, is in pole position. Anglo has not disguised its interest in lifting its stake, and Dr Mpande says he takes it for granted this will be the case. 'When they come back they will be in charge of management, but there will be very little change. The people they need are already there. The human resource is there, but they can enrich it.' The chances of a total sell-off appear unlikely. The government will not want to forsake all influence over what is seen as the jewel in Zambia's crown. Any controlling shareholder is also likely to deem it prudent to have the government on board, if only to share responsibility for difficult decisions such as retrenchment. Although the government is unlikely to commit itself until after the World Bank study is completed, the chances of the privatisation being resolved within the next year must be good. The interim is likely to see a good deal of horse trading as private investors jockey for a piece of the action.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

These diplomatic activities show relations between  Vietnam and countries in Africa and the Middle East are  developing positively. Here is our comments on these events:    Due to geographic difficulties, relations between Vietnam  and  countries in Africa and the Middle East have not developed,  though the peoples in that region offered support towards the  national liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people in the  past as well as in national construction at present. Those  geographical obstacles are now less difficult. Many countries  in that region have invited Vietnamese leaders to pay working  visits. In response to their warm sentiments, in March Vice  President Nguyen Thi Binh led a Vietnamese delegation to visit  Algeria, Guinea, and Mali. Vietnam signed with those three  countries agreements on economic, cultural, scientific and  technological, and trade cooperation. At the end of last week,  Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh left for South Africa to attend  the swearing-in ceremony of President Nelson Mandela. There,  she met leaders of African countries and affirmed Vietnam's  determination to strengthen cooperative ties with them,  particularly with the new South Africa.    In the Middle East, with the current visit by Vice Premier  Nguyen Khanh to Syria and Egypt, new prospects in cooperation  have been opened up. Trade agreements have been signed between  Vietnam and Syria and Egypt. Vietnam now has expanded its  relations with all regions in the world. It has genuinely  integrated into the international community. Vietnam's foreign  policy to befriend all countries in the world and its  achievement in the current economic renovation are keys to  Vietnam's successes.     "

Nedcor Bank, a subsidiary of Nedcor, has entered into a strategic alliance with Societe Financiere pour les Pays d'Outre-Mer (SFOM), to combine forces in Africa. SFOM, a Swiss-based holding company, has major shareholdings in banks in 14 countries in Africa with a strong presence in West and Central Africa. It is owned by Banque Nationale de Paris, Dresdner Bank and Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Nedcor Bank and SFOM have also agreed, with effect from October 1 1993, to combine forces in Namibia by merging Namibian Banking Corporation and Commercial Bank of Namibia. The merged bank will be jointly managed by the two partners, which hold an 88 per cent stake, and will be known as The Commercial Bank of Namibia. It will be the third largest bank in Namibia with total assets of R725m (Dollars 166m). Nedcor Bank has also agreed to acquire an effective 16 per cent strategic stake in the Merchant Bank of Central Africa, one of Zimbabwe's premier banks, in partnership with other major shareholders including SFOM, NM Rothschild and Hill Samuel. Nedcor Bank said that, given South Africa's inexperience in the rest of the continent, it had been decided to forge relationships with other banks that had greater experience in the region.

This enabled arms to be  supplied continually to Afghan rebels in their uprising against  the USSR- supported government of Najibollah. This was also the  reason why despite the controversial information received  through CIA sources, the U.S. President continued to issue  ""clean-chits"" on Pakistan's nuclear program.    But the end of the cold-war signified a decline in the  importance of Pakistan for the U.S. The result being that the  White House at the end of October 1990, expressed its inability  to issue such chits. Consequently, all the military aid given  to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment provisions were  stopped. But contrary to even U.S. expectations, Pakistan  managed to meet all its defense needs in the last four years.    It appears that Pakistan is not likely to be trapped by this  U.S. enticement as she has her own problems. Even if Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto wants to, she cannot accept the U.S.  proposal as Pakistan's nuclear program is in the hands of the  military, with opposition leader Nawaz Sharif giving it a  political color. Prime Minister Bhutto perhaps would not like  to shatter the dreams of her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who  launched the nuclear program under any external pressure by  suspending it.    According to a report published in Washington, the U.S.  would  like to entice India together with Pakistan, to nab the former  in her policy trap. If India agrees to sign the nuclear NPT and  accepts the measures for international security proposed by the  U.S., the latter might extend her the following benefits.    (1) First, the U.S. could take the initiative by resuming to  supply fuel for the Tarapur Power Plant. It may be recalled  that after India's peaceful nuclear testing in Pokharan in 1974,  the U.S stopped supplying fuel for the plant in 1980-81 under  its policy of coercion and regulation of nuclear  nonproliferation. But, due to the (?determined) policy of  Indira Gandhi and her followers, and France as its alternative  supplier of Uranium U-235, India not only successfully ran the  plant, it also did not compromise on its nuclear policy.    (2) Also, an assurance could be given to soft peddle Super  301 measures. The U.S. has all along been threatening India  together with Japan and Brazil with imposing economic and trade  sanctions for their prohibitive business behavior under Super  301 rules. Any U.S. decision in this regard would prove  extremely important for India in her current weakened economy  because one-fifth of its total exports are consumed in the U.S.    (3) With the liberalization of U.S. rules on computer  imports, it may become possible for India to start exporting her  latest computers. After a recent liberalization, the U.S.  Department of Commerce allowed India to export computers of the  level of 500 MTOPAS. If the U.S. wants, it can raise this level  to 1000 MTOPAS, the limit it prescribes for other countries.  India's present quota is only 125 MTOPAS.    (4) Another concession is providing complete help to  Hindustan Aeronautics in manufacturing light bombers. The  cessation of aid from the U.S. firm, Marin Marietta, to Indian  scientists in design-development for advanced flight-control  systems could prove to be a great headache. But any ban on  General Electric engines by the U.S. could ground the whole  program till the Kaveri engine, which is still being produced by  the Gas Turbine Research Organization, is ready.    How far would these U.S. enticements to India like the F-16  bombers to Pakistan, serve U.S. economic interests? The basic  idea of resuming the supply of uranium and helping in the  manufacture of light bombers is to make India dependent on the  U.S. On the other hand, the supplies of the most modern  computers is also guided by demand. Computer technology is a  monopoly of the U.S. and Japan. The aim of the relaxation of the  U.S.-Japan computer monopoly is to remove hurdles in its  competition with Japan, which as a result the U.S. electronics  industry has so far suffered losses of $30 billion. India's  increased use of computers and the huge size of its market could  help compensate the U.S. favorably for this loss.    Like India and Pakistan, another victim of the  economic-interest-spurred by U.S. NPT policy is North Korea. By  blowing out of proportion North Korea's nuclear capability, the  U.S., on one hand, has been able to make its active role in  nuclear nonproliferation felt. On the other hand, by creating a  atmosphere of fear in South Korea, it has activated a market for  its weapons new and old. The recent supply of Patriot missiles  bear testimony to this assertion. Unhappy with the U.S.  decision to resume supplying F-16 bombers to Pakistan, the  Republican Senator from South Dakota and the author of the  Pressler Law, Gary Pressler, has perhaps rightly commented:  ""Instead of adopting a responsible policy on NPT in South Asia,  the Clinton Administration appears to be conducting only the  sale of the military arms and junk brought out from the Pentagon  garage."" Whether it is to restore the F-16 jets to Pakistan at  the cost of Pakistan's nuclear program or frightening the South  Koreans by magnifying the nuclear capability of North Korea and  thus ensuring the sale of her missiles to South Korea, the only  aim of U.S. policy is to use the NPT to enhance regional  imbalances, and as a cover to fan the demand for traditional  arms that has been dying after the end of the cold war. To the  U.S. this appears to be the only way to save its arms industry,  which has now fallen on bad times. To achieve this, the U.S.  can go to the extent of using the nuclear nonproliferation as a  weapon and it into cold storage in case it fails.    The Clinton Administration has not made a final decision on  Pakistan's F-16 jets. However, the views of the Assistant State  Secretary Robin Raphel in the context of the ineffectiveness of  the Pressler Amendment for achieving the NPT aims indicate that  the U.S. might restore its supply without any conditions, and  this should cause no surprise.    If the U.S. is really worried about the increasing number of  countries with nuclear capability, why does it not forgo its  business ruses and attempt to set a treaty that is acceptable to  all? Such a treaty should not only provide guarantees for  nonnuclear countries by prohibiting the use of force by nuclear  states, it should also provide for an early and systematic  destruction of their nuclear arsenals.

0,FT944-12720 ,"FT944-12720 _AN-EJ4DUAEWFT 941031   FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Africa's stock markets aim high - The Emerging Investor      By MARK SUZMAN   As with so much else on the continent, Africa's stock exchanges tend to be bypassed by international investors who are convinced that anything preceded by the word African must be a hopeless economic basket case. Indeed, even among emerging markets specialists, few are aware of the existence of any African stock markets outside of South Africa - and even in that country genuine international interest is a relatively recent occurrence. Last week, however, at the annual general meeting of the African Stock Exchanges Association (ASEA) in Johannesburg, representatives from bourses across the region served notice that Africa is determined to put itself back on the international investment map. In particular, now that a politically rehabilitated South Africa is rapidly becoming integrated with the rest of the continent and is poised to act as its economic leader, hopes are running high that the continent's various exchanges are about to embark on an unprecedented growth path. 'The situation is looking better now for Africa than at any time in the past 30 years, and there's real potential for growth,' observes one analyst who recently started assessing African stocks. While such glib predictions litter Africa's modern economic history, ASEA officials are adamant that this is no longer a pipe-dream, pointing out that there are currently no fewer than 14 operative African stock markets, with a combined market capitalisation of Dollars 256bn (Pounds 162bn). Of these, South Africa is by far the most important player, accounting for Dollars 240bn compared with Dollars 7bn in North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco); Dollars 8bn in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Swaziland and Uganda) and a further Dollars 1bn coming from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. Even more striking is the fact that many exchanges already offer impressive returns. As a group the African markets rose by an average 30 per cent last year and only two exchanges, Botswana and Nigeria, fell. Zimbabwe, meanwhile, had the fourth best performing market in the world, rising by an astonishing 123 per cent in dollar terms (albeit off a low base) and the Mauritian index rose 51 per cent. Taking note of these figures, some of the bigger investment banks and securities houses have started to investigate African markets more seriously. Morgan Stanley, for example, has included several non-South African stocks in its Africa Fund and is distinctly upbeat on the continent's prospects. 'In spite of past problems, Africa's potential is unmistakeable. The world's second largest continent, with 11m square miles, is three times the size of the US and has twice the population, 600m strong, and is rich in natural resources and agriculture,' its assessment concludes. Similarly, in another recent report, Barings predicts that African exchanges should be able to expand from their current 2.2 per cent share of world market capitalisation to 3 per cent by 2010 on the back of anticipated cross-border equity flows of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.6bn. The sub-Saharan markets on their own, the report predicts, could expand by a factor of five or six times. Nevertheless, if the continent is to achieve this, analysts agree that further structural reforms are desperately needed. In particular, the markets need to boost liquidity substantially: South Africa, with annual turnover amounting to only 7.4 per cent of market capitalisation, is currently the most liquid of all sub-Saharan markets and even in the north, only Morocco's 21.7 per cent exceeds it. In large part, this is due to currency controls, which are still in place in nearly all African countries and need to be removed to allow the free movement of capital. At the same time, however, the markets need to launch some international stock offerings to help raise the continent's profile. These points are largely accepted by the markets, which have started actively lobbying their respective governments for action on both fronts. 'Only by removing the major stumbling block of exchange controls and by providing new shares through privatisation issues can we attract the foreign capital we so dearly need to develop our countries,' observes Mr Jimnah Mbaru, ASEA chairman. The first leg of this process has already begun. Several countries have implemented currency reforms as part of IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes. South Africa is also likely to jettison its own confusing financial rand system for foreign investors some time early next year, which should provide further impetus for the deregulation process. At the same time, moreover, many states are considering privatising companies in sectors such as mining, telecommunications and transport. As Ghana's highly successful recent Dollars 450m flotation of its Ashanti gold mine, of which 87 per cent was sold internationally, indicates, given the proper conditions global investors are more than willing to take a chance on Africa. In the meantime, the continent's stockbroking fraternity is continuing to grow: two more markets, in Tanzania and Malawi, are expected to open over the coming year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Friday  Week on week change Stock                             Country  28/10/94   Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bagfas                             Turkey   0.2106    0.0422     25.07 Shinhan Bank                     S.

Mesfin said the relations between the two countries are very  good, adding that Ethiopia has had a lot of support from and  cooperation with China in achieving national unity and economic  development.    He hailed the economic development in China as a great  success, which he said will be a great encouragement to Ethiopia.    Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said China  treasures the friendship between the two countries and is  willing to strengthen the cooperation on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence.    Qian said, the realization of peace in Ethiopia after 30  years of civil war shows what can be achieved by Ethiopia can  also be attained by other similar African countries, so long  clue efforts are made [as received].    The Chinese vice-premier said Ethiopian national economy  grows very fast, with a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 1992-93  fiscal year.    Qian Qichen said at a time when Africa is facing many  challenges and new difficulties, there have been varied  approaches to the continent, some think human rights is the most  important for Africa and others think it is the democratization.  In the light of the practice of China, we hold that the most  important tasks for Africa at present are: firstly to keep  political and social stability which is the primary condition  for the development of economy, secondly to develop economy  which is the central task and fundamental goal of all work.  Thirdly reform, only by which can all construction make  progress. Stability is the condition, reform is the motive  force, while development is the central task.    The Ethiopian foreign minister agreed with the analysis of  the Chinese vice-premier, believing that stability and  development is inseparable.    Qian Qichen also praised highly Ethiopia's policy of good  neighborliness and regional peace.    He said Somali question is the most important one in Africa.  China is paying great attention to the development in Somalia  and sympathizing with the sufferings of the Somali people.    He said, the Somali issue can only be solved by the Somali  people themselves, adding that the key to the peaceful solution  of the Somali problem is to achieve a broad national  reconciliation in Somalia.    However, Qian noted that the international community should  help the Somali people to resolve the Somali issue, but should  not do everything in their stead.    He also expressed the hope that all Somali factions could  iron out the differences through discussions and dialogues and  the Organization of African Unity and countries in the horn of  Africa can play an important role in seeking a solution to the  Somali issue.

Deputy State Secretary of Defence Zoltan Pecze told the  press  that the 34 signatories to the 1991 European agreement on the  elimination of conventional arms agreed to destroy part of their  armaments by 1994 so as to reduce the danger of war, prevent the  senseless arms race, and build mutual confidence.    The agreement obliges Hungary to destroy 510 tanks, 65  armoured vehicles, and 207 artillery pieces. Curuss Rt, a  Godollo-based company commissioned to carry out the task, has so  far destroyed 139 tanks, 89 armoured vehicles and 56 artillery  pieces. Cut up with oxy-acetylene torches, sections are sold as  scrap to metal dealers.    The foreign delegation composed of U.S., British, Spanish,  and Belgian officers supervised the cutting up of 14 tanks.    Some countries are obliged to destroy fighter planes and  helicopters, too. This obligation, though, does not apply to  Hungary whose stock of this category of military equipment  remains below internationally agreed limits.     "

It pleases me on this happy occasion--the opening of the  30th  African summit--to express warmest gratitude and appreciation to  the fraternal people of Tunisia and their leader President Zine  El Abidine Ben Ali for the hospitality they have accorded us and  for their obvious eagerness to provide all the necessary  requirements for the success of this conference. I am also  pleased to express my complete confidence that the ability and  wisdom of President Ben Ali will lead the OAU, at its 30th  summit, in extensive work and great achievements.    Brothers and sisters: It is one of the greatest moments in  the history of Africa and its organization to see the new South  Africa, under dear brother President Nelson Mandela, join the  independent and free countries that are working to advance the  united African march. The people of South Africa were not  absent from us and from the OAU. They have always been with us  in their heroic and glorious struggle, through which they  recorded a bright page in the history of humanity and  strengthened man's confidence that truth, virtue, and justice  must triumph over the forces of evil, darkness, and coercion.    Allow me to salute brother President Nelson Mandela once  again and to congratulate him on the high confidence he won from  the sons of his country, both the majority and the minority, and  on the establishment of the first nonracist government,  reflecting the united will of the entire nation, without  discrimination. While we wish this historic experience in  democratic transformation all success and prosperity, we hope it  will become a model to be emulated, not only in Africa but  throughout the other continents, where there is a pressing need  for coexistence, dialogue, the renunciation of violence, and  elimination of hatred and the spirit of contradiction and enmity.    Reconstruction is, and will always be, harder and more  difficult than revolution and change. The task of  reconstruction requires security and stability as well as the  cooperation of everyone in the pursuit of the national goals of  social and economic development.    The African nations, who have stood firmly behind the South  African people during their struggle, are determined to maintain  their solidarity with the South Africans in the reconstruction  phase. The Africans will give their support to the brotherly  South African people and help them assume their responsibility  in this strategic part of our glorious continent.    Brothers and sisters, a year has passed since we last met in  Cairo last June, a year that brought with it glimmers of hope  for a better future. The past year saw continued efforts by the  OAU leaders and peoples to confront the numerous problems facing  our nations, which are and exhausting a large portion of our  resources and potentials.    It is a regrettable and painful fact that many of these  problems were caused by the Africans themselves. Therefore, the  way to rid ourselves of the evils of war and destruction is  something that we, not others, have to find. Making and  preserving peace is our responsibility, not that of other  international organizations and outside powers.    The OAU has taken a large and remarkable stride toward  adopting preventive diplomacy as a way to avoid perils, foresee  crises, and settle disputes. Among our accomplishments in the  past year was the agreement by African leaders in Cairo OAU  summit last June to set up a central mechanism of preventing,  managing, and settling conflicts. This was followed by a meeting  in Cairo last September at the level of heads of state. This  meeting succeeded in formulating the principles and determining  the framework for the mechanism's operation through its central  body.    The OAU took this great achievement to a higher plateau with  its decision to set up a peace fund to finance the mechanism's  activities and enable it to deal effectively with a number of  African problems. This will give the entire OAU the credibility  it needs. There is a mounting international tendency to try to  resolve disputes through regional organizations before resorting  to external powers, the aim being to prevent these disputes from  assuming an international dimension that might lead to further  complications.    In order to preempt crises and curb fledgling disputes, an  African minisummit was held in Harare in March, and it was a  success. It involved in-depth discussions of the situation in  South Africa on the eve of the elections that led to the birth  of a new government.    Within this context, on the basis of experience and events,  as I hand over the chairmanship of the OAU, I call for great  attention to be paid in the coming period to preventive  diplomacy and to establishing an early-warning system that  anticipates disputes before they turn into military showdowns.  The OAU Secretariat General must provide a data base for the  current and expected disputes on the continent.    As we view this historic achievement, we must not forget  that  the wisdom of the leaders, the vigilance of the African people,  and response of all forces to the call to discard violence and  maintain the unity of South Africa resulted in the call I made  in the name of the OAU to a number of heads of state and  government in major Western capitals. This undoubtedly enabled  the OAU to spare the people of South Africa further violence and  confrontation and to maintain that country's unity and the  integration of its components.    Brothers and sisters: Our African continent has adopted  these two big steps, which are considered the most prominent  indications of wisdom and political pragmatism, whether in  achieving national detente through the democratic choice in  South Africa or in maintaining unanimity in establishing a  watertight system and a mechanism to settle its disputes by  peaceful means. An our organization has taken a third daring  step by its correct realization and understanding of the new  economic facts of the modern world.    The organization discovered that the phenomenon of blocs,  groupings, and mutual reliance is the hallmark of economic  relations among the countries of the North, whether in Europe,  North America, or the Asian Far East. Our organization felt the  long-term effects of its relations with the states of the North  and the sum total of international economic relations. From  this premise, brothers and sisters, and realizing the need for  integration between the North and South, right after our  previous summit and in the name of all you, I addressed the  leaders of the major industrial powers on the occasion of last  July's Tokyo summit [of the G-7]. I explained the nature of the  economic problems in Africa and submitted our just and realistic  demands, especially the easing of the heavy burdens of our  countries' debts within the framework of a relationship based on  constructive dialogue and mutual understanding among the states  of the North and South. Within the same framework, the brother  leaders in Africa responded brilliantly--not only to the needs  dictated by the international economic situation but also out of  a real desire by the continent's states and peoples--when they  each approved the African Economic Group agreement. Thus, the  necessary approvals have been received for this important  agreement to legally take effect.    With that, Africa will enter a new phase of integration  involving its various economies. We hope that this integration  will reflect positively on its relations and dialogue with the  states of the North. We also hope that this integration will  positively affect the development of its energies and wealth and  will achieve higher growth rates and greater prosperity for the  African nations.    I have no doubt that this accomplishment and the successful  efforts of the African continent to forge ahead along this road  will guarantee a good position for Africa on the world's  economic map. They will also enable the African states to  benefit from the various privileges of economic integration,  such as lessening the cost of production, increasing the number  of markets, and ensuring better transportation and communication  facilities. Economic integration will also enable the continent  to have negotiating power vis-a-vis the other world blocs.    Brothers and sisters, this step was very important for us in  Africa after the introduction of the new GATT Agreement and the  impending establishment of the World Trade Organization. These  developments could bring positive and negative results that  might affect the developing countries in general and the African  states, which produce raw materials, in particular. Such  developments could also dictate the lifting of restrictions and  barriers hindering international trade, especially the exports  of the advanced industrial countries.    Accordingly, the African Economic Group Agreement will  provide a protective umbrella for our interests and a strong  guarantee against any effects that could harm our economic  conditions if we are not well prepared for it. What  consolidates the role of this Economic Group and gives it  impetus is that the Group's states agreed last year to establish  the first African import-export bank. They also agreed on Cairo  as site of the bank's headquarters.    We are also confident that this vital economic establishment  will open up broad horizons for inter-African trade and will  achieve the desired integration. It will also create new fields  for balanced trade relations with the rest of the world.    We recorded undeniably positive aspects in the economic  field  thanks to a sound awareness of the economic facts and changes.  We must never forget that advancing the wheel of economic  development in Africa can only be achieved by effectively and  wisely confronting Africa's chronic and persistent  problems--drought and desertification and the accompanying  famine and refugees. We witnessed one of its painful chapters  in the Horn of Africa 10 years ago.    We must also not forget that pushing forward the wheel of  economic development in Africa requires that we always maintain  the delicate balance between population and resources or between  land and people. No matter how great the resources, they are  liable to be depleted due to the constant increase in  population. This poses a social and economic challenge to the  continent's people, who must face it with wisdom and reason.    Finally, we must not forget that economic growth cannot be  achieved without a comprehensive and balanced infrastructure and  without human development that raises the standard of the  individual, maintains his dignity, and releases his potential  and energy. I will continue to call for a climate of political  and social security and stability as a necessary and vital need  for the economic development process. Security is the main  pillar of stability, and stability is the guarantee for the  success of development. Africa urgently needs these three  components together.    Brothers and sisters, Africa has emerged cohesive and strong  from the era of colonialism and foreign domination. Its groups  and tribes have coexisted as brothers and neighbors across  borders and within the same homeland. Loyalty to the homeland  has remained above any other loyalty. Our affiliation to the  African continent and to its civilization and interests has  superseded all other affiliations. Africa has respected its  borders, enshrined its territorial unity and integrity, and  safeguarded its states' sovereignty, independence, and freedom  in accordance with its charter, which was adopted by its  founding leaders 30 years ago. Therefore, the recent aspects of  struggle that have divided the sons of the same homeland and  threatened security and stability in some parts of the continent  do not conform with the genuine African spirit. They must not  be interpreted as representing an African phenomenon or a  permanent fixture in Africa with which we have to coexist and  accept as part of the new continental reality. On the contrary,  it must be viewed as a passing and temporary phenomenon that  does not conform with firm African traditions and does not agree  with our long history and rich heritage.    An example of this deteriorating situation, on which we must  not remain silent, is the situation in fraternal Somalia.  Despite the honest and sincere efforts undertaken by  neighboring countries, the OAU, the United Nations, and several  friendly states, the Somali people continue to pay a heavy price  for the power struggles and rivalries at the expense of the  country's unity and its social fabric and at the expense of its  stability and the security of its citizens.    I have taken it upon myself to do my utmost to put an end to  this destructive crisis by virtue of my responsibility as OAU  chairman and by virtue of my capacity as president of Egypt,  which has strong historical and cultural relations with Somalia.    The efforts, which we coordinated with the brothers and  presidents, who played a special role in this regard, focussed  on closing ranks and calling on all factions without exception  to agree to a national reconciliation formula. The efforts  resulted in the issuance of the Cairo Declaration, which  constituted a solid base and a common ground for all factions to  get out of the current crisis. We are renewing our call to all  sides to place Somalia above ambitions, and to restore unity to  the country and security and reassurance to the people. We urge  them to start a sincere and determined march toward unity and  national reconciliation so that this fraternal country can  continue its development and message.    If we are to learn a lesson from this tragedy, it is that  Africa is most capable of solving its problems by itself.  Assistance from friendly countries and international  organizations, no matter how necessary, cannot replace the  African role but only support it. The responsibility lies  primarily with the people of Africa, because they know best the  problems of their countries and societies.    In central Africa, that strategically important region  thanks  to its unique location where the great Nile starts and many  friendly countries share borders, heavy blood was shed on the  soil of two friendly countries, Rwanda and Burundi. The vicious  fighting pained our hearts because it bordered on genocide,  where hundreds of thousands of people were killed, resources  that we urgently need were wasted, and hundreds of thousands of  people were turned into refugees burdening the neighboring  countries and depleting their resources, let alone the war's  negative reflections on Africa's image and culture.    These tragic situations, brothers and sisters, place on the  shoulders of our organization, the world community, and the  United Nations a common humanitarian duty and a moral obligation  to move to stop this bleeding so that its aftermath and  consequences do not extend to the heart of the continent and to  this spot, which is vital to its own peoples and to the  neighboring peoples.    In Burundi, the OAU's swift moves to control the situation  prevented further deterioration. These moves constituted one of  the first successful trials of the conflict resolution mechanism  which the OAU has established. The OAU envoy contacted all  forces in the government and the opposition, and this set the  appropriate stage for containing the situation and easing  tension.    Another lesson to be learned from our experience in this  central African region is that the presence of peace-keeping  forces, although undeniably important, is not an alternative to  a genuine peace among the sons of the nation, whether in the  government or the opposition, within the framework of  legitimacy, law, respect for man's dignity, and the use of the  language of dialogue and reconciliation.    Perhaps the real dilemma facing African countries in  certain areas is that of maintaining internal stability and  national cohesion. Unity should be preserved through pluralism.  The time is right for the OAU, with all its agencies, to turn  its utmost attention to this issue, among others.    Against this background, the OAU continued its efforts to  restore stability, consolidate national cohesion, and unify  national forces in Angola, Liberia, and Mozambique. I had  urgent exchanges with the influential forces in these countries  with a view to probing the problems there and resolving them.    In the same context, the OAU is in touch with the brothers  in  Cameroon and Nigeria in an effort to resolve their dispute. We  hope that our efforts there will succeed in defusing tensions  and finding an acceptable solution. Both sides have exhibited a  desire to reach an understanding and begin a dialogue.    Brothers and sisters, solidarity among African and Arab  nations both inside and outside Africa has been instrumental in  many great achievements concerning African liberation, the  liquidation of imperialism, and the achievement of  self-determination.    The firm backing by African nations of just Arab causes in  various international forums has been remarkable. African  support of the Palestinian issue and the rights of the  Palestinian people has always been courageous and impressive.    Brothers and sisters, I am pleased to tell you that,  following daunting negotiations, our efforts have been crowned  with great success in the signing of the self-rule agreement in  Gaza and Jericho. Israel and the Palestinians signed the  agreement on 4 May 1994. The self-rule agreement is merely a  first step toward fulfilling the rights and aspirations of the  Palestinian people for self-determination. We hope that it will  be followed by similar steps on other tracks of the Arab-Israeli  peace talks and that a just and comprehensive peace will be  achieved by all the nations of the Middle East.    Brothers and sisters, seen from a political and strategic  overview, African and Middle East security are linked. This is  why we made an initiative, which we are trying to promote in  various forums. This initiative calls for turning the Middle  East and Africa into zones that are free from nuclear weapons  and weapons of mass destruction.    Today, Africa and the Middle East face new horizons as the  21st century approaches. Our nations need to preserve their  resources and potentials, elevate their standards of living, and  achieve development and prosperity. The only way to attain  these noble objectives is by maintaining security and stability  throughout Africa and the Middle East. The threat of mass  destruction should disappear from Africa, the birthplace of the  oldest civilizations, and the Middle East, the birthplace of  major religions and the ancient cultures of the East. Our  nations look with hope and confidence to reaping together the  fruits of the great seeds sown by our founding fathers 30 years  ago in the black African soil.    Brothers and sisters, during the past year you gave me the  honor of being OAU chairman for the second time in five years.  You laid on me the responsibility of representing it and  speaking with the leaders of the outside world on your behalf.  I hope that my efforts in this connection were adequate to the  task.    On this occasion, I feel it is necessary for me to offer my  thanks to all the brother presidents for the sincere fraternal  cooperation they have shown me. This helped me to accomplish  the chairman's tasks. Throughout my period of responsibility I  did not feel I was alone but was always surrounded by your  sincere support. None of you hesitated to carry out what I asked  them to do for the good of our mutual interests and united  destiny. This gave me additional pride in your comradeship and  fraternity and in belonging with you to the greater African  entity and its splendid civilization. Furthermore, your  objective attitude, frankness, truthfulness to yourselves, and  putting the general interest above other considerations have  given me fresh confidence in this young continent's future and  the ability of its future generations to confront new problems  and challenges with total fortitude. In this task they will  rely on their unshakeable faith in the principles of African  unity and their firm commitment to strengthening solidarity and  cooperation among the continent's nations until their noble  objectives are attained.    Brothers and sisters, I must not forget to offer my thanks  to  OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim for his sincere  cooperation and perseverance which decisively helped us to carry  out the achievements of the past year.    Long live our African continent in security and stability.  Long live its nations, united and strong. Long live the  African nations' struggle for economic development and progress.  Long live the memory of Africa's devout martyrs.    Let the torches of liberty burn everywhere in Africa. Let  the light of learning and civilization spread in the corners of  this glorious continent.    Long live the OAU. Long live the memory of its pioneers and  founding leaders. May God give us all success. Peace and the  mercy of God be with you. [applause]     "
0," LA040189-0012   38254    April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 14; Column 1; Foreign Desk      1492 words      DAY ONE OF U.N.-SUPERVISED TRANSITION;    NAMIBIA STARTS MARCH TO INDEPENDENCE      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      Namibia, South Africa's vast colony for 74 years, began its long-delayed march  to independence today under the supervision of the largest and most expensive  U.N. peacekeeping mission in history.    ""The people of Namibia have waited long years for this day, and it is the eve  of an era: an era of all of the people of Namibia,"" Martti Ahtisaari, the  U.N.'s special representative to Namibia, said Friday as he arrived to monitor  the transition from African colony to nationhood.    ""Namibia has truly been a wound in the side of Africa,"" Ahtisaari told a news  conference at Windhoek's airport. ""But it also has a special place in the  hearts and minds of the whole world.""    Thousands of cheering Namibians came by train, bus and even on horseback across  the scrubby desert to line the airport road and welcome the U.N. official, who  arrived on a South African Airways flight from Frankfurt, West Germany.    The throng, bedecked in traditional African dress and the bright colors of some  of the territory's 40 political parties, carried signs reading: ""No Government  Based on Ethnicity,"" ""No to a One-Party System"" and ""Welcome Martti."" Women in  braided hair ululated and danced while political organizers with bullhorns  called out slogans to their faithful.      'We Want an Election'    ""We're here to show these U.N. people how much we want an election,"" said  Katjimuini Veii, who was wearing a T-shirt expressing his support for the  Namibian Patriotic Front, a coalition of political parties.    Ahtisaari's arrival was eagerly awaited here because it signaled the start of  an 11-year-old U.N. plan to free Namibia, a rugged land of only 1.5 million  people on the southwestern coast of Africa.    South Africa, itself then a self-governing British possession, captured the  colony from Germany in World War I. After the war, the League of Nations gave  South Africa the mandate to govern the territory. South Africa became fully  independent of Britain in 1934 and after World War II, the league's successor  organization, the United Nations, refused to allow it to annex the territory.  In 1966, the U.N. General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate in  Namibia.    Pretoria has defiantly occupied Namibia for more than 20 years. Since the  mid-1970s, it had cited the presence of Cuban troops in Angola, Namibia's  northern neighbor. But in December, it agreed to bring its troops out, in  return for a promise that Cuba would pull its troops out of Angola.      Test of Commitment    The independence process is considered an important test of South Africa's  commitment to peace in southern Africa. South Africa also hopes a smooth  transition for Namibia will improve Pretoria's image abroad and help reduce its  international economic and political isolation.    ""We are leaving Namibia with a feeling that we have fulfilled our commitments  here with dignity,"" Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister,  said Friday at a news conference in Windhoek. Describing South Africa's  contributions to Namibia's infrastructure over the years, Botha added, ""I  cannot imagine a country that has a better hope of making a success of  independence than this one.""    The U.N.'s Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), which will cost $416 million,  includes a multinational force of 4,650 troops and, at its height, 2,500  additional monitors, administrators and local staff. About 1,000 troops already  have arrived and are stationed throughout the territory to monitor the election  campaign and voting.    Under the U.N. transition, Namibia will be governed until independence by South  Africa's administrator general ""to the satisfaction of"" the U.N.'s Ahtisaari,  according to the U.N. resolution.    Ahtisaari, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's personal envoy in  Namibia, said the joint U.N.-South Africa effort marked ""a unique and  pioneering vision."" If successful, he added, ""the prospect for a peaceful  settlement of even the (world's) most intractable problems will have taken a  giant stride forward.""    ""We'd like to see these elections be really free and fair, free of the scourge  of violence and intimidation,"" the South African administrator, Louis Pienaar,  said in pledging his country's impartiality. ""We would like to prove that  democratic elections can be held in this part of the world.""      Cease-Fire in Effect    A formal U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between South Africa and the South-West  Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has waged a 23-year guerrilla war  for independence, went into effect at dawn today although the two sides had  informally observed a cease-fire since December.    Also beginning today, South Africa's troops are confined to two bases in the  country, and SWAPO's soldiers must remain in their bases in Angola and Zambia.    About 24,000 black Namibians who have fought with the South African army  against SWAPO are being disbanded and ordered to surrender their weapons and  uniforms.    Namibia's independence is guided by a strict timetable. By mid-May, all  discriminatory laws must be repealed, and by early June all political prisoners  and detainees held by both sides must be released. South Africa has until July  to reduce its troop strength in Namibia to 1,500, from a high last year of  about 30,000.    Namibians who fled the country to escape the war and SWAPO members who went  into exile are expected to begin returning in the coming weeks. The United  Nations estimates that about 58,000 Namibians are living in exile, most of them  in southern Angola.    Namibia's election campaign begins in July and, in early November, the  territory will elect an assembly to draw up a new constitution. The whole  process is expected to be concluded by this time next year.    SWAPO, with its strong base of support in the north, Namibia's most populous  region, is regarded by many political analysts as the likely winner in an  election. But few believe it will gain the two-thirds majority needed to design  the constitution by itself.    Namibia, a mostly desert land with mines producing diamonds and uranium, is one  of the world's least-populous regions. In fact, the territory will have one  U.N. soldier for every 200 Namibians. But because of the large distances to be  covered, the world body considers its mission in Namibia ""the most complicated  mission we have ever put on,"" according to Cedric Thornberry, the  second-ranking U.N. official here.    Most of Namibia's inhabitants are black and 60% of them live in the north,  where SWAPO draws most of its support. Only 80,000 Namibians, about 6% of the  total population, are white. But they control many of the businesses.    Most of Namibia's whites, including those who strongly oppose the U.N. presence  here, have decided to remain at least until the November elections. Many more  moderate whites have decided to actively contest the election in the hope of  preventing a sweeping SWAPO victory.    Before today, Namibia had been governed by a multiracial transitional  government, but South Africa's administrator retained veto power over  legislation. Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago,  segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools  and hospitals racially separate.    But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South  Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating  to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of  the United Nations.      NAMIBIA NEARS INDEPENDENCE (Southland Edition)    Today marks the beginning of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by South Africa (which has administered the huge,  sparsely populated territory since World War I), Angola and Cuba. Provisions of  the plan:    April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of the 7,000-member  U.N. Transition Assistance Group who will oversee the transition. South African  troops in Namibia and guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), based in neighboring Angola, are confined to their bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is disbanded; South Africa reduces its  forces to 12,000 troops. South African administrator Louis Pienaar publishes  election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners freed; Namibian exiles return.    July 1 -- Pretoria's forces cut to 1,500; election campaigning begins.    Oct. 31 -- 25,000 Cuban troops have left Angola, rest withdraw north of 13th  Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered to  approve constitution for independent Namibia, the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate in Namibia ends; Cubans have  removed 33,000 troops from Angola.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans withdraw last of 50,000 troops from Angola.

Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago,  segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools  and hospitals racially separate.    But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South  Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating  to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of  the United Nations.      NAMIBIA NEARS INDEPENDENCE (Southland Edition)    Today marks the beginning of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by South Africa (which has administered the huge,  sparsely populated territory since World War I), Angola and Cuba. Provisions of  the plan:    April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of the 7,000-member  U.N. Transition Assistance Group who will oversee the transition. South African  troops in Namibia and guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), based in neighboring Angola, are confined to their bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is disbanded; South Africa reduces its  forces to 12,000 troops. South African administrator Louis Pienaar publishes  election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners freed; Namibian exiles return.    July 1 -- Pretoria's forces cut to 1,500; election campaigning begins.    Oct. 31 -- 25,000 Cuban troops have left Angola, rest withdraw north of 13th  Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered to  approve constitution for independent Namibia, the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate in Namibia ends; Cubans have  removed 33,000 troops from Angola.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans withdraw last of 50,000 troops from Angola.

""We are against any form  of dual recognition,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would  not seek to cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria  switches diplomatic recognition to Beijing.    The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked  the first time Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to  tolerate dual recognition with China. However, the Chinese  spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be unacceptable  to Beijing. ""We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two  Chinas, or one China one Taiwan,"" he said.    China refuses to permit countries with which it has  diplomatic relations to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded  as a renegade province ever since Nationalist forces fled to the  island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the  mainland. Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any  country which switches formal recognition to Beijing.    Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity  are widely expected to establish diplomatic relations later this  year. China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's  struggle for political rights in South Africa, had previously  refused to establish ties with the white government in Pretoria  until the country's apartheid system had been completely  dismantled. ""We believe that relations between China and the  new South Africa will enjoy all-round development in the  future,"" the spokesman said.    In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links  with South Africa which were suspended in 1960.    Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29  countries, including South Africa, but has in recent years  launched a diplomatic offensive -- especially in Southeast Asia  -- to cement ties with other governments.

In a talk with visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of  Angola Venacio da Silva Moura, Qian said that the peoples of  China and Angola have enjoyed traditional friendship, adding  that China is willing to further enhance cooperative relations  with Angola.    Qian said that China has been paying close attention to  Angola's peace process and sincerely hopes that the talks in  Angola will reach final agreement at an early date and realize  domestic peace and stability.    He noted that China has never interfered in the internal  affairs of African countries and has dedicated itself to  contributing to the development of Africa as much as possible.  China hopes that African countries enjoy peace and stability  and develop good-neighborly ties of friendship, Qian said.    Qian pointed out that big countries, instead of interfering  in the internal affairs of African countries, should let African  nations build their countries according to their own situations.    If big powers really care about Africa, they should not  write  out a prescription and force Africa to accept it, Qian said.  They should offer aid to Africa to promote the development of  African economies.    Moura briefed Qian on the current situation in Angola. He  expressed thanks for China's long-term political and economic  support of his country.    He noted that in Angola's struggle for national  independence,  the peoples of Angola and China stood on one side. After  drastic changes in the international situation, the two peoples  still stood together.    The Angolan foreign minister reaffirmed that his country  firmly insists on a ""one-China"" policy and will not develop any  official ties with Taiwan.    He expressed the belief that economic and trade relations  between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola  realizes internal peace.     "

Section 179B applies to areas that could attain the relevant NAAQS by the statutory attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside the United States (U.S.). For PM10 nonattainment areas, section 179B(a) provides that EPA must approve the moderate area SIP if (1) the SIP meets all the applicable requirements under the Act other than a requirement that such plan or revision demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM10 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, and (2) the State demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the SIP would be adequate to attain and maintain the PM10 NAAQS by the attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. In addition, section 179B(d) provides that if a State demonstrates that an area would have timely attained the PM10 NAAQS but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S., the area must not be subject to the reclassification provisions of section 188(b)(2). Section 188(b)(2) provides that any moderate PM10 nonattainment area that EPA determines is not in attainment after the applicable attainment date shall be reclassified to serious by operation of law. Therefore, the statute provides that areas that could attain but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. must not be reclassified as serious after failing to attain by the applicable date. 7                 7     As noted, section 179B(d) states that areas demonstrating attainment of the standards, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S., shall not be subject to section 188(b)(2) (reclassification for failure to attain). By analogy to this provision and applying canons of statutory construction, EPA will not reclassify before the applicable attainment date areas which can demonstrate attainment of the standards, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. (see section 188(b)(1)). First, section 179B evinces a general congressional intent not to penalize areas where emissions emanating from outside the country are the but-for cause of the PM10 nonattainment problems. Further, if EPA were to reclassify such areas before the applicable attainment date, EPA, in effect, would be reading section 179B(d) out of the statute.

Canons of statutory construction counsel against interpreting the law such that language is rendered mere surplusage. Finally, note that section 179B(d) contains a clearly erroneous reference to carbon monoxide instead of PM10, and that this section contains other clear errors (see, e.g., section 179B(c) reference to section 186(b)(9), which does not exist).

0,FT933-11867 ,"FT933-11867 _AN-DG0CFAGBFT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (9): Hopes may be too high - Edward Balls examines some harsh realities for the future      By EDWARD BALLS   GHANA is perhaps the only African country to have accepted the spirit, as well as the letter, of the World Bank's list of market-based reforms over the past decade. But after 10 years of structural adjustment, the country has yet to receive the promised rewards. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take Ghana 20 years to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. Only then would the average poor Ghanaian reach the poverty threshold - defined as two-thirds of today's average consumption per head. To succeed, the World Bank's African role model must make the leap into accelerated growth and wean itself off foreign aid by attracting much more of the private and foreign direct investment that Africa so desperately needs. Failure to do so would mean, rightly or wrongly, a damaging blow to the Bank's reputation in the continent. Little wonder that understandably nervous World Bank officials hurry to damp down expectations about Ghana's future prospects while stressing the progress that has already been made. Yes, they acknowledge, Ghana remains a very poor country (average incomes averaged around Dollars 400 per head) and relies heavily on foreign assistance. But Ghana's economic performance has still been impressive over the past decade relative both to the previous 10 years and the rest of the continent. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. GDP growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1983; in sub-Saharan Africa the average is 2.1 per cent. These growth rates occurred while Ghana's terms of trade have fallen relentlessly. While gross aid flows have averaged 8 per cent of GDP a year, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses the net resource transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared to a sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent. In short, World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials argue, Ghana confirms that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for successful development. Low inflation, a realistically valued exchange rate, reduced tariff barriers and the removal of numerous restrictions on investment, have together delivered much faster growth. Ghana's experience, they argue, also undermines some common myths about adjustment. Does structural adjustment require a smaller public sector? Fewer civil servants, perhaps, but the share tax revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. Does adjustment hit the poor harder? The sketchy evidence, according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on average, adjustment has reduced the incidence of poverty by shifting resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions. But Ghana also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is insufficient for an acceleration of economic growth and a rapid fall in poverty. The obstacles to an acceleration in economic growth to the levels achieved by the east Asian developing economies over the past two decades will not be rectified by low inflation and liberalisation alone. Ghana lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and physical infrastructure, as the charts show. 80 per cent primary school enrolment is high by African standards but low compared to east Asia. And the capacity of Ghana's civil service to implement reforms remains disappointing, as Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, readily admits. Most worrying are the low level of private sector investment and the small share of manufacturing investment in GDP. Last year's balance of payments does, in fact, suggest that flight capital may be beginning to return. But inflows of foreign direct investment remain low. Senior government minsters call for a new 'agenda of activism' to address these deficiencies. Mr Botchwey stresses the need to attract foreign investment to supplement Ghana's small pool of domestic private savings and trumpets the new investment code. He talks of packages of tax cuts and tariff concessions to attract particular foreign investors. Meanwhile the Bank of Ghana is using all its powers of moral suasion to encourage the banking sector to bias its foreign exchange operations towards export-orientated business and offer cheaper term loans for new investments. The Bank has made it clear, says one banker in Accra, that 'importing second-hand cars is not consistent with sustainable development.' But the government appears undecided about whether to bow to pressure for infant industry protection, from members of the private sector advisory group, although the World Bank and IMF counsel strongly against it. 'Free trade means efficiency but it can also destroy domestic industry,' says one senior minister.' Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of Unilever Ghana, does not believe in protectionism. 'It breeds corruption and inefficiency,' he says. 'Most companies in Ghana asking for protection grew up in a shortage economy and have never had to justify their investment.' The missing ingredient is confidence. Senior ministers privately voice frustration at President Rawlings's occasional outbursts against particular private companies. Ghana's experience suggests some lessons for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Bank, Fund and government officials list some possible reasons for Ghana's success: Ownership: the Economic Recovery Programme was identified with the government, not the donors, and ministers took responsibility for mistakes as well as successes - at each stage, they worked hard to persuade interest groups that reforms were in their interests; Sequencing: reforms were carefully staggered - the devaluation occurred well before imports were liberalised - and not pushed through faster than the government's capacity limitations allowed; Aid: donor support was substantial and became available from the outset of the programme before the government had established a track record. But the missing element is politics. The military has consistently tried to align its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite who probably stand to lose more from adjustment in the early stages. And the government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10 year period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result. But the Rawlings government won the right to continue for a further term of four years, in an election which most western observers judged to be free and fair. That is perhaps the most encouraging sign yet that structural adjustment might work in Africa.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.

0,FT941-14560 ,"FT941-14560 _AN-EATCKAA4FT 940120   FT  20 JAN 94 / Laos starts to wake up to its energetic neighbours - How south-east Asia's poorest country is being caught up in the region's growth      By VICTOR MALLET   A casual glance at the national accounts of Laos might give the impression the country is in sub-Saharan Africa rather than south-east Asia. Laos imports twice as much as it exports; it is dependent on the assistance of the International Monetary Fund and other foreign donors; and it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an annual per capita gross domestic product of about Dollars 230 (Pounds 154). Total GDP is Dollars 1bn a year, less than the turnover of a large corporation in neighbouring Thailand. Laos's 4.4m inhabitants are known more for their charm than their industriousness. Lao rice farmers have a reputation in this dynamic region for lying down, closing their eyes and listening to their crops growing in fertile paddy fields. In towns such as Luang Prabang, Morris Minors and 40-year-old Mercedes Benzes share the streets with more recent arrivals from Japan. In the capital, Vientiane, stallholders in the market are trying to sell old-fashioned Soviet cameras and hi-fi systems as well as Japanese refrigerators. Laos, however, is changing fast. Even if it wanted to, this once forgotten corner of Indo-china could hardly escape the effects of the frenzied economic growth across its borders in China, Thailand and Vietnam. Landlocked Laos is already a commercial crossroads of sorts. It levies a Dollars 1,300 transit fee for new luxury cars - the Toyota Lexus is the latest favourite - on their way to the tycoons of China's Yunnan province from ports in the Gulf of Thailand. In the past such trade was hindered by the difficulty of crossing the Mekong river, the appalling state of Laos's roads, and the uneasy relationship between Thailand and the communist government of the Lao People's Revolutionary party. These days Thai-Lao relations are much improved, Australia has built the first bridge across the lower Mekong near Vientiane - a Dollars 30m structure due to open in April - and other donors are financing construction of the road to China. Even the building work is a novelty in a country where 85 per cent of the population depend on subsistence agriculture and have to forage for food in the forests if their crops are damaged by drought. Abandoned by the disintegrating Soviet Union in the 1980s, Laos's socialist rulers (they have forsaken the communist label and dropped the hammer and sickle from the flag) have encouraged foreign investment as well as foreign aid. The 'New Economic Mechanism' is the Lao code phrase for capitalism. As in Laos's long-time ally Vietnam, the ruling party is in an ideological vacuum. Officially, the government of Mr Khamtay Siphandon says that the one-party system will stay for ever. State radio blares out the officially approved news from street corners. The increasingly prosperous inhabitants of Vientiane, however, watch Thai television broadcasts (Thai and Lao languages are similar) or programmes beamed by satellite from Star TV in Hong Kong. They want to learn English and they go to discotheques. The government is concerned about the social, environmental and political dangers of foreign - especially Thai - influence and economic liberalisation. It has therefore moved cautiously, but it has moved nonetheless. Moribund state companies are being privatised or closed. Sensing that the inaccessibility of Laos and its small population make it a relatively unattractive prospect for investors, the government has gone further than its neighbours and allowed 100 per cent foreign ownership of companies. Clothing produced in more than 50 new factories has overtaken hydroelectricity as the country's main export, although there are plans for foreign investors to build hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new dams, increase electricity output 10-fold and sell 1,500MW to Thailand by the end of the decade. Timber processing is also thriving. Hunt Oil and Enterprise Oil are searching for oil and gas. Newmont of the US and CRA Exploration of Australia are looking for gold. Shinawatra of Thailand has won a Dollars 63m contract to install telephone networks and a satellite earth station. Tourism is increasing. Some former refugees, Lao-Americans and Lao-Australians, are returning as investors. Foreign investment, much of it from other Asian countries such as Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, is still pouring in at a rate of some Dollars 150m a year, and the economy is growing rapidly: 7 per cent in 1992 and about the same again in 1993. In these two important respects, the statistics show that Laos is a poor country in south-east Asia rather than a poor country in Africa.   Countries:-  LAZ  Laos, Asia.

Well,  those days are long gone.    Greeks have now a true democracy again. It is a democracy free of U.S.  government intervention, and offers, unlike that of the U.S., more than just  two choices. Greeks, like most democratic European nations, have a truly  pluralistic democracy with political parties of the right, middle and left, all  represented in the Parliament. That is the ultimate sign of a true democracy.    Your mocking of the way the Greeks voted on June 19 reflects your true feelings  about Greece. You do not care about democracy in Greece; all you want is a  ""friendly government."" Unfortunately for you, Greeks have other ideas.

African  Election Process""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 22 (XINHUA) -- With the  announcement of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) participation in  next week's non-racial election in South Africa, it is expected  the poll will proceed in an atmosphere of goodwill and  reconciliation.    The April 26-28 election is historically important to South  Africa as it is the result of the 300-year struggle of the South  African people, the blacks in particular.    Since the Dutch invaded the South African continent in 1652,  the black people have gradually become the slaves of the white  settlers.    Before the implementation of the 1993 interim constitution,  South Africa was the only country in the world which had  legalized the apartheid system.    The current election in South Africa symbolizes the end of  the inhuman apartheid system in the human history.    On April 19, or one week before the election, the Inkatha  Freedom Party -- the second biggest black party in South Africa  -- announced its participation in the election.    The South African press described the IFP's participation in  the election as ""a miracle.""    In reality, this is a natural result for the IFP after an  international mediation failed in the previous week.    If the IFP does not want to be a guerilla movement in a new  South Africa after the election, it has no other choice but to  participate in the election.    The IFP stands for a federal or confederate state in a  future  South Africa. It asked the international mediation over the  constitutional dispute between the IFP and its rival, the  African National Congress (ANC), so that the 1993 interim  constitution is amended and the election postponed.    The IFP can only become an opposition party if it does not  participate in the election after the failure of the  itnernational mediation.    IFP's decision to participate in the election has greatly  changed the political situation in South Africa.    The three major political players in South Africa, namely  the  ruling National Party, the ANC and the IFP, will all participate  in the election. They are expected to obtain 85 percent votes  of all the voters in the country.    On April 19, South African President F.W. de Klerk, ANC  president Nelson Mandela and IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi  signed an agreement and a joint statement in Pretoria.    The agreement said the three parties reject violence and are  committed to realize reconciliation and peace in South Africa.    The joint statement appealed to the South African people to  end violence, exercise maximum restraint and pursue their  objectives by peaceful means.    The agreement and the joint statement will create  circumstances conducive to the holding of a free, fair and  peaceful election in South Africa.    Buthelezi said his party will accept the election result so  long as the international community regards it free and fair.    After the IFP decision was declared, many Zulu people  expressed their ardent wish to participate in the election.    Buthelezi was given a hero's welcome and support when he  returned to Ulundi, capital of the Kwazulu homeland, on April 19  after the signing of the agreement and the joint statement.    Definitely, violence will greatly be reduced as the root  cause of the political conflicts between the IFP and the ANC  have been removed.    An amendment on the 1993 interim constitution was tabled in  the parliament on April 21.    The bill will be debated and approved at a special session  of  the parliament on April 25.    The bill makes provisions for the institution, role,  authority and status of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill  Zwelithini.    This is the result of a reconciliation among the ruling  national party, the ANC and the IFP.    Where will the seven million Zulu people go? it is important  to the result of the April 26-28 election.     "

In his presentation on international  relations, PNC Assistant Chairman of the Board Mitsuo Taguchi  made the following statement: ""Last year PNC underwent 17  percent of the total amount of inspections worldwide by the  IAEA, which added up to 1400 man-days."" Needless to say, this is  the kind of strict international scrutiny that results from  Japan's plutonium utilization. The number of man-days works out  to four inspectors from foreign countries conducting  international inspections at PNC facilities every day of the  year. In fact, the IAEA's ""eyes of non-proliferation"" are  focused more sharply on Japan than anywhere else in the world.    In his introductory greeting, Chairman of the Board Takao  Ishiwatari touched on the international situation, including  increasing concern over the problem of excess plutonium  resulting from the dismantling of nuclear weapons accompanying  the end of the Cold War. He said, ""The FBR, fuel recycling, and  plutonium utilization put us on a radical path of atomic energy  development and use. We must respond to concerns raised by the  international community."" He also revealed a plan to proceed  with international cooperative research with the U.S. and France  on mixing and burning minor actinide series transuranium  elements (neptunium, americium, etc.) with plutonium. In a  sense, as a response to foreign concern over Japan's use of  plutonium, this research will lead to utilization of ""nuclear  proliferation resistant"" enhanced plutonium that is blended so  nuclear outlaws will leave it alone. Moreover, because this  technology also burns up the minor actinides that are normally  present in high level waste, it may kill two birds with one  stone by easing the burden of high level waste disposal, which  is the greatest problem the nuclear power industry must confront.    As a backdrop for all this, the U.S. Department of Energy's  budget proposal in April authorized the burning of actinides in  the experimental breeder reactor (EBR II), and funding for the  IFR (Integral Fast Reactor), which had been eliminated, was  restored by a House-Senate conference committee in Congress on  14 October.    In the spring of 1977, President Carter essentially put a  halt to breeder reactor development, and although both are  Democrats and President Clinton's non-proliferation policy must  cope with the problem of plutonium from dismantled weapons,  after 16 years this is, in essence, welcome news. France, on the  other hand, remains silent. In Japan, however, informed persons  have been deeply distressed because the Atomic Energy Commission  has been holding hearings to revise the Long Term Plan for one  year and three months, but the long-awaited report on FBR  commercialization, which includes plans for the first FBR  demonstration reactor, is still not ready for submission because  of ""evasion tactics"" by some in the electric power industry.    Fuel Facility Automated, Remote Control Plant    Returning to the main topic, PNC also revealed issues to be  addressed and future prospects for technical progress through  the cooperative development of this advanced plutonium recycling  technology by Japan, France, and the U.S. Yoshiro Takahashi  (Assistant Director, Development Promotion Division, PNC)  appealed that we should change our concept of plutonium  recycling as merely technological development intended to clean  up the leftovers of LWR power generation and stated, ""The ratio  of isotopes in which nuclear fission occurs (fissile quantity)  drops off only slightly even when the number of recycling passes  is increased."" ""We can utilize minor actinides, which are  elements we have thrown away in the past, as a source of fuel  and reduce the burden on the back end (disposal of high level  waste),"" and ""We must look at this from the standpoint of a  comprehensive technology from LWR to FBR to recycling.""    From the standpoint of fuels, Shojio Kawada (Assistant  Director, Reprocessing Technology Development Division, PNC)  stated, ""In reprocessing we must first develop technology for  isolating and recovering transuranium elements, and because we  will no longer need a purification process, the overall process  will be shortened.""    Because of the intense radioactivity, however, operation of  the plant must be automated, and maintenance must be performed  by remote control. Construction of this Recycling Equipment  Testing Facility (RETF) will begin next spring.     "
0,FT934-15877 ,"FT934-15877 _AN-DJJAIAAVFT 931009   FT  09 OCT 93 / Mandela wants S Africa to join Lome pact      By Our Foreign Staff   MR NELSON MANDELA, the African National Congress leader, yesterday asked the European Community to allow a democratic South Africa to join the Lome Convention governing trade, aid and co-operation between the EC and 69 developing countries. At talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Manuel Marin, EC development commissioner, Mr Mandela is understood to have expressed a preference for accession to the Lome accord, rather than other options for EC-South African relations. The ANC president won EC pledges to help build a new civil service, army and police force, and Community support to prepare voters for multiracial elections next April. Mr Mandela said that while South African membership of Lome was under discussion, the republic's mixture of pockets of wealth surrounded by backwardness meant it should be regarded as an economy in transition, rather like the central European economies. The EC has progressive market access and substantial aid agreements with east and central Europe. But current thinking in Brussels favours a relationship with South Africa as part of a more integrated bloc of nations in southern Africa. This is based on the premise that Pretoria would join the Southern Africa Development Community, which South Africa already dominates economically by the strength of its trade and industrial links. EC officials are uncomfortable with the idea that South Africa, with comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture, a developed financial system, industrial capacity, and advanced transport and communications infrastructure, should be slotted into a format such as Lome designed to aid much less developed former colonies. Meanwhile in New York, the UN General Assembly yesterday agreed to end most economic sanctions against South Africa, two weeks after Mr Mandela, in an address to the world body, proposed lifting the restrictions However, the oil embargo will remain in place until the Transitional Executive Council agreed last month becomes operational, probably around the end of the year. In South Africa the government was yesterday criticised by the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress for an early morning raid on a home in Umtata, Transkei in which five people died. The PAC denied that the house was used by its military wing. Meanwhile, conservatives have formed the Freedom Alliance, grouping former members of the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) - Bophutatswana, Ciskei, Inkatha, the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront. At the same time, Bophutatswana and Ciskei withdrew from the negotiating council - the forum for multi-party talks - and ended all meetings with the government and ANC. The Alliance's short-term aim is to present a single, united negotiating team which will seek concessions on federalism from the ANC. In the longer term, it seeks to displace the National Party as the country's second largest political group behind the ANC.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT943-6379 ,"FT943-6379 _AN-EH3EIAA1FT 940830   FT  30 AUG 94 / Southern Africa harnesses SADC as engine for growth      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday handed over the country's new flag to Southern Africa Development Conference chairman Sir Ketumile Masire in Gaberone, Botswana, in a gesture that marked the start of a new era for the entire region. The formal accession of South Africa to the now 11-member SADC means that the organisation, originally devoted to reducing its members' links to their southern neighbour, is now regarded as the vehicle with the best chance of driving the region towards growth. The shift follows years during which SADC has been politically opposed to, but dependent on, South Africa. This spirit of co-operation between South Africa and SADC was by no means guaranteed. While most of the world rejoiced at the success of South Africa's elections earlier this year, the broader southern African community viewed the transition to democracy with mixed feelings. Although justifiably proud at their contribution to the overthrow of apartheid, many in the region feared that the African National Congress, once in power, might forget its debts, while South Africa's re-emergence on the global stage would divert much-needed aid and investment from its poorer neighbours. But, despite such concerns, the new South African government has placed regional co-operation at the forefront of its emerging foreign policy. In parliament two weeks ago, Mr Alfred Nzo, foreign minister, made clear that promoting good relations with other southern African states would be a priority. 'South Africa will actively encourage the movement to create a new form of political and economic interaction in southern Africa,' he said, while stressing his support for a new regional security mechanism that would complement SADC's economic activities. The new approach is a marked contrast to South Africa's previous policies. As the unquestioned regional superpower under former President PW Botha, the South African regime unabashedly used its economic and military might to prevent its black-run neighbours from successfully uniting in opposition to South Africa or helping to provide aid to the liberation movement. By helping to foment civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and showing little hesitation in launching cross-border military strikes to try to destroy ANC bases in other countries, South Africa garnered a well-deserved reputation as regional bully. It was in response to such activities that South Africa's neighbours formed SADC's precursor, the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), in 1980. Despite its admirable aims, however, SADCC proved unable to meet its objective of reducing its members' trade with South Africa. Not only did nearly all its members actually expand their economic relationship with South Africa over the past decade; few of the organisation's initiatives to improve regional infrastructure yielded any fruit. Now, however, the situation has changed drastically. Recognising the wider impact of political change in South Africa, the body renamed itself SADC in 1992, changing its primary focus from opposition to South Africa to economic development. And, with South Africa now a fully integrated member, the organisation is optimistic that it will finally be able to succeed in its goals. Yesterday's SADC summit was preceded by a two-day meeting of regional trade ministers and it is through trade that the main thrust of economic development is planned. Recognising the need to establish competitive, export-oriented industries, SADC intends to devote itself to the establishment of a regional trade treaty which will ultimately allow the free movement of goods, services and capital across all member states. However, most of the region's economies maintain complex trade and tariff regulations which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the relative size of South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a regional GDP of around Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries nervous of being flooded with cheaper South African goods should all restrictions be removed. Thus many observers feel that any short-term benefits flowing from a restructured SADC are likely to be political rather than economic. 'I can't see SADC successfully turning itself into a free trade area in the immediate future, but there is significant potential for the grouping, under South African leadership, to play the role of regional peacemaker,' says Mr Chris Landsberg, a foreign policy specialist at Johannesburg's Centre for Policy Studies. Acknowledging this possibility, the Frontline States organisation (a political grouping comprising all SADC members except Malawi, Lesotho and Swaziland and also originally designed to thwart South Africa) has decided to restructure itself into the political and security wing of SADC. It to play the role of mediator in regional conflicts. The scope for such activities has been demonstrated over the past week as SADC members have taken a stand to try to restore democracy to Lesotho after its king illegally dismissed the elected government. South African President Nelson Mandela has also played a role in helping to resolve remaining disagreements ahead of the planned Mozambican elections. Whether any of these initiatives, political or economic, prove successful remains to be seen. However the fact remains that, for the first time since most of SADC's members achieved independence, there is hope that, with South Africa at the forefront, the region might at last be able to reverse its economic decline.

0,FT943-13715 ,"FT943-13715 _AN-EGRD8AFOFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (31): On the touch-line - Foreign investment      By TONY HAWKINS   More talk than action sums up South Africa's recent record of foreign investment. Most of the action has come in the past 18 months with a surge of portfolio investment and a large number of franchise and other non-equity deals. A recent independent survey concludes: 'Most companies are adopting a wait-and-see attitude', avoiding manufacturing and keeping their investments relatively small. Many foreign companies have established a low-profile presence in the country in anticipation of an improved business climate from 1995 onwards. The main action has been on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In the 15 months to March 1994, net inward investment on the JSE totalled R8.9bn, almost two-thirds in gilts and the balance in equities. This compares with substantial net foreign selling, especially of equities in the 1990-1992 period. The same survey, which warns that it may not have tracked down all post-1990 foreign investment, lists 17 first-time new investors, including Vodafone of the UK and Alcatel of France in telecommunications, Daewoo of South Korea in household goods, Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland in publishing and Digital Equipment of the US in computers. Another seven are listed as returning companies - those that divested in the 1980s for political reasons. This list includes leading players such as IBM, Procter  Gamble and AB Electrolux of Sweden. Another important participant who stayed behind, BMW, has brought in R100m in new capital to expand its Rosslyn vehicle-assembly plant. There has been a good deal more activity in the field of indirect investment  -distribution, franchise and licensing deals. This list is dominated by the returnees - Apple, Honeywell and Novell in computers; Volvo and Peugeot in cars, and Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Warburgs in banking. Significantly, the largest single category, of some 36 companies, is made up of those intending to invest or reinvest. Here, too, the list reads like a Who's Who of global business: Ford, Motorola, Heinz, Philip Morris, Wang, ATT, Ericsson, NEC, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. The conventional wisdom is that this cautious trend, with its emphasis on indirect investments with minimal equity involvement, such as franchising, will continue for another 18 months to two years. The broking community is bullish about portfolio investment prospects, especially once the financial rand is abolished. But direct investment is seen, in the words of Mr O'Reilly, chief executive of Heinz, as a 'postponable event'. How postponable was outlined at last month's World Economic Forum meeting by Mr Frank Savage of Alliance Capital Management International. Mr Savage put up a 10-point wish list of conditions that foreign investors want to see in South Africa: financial rand abolition, the removal of exchange controls, removal of limitations on foreign ownership, no capital gains taxes, non-inflationary budgets, lower tariffs, reform of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, anti-trust legislation, black economic empowerment and consolidation of the government of national unity. Almost all of these are on the new government's agenda - the one exception being the probability of some form of capital transfer tax. But it will take years to translate an agenda into action. While the foreigners sit on the touch-line, domestic investment has started to recover. In March, Nedbank's Economic Unit, relying on public announcements, estimated new and continuing capital projects worth almost R100bn (Dollars 27bn at present exchange rates), over the next six years. This estimate includes an adjustment of 10 per cent a year for inflation. Community and social projects (R35bn) make up the largest single chunk, followed by energy and water projects (R21bn) and manufacturing (R13 bn). In the past, South Africa's investment record has fallen short on two counts. Even when it was investing more than comparable middle-income economies such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico - averaging 26 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 1970s - output and employment growth did not respond proportionately, because of growing capital intensity. In the 1980s and 1990s, the problem was less the efficiency of investment than the steep decline in volume. By last year investment was down to 15.2 per cent of GDP, touching bottom in mid-year, since when there has been some recovery. To grow at 5 per cent a year, the economy needs to invest more than 25 per cent annually - implying a shift of more than 7 per cent of GDP from consumption to savings. Part of this shift can be funded from offshore, with foreign capital, but achieving the domestic transfer of resources while simultaneously satisfying expectations will be a formidable task.

At the Houston Ship Channel, a $91-million bridge -- the largest ever financed  by the state -- is being built with steel girders produced in South Africa.    Never mind that there has been a ban on the importation of South African steel  since the United States imposed economic sanctions to protest apartheid in  1986. The bridge project is perfectly legal -- at least in the eyes of the Bush  Administration.    As the law is being interpreted, South African steel is, indeed, banned. But  girders are allowed in because they are a fabricated product one step removed  from the steel mill. In the language of government, a ""substantial  transformation"" had taken place.    ""The plain and simple answer is that it is not covered by the (anti-apartheid)  act,"" explained one Treasury Department official who requested anonymity.    While the distinction may be clear to Administration officials, it is not to  others. Critics accuse federal officials of splitting hairs in order to skirt  the sanctions, which Congress passed over President Ronald Reagan's veto.    The sanctions, which were not intended to be comprehensive, prohibit  importation of several South African goods, including iron, steel and  agricultural products and anything produced by companies in which the South  African government has a stake. The law also placed restrictions on what may be  exported to South Africa, as well as financial transactions.    Several members of Congress charge that the importing of South African steel  products illustrates how the Reagan and now Bush Administrations are  undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.    Millions of dollars of banned South African goods, from lobsters to textiles,  are coming into the United States despite the sanctions. And, according to  trade experts, American goods banned for export to South Africa are getting  there anyway.    A common theme of critics is that many goods are allowed to enter the United  States because of the U.S. Treasury Department's narrow interpretation of the  law and the failure of the State Department to identify products made by  so-called parastatals -- companies the South African government either controls  or partly owns.    At the same time, South African businessmen are said to use a number of  methods, including ""laundering"" shipments through other countries, as a way of  moving products into the United States and other countries that have imposed  trade embargoes.    The House Trade and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations  subcommittee has begun an inquiry into the steel imports. Rep. John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), the chairman, in a letter to then acting U.S. Customs Commissioner  Michael Lane, complained that the government ""appears still to be accepting the  most outrageous legal arguments of steel importers rather than trying to assess  the clear intent of Congress. . . .""    The legislation states that ""no iron or steel produced, or iron ore extracted,  in South Africa may be imported into the United States.""    The task of enforcing the law fell to the Office of Foreign Assets Control at  the Treasury Department, which identifies only 15 items as iron or steel  products.    A Treasury official argued that the list did indeed satisfy the intent of the  law and, in fact, may have gone beyond it by including items such as wire  products. Others, however, disagree with that interpretation.    ""The law absolutely bans all iron and steel from South Africa after Dec. 31,  1986,"" said Rep. John Bryant, (D-Tex.), who has become one of the major  proponents of broadening the sanctions.    Taking the 'Low Road'    Another who considers the interpretation to be too narrow is Gay McDougall,  director of the South Africa Project of the Washington-based Lawyers' Committee  for Civil Rights Under Law.    ""The (Reagan) Administration was on the record as being against these  sanctions,"" she said. ""Clearly, they took the low road in terms of enforcement  and implementation. They have taken the narrowest interpretation of the embargo  possible, and they haven't taken all the steps to fully implement it.""    Import figures show that the sanctions have had some effect, but by no means  have closed off trade with South Africa. In 1986, the year before the embargo,  the United States imported $301-million worth of iron and steel from South  Africa and, overall, imported goods worth more than $2.3 billion from that  country. In the following two years, more than $353.6-million worth of iron and  steel have been imported from South Africa, according to the U.S. Department of  Commerce.    Billions in Imports    The Bureau of the Census reported that since the beginning of 1987, more than  11,000 tons of goods categorized as ""other steel products"" have been imported  from South Africa.    In 1988, iron and steel ranked as the fourth-largest category of imports from  South Africa to the United States, according to Commerce Department statistics.  During that year, the last for which the Commerce Department had figures, the  United States imported more than $1.5-billion worth of goods from South Africa.    The figures are assumed to be conservative, since they do not count goods  transshipped through other nations.    Last April, for instance, Timothy Zwane, principal secretary for commerce,  industry and tourism in Swaziland, complained that South African firms were  using false documents to export goods as Swazi products. He cited as an example  a shipment of 50 tons of cut flowers, said to have originated in Swaziland,  that were exported to Europe, where sanctions against South Africa are also in  force. The only problem was that Swaziland produces nowhere near that amount of  flowers. He also pointed out that Swaziland does not grow apples, pears or  grapes.    ""Yet we constantly find, when we travel around (that) people talk about  Swaziland apples, pears and grapes,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Of course, we  are surprised.""    In another case, a U.S. Customs official described how an ostrich egg laid in  South Africa was transferred to another country, where it was hatched, and the  chick eventually was shipped to the United States. It was considered a legal  import because the chick was not hatched in South Africa. The same official  described how South African rock lobsters are allowed into the United States  because they are processed and shipped on vessels registered to another  country.    Last March, a former South African bank manager told a House subcommittee that  a number of European banks were using their New York offices to disguise South  African transactions, including some prohibited by the sanctions. Terry  Crawford-Browne, now an adviser to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he could not  document his allegations, but that his past banking experience led him to  believe this was occurring.    The United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations said in a report in  July that South Africa had responded to the sanctions by developing what is  widely known as ""unconventional trade.""    The report described a raft of methods used to get around the sanctions, from  simple mislabeling to transshipment through several countries. One example: A  chain of private trading companies passes formal title to the goods among  themselves until the real owner and destination are impossible to detect.    ""This is intended to confuse or deter monitoring through sheer complexity,"" the  report said. ""Invariably, the actual movement of the goods is much more direct.  In monitoring oil shipments to South Africa it has been observed that, whereas  the tanker sails directly from the port of loading to South Africa, title to  the cargo may change hands 10 to 15 times among traders and brokers in a number  of different countries.""    'Dutch Blend' Coal    The report also explained how South Africa ships coal to places where it is not  banned. It mentioned Rotterdam and Antwerp. The South African coal is then  mixed with shipments from other locales to obscure the coal's origin. In the  parlance of trade, the Rotterdam product is known as ""Dutch blend.""    Given the lax U.S. enforcement, many South African products need not take such  circuitous routes to reach America, McDougall of the South Africa Project said.  In the project's 135-page report last year, for example, McDougall was highly  critical of the Treasury Department's definition of uranium products covered by  the sanctions. While uranium and uranium oxide are banned, uranium hexafluoride  is not. Thus, she said, only uranium in its beginning and finished forms are  banned, while the products of interim processing may be imported and then  easily transformed.    ""The Treasury Department's interpretation permits easy circumvention of the  sanction,"" the report said.    Last August, a report of the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm  of the Congress -- said that sanctions against South Africa had been enforced  only partially because the State Department never gave Customs a detailed list  of parastatal products. It had only identified the parastatal companies.    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) one of the most ardent foes of South Africa's  white minority government, described the GAO's findings as showing a ""shocking  lapse by top Reagan Administration officials, who failed to apply elementary  enforcement procedures in carrying out the anti-apartheid laws.""    The whole question of sanctions is a tricky and controversial one that is  further complicated by the fact that the 1986 provisions were the first in  modern times enacted by the Congress rather than the President.    The Reagan Administration deemed sanctions to be counterproductive in any  effort to get the South African government to end its minority rule. But when  Congress overrode Reagan's veto, it did so in very selective fashion, with the  announced intent of hurting just the South African government's tax base, not  the citizenry.    As a result, the imports section specified only textiles, agricultural  products, iron and steel, coal and uranium and any article grown or produced,  manufactured or exported by a parastatal. It was not until 1987 that gold,  which accounts for about 45% of South Africa's export revenues, came under the  sanctions. At that time gold was defined as a parastatal product, the  government entity being the South African Reserve Bank.    Recently, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was  quoted as saying that the sanctions have been ""effective in bringing about new  thinking in Pretoria.""    McDougall and others say that the sanctions would be far more effective if they  were of the blanket variety imposed in the past against Libya, North Vietnam,  North Korea and other nations.    Others, including South African officials and many white South Africans who  oppose apartheid, follow the Reagan line of thinking. They say the U.S.  sanctions are hitting labor-intensive industries such as farming and coal  mining, and thus hurting the black South African labor force.    From that standpoint, ""the sanctions have been a complete failure,"" said  Michael Johns, a South African specialist at the conservative, Washington-based  Heritage Foundation.    The GAO, in a report released last month, addressed the question of whether  further restrictions on gold might be feasible. The conclusions were mixed, but  the report did point out that while gold is banned, much of it comes into the  United States anyway, as Italian jewelry.    The reason is that South Africa markets most of its gold through Britain and  Switzerland, and those countries then redistribute it. Almost all of the gold  that goes to Italy, the world's leading consumer, is made into jewelry, which  is then marketed around the world. The GAO said that 91% of all gold entering  Italy comes from South Africa.    Meanwhile, a member of the House oversight subcommittee said that hearings on  the importation of South African steel and steel products should begin in the  next several weeks, and that Treasury and Customs officials will be called to  explain their rationale on the importation of girders for the Texas bridge.    Rep. Bryant has sent the Treasury Department a letter requesting details of all  transactions in which iron and steel have been allowed into the United States  since the embargoes were imposed in 1986.    An aide to Sen. Kennedy said that an effort to tighten the sanctions will be  made during this session of Congress. (The House last year passed a bill to  widen the sanctions, but it did not make it to the Senate floor before the end  of that session.)    ""There are a lot of loopholes we've got to close,"" he said. ""We didn't cover a  lot of things.""

African Situation""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April  26-28 elections in South Africa.    The decision was announced by South African President  Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among  himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson  Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in  the poll is of great importance to the current situation in  South Africa.    The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest  political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the  three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in  the elections.    The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of  Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in  South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu  Homeland.    The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or  con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed  the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party  negttiations and adopted by the parliament.    The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later  asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to  submit its candidates for the elections.    Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other  foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt  to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and  IFP, but failed.    Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since  1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The  violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year.  More than 300 people died of violence monthly.    De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of  agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks  in Pretoria.    The memorandum said the three parties ""reject violence and  will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and  fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa.""    In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their  followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise  maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful  means.    The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will  greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa.    The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the  total South African people, are taking part in the elections.  This means a great change in the elections in South Africa.    Buthelezi said at a press conference today ""South Africans  may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of  unimaginable proportions.""    Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is ""a leap forward""  for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process.""    ""IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all  leaders and of all those who love South Africa,"" Mandela stated.     "

PTA, whose full name is Eastern and Southern Africa Trade and Development Bank, was set up in 1985 and has 14 shareholders including the African Development Bank, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mauritius and Burundi, where the bank is located. Today's issuance will be drawn from its Dollars 500m CP programme which is fully backed by a cash collateral account held in Bermuda. The programme is designed to protect CP holders from African risk, said Mr Francis Daniels, a senior adviser at Aidoo Group, a New York-based financial advisory group specialising in representing African governments and companies. Although PTA Bank is unrated, the structure of the programme has enabled it to secure a CP rating of A-1 plus from Standard  Poor's and F-1 plus from Fitch. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are the dealers for the programme. The proceeds will be used to support the bank's trade loans. The move towards democracy in South Africa has turned international investor attention to Africa but the depth of interest is far from clear.

It will attend the  inauguration ceremony of Nelson Mandela, the new president of  South Africa, which will take place on 10 May.    At Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg, Shumeyko made the  following statement:    ""A solemn and joyful event in the life of South Africa --  the  inauguration of the first democratically elected president of  the country -- has brought this Russian delegation to South  Africa.    ""As is known, Russia has made a weighty contribution to the  cause of dismantling apartheid and ensuring a political  settlement in the RSA. In the fight against the system of  apartheid and in the process of establishing a negotiating  process, we developed close friendly relations with the  constructive forces in South Africa, which are now widely  represented in the leadership of South Africa. We intend to  maintain and strengthen these relations.    ""The RSA and Russia are experiencing a similar period of  renewal, a period of seeking the ways of future development  while overcoming the old mentality and difficulties of adapting  to the new realities. Who, therefore, is better qualified than  we are to better understand each other's problems and mutually  make use of the accumulated positive experience of social  reformation.""    The similarity of approach to many aspects of world politics  paves the way to partnership in international relations. Russia  maintains that the new South Africa must enter the world  community and its international bodies as an equal participant,  and that all remaining sanctions against it should be lifted  without delay. We are prepared to help South Africa in this  matter.    The delegation also brought a personal message from  President  Boris Yeltsin to President Nelson Mandela, congratulating him  and stating that the Russian leadership and all Russia's  citizens are ready to further promote bilateral cooperation with  the RSA in all areas, which would benefit both democratic Russia  and South Africa in the name of peace and prosperity.""    In an ITAR-TASS interview, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that  the RSA used to be associated mainly with apartheid. Now when  the democratic processes have begun in that country, just as  they have been in Russia, the whole world wishes it success on  this path.    Speaking of bilateral relations, the head of the Russian  Federation delegation said they are not beginning from scratch.  Since the sanctions against the RSA were lifted, many  cooperation opportunities in various fields have opened up  between the two countries that are building democracy.  Interparliamentary relations are of considerable importance.  Our countries have similar legislature in the economic sphere,  and this makes our contacts much easier. We hope that from the  outset we will start moving toward legislation that will take  into account the interests of each partner.     "

Mr. de Klerk was speaking in Pretoria after meeting with  visiting Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring.    [Begin De Klerk recording] It's great to be good friends  again with Ireland. We, during our discussion, focused firstly  on the process in South Africa, on the prospects of a free and  fair election, the problem of violence -- what is being done  about it, what can be done; on the negotiation process which has  not been completed. As you know, some significant parties are  not on board and we're trying to get them on board. Our meeting  with Mr. Nelson Mandela will also focus on the state of  negotiations. We also focused on the European Union's  relationship to a new South Africa, the role it could play in  ensuring that this first chapter of the new South Africa will be  a very successful one; focused on how we could expand and the  necessity for expansion of bilateral relationships in the sphere  of trade and industry. I welcome the establishment of a  cooperative organization between the private sector of Ireland  and the private sector of South Africa. We welcome the  establishment of full diplomatic relations.    By and large, may I say that we hope that also this visit  will contribute towards good cooperation between us in South  Africa, those in charge of the election -- the Independent  Electoral Commission, the government and other parties, and the  teams of international observers that we expect here to be  vastly expanded as we come nearer to the election. We welcome  the international observation which will take place. It is  important that international community should satisfy  themselves, and it is also important that their presence can  make a contribution to ensure that there won't be intimidation  because that poses the biggest threat to the coming elections.

The full text of the message follows:    To the OAU summit:    On the occasion of triumphant convocation of the 30th OAU  summit, I hereby extend to it my warm congratulations on behalf  of the Chinese Government and people.    The birth of new South Africa with Nelson Mandela as its  president, and its attendance at the current summit as the 53d  OAU member signify the inspiring great victory accomplished by  the OAU and all African people in the political field, showing  the further strengthening of unity and solidarity on the African  continent. The admission of new South Africa to the OAU has  added a new vitality to the African people in their efforts to  seek a better future under the banner of the OAU, and has also  ushered in a new epoch in the history of the OAU. We  wholeheartedly wish the African people constant, new successes  in their struggle to defend national independence and  sovereignty, safeguard Africa's solidarity and unity, and  improve living conditions.    We are glad to learn that the African Economic Community  Treaty has officially become effective. The acceleration of  Africa's economic integration is of great significance to  African people's revitalization of the African economy through a  collective self-reliance. It shows the firm will and  determination of African countries and people to become united  and make themselves stronger in an unfavorable international  environment. The Chinese Government and people greatly admire  their will and determination and wholeheartedly hope that the  African people's collective efforts in the economic field will  succeed.    With the changing international situation, it has become  more  and more important to maintain political stability in African  countries so as to facilitate their economic development.  Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in  particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the  economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the  international community. We firmly support the OAU in its  efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain  political and social stability in African countries.    A profound friendship has been forged between China and  African nations during long, common struggles. Under the  present complex international situation, we should even more  sympathize with and support each other, and make joint efforts  to strengthen Sino-African solidarity and cooperation. The  Chinese Government and people treasure very much the  Sino-African friendship. To strengthen friendship and  cooperation with Africa has always been an important part of the  foreign policy of the Chinese Government no matter how  international situation changes.    I am convinced that the current summit will certainly  achieve  its desired results and triumphantly accomplish the lofty  missions assigned by African nations and people.    I wish the summit a complete success!    [Signed] Li Peng, premier of the State Council of the  People's Republic of China    [Dated] 11 June 1994, Beijing.     "

President Zafy warmly welcomed Qian Qichen. He said: The  current visit will surely further enhance the development of  friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries.    Qian Qichen said: Sino-Malagasy relations have a sound  foundation. The Chinese and Malagasy Governments will make  joint efforts to continuously consolidate and develop the  friendship between the peoples of the two countries and push  forward the development of bilateral economic and technological  cooperation.    Qian Qichen conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards  and good wishes to President Zafy. He said: President Jiang  looks forward to President Zafy's visit to China this year.    President Zafy pointed out: Madagascar and China have many  points in common. The Malagasy Government highly treasures our  friendly ties with China.    Touching on the situation in Africa, Qian Qichen said: The  process of decolonization in Africa has taken nearly half a  century. Currently, the African nations are still in a stage of  exploring how to develop their own economies. He stressed: The  practice of China's construction has proven that one cannot gain  success by indiscriminately copying and imitating the  experiences of other countries. The important thing is to  proceed from the realities of your own country, combine them  with and draw from the experiences of other countries, while  seeking your own path of development.    President Zafy endorsed Qian Qichen's views. He said: The  African people are increasingly aware of the importance of  acting independently and having the initiative in their own  hands, and of relying on themselves to develop their countries.  Notwithstanding that presently Africa has encountered  difficulties, it has its own superiorities.    Earlier on, Malagasy speaker Andriamahazo met with Qian  Qichen, and both sides exchanged views on how to further  strengthen contacts between the national assemblies of the two  countries.

The urgent need for such a program stems  from the worsening environmental situation coupled with the  virtual absence of an independent sector in this country  oriented toward the development and manufacture of environmental  products, as well as the fact that the task is truly complex.  Using the intellectual and scientific-technical potential and  production capacity of the defense complex to solve  environmental safety problems by providing comprehensive  environmental monitoring, creating new environmentally safe  technologies and improving means of processing industrial and  household wastes will help make that task manageable.    The program envisions involvement by more than 90 research  and planning organizations under the Russian Federation  Committee on the Defense Industry.    According to 1993, estimates, the cost of the program will  be  R54.28 billion [rubles].    Funding will come from the republic budget, investment and  conversion credits, capital investment, foreign investment,  customers' own funds and other off-budget allocations.    Implementation of the program is expected to take three  years.    The program will include the development and production of  new technologies and means of cleaning up exhaust gases and  waste water and of processing, neutralizing and reusing solid  waste; measurement and information systems for background  monitoring of the state of the environment, and systems to  monitor pollution sources; and environmentally safe and  resource- and energy-conserving technologies and types of  production.    The ``Conversion-Ecology'' program will be coordinated by  the  Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources.     "

In addition to Taiwan investment, a number of Southeast  Asian  nations poured money into Vietnam last year, including Malaysia,  Thailand and Indonesia, who invested US$346 million, US$209  million and US$131 million respectively, the IDIC statistics  showed.    From 1988 to November, 1993, Taiwan's accumulated investment  in Vietnam hit US$1.275 billion with Taiwan Sugar Corp. and  Chinese Petroleum Corp. as leading investors.    Hong Kong ranked second in accumulated investment, with  US$1.064 billion during the period. South Korea came in third  with US$473 million, followed by Australia's US$415 million and  Japan's US$414 million.    In recent years, foreign capital has continuously poured  into  Vietnam due to its cheap labor and the legislation of an  investment law in 1987 as well as the free market reform policy  adopted by the Vietnamese Government at the end of the 1980s.    The market reform policy, although coming later than similar  policies in other Southeast Asian countries, still fueled an  outstanding average economic growth of 7.1 percent over the past  three years.    Total approved foreign investment in Vietnam in 1991 reached  US$1.146 billion, and the figure jumped to US$2.863 billion in  1993, the statistics showed.    Although Taiwan topped other investors in 1993, its US$430  million was a decline of 17.8 percent from 1992, the IDIC  statistics showed.    Taiwan manufacturers focused their investments in the hotel,  tourism, service, petroleum and natural gas industries.     "

Mr Jaycox, who was on a brief stopover in London en route to the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, said the projects aimed to improve health, housing and education for South Africa's poor blacks. The World Bank stopped lending to South Africa when international sanctions were imposed against Pretoria's apartheid regime. But after two years of talks with both the government and the African National Congress, Mr Jaycox said prospects for renewing relations with South Africa were 'excellent'. Mr Jaycox stressed that World Bank loans to South Africa would not be on concessional terms, because of the country's relative wealth. The Bank's pledge follows similar promises of economic support for a democratic South Africa by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. The World Bank official was also keen to dispel the widespread image of the continent as a region of 'victims and losers'. For the first time in a generation, many countries were enjoying growth rates higher than the expansion of their populations. He was confident that tough structural adjustment programmes were beginning to bear fruit, despite an adverse international economic climate and the lukewarm commitment of many African governments to reform.

In this afternoon's meeting with the team of reporters who  accompanied him to the Mandela ceremonies, the Cuban president  described the South African president's election as an enormous  victory for the people of South Africa and for the world's  progressive forces.    It is a rebirth and proof that great victories can be  achieved in the wake of international disasters which have  occurred in the unipolar world in which we now live, Fidel  Castro said.    Asked by PRENSA LATINA about possibilities for cooperation  with the new South African Government, Cuba's top leader said:  ""There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we  share with South Africa.""    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    Regarding his first visit to this country, which a few years  ago was Cuba's battlefield enemy, Castro said: ""We were treated  very respectfully by all sectors of society, not only from the  ANC [African National Congress], but also from the Indian,  white, and mestizo sectors, taking into account that this is a  multiracial country in which millions of people feel the need to  cooperate with one another.""    There are two South Africas, the Cuban president said. At  various occasions in South African history, there were times of  violent clashes, but now there is a new South Africa in which  there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.    Castro believes the ANC government has a very difficult task  ahead of it, because ""even though it is a relatively developed  country, there is a huge population that has lived for a long  time under apartheid, and it has the needs and yearnings of a  majority which has been discriminated against.""    When referring to his first visit to this southern African  nation, Fidel Castro said, ""with few countries do we have such  heart-felt and fraternal ties as those we have cultivated over  so many years with South Africa and the ANC. [no closing  quotation marks as received]    Every time one speaks to a South African, one first notices  the great spiritual possibilities that exist, Castro said.    In discussing diplomatic relations, Castro said, ""We should  consider them when it is right for them, at an opportune  moment."" Cuba will be very honored to develop its relations  with South Africa, he said.    I see evolving events in this country as something  marvelous,  and my greatest wish is that this country achieves peace and  harmony, something we all must contribute to enable the efforts  and sacrifices made by this a country to serve as a model for  the entire world, the Cuban leader underscored.    Regarding today's swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed  by more than 5,000 South Africans at the Union Building  amphitheater, Castro said: ""The coming together of all South  Africans and all ethnic groups was beautiful. We hope that the  process continues to progress in this direction.""    Today in South Africa, we helped bury apartheid and assisted  in the birth of liberty, Fidel Castro said.    This is the first time that a high-ranking official Cuban  delegation has stepped onto South African soil.    Both countries faced each other on the battlefield between  1976-91, when Cuban troops went to assist Angola at their  request, to safeguard its independence and territory, which had  been threatened by military forces backed by the racist Pretoria  regime.

Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South  Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey  and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the  problem and ""go into action"" soon.    But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress,  blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out  sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month  in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban  townships.    ""Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it)  to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible,"" Mandela,  flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news  conference. He added that the trouble ""indicates the rejection by the masses of  the people"" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called  independent homelands for blacks.    Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe,  Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has  been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days  of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted  during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa  in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South  African constitution.    Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi  drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three  people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that  armed black attackers were poised to invade.    Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in  Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking  the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and  meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R. Tambo. He was escorted from his  airport news conference here to a daylong concert by South African artists held  in his honor.    This week, Mandela is scheduled to attend independence celebrations in Namibia,  which formally ends 75 years of South African colonial rule Wednesday.    During the week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet  Mandela in Namibia and then call on South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk  in Cape Town. Mandela acknowledged that the ANC had tried to discourage Baker  from visiting South Africa and that Mandela had refused to see him here.    ""If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see him,"" Mandela  said Saturday. ""But I will not see him in South Africa.""    ""A high-profile visit"" to South Africa ""can result in a lot of confusion,""  Mandela said. ""It would suggest that President De Klerk has done something  positive, something fundamental that requires the world to review sanctions.""  The ANC has welcomed De Klerk's initiatives but says they fall short of  creating a climate for negotiations.    Mandela also said Saturday that the ANC has chosen him to lead its delegation  for the first official meetings with De Klerk and his white minority-led  government in Cape Town on April 11.    He declined to discuss what might be on the agenda. But he reiterated the ANC's  position that its preconditions for negotiation -- amnesty for returning  exiles, release of political prisoners and ending the state of emergency --  ""are the minimum conditions"" for ANC participation in government-sponsored  talks on a new constitution that would give the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    The escalating unrest has complicated those talks by giving the government a  reason to retain its powers to quell violence under the state of emergency.  That violence, in which a white motorist was killed Thursday night near  Sebokeng township, also has hampered the ANC's attempts to reassure whites that  a black majority government would be orderly and fair.

0,FT922-14359 ,"FT922-14359 _AN-CDGBIADFFT 920407   FT  07 APR 92 / EC lifts embargo on oil exports to South Africa      By DAVID BUCHAN, PHILIP GAWITH and DEBORAH HARGREAVES      LUXEMBOURG, JOHANNESBURG   THE European Community yesterday lifted its ban on oil sales to South Africa, and paved the way for renewed sporting, cultural and scientific links. The moves brought an instant welcome from Dr Bhadra Ranchod, South Africa's ambassador to the EC, who said his country had had to compensate for the embargo by spending more on synthetic fuels, on stockpiling oil imported from other sources, and on prospecting for oil within South Africa and its waters. EC oil companies established in South Africa, such as Shell and BP, would be far freer to operate there, Dr Ranchod said. The decision paves the way for countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium to re-negotiate the cultural accords they broke off in 1985 when United Nations and EC sanctions were stepped up. South African academics and students will also have easier access to European universities, Dr Ranchod said. The only remaining EC sanctions on South Africa are those mandated by the UN Security Council banning the sale of arms to, and the exchange of military attaches with, South Africa. Oil industry operators in South Africa welcomed the unexpected announcement, but noted that the Community's decision will have limited financial impact. For the past few years South Africa has been buying its crude at world prices, paying little if any premium. The diminished impact of the embargo was already evident last year when the government announced it would sell part of its strategic reserve to finance social upliftment. It will, however, allow South Africa to diversify its sources of supply. The country will also be able to trade crude oil products openly. What remains unclear is the extent to which yesterday's announcement will undermine the United Nations embargo which remains. Locally, it will provide added impetus for the decentralisation of oil procurement, which has been controlled by the Central Energy Fund. Shipping Research Bureau, an Amsterdam based monitoring group, estimated that South Africa's oil imports cost Dollars 1.6bn in 1989. Demand is about 30 per cent below that of the mid-1970s due mainly to progress made by South Africa in achieving a level of self-sufficiency through developing a synthetic fuel industry which converts coal to oil and gas. Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil traders do not believe the EC move will have much impact on world prices. 'We could see some temporary distortions in the trade flows of certain oil products,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, 'but there will be no huge spate of demand opened up.'

""The document envisages a joint sale of American and Russian  uranium products in the U.S., and at market prices, too,""  Russian Deputy Minister of Nuclear Power Nikolay Yegorov, who  signed the amendment for the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS.    ""According to preliminary estimates, Russia's revenue from  the sale of uranium on the U.S. market may run at 150 million  U.S. dollars annually. Of great importance is also the consent  of U.S. uranium producers, who earlier accused our country of a  desire to sell uranium products at dumping prices, to cooperate  with Russia,"" Yegorov said.    A press release circulated here by the Russian Embassy in  the  U.S. points out that the amendment, agreed upon by the  governments of the two countries, reflects the mutually  beneficial and innovatory approach to the solution of trade  problems and is a new specific example of partners' relations  being developed by Russia and the U.S.     "

Several  personalities, in particular Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba,  the speaker of the National Assembly, members of the government  and the presidential staff went to welcome him at Bangui  airport. [passage omitted]    Soon after his arrival at the Palais de la Renaissance, the  president reviewed the Ndjamena summit. He recalled the signing  of the treaty and agreements establishing the Economic and  Monetary Community of Central African States [CEMAC], the  Monetary Union of Central Africa, and the Economic Union of  Central Africa. The quality of discussions held by the UDEAC  heads of state was very much appreciated. In fact, they did not  merely content themselves with approving the reports drawn up by  experts and ministers. On the contrary, they carried out a  detailed examination of the documents submitted to them. The  issues discussed at the summit consisted of economic and  regional integration, the situation of the Bank of Central  African States, and a report on the opening up of the region,  presented by the Central African Republic.    President Ange Felix Patasse also appealed for  reconciliation  between the Chadian Government and Moise Kette's movement  operating in southern Chad, the National Awakening Committee for  Peace and Democracy. Alain-George Ngatoua has given us a full  report on President Patasse's Ndjamena trip:    [Begin Patasse recording] I would like to tell you how happy  I feel to be among you this 17 March, for, within days, we will  be marking the anniversary of the tragic death of President  Barthelemy Boganda. In Ndjamena, we contributed much to the  success of the UDEAC summit. We have remained faithful to its  spirit and I am happy to announce that at long last Central  Africa is coming out of its deep slumber. We have understood  that our destinies are linked together. Central Africa is  lagging far behind the others because of national chauvinism.  At the same time that we held our summit in Ndjamena, West  Africa was also holding its summit. While all the West African  heads of state were present at their summit, some leaders in our  subregion were absent. You will understand the anguish we felt  some time ago. So if we left Bangui for Ndjamena, it was not  simply to accept the UDEAC secretary general's report, but  because we wanted to breathe new life into this institution by  taking a decisive step.    It was a choice between continuing to tread the same  well-trodden paths or to carry out a radical restructuring. We  opted for the latter solution. Yes, Central Africa is coming  out of its long sleep and those who want to remain within this  general dymamic awakening movement will do so, but those who do  not want to do so -- and it is a question of state sovereignty  -- are free not to go along with the others.    As far as we are concerned, we have stated that the treaty  establishing the economic and monetary community in Central  Africa must be signed at all costs. We have also said that it  was not obligatory to sign the treaty on the same day and at the  same place. Each country can do so within the framework of its  peculiar institutions. On this score, the host country  submitted the draft treaty for signature. Chad, Congo, and the  Central African Republic have signed the treaty. The president  of Equatorial Guinea could not be present at Ndjamena and  delegated this responsiblity to his deputy prime minister, so  Equatorial Guinea has also signed. Cameroon sent only the  president of its Economic and Social Council, who did not even  have a mandate to initial the document. However, since the  current chairmanship of the UDEAC has fallen to Cameroon, the  ball is in that country's court. We have decided to walk hand  in hand, and that is the determining factor. The community has  been born. [passage omitted] [end recording]     "

PRESS, Christian Science Monitor      WASHINGTON      Much of Africa will have above average or even record harvests this year, as it  did last year. But many Africans are still going hungry.    The surge in food production, due chiefly to improved weather conditions,  highlights what one World Bank official describes as the paradox of ""full  silos, empty stomachs.""    Big harvests are not helping poorly paid or jobless city residents who cannot  afford to buy enough food, even if prices fall slightly. And in rural areas,  many small farmers who cannot grow enough for their families lack the money to  buy extra food.    Thus, even as many experts seek ways to further boost Africa's food production,  a smaller number are looking for ways to boost incomes to help the hungry poor  afford decent diets.      Consumption Declining    According to the World Bank, nearly one-fourth of Africa's population -- more  than 100 million people -- do not get enough to eat. Food consumption per  person has been declining for most Africans since 1980, the bank says.    Large-scale famine continues in southern Sudan, due to a five-year civil war.  War also hampers farm production in at least three other countries -- Angola,  Mozambique, and Ethiopia.    But elsewhere, ""The basic part of hunger (in Africa) is an income problem,""  says G. Edward Schuh, a former economic aide to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and  Jimmy Carter, and ex-World Bank director of agriculture and rural development.  ""It's basically a poverty problem.""    There is a growing recognition among experts of a poverty-hunger link. In a  recent issue of the publication Africa Report, World Bank vice-president for  Africa, Edward Jaycox, said: ""Hunger is not mainly caused by transitory  droughts or crop failures or interruptions in the market. . . . Rather, chronic  food insecurity is caused by poverty. . . . ""      Income Declining    Per capita income has been declining in Africa for several decades, falling by  25% since 1980, Jaycox says.    ""We cannot treat the hunger problem as (only) a food supply problem,"" says  Sholom Reutlinger, a World Bank official.    World Bank President Barber Conable has called for more efforts to help the  poor afford more food. But for now, most World Bank and other aid efforts  remain directed at boosting food production rather than income.    Diverting more international and African attention to incomes will not be easy,  Reutlinger says. Larger farmers and equipment manufacturers push to keep the  focus on increasing crop production. And donors and African bureaucracies are  long accustomed to such a focus, he says.    Reutlinger and other specialists interviewed support efforts to boost food  production. But, they say, with the improved harvests, now is a good time to  try harder to find ways to help more people afford the food already available  in their countries.      New Programs Urged    They call for such programs as:    * Hiring small farmers in the off-season to build rural roads and bridges and  paying them with vouchers that can be exchanged for food.    Malawi has begun such a program, and the World Bank is considering helping fund  it. If such programs are not run during the slack farming season, however, they  may pull farmers away from regular farm work, one expert says.    *Paying rural children with food for each week of school they attend.    This would help many families by reducing their expenses on food, and would  encourage school attendance, says Schuh, now dean of the Humphrey Institute of  Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. A few programs like this have  been launched in schools in India, but he is not aware of any in Africa, Schuh  says.    Schuh says the more common types of aid to farmers also help feed the poor. For  example, assisting export-crop farmers through government programs such as  credit and improved roads often leads to their hiring more labor, giving the  laborers more income.    And government aid to farmers growing staple food crops also helps the poor by  reducing food prices, he adds.      Inadequate Storage    The challenge in Africa this year is what to do with the bumper crops already  in or expected. Storage facilities in most countries are inadequate.    Where storage is available, Reutlinger suggests that the local governments buy  the surplus and use it to pay for work projects carried out by the poor.    Dean Schuh says countries should export what they cannot use or sell, and save  the foreign exchange that is earned to import food during lean years.  Cumbersome as that may sound, it would avoid losses of food in storage to  rodents and insects, he says.      Potential for Growth    Africa has the potential to produce enough food for its people, says Curtis  Farrar, a World Bank expert on agriculture.    And although he acknowledges that a continuing high population growth rate --  Africa's is the highest in the world -- could offset production increases,  Farrar says the growth rate is almost certain to slow. It will slow as incomes  and education rise along with urbanization and couples have fewer children.    Some experts are not so optimistic. Family planning programs in Africa have  made some progress but no major gains so far.    Farrar is executive secretary of the World Bank's Consultative Group on  International Agricultural Research, which has several research centers in  Africa.      No Dominant Crop    No ""green revolution"" is likely to happen in Africa the way it did in Asia in  the 1960s, Farrar says. Africa lacks the kind of single dominant crop that Asia  (rice) had, he explains.    But some crops are showing major potential. Sorghum production has doubled in  some parts in recent years, and has more potential. Local crops such as cow  peas are also showing significant promise, he says.    Improved corn seed has tripled yields in Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, says  Michael Cowlinson, a social scientist at CGIAR headquarters in Washington. Such  increases have been accompanied by more effective use of fertilizers, better  planting methods, and local research, he says.    But Farrar and Cowlinson point to a weak link in efforts to boost food  production: In most of Africa, long-range research is inadequate. They also  cite lack of focus and coordination among donor nations aiding agricultural  production efforts.

PRESS, Christian Science Monitor      WASHINGTON      Much of Africa will have above average or even record harvests this year, as it  did last year. But many Africans are still going hungry.    The surge in food production, due chiefly to improved weather conditions,  highlights what one World Bank official describes as the paradox of ""full  silos, empty stomachs.""    Big harvests are not helping poorly paid or jobless city residents who cannot  afford to buy enough food, even if prices fall slightly. And in rural areas,  many small farmers who cannot grow enough for their families lack the money to  buy extra food.    Thus, even as many experts seek ways to further boost Africa's food production,  a smaller number are looking for ways to boost incomes to help the hungry poor  afford decent diets.      Consumption Declining    According to the World Bank, nearly one-fourth of Africa's population -- more  than 100 million people -- do not get enough to eat. Food consumption per  person has been declining for most Africans since 1980, the bank says.    Large-scale famine continues in southern Sudan, due to a five-year civil war.  War also hampers farm production in at least three other countries -- Angola,  Mozambique, and Ethiopia.    But elsewhere, ""The basic part of hunger (in Africa) is an income problem,""  says G. Edward Schuh, a former economic aide to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and  Jimmy Carter, and ex-World Bank director of agriculture and rural development.  ""It's basically a poverty problem.""    There is a growing recognition among experts of a poverty-hunger link. In a  recent issue of the publication Africa Report, World Bank vice-president for  Africa, Edward Jaycox, said: ""Hunger is not mainly caused by transitory  droughts or crop failures or interruptions in the market. . . . Rather, chronic  food insecurity is caused by poverty. . . . ""      Income Declining    Per capita income has been declining in Africa for several decades, falling by  25% since 1980, Jaycox says.    ""We cannot treat the hunger problem as (only) a food supply problem,"" says  Sholom Reutlinger, a World Bank official.    World Bank President Barber Conable has called for more efforts to help the  poor afford more food. But for now, most World Bank and other aid efforts  remain directed at boosting food production rather than income.    Diverting more international and African attention to incomes will not be easy,  Reutlinger says. Larger farmers and equipment manufacturers push to keep the  focus on increasing crop production. And donors and African bureaucracies are  long accustomed to such a focus, he says.    Reutlinger and other specialists interviewed support efforts to boost food  production.

The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South  Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days  here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with  the EU.    ""We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing  to do business with us,"" committee member Stella Sigcau said.    Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South  Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the  community following its first all-race elections next month.    The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political,  trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections,  to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades.    The South African authorities, including the African  National  Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for  a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the  post-apartheid economy.    But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South  Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring  African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can  be more widely spread.    A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin  said  it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to  join regional groupings.    These include the Southern African Development Community,  originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid  South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP)  group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention.    ""But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will  still be important to stimulate regional development,"" he said.    South African Manpower Minister Leon Wessels, a member of  the  delegation, said: ""There has been a greater convergence of  ideas. We feel ourselves closer to the heartbeat of southern  African.""    South African Ambassador to the EU Neil van Heerden spoke of  an ""emerging consensus"" about EU-South African relations, and  said he was confident that agreement could be reached ""on a fast  track"" after next month's elections.

MAUGH II, Times Science Writer      SAN DIEGO      New genetic evidence has strengthened the claim that all humans alive today are  descended from a single African woman and suggests that the woman lived 140,000  years ago, not 200,000 as was previously believed, a UC Berkeley researcher  said here Tuesday evening.    Descendants of that woman, whom scientist have dubbed ""Eve,"" started migrating  north out of Africa 75,000 years ago and had fully settled in southern Europe  35,000 years ago, displacing the indigenous Neanderthal population, said  molecular biologist Allan C. Wilson. The Neanderthals were dispossessed because  they were genetically incompatible with the humans of African origin, Wilson  said at an international genetics conference.    The new evidence also indicates that early males may have roamed rather freely  throughout Africa nearly 100,000 years ago while females stayed firmly rooted,  suggesting that sharp changes in cultural interaction of men and women occurred  over a period of about 30,000 years.      Basis of Conclusions    Wilson reached his conclusions by studying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the  genetic blueprint of humans) found not in the nucleus of cells, where most  genes are stored, but in mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell that are  the source of the cell's energy. Mitochondria have only 37 genes, compared to  the estimated 100,000 found in the cell's nucleus, making them much easier to  study.    Unlike genes in the nucleus, which are inherited from both parents, genes in  mitochondria are passed down only from mothers. Because of this, researchers  can trace maternal lineages unaffected by contributions from males.    Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are believed to occur at a constant rate over  long periods of time. By studying the differences between mitochondrial DNA  from two women, for example, researchers can determine how long ago they shared  a common female ancestor. When many women are used, the technique also reveals  where that ancestor lived.    Using mitochondrial DNA from placentas, Wilson and his colleagues reported in  1987 that all modern humans are descended from a woman who lived in southern  Africa about 200,000 years ago, a woman who has subsequently become known as  Eve or ""the mother of us all."" That finding does not mean that only one woman  was alive then. Rather, it means that the lineages that descended from all  other women eventually died out -- a phenomenon that is common in biology.    By comparing every possible pairing among the 147 people tested in the study,  the researchers concluded that Eve could only have lived in Africa.    Although other researchers generally accept Wilson's methodology, they  criticized two aspects of his studies: the fact that he used black Americans in  his study as a surrogate for Africans, and the speed of his so-called  ""molecular clock."" The molecular clock is a measure of the rate at which  mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, and critics charged that Wilson's was too  fast, placing Eve too near us in time.    In his current study, Wilson used newly developed biochemical techniques that  allowed him to study the mitochondrial DNA contained in a sample as small as a  single hair. Because he could use hairs, he was able to obtain specimens from  two hunter-gatherer tribes in central Africa and from the !Kung bushmen of  southern Africa, who would not have donated placentas for such a study. (The  spelling of !Kung denotes a clicking sound in the pronunciation of the K.)    He was also able to perform similar studies on chimpanzees, which helped him  achieve a finer calibration of his molecular clock.    ""We have been able to refute both criticisms,"" Wilson told a meeting of  geneticists.    Based on the new data, he said, Eve lived in southern Africa 142,000 years ago.  ""We are all a derivative of one of the !Kung lineages,"" he said.    The data further show that humans -- men and women together -- began migrating  out of Africa into the Middle East about 75,000 years ago. By 35,000 years ago,  they were firmly established in southern Europe, displacing the Neanderthals  who had lived there.    That agrees with archeological data, thereby confirming the accuracy of his  molecular clock. The fact that Neanderthal women made no contribution to the  gene pool indicates, he said, that a fundamental genetic incompatibility  existed between the two groups.    Although men and women began migrating out of Africa 75,000 years ago, men must  have begun moving around and exploring the continent much earlier, he said.  Evidence for this was provided by the genes of the three groups of African  women.    In those stages men did all the exploring and left women to tend to the home,  whereas later the family group was clearly more important and migrated as a  unit.    Wilson found virtually no overlap in the mitochondrial DNA from the three  groups, indicating that the females had stayed put for periods long enough for  gene differences to develop -- many tens of thousands of years. To his  surprise, however, Wilson found an almost complete overlap in key nuclear  genes, which are inherited from both parents.    ""This means that during most of the time in Africa, our female ancestors moved  very little, while the males apparently migrated quite a lot,"" he said.

About 80 Chinese companies will participate in the Trade Expo organised by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and to be held in Johannesburg from April 19 to 25. The CCPIT-organised fair in South Africa is one of 22 planned internationally and coincides with a rapid increase in China's exports, expected to reach Dollars 100bn (Pounds 70.4bn) this year. China's efforts further to accelerate its trade growth - it is expected to leap into the top 10 of the world's trading nations this year - comes as Beijing intensifies its attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China and the US formally resume Gatt talks in Beijing this week after a three-year break following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. China and South Africa last year established visa-issuing representative offices known as 'research centres' in each other's capitals as preparation for full normalisation. China, which has been discreetly trading with South Africa for many years, has said that formal relations would follow further constitutional reforms, including agreement on a national unity government pending elections. The foreign ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. South Africa's Mr Pik Botha visited Beijing in 1991 and China's Mr Qian Qichen went to Pretoria last year. Gold-hungry Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of Dollars 4.3bn on gold jewellery last year, according to China's official Business Weekly. Quoting a report of the Geneva-based World Gold Council, the newspaper said that, based on 'conservative estimates', jewellery sales in China exceeded 250 tons. This was equivalent to one quarter of all the gold sales in Asia - a region that is traditionally a big gold consumer. Taiwanese buy about 10 grams of gold on average a year, Hong Kong residents 6 grams and China 1.8 grams. The huge Chinese demand for gold jewellery has been partly spurred by concerns about the depreciating value of the local currency - the renminbi - and also by growing affluence in a country where economic growth last year topped 12 per cent. The World Gold Council, an association of producers, said that it would devote more resources to developing the gold market in China. It planned to target women consumers. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has purchased large quantities of gold in the past year, but the Chinese have not disclosed details. China has not divulged the extent of its gold reserves for more than 10 years.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana  Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr.  Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V.

Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief  director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho,  said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the  rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over  wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of  division. He said the most important lesson that came out of  the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black  majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so  that they can move into the new democratic era in unity.    Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings  seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They  included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore  of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife  of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of  Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the  situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade.    On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President  Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to  commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President  Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to  improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho  said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in  South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their  efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on  the continent.

0,FT933-8301 ,"FT933-8301 _AN-DHQCUABQFT 930817   FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: South Africa chafes at customs link      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   THE Southern African Customs Union meets today in Swaziland to discuss its future amid increasing indications that South Africa, the senior partner, wishes to revise the terms of its participation. Sacu - consisting of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho  -has existed in various guises for more than 100 years, and has been the most successful of the regional economic structures in southern Africa. Domestic fiscal pressures, however, have led over the past year to vocal protests in South African government circles that the system cannot continue in its current form. The root of the complaint is that while South Africa contributes 90 per cent of all revenue to the customs pool, its share of receipts has declined to 44 per cent from 73 per cent a decade ago. In the case of countries like Lesotho and Swaziland, these payments amount to more than a third of national income. In the 1991/2 fiscal year, South Africa paid more than R4.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) to other Sacu members, with about 40 per cent going to the nominally independent homelands in South Africa. According to Mr Gerhard Croeser, director general of the Department of Finance, today's meeting is 'just to have an exchange of views, not to make demands'. South Africa is too close to implementing new transitional government arrangements for any big policy shifts. Although the discussions will be technical in nature, they do have important ramifications, particularly for the future of regional economic co-operation. As Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said earlier this month, the issue is not whether South Africa should be making the payments. 'All I am saying is that you cannot justify the size of these payments in terms of the Customs Union. If we were to include other potential members into this arrangement, our system would run downhill at a rate which would be truly alarming.' If the Sacu formula is amended so as to make it possible for other countries to join - and some have expressed interest - this would cast serious doubts over the future of the Southern African Development Community as the premier regional vehicle for economic integration. The other main item up for discussion will be the terms of South Africa's revised tariff offer to Gatt in the Uruguay Round. Due to be tabled by the end of the month, it is likely to involve a cut in the number of tariff lines from 12,000-plus to about 1,000, and a substantial cut in the average level of protection. The issue will be how to reconcile South Africa's tariff policy with the needs of other Sacu members, all of whose economies are much less developed.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The president was  addressing a crowd which gathered at the parliamentary buildings  in Kampala today to celebrate the end of apartheid in South  Africa. Mr. Museveni said that it is a great achievement to see  that this sad chapter in human history has come to an end. He  also congratulated Mr. de Klerk for changing his mind from his  original stand and join the people of South Africa in the move  toward this new chapter.    Mr. Museveni paid tribute to the people of South Africa who  sacrificed a great deal in the struggle for freedom. He singled  out Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, (Subukwe) among others as  people who refused to surrender their right to freedom despite  the terrible hardships they went through. He also paid tribute  to African leaders who made significant contributions to the  freedom struggle, whom he enumerated as Julius Nyerere, Kenneth  Kaunda, Samora Machel, Kwame Nkrumah, 'Abd-al-Nasir, Ben Bella,  Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, Sekou Toure, and Robert Mugabe. Mr.  Museveni said that with this new chapter in South Africa, Africa  is now free from the Cape to Cairo. He cautioned, however, that  Africa is only free in the broad-based sense, because there are  still many problems to solve, such as the present conflicts in  Rwanda, Burundi, the Sudan, and Angola. He also pointed out  that the combined gross domestic product of South Africa, East  Africa, and Nigeria is still smaller than the gross domestic  product of a small country like Belgium.    The president, who acknowledged the presence of ANC soldiers  at the celebrations, said that since the National Resistance  Movement came to government in 1986, it has given assistance to  the ANC in line with the OAU policy. This assistance culminated  in the receiving of ANC soldiers in Uganda after they were  forced to leave Angola in order to pave the way for the  independence of Namibia. [passage omitted]     "

Mr Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, said yesterday that a formal long-term credit rating would be the most tangible step towards the country's return to the international capital markets. Bankers said South Africa was likely to make submissions to Moody's and Standard  Poor's, the two leading international rating agencies. The rating process would at least a few months to complete, they added. South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating which would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. Bankers said South Africa's infrastructure was more advanced than other 'emerging markets' but these achievements were offset by the country's political risk and the high unemployment.

0,FT923-3216 ,"FT923-3216 _AN-CINBUADSFT 920914   FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (3): Miracles need a long haul - Tony Hawkins takes an overview of the economic prospects      By TONY HAWKINS   ONLY a handful of third world countries in East Asia have made the difficult leap from factor-driven growth, exploiting abundant low-cost labour or rich natural resources, to a modern, investment-driven economy. Mauritius, having already exploited to the full its narrow resource base, will try during the 1990s to make this transition to a skills-intensive, service-led economy. It has little choice, because employment of both labour and land is forcing it upmarket into territory where, today at least, it has no obvious comparative advantage. International trends are forcing it along a new, more difficult, growth path too. Liberalisation of the world trading system - especially the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) - will remove an important source of past competitive advantage in the form of preferences in the European Community, while reform of the EC's common agricultural policy will hurt the sugar sector. With two of the island's three economic pillars, clothing and sugar, under threat from global forces, as well as domestic constraints, the third pillar, tourism, will have to be supplemented by new sources of growth. The trick in the 1990s will be to 'grow' new competitive advantage, especially in services: offshore banking and other business services, a free port, increased tourism, diversified agriculture and manufacturing; in the same way as it successfully developed into a world-class exporter of knitwear over the last decade. But it is going be more difficult this time round, partly because there is no longer a pool of skilled and semi-skilled workers to exploit, but also because the world of the 1990s threatens to be far more competitive. Mauritius expects to lose some of its preferential advantage in the single European market to low-cost manufacturers like Greece and Portugal, while facing tougher competition from other third world exporters if and when the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation measures is implemented. Following the important structural reforms of the early 1980s, the Mauritian economy has grown at almost 6 per cent a year, with the main thrust coming from the export processing zone( EPZ), dominated by clothing manufacturers, whose share of GDP more than doubled from 6 per cent in 1984 to 14 per cent last year. Sugar, the traditional locomotive of growth, whose reinvested profits fuelled both industrial and tourism expansion, still accounts for 10 per cent of GDP, while tourism's direct share, at 3 per cent, much understates its real importance as a foreign currency earner (16 per cent of the total) and as a source of employment. Growth prospects have deteriorated with the onset of full employment. EPZ growth slowed dramatically from more than 30 per cent annually in the mid-1980s, to an average 7 per cent a year since 1987. This reflected intensified competition in global markets, some loss of competitiveness as wage inflation took hold, and the tightening labour constraint as unemployment fell below 3 per cent last year from 19 per cent in 1983. Despite this, EPZ expansion still accounts for more than a fifth of post-1987 economic growth. By contrast, the sugar sector has gone backwards, with value-added declining 6 per cent over the past five years The bulk of growth (60 per cent) has come from services, with the finance sector, on which great hopes are pinned, expanding at more than 6.5 per cent a year. The balance of payments is healthy: a current account deficit of MR274m (Dollars 20m), 0.7 per cent of GDP. Mauritius has a large trade deficit of MR3.3bn (Dollars 235m), but this will be more than offset by tourist earnings of over MR4bn in 1992, while capital inflows, in recent years, have averaged MR1.5bn. External debt is modest at Dollars 938m (1990), with a debt-service ratio of 6 per cent. Hopes of maintaining growth at 6 per cent look optimistic. The signs are that Mauritius will have to settle for a more sedate 4 per cent growth rate in the 1990s, although this year GDP is forecast to rise 6.5 per cent, chiefly on the strength of a recovery in the sugar sector following last year's drought. Export processing zone (EPZ) diversification - with reduced dependence on clothing in favour of electronics, watch assembly, jewellery manufacture - has not yet materialised. There is a strong feeling that the Free Zone firms would do better to stick (literally) to their knitting. At present almost 85 per cent of EPZ workers are employed in the garment industry, with another 6 per cent in textiles, and this sectoral concentration has been increasing. The Mauritian education system is well equipped to provide the type of worker required for relatively low-skill clothing manufacture, but its capacity to turn out workers capable of operating high-tech state-of-the-art equipment, and people trained to staff and manage entrepreneurial service activities, is very much in doubt. Even if indigenous skills can be developed, there are just not enough pairs of hands to go round. This means not only that labour participation rates must rise, with more women being enticed to take jobs - participation rates are twice as high among men - but also that productivity growth must be secured from substantial new investment in both the software and hardware of modern business. Traditionally, growth and diversification has depended heavily on the reinvested surpluses of the sugar sector. But with sugar profitability on the wane, new sources of savings will have to be found. The 1992 budget tackles this problem, with a raft of new savings incentives targeted specifically at stock market investment. Unlike the Asian tigers, Mauritius is not a significant player in the inward investment game, attracting less than Dollars 150m in new foreign capital inflows during the 1980s. Investment has therefore been dependent on domestic savings levels which, fortunately, have averaged 27 per cent of GDP in recent years, sufficient for GDP growth of at least 5 per cent a year, given existing rates of investment efficiency. As sugar surpluses fall, however, so Mauritius will need to attract more foreign interest - not just financial inflows, but the even more important inputs of technology, expertise and access to markets, to brandnames and subcontracting arrangements. Attracting these inflows is not going to be easy; with a GDP of less than Dollars 3.5bn, the domestic market has little to offer. Government ministers believe that the improved economic prospects in the island's natural hinterland - east and southern Africa - will turn Mauritius into an attractive location for entrepot business, interfacing between Africa and south-east Asia; for regional headquarters for multinational companies as well for the offshore banking and financial services. Mr Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, sees post-apartheid South Africa as the locomotive most likely to start up the regional economy. But there is an element of wishful thinking in this regional service centre picture, given the continuing - indeed, accelerating - marginalisation of Africa and the probability of only a sluggish South African economy for the next few years at least. Even if the plan were to come good, it is very much a long-haul one. The upbeat side of it is the Mauritian track record. Given the transformation in little more than a decade from sugar mono-economy to a finely-balanced three-legged stool - sugar, clothing and tourism - the islanders' resilience and resourcefulness should not be underestimated. Mr Sithanen has started well by rationalising domestic monetary and tax policies to increase savings and investment, while also abolishing what remained of exchange controls. There is more to be done. For all its reputation as a liberal, outward-oriented economy, Mauritius today has more price controls than five 5 years ago; its system of centralised wage-bargaining is a drag on industrial and commercial efficiency. Mr Sithanen acknowledges that the public sector is overmanned, agreeing that labour must be retrained and redeployed; the sugar milling sector needs to be rationalised to reduce the number of mills and thereby improving efficiency, and the one-stop investment shop at the ministry of industry needs to be streamlined. Above all, the Mauritian miracle is going to run out of steam unless it can revitalise its human sector. Two elements are crucial. The first is the will to win, and many doubt whether the cheerful, easy-going Mauritian people, increasingly accustomed to rapidly-improving living standards (per capita income have risen 70 per cent since 1980 - have that killer instinct. Second, and perhaps more importantly, they may not have the core competencies necessary to succeed in a world where low-cost labour is no longer a passport to economic growth. Developing new attitudes and new competencies will - like financial sector growth  - be a long haul.  ----------------------------------------------------------- GDP GROWTH RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------- Years                          Annual growth rates  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1980                           -10.1 1981                             6.4 1982                             5.8 1983                             0.4 1984                             4.7 1985                             6.8 1986                             8.9 1987                             8.4 1988                             6.1 1989                             4.7 1990                             7.1 1991                             4.6 1992*                            6.5  ----------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast Source: Central Statistical Office, St Louis  -----------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION  ----------------------------------------------------------- Years     Annual %  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1980      42 1981      14.5 1982      11.4 1983      5.6 1984      7.3 1985      6.7 1986      1.8 1987      0.6 1988      9.2 1989      12.6 1990      13.5 1991      7.0 1992*      5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast Source: Central Statistical Office, St Louis  -----------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (MRs in millions)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal years                   1989-1990     1990-1991     1991-1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports                        15,925        18,166        19,499 Imports                        20,019        21,971        22,846 Trade deficit                  -4,094        -3,805        -3,347 Net invisibles                 +2,228        +2,945        +3,073 Current account deficit        -1,866        -860          -274 Net capital                    +1,409        +1,714        +1,428 Unrecorded flows               +3,498        +2,259        +1,894 Overall balance                +3,041        +3,113        +3,048  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of Mauritius  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

Long  awaited by current South African leaders, this visit should  render official the ""normalization"" of relations between the two  countries after a decade of open hostility.    With just four months to go to the first multiracial,  general  elections, Edouard Balladur's government is seeking to give  greater emphasis to ""French support for the current process of  transition,"" a communique from Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry]  indicated. The visit by the foreign minister therefore marks  his ""confidence in the South Africa of tomorrow and in its will  to give new impetus to bilateral relations,"" the communique  added.    Edouard Balladur showed his interest in the development of  democracy in South Africa with a private visit a few months  before last year's legislative elections. For the future prime  minister of a government of the right, it was primarily a  question of renewing contact with the ANC [African National  Congress], which had previously maintained ""exclusive"" relations  with the Socialist government. Spearheading a Western crusade  against the apartheid regime, in 1985 Laurent Fabius  unilaterally imposed economic sanctions against South Africa, a  decision that ranked France clearly alongside the ANC while  concurrently benefiting its principal competitors -- Great  Britain and Germany, which did not follow its lead.    Following in the footsteps of Edouard Balladur, Alain Juppe  -- who will meet President Frederik de Klerk; ANC President  Nelson Mandela; and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu  Inkatha Party -- must complete this rebalancing, which is  essential to new French policy in Africa. In fact, France has  been trying for several months now to secure ""fruitful  partnership relations"" with South Africa, the most advanced  country in Africa and the continent's future center of  development. There is a need to find additional outlets for  French companies which, despite some spectacular deals (such as  selling seven A-320 Airbuses and doubling investments (3  billion francs) in three years), have little chance of making up  for lost ground on the South African market.

In a report - expected to be legislated by the new government later this year - the authorities declared their commitment to overall restructuring of operations, with emphasis on increasing market participation by both foreigners and black investors. The exchange will run a series of investor workshops and encourage the listing of small black companies, while also permitting limited corporate membership and some foreign ownership of local brokerages for the first time. After years of sanctions and isolation, during which many overseas buyers, particularly Americans, stopped even considering South African stocks, interest has resurfaced over the past six months. The recent boom, which has seen the major indices hit a series of new highs, has been largely foreign driven. Several specialist Africa funds have been formed, most notably Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m Africa Fund and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern Africa fund, both of which are overwhelmingly concentrated on the South African market. More are expected. As South Africa is increasingly added to global market indices, such the IFC data base on emerging markets, a greater proportion of international investment capital will almost certainly make its way to the country. With a current market capitalisation in the region of Dollars 160bn, the exchange is the 11th largest globally, and much more mature and sophisticated than most comparable markets in the developing world. With foreigners expected to be allowed to participate shortly, it is already widely rumoured that major London firms have expressed interest in partnership with local brokerages, a move that will likely generate further foreign business down the line.

December 31 marked more than the end of just another year.  It also marked the end of an era, he said.    Next year South Africa would, for the first time, have a  multiparty government that would be truly representative of all  its people. ""For the first time we will have a system where the  constitution and the bill of rights -- and not politicians in  Parliament -- will have the final say,"" Mr de Klerk said.    For the first time South Africa would have a constitutional  system containing effective checks and balances against the  misuse of power.    Important among these would be independent courts, including  an independent constitutional court with wide-ranging powers.    Equally important would be the establishment of strong and  autonomous provinces, with important powers and functions  effectively entrenched.    Mr de Klerk said South Africa faced three challenges in the  new year, the first being to let democracy succeed. ""The second  challenge...will be to make our economy work to the benefit of  all our people. Success in the economic field will be as  important as success in the constitutional field.""    Democracy and elections would not by themselves bring all  the  things that people needed, said the president. ""We will not be  able to create jobs and build all of the houses, schools and  clinics that we need, unless there is money to pay for them.  And the only way that we can get this money is to ensure that  our economy grows as quickly and as strongly as possible.""    This would require hard work, new investments and expanding  exports. ""To achieve this, the new government of national unity  will have to follow the right policies -- policies that have  succeeded throughout the world.""

The Iraq issue, the most important among  the problems between Turkey and the United States, is gradually  worsening. Turkey's flirtation with Baghdad has made Washington  extremely uncomfortable. Washington is reportedly worried that  the UN embargo on Baghdad will be violated and the Saddam  administration's existence will be prolonged if Ankara insists  on its approach. Washington is also worried that the approach  maintained by Turkey, which is the most important country from  the point of view of the UN sanctions, may disrupt the already  weakening alliance against Iraq; that is, if Turkey does not  abandon its stance.    The U.S. view is this: ""The approach you adopted when we  were about to achieve our goal will encourage Saddam Husayn.  That will make things difficult for us."" Consequently, that  country is trying to persuade Turkey to change its position. An  effort is being made to find an intermediary formula to obstruct  the approach maintained by Turkey, which is swaying under the  pressure of an economic crisis and the search for an agreement  with the IMF on credits.    Apparently, the embargo on Iraq is being maintained upon the  insistence of the United States. Washington knows it must  decide what policy to adopt on Iraq. The pressure at the United  Nations to lift the embargo is gradually increasing. Many  countries, Jordan in particular, have said ""the embargo should  be lifted. It is enough."" The next few weeks will be very  important from that viewpoint. The UN Security Council must  reconsider the issue and decide whether to maintain the embargo.  Attention is focused on Washington. The decision it will adopt  to change or maintain its approach will have a bearing on Iraq's  territorial integrity, regional developments, and the relations  between Turkey and the United States.    Iraq Has Been Forced To Pay Enough    Iraq has suffered enough of a penalty for causing the Gulf  War. The UN decision to impose an embargo on it has been  implemented in an unprecedented way. All its heavy arms have  been destroyed under UN supervision. Baghdad revealed a few  days ago that it has relinquished its claim that Kuwait is a  part of Iraq.    The embargo has been an adequate lesson for Iraq. Iraq has  lost some of its wealth and its military strength has weakened.  But the United States would be wrong to expect its pressure to  achieve Saddam Husayn's removal. On the contrary, the  conditions are helping Saddam Husayn to strengthen his  administration. The Iraqi people have rallied around their  leader, prolonging the Saddam administration's term in office.    Turkey Cannot Endure the Embargo....    Turkey has suffered significantly from the embargo on Iraq.  So far it has lost $20 billion. The loss will increase by $5  to $6 billion a year. The issue has reached a point where it  can no longer be endured. The serious situation will be better  understood if this is considered together with the rate of  unemployment and political and social unrest in southeast Turkey.    As if all that is not enough, Turkey has been assigned an  active task within the framework of the Hammer Force for  penalizing Iraq. It is as if Turkey is being forced to punish  itself.    That is what the public has been unable to understand...    Turkey is expected to continue to support the Hammer Force,  while its economic problems are ignored and its wish to use the  oil from the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline is rejected. No one  agrees with the excuse: ""Turkey cannot act against the Workers  Party of Kurdistan militants in northern Iraq without the Hammer  Force. Nor can it bomb Iraq's territory whenever it wants. It  will risk significant world reaction. But the United States has  preferred to overlook developments in the region because of the  existence of the Hammer Force.""    The Turkish Grand National Assembly will debate the  extension  of the Hammer Force's mandate for another six months very soon.  The debate that will be held will be much more serious than  those that were held in the past. In view of that, Washington  should consider the anxiety in Turkey when it moves to decide on  the embargo on Iraq and the withdrawal of the oil from the  Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The U.S. approach has begun to  seriously harm Turkey and the region.     "

They sent it to the Organisation of African Unity, the  United  Nations Security Council and its secretary general, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    But in acknowledging the crimes being predominantly  committed  by Rwandan government soldiers and ruling party militiamen,  Mandela fails to acknowledge South Africa's role in arming them.  At least 3,000 of Rwanda's soldiers and some militiamen carry  South African R4 automatic rifles. Rwanda bought them in 1992,  along with 10,000 hand-grenades, 20,000 rifle grenades, 10,000  launching grenades, and more than one million rounds of  ammunition.    Rwanda's purchase of arms from South Africa was in violation  of a 1984 voluntary UN Security Council resolution. By 1977 it  had already imposed a binding resolution against any arms sales  to South Africa.    But the UN is expected to lift its arms embargo against  South  Africa soon. This would give Mandela the chance to demonstrate  that the new South Africa would not sell arms to countries like  Rwanda. Instead, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa]  executive Andre Buys told Defense News: ""We expect that by  1996 exports will at least    When Vaclav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia in  1989,  he promised to end armed exports. But last year, after the  country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, both renewed  exports. Unfortunately, Mandela and the African National  Congress seem likely to take the same road.    ""Once the new government is up and running, we will welcome  a  complete lifting of all remaining sanctions and embargoes  against South Africa,"" ANC spokesman Madala Mthembu told DEFENSE  NEWS. ""We also wish to state the new government will be in full  compliance with international standards governing exports of  technologies and materials that would threaten world security.""    Such standards would preclude arms sales, for example, to  states like Libya, which is also currently subject to a UN  embargo. But states like Rwanda before its present crisis would  still be able legally to buy arms.    No one expects Mandela to turn his back on what promises to  become one of the new South Africa's best earners of foreign  exchange. But few would expect, either, a man who has devoted  his life to his country's struggle for justice, equality and  human rights to turn his back on future victims of other abusive  regimes now.    He wouldn't necessarily need to. Because of the existing US  embargo, precise figures on South Africa's military exports are  unknown. But Denel, the state-owned manufacturing consortium  created out of part of Armscor and its subsidiaries in 1992, has  assets of $2.9-billion and has made about $175-million in arms  exports annually so far. Denel accounts for only about 60  percent of the country's total defence sales.    However lethal to its own citizens, Rwanda's purchase of  $5.9- million worth of grenades, mortars and ammunition from  Armscor made only a tiny addition to South Africa's balance  sheet. A leader in almost every weapons grouping, it expects to  make most of its profit from the sale of expensive, hi-tech  systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic  warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and  battlefield mobility systems.    South Africa also has a technological edge in landmine  detection and sweeping equipment that countries like Cambodia,  especially, need. While South Africa has already begun to  market this equipment, it announced in March that it would not  sell landmines at the same time, and stopped exports.    Although motivated by appearance before principle, this is a  welcome sign.    But the ANC's present policy isn't good enough. While  exporting mine-sweeping equipment and hi-tech weapons to earn  foreign exchange rightfully, the new South Africa should  re-examine its small-arms export policy. International  prohibitions against arms sales to abusive regimes are at  present non-existent or low.    Rwanda, long documented for its grisly record, is a case in  point. Rather than sink to this standard, Mandela should lead  the world in raising it up.     "

Brazil, as an emerging power,  wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking  countries that had recently become independent from Portugal.  Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian  businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed  by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But  the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of  projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of  doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month  before the first South African elections in which the black  population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen  headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion  Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to  that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large  companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes  Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company],  Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: ""The  time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed  confidence in the South African electoral process.""    The South African elections, which will put an end to 46  years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and  28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last  few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is  considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of  Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible  missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According  to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of  Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation,  Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade  with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of  consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's  representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an  eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting  government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party  program.    The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic  departments  and with representatives of five different sectors (including  the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which  includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures  and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian  deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development  project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira  commented that ""the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost  houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is  lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas."" Mandela's  supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy  implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to  minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed,  includes nuclear bombs.    The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the  establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay  -- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and  Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South  Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the  African markets. He added: ""They know how to negotiate with the  region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen.""    Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any  nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether  or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil  field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with  the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians'  visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only.  At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed:  The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material  from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene.  Minister Vieira exclaimed: ""We have discovered South Africa.""  What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election  will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country.  After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking  African countries failed because they all were drowned by  endless civil wars.     "

0,FT924-1254 ,"FT924-1254 _AN-CLRBYAARFT 921218   FT  18 DEC 92 / Popular movement urged to meet the needs of children      By DAVID DODWELL      GENEVA   THE United Nations Children's Fund yesterday called for a worldwide popular movement - 'the basic needs movement' - to raise Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.4bn) a year to meet children's needs for food, clean water and basic health care. Reaching this target would lower birth rates, and save the lives of more than 4m children a year, Unicef said in its annual 'State of the World's Children' report. This would create a breakthrough against 'the last great obscenity - the needless malnutrition, disease, and illiteracy that still casts a shadow over the lives, and the futures of the poorest quarter of the world's children'. 'The time has come to banish in shame the notion that the world cannot afford to meet the most obvious and basic needs of all its children,' said Mr James Grant, executive director of Unicef, pointing out that Dollars 25bn amounted to less than Europeans spend on wine each year, Americans on beer, and Japanese on business entertaining. This contrasts with about Dollars 750bn spent every year on the military. He added that progress depends not just on cash, but on sustained commitment and managerial competence by governments. 'It is an unacceptable disgrace to humanity for millions of children to be dying every year from diseases that can demonstrably be prevented and treated at almost negligible cost,' the report says. Unicef calls for two thirds of the Dollars 25bn needed to come from developing countries themselves. This could be achieved if governments spent 20 per cent of their budgets on basics such as food, water, sanitation, health care and family planning, the report says. It complains that at present, more is spent on the military, and on debt servicing than on health and education. The rest could be met out of aid funds if donor countries raised to 20 per cent the proportion of aid devoted to basic needs. At present, less than 10 per cent of the total Dollars 40bn provided as bilateral aid every year is targeted in this way. 'The problem today is not that overcoming the worst aspects of world poverty is too vast or too expensive a task: it is that it has not been seriously tried,' the report says. It says that a combination of new technologies, falling costs, and community-based strategies, is making it possible today to tackle aspects of poverty that historically have been the most stubborn - such as nutrition, clean water and basic education. For example, providing clean water in Africa today costs about Dollars 20 per person per year, half the cost of just six years ago. Unicef calls for a worldwide popular movement because of concern that the threat to children is a 'silent emergency' that passes unnoticed alongside more dramatic crises such as those in Somalia or Yugoslavia: 'No famine, no flood, no earthquake, no war, has ever claimed the lives of 250,000 children in a single week,' said Mr Grant: 'Yet malnutrition and diseases claim that number of child victims every week.' The report points out that 60 per cent of the 13m child deaths every year are caused by three diseases - pneumonia, diarrhoea and measles - all of which can be treated at low cost. Treatment for vitamin A deficiency, which can cause blindness and early death, can be controlled at a cost of about 10 cents per child per year, while iodine deficiency, which causes mental retardation, could be eliminated at a total cost of Dollars 100m. It is nevertheless encouraged by shifts away from military government, singling out Ethiopia, where military spending fell last year from 60 per cent to 30 per cent of the total spending, with health and education spending rising from 12 per cent to 20 per cent. A final critical concern is the 'financial famine' facing developing countries because of high levels of debt, low inward investment, and limited access to export markets. Developing country debt now totals Dollars 1,300bn, the report says, with capital and interest charges of Dollars 143bn falling due each year - three times the total of aid received from all sources.

0,FT923-6912 ,"FT923-6912 _AN-CHYAUAA3FT 920821   FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: 'Neighbour' nations defy South Africa      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   THIS week's announcement from the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) that it plans to turn itself into the more ambitious Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a sign it had failed to deliver the goods. While few dispute the need for a change, it is unclear that this initiative, which aims to replace a loose arrangement of sectoral co-operation between nine nations with a formal treaty seeking greater economic integration, is for the better. With the premise of SADC seeming to provide a bulwark against South Africa's economic dominance in the region, it seems set to fail. As Johannesburg's Business Day argues, it seems an 'exercise in futility' to try to deny economic links with South Africa just when most foreign interest in the region wants to use it as a springboard, not a main player. SADCC's change was forced on it by the South Africa reform process undermining a basic tenet of its existence: the need to achieve economic independence from a hostile neighbour (South Africa itself). Formed in 1980 with nine member states (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), since joined by post-independence Namibia, SADCC sought to reduce external economic dependence, especially on South Africa, and promote economic development. This week's changeover to the new SADC raises questions on two fronts: the relationship between SADC and South Africa; and the need for greater economic integration. South Africa elicits contradictory reactions among SADC members. It can be seen as the saviour - the region's economic locomotive and, with foreign aid flows not as free as in the past, a potential paymaster - or feared, as an economy able to swamp its neighbours. The dilemma is real, but this week's decision suggests SADC prefers to delay confronting it. Sound political reasons exist for not having any truck with South Africa until it has achieved full democracy, but it seems clear the only hope for achieving a useful regional economic grouping is with South Africa at its core. Re-organising before addressing the South Africa issue seems futile. Setting aside South Africa, analysts are sceptical about the route of deeper economic integration chosen by SADC. Dr Eric Leistner of the Africa Institute notes: 'The aims of SADC are more ambitious, so they will fail more spectacularly (than SADCC).' Three major problems are involved in this route: the first concerns the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA). Eight of SADC's members belong to the PTA, and SADC overlaps considerably with the PTA, yet SADC will not merge with PTA - an illogical stance. Second, PTA has had limited success in its aims, such as tariff reduction, due to lack of economic resources and political will on the part of its members. Why should things be different for SADC? Also, the limited success enjoyed in achieving the far less demanding aims of SADCC casts serious doubt on whether SADC can hope to progress in the difficult task of economic integration. Finally, the enormous economic disparities between the member countries of SADC, in terms of such factors as inflation and access to foreign currency, make integration problematical. Given these problems, and an unwillingness to cede sovereignty to regional bodies, a more promising route would for the SADC countries to focus on aims such as co-operation in sectors such as energy, transport and movement of goods.

The Old Mutual South Africa Trust is hoping to raise about Pounds 50m to invest in a range of South African companies, with a bias towards smaller and medium-sized companies and the financial and industrial sectors. The fund will be managed with a bottom-up, stock-picking style. The fund's managers say that South Africa combines much of the growth potential of an emerging market with the developed infrastructure of an advanced industrialised economy and a stock market more than 100 years old. The ending of sanctions and improved political stability provide encouraging opportunities for growth. The fund's bias towards smaller companies is intended to avoid duplicating investment in areas which are easily accessible to foreign institutional investors, focusing instead on areas of the market for which research is not widely available overseas. South Africa is due to be included in the IFC emerging markets index, where it will have a weighting of about 13 per cent. This is expected to lead to heavy inflows of overseas money into South Africa, and the Old Mutual trust hopes to appeal to institutions looking for a quick way to increase South African exposure in line with the index. The fund is mainly targeted at institutional investors, but there will also be a public offer to allow private investors a chance to participate. Lord Tombs, former chairman of Rolls-Royce, will chair the trust, with other board members drawn from Old Mutual and the UK investment trust sector. Shares will be issued at 100p with one warrant attached to every five shares. The public offer opens on June 23, and closes on July 1.   Companies:-  Old Mutual Unit Trust Management.

What specifically can you do if  some governments are not representing the interests of all their  ethnic groups?    [Salim] The African states are largely the product of the  arbitrary drawing of borders by the colonial powers.  Nevertheless, we have decided to retain the territorial  integrity of our states. Regarding the representative nature of  the governments, there are a few peculiarities. There has been  democratization, which is certainly worth being recognized -- in  Benin, Zambia, the Congo, to name just a few. In Africa,  democratization means two things: first, that power emanates  from the people, and second, that we have good, reliable  governments. I do not know which system is most suitable for  that.    Regarding the problem of tribalism, it has turned out that  Europe is not free from it either -- the term ""ethnic cleansing""  was invented in Europe. I say this without polemics. It is  little consolidation if one looks at poverty, misery, and  violence as they are now in Rwanda -- conditions that shock and  sicken me -- and then says: You in Europe are not perfect  either. But no one in the world can claim a monopoly on  everything good and pleasant.    As an international community, we must learn to learn from  each other -- from the tragedies in Bosnia just as from the  tragedies in Africa. In particular, we must also solve the  ethnic and religious conflicts, because otherwise they develop  such an explosive power that they become nightmares for our  society.    [Bloch] You have repeatedly stressed how important economic  cooperation among the African states is -- the creation of a  united economic area. How is this supposed to work among  countries that are all struggling for survival, since even the  attempt at cooperation among highly developed industrial states  in Europe is difficult?    [Salim] Quite right, but I would look at it precisely the  other way round: If the need for cooperation among the  prosperous former colonial powers is undisputed, how much more  urgent is this need than for Africa! Precisely because of the  brittleness of our society and the widespread power, we must  cooperate all the more closely and effectively. In April, the  35th member country ratified the agreement on an African  economic community. It is part of our postcolonial syndrome of  dependence that we talk much about economic cooperation but have  done little for it. We have always looked toward the north. We  need experts -- we look toward the north; we want to buy things  -- we look toward the north. Even today it is sometimes easier  to fly from one African country to another via Europe. Or one  makes telephone calls via Europe -- all these are things that  must change.    [Bloch] How?    [Salim] The African countries must finally be able to  improve  their foreign trade balance. We have always been told: You  must simply work harder and produce more. But today everyone  knows that this does not work. The Africans -- in particular in  the rural areas -- can work two, three, or four times harder and  would still get less for it than 10 years ago. The unjust  imbalance of the international market must make the West think.    No one denies that Africa has enormous resources --  minerals,  raw materials, the gigantic hydroelectric volume of our waters.  People always talk about Africa as the continent of the future.  I am more interested in Africa as the continent of the present.  The point is to use our resources in a sensible way.    [Bloch] In the German media, Africa is never portrayed as  the  continent of the future, not even as the continent of the  present....    [Salim, interrupting] ...Because there is an English  proverb:  ""You give a dog a bad name and you hang it."" As long as Africa  is portrayed only as a confused, miserable, vegetating  continent, whose rulers are entangled in bloody wars with each  other and cut each other's throats after military coups,  naturally no one will care for our concerns. However, if one  explained the efforts of the normal Africans for economic  improvements and political reforms to the Germans, they would be  more understanding.    [Bloch] What are you relations like with those ruling in  Europe? Do you not often appear as a suppliant?    [Salim] When I go to Europe or the United States or to the  Gulf states, I never turn up holding out my hand in  supplication. Rather, I am making propaganda for actively  understanding our problems. The best support develops if the  people understand what is going on on our continent beyond all  cliches.    [Bloch] And does such understanding exist?    [Salim] There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy.  Today some people talk about ""Afro-pessimism"" and reproach  Africa for precisely those things for which they are partly to  blame themselves and which they have partly brought about. Some  people speak of corrupt, dictatorial regimes -- governments with  which they have cooperated for decades and with whose help they  are acquiring advantages. In addition, the Europeans must  understand that Africa can never be understood as a homogeneous  mass. This would be as if one were to declare Bosnia a  typically European phenomenon.     "

He  disclosed that a delegation of central bankers had recently  visited Hong Kong in search of investment.    Last year, Hong Kong exported $2.44 billion worth of goods  to  Russia, most of them re-exports. Imports were a relatively  paltry $706.93 million.    Poland is the first country in the former East Bloc that has  diplomatic representation in the territory.

At stake is the fate of a continent battling for economic recovery against mounting odds. Over the past handful of years, the old order has collapsed, or is on its last legs. Apartheid has crumbled. Dictators have been overthrown, democracy sought, and state-controlled economies have succumbed to the market. As the world itself changed, African presidents lost the patronage of Moscow and Washington, and donors demanded 'good governance' from previously tolerated corrupt or mismanaged regimes. From Lagos to Lusaka, the mood of the continent has altered dramatically as Africa has entered a new era. Africans have fewer inhibitions about criticising their governments, and they speak out more confidently for human rights and against corruption. Above all, they debate what is critical to their future: structural adjustment - as powerful in its impact as any ideology the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have adopted. Drawn up by the World Bank, endorsed by other official donors and the IMF, criticised by many non-government organisations, and often bitterly attacked within the region itself, it shapes the lives of more than 600m Africans. Yet some 10 years after its inception, the results are modest. As articles elsewhere in this survey suggest, the business environment in Africa has changed for the better. But in its crucial forthcoming review of adjustment in Africa, provisionally entitled Progress, Payoffs and Challenges, the Bank is expected to warn that progress falls short of expectations. Implementation by governments has been weak, the obstacles formidable, the time required longer than expected, the results modest, and elements of the programme flawed. The report is guarded in its conclusions. But the insights it provides, together with the experiences of FT writers on the ground, point to a sombre conclusion: structural adjustment, while essential to Africa's recovery, is not sufficient. The African crisis is outpacing efforts to resolve it. For millions in the region, the new era is associated with pain. Factories have been closed, food subsidies eliminated, social services cut, as governments seek to live within their means. The poor are the first to suffer. 'Structural maladjustment is even more painful than adjustment,' observes Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's long-serving finance minister. He is sympathetic to their plight, but that is scant comfort. Even in the most successful of the 30 or so countries in various stages of structural adjustment, relief is modest and the road ahead long and arduous. At present growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. The less successful have longer to wait: 'With today's poor policies it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid 70s', says a Bank official. In the meantime, Africa is being left far behind by countries which have made better use of their resources and compete more vigorously for capital. In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Equally striking is Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. 'Can Africa's decline be reversed?' asked the Bank in its last important study of the continent's plight: 'The simple answer is yes. It can be and it must be. The alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.' Four years later, the region remains racked by disease, disaster and debt: the question becomes more compelling, the alternative creeps closer. The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Today, more people in Africa are poorer, and more children are dying. Other signs of stress are apparent, beginning with the distressing list of countries that have effectively ceased to function as modern nation states: Zaire, Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, Angola. Hopes raised by the end of the war in Ethiopia, the peace agreement in Mozambique, and a fragile peace pact in Liberia, are offset by renewed civil war in Angola and Nigeria's steady decline, and strife in Sierra Leone and Rwanda. Former 'success' stories and 'role models' in the 1970s have since become cautionary tales. Kenya struggles to implement economic reforms which erode the patronage on which the ruling Kanu party has been so dependent. Cote d'Ivoire moves deeper into difficulties that cannot be addressed until the CFA franc is devalued, an obstacle that holds up effective economic reform in the 13-member CFA bloc. The collapse of the settlement in Angola and continuing violence in South Africa raise doubts about whether, in the short term at least, southern Africa can be the engine-room for regional growth. Most disturbing of all, perhaps, is the concern that Africa no longer has the adequate institutional capacity to help itself. The technological gap between Africa and the world has widened, and the continent's management is weak. Many schools and universities are without teaching materials. Civil services have been neglected or politicised. The integrity of the judiciary has been eroded. Meanwhile, Aids takes its terrible toll. More than half of the world's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans. An estimated 14m will be infected by 2000; many are from the skilled urban class on which the implementation of reform greatly depends. Hopes that the emergence of multi-party politics would prove a simple stepping stone to good governance have proved premature. Opposition parties have turned out to be weak, fractious and susceptible to patronage, owing more to ethnicity than policy for their support. For the industrialised world, the will to help may emerge only when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat to self-interest, in the form of immigration to southern Europe, or a rise in Moslem extremism, growth in drug-trafficking or health risks posed by a continent that cannot be ring-fenced; or when it is stimulated by the loss of flora and fauna with medicinal value, or environmental concerns. Self-interest or humanitarian imperative, Unicef's poignant warning is timely: 'The abandonment of hopes for the continent would mean the writing off of the talents, aspirations and potential of one eighth of mankind, both now and far into the next century.' From Africa must come a new generation of leaders, committed to reform, and tapping the same spirit that brought freedom 30 years ago. Angered by the failures of corrupt and autocratic leaders, frustrated by economic policies that did not deliver, impatient to recover their lost civil rights, and worn out by wars, Africa's people are striving for a fresh start.

Doukoure Amadou reports:    [Begin recording] [Amadou] It was the former executive  secretary of the Economic Community of West African States  [ECOWAS] and presently foreign minister of his country, Sierra  Leone, who was the last foreign personality to bid farewell to  President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday at 2100. After the  audience, Abbas Bundu stated that he had been sent by Captain  Valentine Strasser to attend late President Houphouet-Boigny's  funeral and then congratulate President Henri Konan Bedie on his  assumption of office of president.    [Bundu, in English fading into French translation] First and  foremost, I was asked by my head of state, Capt. Valentine  Strasser, to bring greetings to His Excellency President Bedie,  to renew the felicitations conveyed to him on his assumption of  the office of president of this great country. My president  also asked me to convey to the government and people of Cote  d'Ivoire, the condolences of the government and people of Sierra  Leone on the death of Houphouet-Boigny. The Sierra Leonean  people join the Ivorian people in sharing the pain inflicted by  the death of the late president. I was also charged with  informing the president concerning what is happening in the  subregion. Last November, the war had almost ended in Sierra  Leone, so the government decided to decree a unilateral  cease-fire and grant amnesty to the rebels.    Thus, a cease fire came into effect on 1 December, which was  to last 30 days. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the  war effort, the war intensified. The rebels took the  opportunity to replenish and strengthen their positions by  receiving arms from Charles Taylor of Liberia.    [Amadou] A few hours earlier, President Henri Konan Bedie  had granted another audience, this one with the secretary  general of the OAU. President Bedie discussed the upcoming OAU  summit, which will take place in Tunis in June, with Salim Ahmed  Salim.    [Salim, in English fading into French translation] The  president and myself discussed the heritage left by President  Houphouet-Boigny, not only to Cote d'Ivoire, but also to Africa  as a whole and the possibility of continuing this struggle which  President Houphouet began -- the struggle to improve the  continent's economic situation, the fight to resolve conflicts  in Africa, and the fight to maintain the dignity of our people.    [Amadou] Is there already an idea of the major issues to be  discussed at the Tunis summit?    [Salim] By the time of the summit, the elections scheduled  for South Africa will have already taken place. So there willl  be a new government in South Africa and it is most likely that  South Africa will become a member of the continental  organization at this summit. So the issue of decolonization and  apartheid in Africa will be over.    We shall then have to focus attention on issues of economic  development, economic integration, and issues relating to the  African Economic Community. We shall discuss what should be  done concerning inter-African cooperation, subregional  cooperation, and also we shall discuss the issues of stability  and security -- since we cannot speak of economic development  within an environment of chaos and anarchy.    [Amadou] Both audiences took place in the presence of the  Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. [end recording]     "
0,FT944-17976 ,"FT944-17976 _AN-EJED5AG6FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (13): Fresh hope for Afro-optimists - Analysis / Afro-optimists hope that a thriving post-apartheid South Africa will be the engine of growth that will haul the ailing economies of the region out of their protracted slump      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor   In spite of the optimism over the long-term trade prospects for South Africa, Afro-pessimists point to the enormity of the challenge facing the region. African countries' GDP growth last year (excluding South Africa) was 1.4 per cent, according to the 1994 World Bank annual report - better than 1992, but still well below the region's population growth rate. Whatever the outcome, no one under-estimates South Africa's dominant role in the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, strikingly illustrated by one yardstick: export credit guarantees extended to Pretoria, since Nelson Mandela's inauguration, exceed the total cover available to other countries in the region. Whether trade opportunities are indeed going to pick up north of the Limpopo depends on which analysts you believe; and the analysts assessment may well be influenced by what they wish to sell. For brokers extolling the merits of the dozen or so investment funds which have identified Africa as an emerging market whose time has come, prospects seem almost rosy. 'Out of the starting blocks' reads the caption on the cover of a bullish analysis of sub-Saharan stock markets published last month.* Vast commodity reserves and low cost production, privatisation getting under way, and the easing or lifting of foreign exchange controls are features noted elsewhere in the report. But before the exporter to Africa sends out a sales team, a distinctly more cautious comment should be taken into account. 'Small markets with low growth rates, poor infrastructure, high indebtedness, slow progress in introducing market and private sector orientated economic reforms, and low levels of technological capabilities, all reduce the attractiveness of many African countries to foreign investors,' says the recent 1994 World Investment Report.** Neither the stock market nor foreign investment level are in themselves adequate guide to the state of the African market: as much as half of the region's imports may be aid financed, and aid flows have been rising. But the comments of the Investment Report may serve as a useful indicator, for higher levels of foreign investment are essential to Africa's economic recovery. Despite the reforms that got under way in many African countries during the 1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows did not increase between the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, notes the report. Averaging around Dollars 3bn a year, FDI flows to the entire region were considerably less than those received by Malaysia in the early 1990s, it points out. Inflows are concentrated in oil exporting countries, notably Egypt, Angola and Nigeria. Although the total value of FDI flows into Africa nearly doubled from an annual average of Dollars 1.7bn during 1981-85, to an average of almost Dollars 3bn during 1986-90, says the study, those investments were concentrated in few countries, and modest when compared to FDI flows to other regions of the developing world. Average annual FDI flows into Africa as a proportion of all inflows in developing countries declined between these two periods from 13 per cent to 11 per cent. Worse was to come. Flows stagnated in the early 1990s to many African countries, while flows to other developing countries continued to increase. 'As a result, Africa's share decined further to 6 per cent by 1992, thus underlining the marginalisation of that continent in relation to FDI, apart from its marginalisation in relation to international trade.' Africa's reforms may have got it out of the starting blocks, but it has several laps to go, it seems, before it breasts the finishing tape. *Sub Saharan Stock Markets, Baring Securities; tel (44)-71-522-6707. **World Investment Report, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, (Unctad).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FLOWS INTO AFRICA              1981-1992, (billions of dollars and percentage)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Region/country                                1981-1985    1986-1990     1991   1992                                    Annual average  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa                            1.7          2.8         2.7    3.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa's share in: (%) All countries                     3.4          1.8         1.7    1.9 Developing countries             12.9         11.4         7.0    5.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil-exporting countries*          1.4          2.1         1.8    2.2 Egypt                             0.7          1.1         0.3    0.5 Nigeria                           0.4          0.7         0.7    0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other countries                   0.3         0.82         0.9    0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nigeria and Tunisia; 2 Figure is inflated by unusually high investment in Liberia in 1988-1990 (Dollars 290m, Dollars 656m and Dollars 225m, respectively), most likely in flags-of-convenience facilities.

A ban on trade, services and investments, implemented in 1986 and 1987, would be lifted from March 15 but an embargo on sales of oil and weapons would be upheld. Norway's exports to South Africa, comprising mainly iron ore, fish, fish products and mechanical equipment, fell to NKr56.2m (Pounds 5.6m) in 1987, after sanctions were implemented, from NKr348.3m in 1986. Norway said the time had come to introduce new political instruments to promote democracy in South Africa; it had formulated a five-point programme to provide assistance during the transition. Meanwhile the Swedish government said yesterday it hoped to lift sanctions against South Africa within a few weeks, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said: 'It is a matter of weeks', but he stressed removal of sanctions would be conditional on continuing democratic reforms in South Africa. Sweden banned investments in South Africa in 1979 and imposed a ban on trade in 1987.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT921-15895 ,"FT921-15895 _AN-CAHBJAAGFT 920108   FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (7): Little interest from abroad - Investment, Unemployment problem sits on the horizon      By TONY HAWKINS   IF KENYA is to avoid a serious unemployment problem later in the decade, it will have to invest a good deal more and make that investment more productive. By sub-Saharan standards its recent investment record is relatively good, with fixed investment (ignoring inventories) averaging almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product. The capital output ratio has been close to four - implying that Kenya has to invest Dollars 4m to obtain a Dollars 1m increase in output. This means that to grow at 5 per cent a year, Kenya must invest four times that - approximately 20 per cent of GDP. Unfortunately, 5 per cent growth is inadequate, given Kenya's population growth rate and age profile, so that a 20 per cent investment ratio is just not good enough. The country's capacity to maintain investment at current levels depends heavily on foreign funding. Not on foreign direct investment, which averaged Dollars 30m annually during the 1980s, but on aid grants and loans. Domestic savings, as a share of GDP, have declined in recent years, partly because of the government deficit. The result has been that between one-fifth and a quarter of total investment is funded from abroad and in a world short of capital, this is a precarious situation. The Kenyan response - like that in many other African countries - has been to promote private investment by establishing an Investment Promotion Centre, seeking to create an enabling environment to foster private entrepreneurship, and establishing export processing and manufacturing-under-bond zones. However, foreign investors are staying away, which is hardly surprising given the two-year dividend remittance pipeline. Rapid exchange rate depreciation compounds the problem: a KPounds 17.8m dividend was worth Dollars 1m in 1988, but by the time it could be remitted in 1990, it had depreciated to Dollars 775,000, thereby sharply lowering the foreign shareholder's return on his investment. Nor has foreign investor sentiment been helped by Kenya's poor international media image. The IPC, established in 1982 as a department within the Ministry of Finance, was converted to an autonomous parastatal five years ago, charged with promoting foreign and domestic investment, acting as a one-stop-shop for investors, and advising government on policy reforms needed to increase investment. Officials insist the centre's chief task is promotional - to attract and motivate investors and then help them through the labyrinth of Kenya's tangled, overlapping bureaucracy. They have been instructed to get a project fully approved within a month, but acknowledge that it takes five to six weeks. Businessmen say it takes longer, pointing out that even when the IPC has obtained its basic approvals from the relevant government departments and the central bank (where applicable), there are often other licences and permits to be obtained - work permits, and trade and import licences. The IPC has processed more than 229 applications since 1988, resulting in project approvals totalling some Dollars 350m, and creating 23,200 jobs. Not all approvals are actually translated into projects, and an IPC list of 123 approvals shows that less than one-third are operational. Another third has been approved, but these are held up because the promoters have yet to raise the necessary capital or are looking for a joint-venture partner. A handful have been rejected including one submitted by Colgate Palmolive, while eight projects cannot go ahead until suitable land is made available. Ten of the 120 were abandoned after being approved, while the remaining 20 are under construction or awaiting the arrival of imported machinery. Most of the 35 operational projects are small, representing a total investment of less than Dollars 30m. Particularly disconcerting is that only about 10 per cent of the project list is expected to generate foreign currency, though there could, be significant import savings. The list is far from complete since investors are not obliged to go through the IPC, although they are advised to do so. One official estimates that as much as 30 per cent of new projects bypass the centre. The IPC hopes to expand its activities abroad in the next few years, opening a second European office - it has one in Zurich - as well as establishing a presence in the Asia Pacific region and the US. The slow response is not surprising, given that less than 2 per cent of global foreign direct investment goes to Africa. Kenya does not offer a package of attractive investment incentives - except in the EPZs. Non-EPZ investment qualifies for export compensation for non-traditional and manufactured exports, import tax and VAT exemptions on imported plant and equipment and tax breaks on investment in plant and machinery. Foreign investment is guaranteed against expropriation, and while dividends, profits and royalties are freely remittable, there is a two-year queue which has encouraged some companies to reinvest. Kenya is a signatory to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Miga), and has signed the US Overseas Private Investment Corp (Opic) agreement. The EPZ package is far more attractive - a 10-year tax holiday, followed by a 25 per cent rate of corporate tax, exemption from exchange controls, and no withholding taxes on dividends. The IPC's belief that there are attractive opportunities in agro-processing, horticulture and tourism is well-founded, though there are very real environmental and crowding-out constraints on tourism, while international competition in horticulture is increasing rapidly. Whether Kenya can attract investment in electronics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, engineering and vehicle components is more problematic. With the declining importance of low-skilled labour in many manufacturing activities, Kenya does not have much to offer by way of competitive advantage. Its best hope perhaps is as Africa's third growth pole - after South Africa and Nigeria - exploiting its geographical position as the hub of the east African market. But that is not a large market by international standards, and not big enough to yield the scale economies so essential to profitable manufacturing and export in many industries today.

By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South Africa threatened Saturday to expel a large U.N. peacekeeping force on  its first day of work in Namibia after charging that guerrillas entering from  Angola had clashed with Namibian police as a formal cease-fire went into  effect, leaving 38 insurgents and two police officers dead.    Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, called the clash a  ""flagrant violation"" of international agreements. He said that if the U.N.  secretary general did not issue a clear statement on the matter, South Africa  would ask U.N. peacekeepers to leave until the South-West Africa People's  Organization (SWAPO), which has fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South  African control, ""can be brought to its senses.""    Despite Botha's threat, it was considered unlikely that South Africa would  expel the U.N. team that is here to oversee Namibia's transition to  independence because that would wreck the entire process and allow Cuba to  renege on its agreement to withdraw its troops from neighboring Angola.    SWAPO officials declined to comment Saturday, saying they needed more  information about the incidents before answering South Africa's charges.    The U.N. special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he would  send a four-member team to the area of the clashes, about 400 miles north of  Windhoek, today. Ahtisaari considered them ""a very serious development,""  according to a U.N. spokesman.    ""We need to go up there and find out for ourselves"" what happened, said  Frederic Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Eckhard  added that ""it's safe to say"" that U.N. peacekeeping forces were not involved.    Statements issued by Botha and Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator  in charge of Namibia, cited three separate incidents along 120 miles of the  Namibia-Angola border, beginning before the cease-fire went into effect at 6  a.m. local time Saturday. They said a group of 40 to 50 armed men entered  Namibia near Ruacana, a second group of about 50 entered near Oshikango and a  third group was encountered halfway between the two cities.      Accused of Atrocities    Security police sources in northern Namibia told The Times that the incursions  were repelled by units of Koevoet, a counterinsurgency unit of 3,000 black  Namibians under the command of white South Africans. The unit, which has been  accused of widespread atrocities, was recently returned to normal police work  and incorporated into Namibia's police force.    The sources could not confirm the number killed in the attacks but said two  alleged SWAPO guerrillas had been captured and others were being sought late  Saturday night. Botha said 14 police officers were injured.    Botha did not specify what weapons were used by either side, but under the U.N.  peace plan Namibia's police were to begin carrying only pistols ""in the normal  performance of their duties.""      December Agreement    The incidents apparently marked the first serious clashes between SWAPO and  South African-backed Namibian authorities since South Africa, Cuba and Angola  signed an agreement in December that paved the way for Namibia's independence  and the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern  neighbor.    Under a U.N. plan intended to lead to free and fair elections here in November,  both SWAPO and the South African Defense Force were restricted to their bases  beginning on Saturday. Most of SWAPO's bases are in southern Angola.    South Africa is conducting the transition to Namibian independence, but its  actions are subject to the approval of the United Nations, which, at peak  periods, will have a team of about 7,000 soldiers, police and administrators to  monitor the process. SWAPO, with strong support among residents of the most  populous northern region, is favored to win the elections.    In Windhoek's black township of Katutura on Saturday, tens of thousands of  Namibians donned the bright colors of their political parties to try out their  new freedom and begin campaigning to govern Africa's last colony.    Police stopped several thousand trade unionists as they began a march from the  township to Windhoek to protest a move to sell Namibian enterprises to private  investors. The group dispersed without incident.      Jubilant Crowds    Namibia's two major political parties -- the Marxist-oriented, predominantly  black SWAPO and the capitalist, multiracial Democratic Turnhalle Alliance --  drew jubilant, singing crowds of about 5,000 each to rallies less than two  miles apart. The country's first unfettered political campaigning, conducted  under a hot sun, was generally peaceful.    Namibia is a mostly desert territory twice the size of California on the  southwest coast of Africa. Its population of 1.5 million is overwhelmingly  black, and more than half live in the northern Ovambo province, the seat of  SWAPO support.    Tens of thousands of SWAPO guerrillas have been killed since 1965, when the  group launched its war with South Africa, which has controlled this territory  for 74 years -- the last 20 years in defiance of the United Nations.    Until recently, South Africa had questioned the United Nations' impartiality in  Namibia because the international body had once declared SWAPO the ""sole and  authentic"" representative of the people of Namibia.    The United Nations currently has only about 1,000 peacekeeping troops in the  country, and U.N. officials say the full force of 4,650 troops will not arrive  until May 1.    The troop deployment was delayed by haggling at the United Nations earlier this  year over the cost of the mission. To cut the cost, now set at $461 million,  the United States and the Soviet Union reduced -- to 4,650 from the originally  planned 6,000 -- the number of troops for Namibia's transition to independence  and black majority rule.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on a one-day visit to Namibia, said  Saturday the border incidents were ""a most serious challenge"" to the Namibian  peace process and she called for a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council  to discuss the matter.      NEW ERA FOR NAMIBIA     Saturday marked the start of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, which has  administered the huge, sparsely populated territory since World War I. Hours  before the transition began, South Africa reported major clashes with  guerrillas in northern Namibia near Ruacana and Oshikango. Provisions of the  plan:     April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of 7,000-member U.N.  Transition Assistance Group that will oversee transition. South African troops  in Namibia and guerrillas of South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO),  based in neighboring Angola, are confined to bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is to be disbanded; South Africa is to  reduce its troops to 12,000. South African administrator Louis Pienaar is to  publish election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners to be freed; Namibian exiles to return.    July 1 -- South Africa's forces to be cut to 1,500; election campaigning to  begin.    Oct. 31 -- Half of Cuba's 50,000 troops are to have left Angola; rest are to  withdraw north of 13th Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections are to be held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered  to approve constitution for independent Namibia -- the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops are to leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate is to end.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans are to withdraw last troops.

AFRICA THREAT TO U.N.      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South Africa threatened Saturday to expel a large U.N. peacekeeping force on  its first day of work in Namibia after charging that guerrillas entering from  Angola had clashed with Namibian police as a formal cease-fire went into  effect, leaving 38 insurgents and two police officers dead.    Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, called the clash a  ""flagrant violation"" of international agreements. He said that if the U.N.  secretary general did not issue a clear statement on the matter, South Africa  would ask U.N. peacekeepers to leave until the South-West Africa People's  Organization (SWAPO), which has fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South  African control, ""can be brought to its senses.""    Despite Botha's threat, it was considered unlikely that South Africa would  expel the U.N. team that is here to oversee Namibia's transition to  independence because that would wreck the entire process and allow Cuba to  renege on its agreement to withdraw its troops from neighboring Angola.    SWAPO officials declined to comment Saturday, saying they needed more  information about the incidents before answering South Africa's charges.    The U.N. special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he would  send a four-member team to the area of the clashes, about 400 miles north of  Windhoek, today. Ahtisaari considered them ""a very serious development,""  according to a U.N. spokesman.    ""We need to go up there and find out for ourselves"" what happened, said  Frederic Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Eckhard  added that ""it's safe to say"" that U.N. peacekeeping forces were not involved.    Statements issued by Botha and Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator  in charge of Namibia, cited three separate incidents along 120 miles of the  Namibia-Angola border, beginning before the cease-fire went into effect at 6  a.m. local time Saturday. They said a group of 40 to 50 armed men entered  Namibia near Ruacana, a second group of about 50 entered near Oshikango and a  third group was encountered halfway between the two cities.      Accused of Atrocities    Security police sources in northern Namibia told The Times that the incursions  were repelled by units of Koevoet, a counterinsurgency unit of 3,000 black  Namibians under the command of white South Africans. The unit, which has been  accused of widespread atrocities, was recently returned to normal police work  and incorporated into Namibia's police force.    The sources could not confirm the number killed in the attacks but said two  alleged SWAPO guerrillas had been captured and others were being sought late  Saturday night. Botha said 14 police officers were injured.    Botha did not specify what weapons were used by either side, but under the U.N.  peace plan Namibia's police were to begin carrying only pistols ""in the normal  performance of their duties.""

The goodwill visit will also help boost Britain's chances of  selling military hardware as naval equipment is high on the  South Africans' shopping-list.    HMS Norfolk, the first of the Navy's most up-to-date Type 23  frigates, and its support vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Grey  Rover will visit Cape Town and Simonstown from January 27 to 31.    The visit follows an invitation by the chief of the South  African Navy, Vice-Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson.    A United Nations ban on military contacts with South Africa  was lifted last October, reflecting the government's commitment  to end white rule.    And it is expected that sanctions preventing the sale of  military equipment to South Africa will be lifted following  elections in April.    UK Defence ministers and officials have been holding  discussions with the South African government and the ANC  [African National Congress] in preparation for the lifting of  the embargo.    The British government and defence industry can see  significant opportunities for sales of military equipment.    There is keen interest in buying naval equipment including  offshore patrol craft, maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters  because of concern about piracy around the South African coast.     "

0,FT944-17977 ,"FT944-17977 _AN-EJED5AG5FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (14): New initiatives in South Africa - Regional focus / A rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia      By MARK SUZMAN   As a glance through Johannesburg's leading business newspaper, Business Day, demonstrates, South Africa's days as a trade pariah are well and truly over. The pages are filled with news of new trade conferences, expos from all manner of countries, and a steady stream of high level ministerial visits - including two trips by America's Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown; visits from both British prime minister John Major; and the president of the British Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine - to try and boost international trade links. Reflecting the country's return to favour as a trading partner, there has been a substantial rise in the number of international institutions willing to provide trade finance for South African transactions and of governments giving export credit guarantees. Britain has been at the forefront of these new initiatives, and Mr Major announced a trade guarantee package of over R1bn during his recent visit, a move which makes South Africa one of the biggest markets for the UK's export credit guarantee programme. However, other countries have also been involved, with both Japan and the US announcing new packages and the European Union agreeing to grant South Africa GSP status from next January (although some key goods such as processed fruit and paper products will not be covered under the agreement following French pressure). And given South Africa's excellent payments record, the risks are relatively small. Another particularly interesting development is the rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia. Trade delegations have been arriving from places as diverse as Nigeria, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. As a result, trade with these countries has been growing very rapidly over the past 12 months, albeit off a very low base, and businessmen on both sides are confident that these links will continue to expand. The new interest has been clearly signalled in South Africa's trade figures for the year, and its import bill has been soaring. In the first six months of the year, merchandise imports rose 21 per cent from 1993's levels and in August alone, they rocketed up by 20.8 per cent to a high of R8.07bn for the month. Also contributing to the surge is the desperate need by South African companies to modernise plant and equipment. After having let fixed investment decline to dangerously low levels during the crippling four-year recession that ended last year, many companies are now embarking on long-delayed capital spending, and machinery has accounted for nearly half of all imports. Given that South Africa has a notoriously high propensity to import during times of economic growth, this move may soon send the trade account into deficit. Indeed, the IBCA, the European ratings agency that recently gave South Africa a sub-investment grade rating of BB, cited this is one of the problems with the South African economy. Such an event is made even more likely by the government's declared commitment to start lowering import tariffs in line with the Gatt agreement, a process that began in July with the announcement that duties on motor cars would be reduced. However, despite this, South Africa continues to run a trade surplus, expected to be around R10bn on the year, and although import growth has far outstripped the rise in exports, the country's businessmen are confident that the tide will soon start to turn. South Africa's remains overwhelmingly dependent on mineral exports, particularly gold, but given the fact that the commodity cycle appears to have bottomed out and in light of the continued depreciation of the Rand, the mining industry is expecting a good year in 1995. The government's decision to start restructuring GEIS, South Africa's controversial R2bn a year export incentive scheme, which subsidises companies involved in manufacturing exports, may cause a short-term drop as companies are forced to cope with reduced government aid.

The ad is timed with Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota's visit  to  the U.S., starting Thursday, to press the White House and the  Pentagon on the issue. Ota said in the ad that his past two  visits to the U.S. to seek a solution to the problems failed to  produce any concrete results.

In Washington he will hold  talks with State Department and Pentagon officials as well as  with members of the Senate and House of Representatives Armed  Services Committees.    Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are  concentrated in Okinawa, comprising a cluster of islands  northeast of Taiwan. The ad calls for the return of the U.S.  naval port in Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and  live-ammunition exercises.

He said the situation  is at a turning point after the Burmese government allowed  100-percent investment by the private sector instead of  assigning state enterprises to supervise operations as in the  past. Besides, he said the Burmese Government has a policy of  promoting foreign investment, and has announced that foreigners  can lease from 12,500 to 75,000 rai of land for business  operations for up to 30 years unconditionally.    Reporting on foreign investment, Wirasak said Singapore tops  the list with investment capital worth U.S. $240 million. The  United States ranks second with U.S. $210 million. South Korea  ranks third at U.S. $90 million; Thailand fourth at U.S. $70  million; the United Kingdom fifth at U.S. $60 million; and Japan  sixth at U.S. $50 million. Thailand leads other countries,  however, in fishing and logging sectors. Anyway, the Burmese  Government has finally enacted a law banning logging by private  companies and prohibiting log exports from the country. Burma  has also banned exports of marine life. It has encouraged  foreigners to set up sawmills, furniture, and plywood factories.    The ambassador said the Burmese Government has opened  bidding  for five plywood factories. More than 30 foreign companies,  including those from Thailand, tendered for concessions.  Singapore and Korean companies won the bidding for plywood  factories. Thai companies have won bids to open furniture  factories. Wirasak said Thai businessmen should form groups to  better compete with other countries, especially in the hotel and  tourism sectors where Singapore is keen and has substantial  capital for investment. He said two Thai companies had won  concessions for tin and coal mining. The Phadaeng Group, Loxley,  and Siam Cement Group are considering investment or joint  investment in other businesses.     "
0," FR940505-1-00079   FR940505-1-00012            Methods recommended for promoting aerobic decomposition of   livestock waste include: aerating manure storage piles every   three to seven days; scraping feedlots at least three times per   year; and spreading oxidizing agents on feedlots. For waste   management practices using a dry method, the proposed FIP measure   will require the periodic aeration and removal of manure storage   piles. This measure is estimated to reduce VOC emissions by 25   percent.   Methane recovery and utilization systems are considered a   potential control method for reducing VOC and methane emissions.   Methane is considered an important greenhouse gas and also a   potential energy source. Depending on the size of the livestock   waste operation, methane recovery systems can pay for themselves   over time and result in cost savings for large-scale dairy   operations. Methane recovery systems are currently operating at   23 sites in the U.S., including at a swine facility near Tulare,   CA and a dairy near Modesto, CA. Near Chino, CA, a recovery   system is under development which would process an estimated   2,500 tpd of cattle waste and 600 tpd of chicken waste.   Technologies for methane recovery include covered lagoons, plug   flow digesters, and complete mix digesters. Although these   recovery systems represent a viable, demonstrated technology,   some systems have not been as successful as expected because of   improper design or other factors. For these reasons, EPA requests   comment and information on any examples, circumstances, and/or   reasons why a previously installed recovery system may not have   achieved its full expectations.   The proposed FIP rule will require that at least 55 percent   of the manure generated be collected and managed through a   methane recovery system. These systems are estimated to reduce   emissions by 80 percent.   The technical and economic feasibility of this technology   depends on farm size, climate, and energy process. The off-gas   (i.e., methane) collected can be utilized in the dairy operation   for processes such as: electricity production (e.g., to fuel an   engine generator); heating (e.g., to fire boilers and/or space   heaters); and cooling (e.g., to fire chillers or other   refrigeration equipment). This in turn can create farm profits   from avoided energy costs or sales of excess electricity to the   local utility. Although methane recovery systems would require a   large initial investment, estimated annual costs range from $100   to $1,300 per year (for a 400 head dairy) to a cost savings of   $10,000 per year (for a 1,400 head dairy). The initial   investment could be recovered within six to fourteen years,   depending on dairy size.   The overall emission reductions from livestock waste   operations will depend on the percentage of waste which is   managed via the dry method (e.g., placed in storage piles)   compared to the handled through a wet method (e.g., sent to the   covered lagoon or digester). For purposes of the FIP reduction   estimates, it is assumed that a minimum of 55 percent of the   livestock waste would be sent to a lagoon or digester. Assuming   that a hypothetical dairy farm would install a recovery system   for liquid management and use the dry method for the remaining   fraction of the wastes not sent to the recovery system, overall   expected cost per ton of VOC reduced is estimated to range from   about $2,100 per ton for a 400 head dairy to a $400 (cost) to   $100 (savings) per ton for a 1,450 head dairy.   Preliminary evaluation of the environmental, economic, and   other impacts of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's   technical support document. VOC Emission reductions expected   from this proposed regulation are estimated at 1.0 tpd in the   Sacramento area and 6.0 tpd in the South Coast. No reductions   are expected in Ventura County because all livestock waste   operations are believed to be less than 200 head. Additional   reductions could be achieved if the requirements were extended to   smaller livestock waste operations, such as 250 head or greater.  EPA is requesting comments and information on a number of   issues related to this proposed measure. Comments are requested   on the proposed FIP requirements and/or other potential emission   reduction strategies not addressed in the proposal. Because each   dairy operation is unique and can vary in its waste management   practices, comments are specifically requested on alternative   emission reduction methods and/or more cost effective strategies   which might achieve equivalent results to those proposed.   EPA also requests comments and information on the number of   dairy farms in the FIP areas which contain at least 400 head and   the percentage of dairy farms which manage at least 55 percent of   the livestock waste through a wet method. Because the emission   factors used to estimate VOC emissions from these sources should   be updated, EPA intends to explore options for additional testing   to verify that VOC emission factors accurately reflect emissions   expected from both wet and dry waste management methods.

The proposed rule builds upon current regulations and   strengthens and improves existing rules through retrofits on gas-operated control valves, lower allowable leak thresholds,   correction of rule deficiencies, and improved inspection and   repair programs. The proposed regulation is based on: CARB RACT   guidance for the control of fugitive emissions of VOCs from oil   and gas production and processing facilities, refineries,   chemical plants, and pipeline transfer stations; Santa Barbara   APCD Rule 331; SCAQMD Rule 1173; and new information regarding   gas-operated control valves.   Currently, gas-operated control valves are not regulated in   the FIP areas. These valves are designed to bleed upon   actuation, resulting in the release of uncontrolled VOC   emissions. The proposed FIP rule would require that these valves   be retrofitted using a control valve which would reduce gas bleed   emissions by an estimated 95 percent. EPA has estimated a   California population of 10,000 gas-operated control valves and   assumed that these valves are evenly distributed throughout the   state. EPA has also assumed that the control valves are only   used in natural gas conveyance and petroleum production.   Comments are specifically requested on the number of gas-operated   control valves in the FIP areas and whether these valves are used   in other operations besides those described above.   The proposed FIP rule will establish a fugitives regulation   for oil and gas production and conveying stations within the   Sacramento FIP area. Previously, these fugitive sources were   unregulated. The majority of expected reductions will be from   the Yolo-Solano portion of the FIP area. In the Ventura FIP   area, the rule builds upon requirements in VCAPCD Rule 74.10 and   lower the number of allowable leaking components and leak   definition to requirements consistent with existing rules and   CARB's RACT guidance.        "," FR940505-1-00079   FR940505-1-00012            Methods recommended for promoting aerobic decomposition of   livestock waste include: aerating manure storage piles every   three to seven days; scraping feedlots at least three times per   year; and spreading oxidizing agents on feedlots. For waste   management practices using a dry method, the proposed FIP measure   will require the periodic aeration and removal of manure storage   piles. This measure is estimated to reduce VOC emissions by 25   percent.   Methane recovery and utilization systems are considered a   potential control method for reducing VOC and methane emissions.   Methane is considered an important greenhouse gas and also a   potential energy source. Depending on the size of the livestock   waste operation, methane recovery systems can pay for themselves   over time and result in cost savings for large-scale dairy   operations. Methane recovery systems are currently operating at   23 sites in the U.S., including at a swine facility near Tulare,   CA and a dairy near Modesto, CA. Near Chino, CA, a recovery   system is under development which would process an estimated   2,500 tpd of cattle waste and 600 tpd of chicken waste.   Technologies for methane recovery include covered lagoons, plug   flow digesters, and complete mix digesters. Although these   recovery systems represent a viable, demonstrated technology,   some systems have not been as successful as expected because of   improper design or other factors. For these reasons, EPA requests   comment and information on any examples, circumstances, and/or   reasons why a previously installed recovery system may not have   achieved its full expectations.   The proposed FIP rule will require that at least 55 percent   of the manure generated be collected and managed through a   methane recovery system. These systems are estimated to reduce   emissions by 80 percent.   The technical and economic feasibility of this technology   depends on farm size, climate, and energy process. The off-gas   (i.e., methane) collected can be utilized in the dairy operation   for processes such as: electricity production (e.g., to fuel an   engine generator); heating (e.g., to fire boilers and/or space   heaters); and cooling (e.g., to fire chillers or other   refrigeration equipment). This in turn can create farm profits   from avoided energy costs or sales of excess electricity to the   local utility. Although methane recovery systems would require a   large initial investment, estimated annual costs range from $100   to $1,300 per year (for a 400 head dairy) to a cost savings of   $10,000 per year (for a 1,400 head dairy). The initial   investment could be recovered within six to fourteen years,   depending on dairy size.   The overall emission reductions from livestock waste   operations will depend on the percentage of waste which is   managed via the dry method (e.g., placed in storage piles)   compared to the handled through a wet method (e.g., sent to the   covered lagoon or digester). For purposes of the FIP reduction   estimates, it is assumed that a minimum of 55 percent of the   livestock waste would be sent to a lagoon or digester. Assuming   that a hypothetical dairy farm would install a recovery system   for liquid management and use the dry method for the remaining   fraction of the wastes not sent to the recovery system, overall   expected cost per ton of VOC reduced is estimated to range from   about $2,100 per ton for a 400 head dairy to a $400 (cost) to   $100 (savings) per ton for a 1,450 head dairy.   Preliminary evaluation of the environmental, economic, and   other impacts of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's   technical support document. VOC Emission reductions expected   from this proposed regulation are estimated at 1.0 tpd in the   Sacramento area and 6.0 tpd in the South Coast. No reductions   are expected in Ventura County because all livestock waste   operations are believed to be less than 200 head. Additional   reductions could be achieved if the requirements were extended to   smaller livestock waste operations, such as 250 head or greater.  EPA is requesting comments and information on a number of   issues related to this proposed measure. Comments are requested   on the proposed FIP requirements and/or other potential emission   reduction strategies not addressed in the proposal. Because each   dairy operation is unique and can vary in its waste management   practices, comments are specifically requested on alternative   emission reduction methods and/or more cost effective strategies   which might achieve equivalent results to those proposed.   EPA also requests comments and information on the number of   dairy farms in the FIP areas which contain at least 400 head and   the percentage of dairy farms which manage at least 55 percent of   the livestock waste through a wet method. Because the emission   factors used to estimate VOC emissions from these sources should   be updated, EPA intends to explore options for additional testing   to verify that VOC emission factors accurately reflect emissions   expected from both wet and dry waste management methods.

0,FT934-15493 ,"FT934-15493 _AN-DJLB5AA9FT 931012   FT  12 OCT 93 / S Africa open for business: A successful transition depends on the economy      By PHILIP GAWITH   MR Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, and the ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, are taking a joint message to the world: South Africa is back on the international stage, and it is united. Beneath this banner, the two men will be seeking foreign investment at a Confederation of British Industry conference in London today, in an effort to complete a reversal in economic fortunes which has gained momentum with the African National Congress's call for an end to economic sanctions and a new convergence between the ANC and the government on economic policy. The next step is the wooing of foreign investors, with the country needing foreign investment 'more than ever before', according to Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank. The urgency has come with a realisation that a successful political transition is going to depend on improving the dismal growth performance of recent years. The key issue is jobs. In its annual report the Reserve Bank estimates that the portion of the workforce unemployed, or involved in the informal sector of the economy, rose to 46 per cent in 1992, from 39 per cent in 1988. While some argue that this figure is overstated, none disputes that unemployment is a serious contributor to the high levels of violence in the country. Although a better agricultural season, a weaker rand and the mid-year flurry in the gold price should help the economy reverse three years of decline in 1993, there is widespread agreement that only restructuring will produce sustainable high growth. This will involve investing more and spending less, restoring investment as a percentage of GDP to something closer to 25 per cent than the low of 15.9 per cent reached in 1992. It will also require a substantially improved export performance. In the first flush of the post-sanctions era, the air has been positively thick with good will, especially abroad. Back at home, though, the going has been rougher, with the government embroiled in disputes about the issue of cellular telephone licences and a rise in the petrol price. Although the petrol dispute may yet drive the unions to mass action, economic policy is not the war zone it once was. These latest difficulties are much more a reflection of the transitional phase in which South Africa finds itself - in both cases the core objection of the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu is that they were not adequately consulted - than of serious policy differences. Indeed, the ANC has now turned to soliciting the foreign investor with fervour. In a series of appearances in the US last month, both Mr Mandela and Mr Trevor Manuel, the ANC's economics spokesman, went out of their way to persuade investors that not only would they be 'very, very welcome' (Manuel) in South Africa, but they would not have to fear 'radical policies' (Mandela). As Mr Keys told a Washington investor conference, the 'best move' South Africa's policymakers can make is to equip a government of national unity, which South Africa will have after next April's elections, with a 'credible and attractive' economic policy. He believes South Africa's chances of achieving this are 'very good' and cites four recent events as constituting important steps towards this goal. They are the renegotiation of foreign debt repayments; the revised tariff reduction offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks; the negotiation of an Dollars 850m (Pounds 563m) loan from the IMF; and agreement on how South Africa will work with the World Bank. Certainly, finalising the debt agreement, and renewing ties with the IMF - South Africa last accessed IMF facilities in 1982 - immeasurably improve the country's creditworthiness. The Gatt offer is also crucial to South Africa's hopes of improving economic growth. All of this is music in the ears of foreign investors hoping for a business-friendly future under a new government. But the past is not far below the surface. It is a source of wry comfort to businessmen that the ANC has now taken to justifying what it describes as anti-trust policy in terms of the 'efficiency of markets' rather than the whites simply having too much.  ------------------------------------------------------     SOUTH AFRICA: AN ECONOMY THAT IS FOCUSING MINDS  ------------------------------------------------------                                 1990    1991    1992  ------------------------------------------------------ GDP growth                      -0.5    -0.4    -2.1 Inflation                       14.4    15.3    13.9 Budget deficit as % of GDP*      0.6     2.5     4.2  ------------------------------------------------------ *For fiscal year ending March 31 Source: Department of Finance  ------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Speaking at an ANC fundraising  dinner in East London, he also said neither he nor ANC President  Nelson Mandela had accepted an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland].    He said the ANC had been looking forward to the meeting  which  was to have been held with the Zulu king this week but was  cancelled. ""As of now we have never received any proposal from  the Zulu king as to what he wants so we don't know what he wants  apart from what was reported in the newspapers.

Clearly, in legal, political and constitutional terms, and  in  ordinary reality there was no such thing as an independent  kwaZulu/Natal. The question of the secession of any part of  South Africa could not be decided on except through democratic  processes. ""Any matter that has to do with dismemberment of  South Africa in any way is a matter that would have to be  decided by the people of South Africa as a whole.""    He said the ANC had not agreed to a volkstaat. What it had  agreed was to continue discussions with what was now called the  Freedom Front on the idea of a volkstaat. ""To continue the  discussions and possibly conclude them before the elections,  we've agreed to that.""    A document agreed to by the ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Union] in September last year stipulated  that any solution to the volkstaat question would have to be  consistent with the principles of democracy and non-racialism.  The two sides had agreed that any further discussion on the  issue should be guided by these principles. ""So the proponents  of a volkstaat have an obligation to make proposals about a  (territory) that would be democratic, non-racial,  anti-apartheid, resulting in peace, absence of conflict and so  on. If a volkstaat consistent with these principles can be  proposed, I don't think the ANC will have a problem with it.""  However no such proposal had been made.

Only hours after Mr Mandela's call at the United Nations in New York, the US Senate approved legislation lifting US sanctions. Canada, Australia and the Commonwealth leadership said they would follow suit. Mr Mandela, urging that all economic sanctions against South Africa be lifted in an attempt to end the country's isolation, said victory against apartheid was in sight. Addressing a specially convened meeting of the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions drive over the past three decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all necessary measures to end the economic sanctions you imposed'. His plea came a day after South Africa's parliament approved the creation of a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council giving blacks a say in government for the first time. Mr Mandela called on the international investment community to 'help regenerate the South African economy'. He said steps should be taken to prevent South Africa becoming another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had brought it to the point 'where the transition to democracy has now been enshrined in the law of our country'. The passage of the South African legislation has been welcomed by President Bill Clinton as an 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives to help restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting South African access to the IMF and World Bank. Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period in which senior officials of the government and the ANC will be seeking to convince investors and donors that they should invest in South Africa. Mr Clinton later announced that the commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is to lead a trade and investment mission to South Africa to explore business opportunities, particularly with the black private sector.

It was found, for example, that anomalously large  shifts in the zone preceded anomalously warm winters in the  U.S., and anomalously small shifts preceded cold winters.  Low-frequency variability of sea surface temperature was  determined from 34 years of data. Data filtering and  normalization procedures are described. Low-frequency  variability of the surface temperature of the North Atlantic  demonstrates a significant spatial variability (up to 2ëC)  which is probably linked with the variability of ocean  circulation. Two types of remote links between the sea surface  temperature and meridional motion of the intertropical  convergence zone on interannual scales are found, and these  appear to be related to quasi-stable atmospheric anomalies. The  local interaction of ocean and atmosphere is probably dominant  in the generation of quasi-stable sea surface temperature  anomalies (as opposed to horizontal advective heat transfer by  ocean currents), but this conclusion requires further  confirmation.

The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign  minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth  Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy.    Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for  South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential,  but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council.    He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic  ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established  diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

AFRICA SALES      From Reuters      ORLANDO, Fla.      Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some  stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has  not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation.    While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an  official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions  that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales  of its petroleum products there.    ""If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break,"" said  Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office  of the comptroller.    Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to  General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the  largest U.S. employer in South Africa.      Tax Bite, Loss Cited    Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging  investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.    Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.

Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by  the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares  were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South  Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's  government.    Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by  Gencorp for as long as five years.    The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local  workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers  will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has  promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year.

""An honest exchange of disagreement,"" Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who  repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's  indirect ties with South Africa.    The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier  announcement was so significant.

He dismissed speculation that Caltex would follow the lead of Mobil and noted  in a statement that motions calling for the withdrawal of Texaco and Chevron  were overwhelmingly defeated in recent annual meetings of both companies.

AFRICA SALES      From Reuters      ORLANDO, Fla.      Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some  stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has  not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation.    While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an  official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions  that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales  of its petroleum products there.    ""If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break,"" said  Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office  of the comptroller.    Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to  General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the  largest U.S. employer in South Africa.      Tax Bite, Loss Cited    Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging  investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.    Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.    ""We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in  their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites,"" he said.

The announcement is disappointing for the government, which had been hoping for a BBB investment grade rating, but still puts it in the same category as countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Mr John Major, the first British Prime Minister to visit South Africa since 1960, nevertheless struck an upbeat note at the end of his three day visit, saying that he had been deeply impressed by the ability and determination of the coalition government, which took power after elections in April. 'The South African government is well aware of the need to create the right climate for the private sector and private enterprise. 'They see no ideological barriers to creating that,' he said. South Africa has been seeking an international credit rating since its April elections and has appointed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to represent it to the major agencies. The price of South African government bonds fell on disappointment among domestic investors that the country had been assigned a sub-investment grade rating. As prices fell, yields rose by 28 basis points to 16.49 per cent. 'There is little surprise outside of South Africa about the decision, but the feeling within the country was that it would get an investment grade rating,' said Mr Graham Bell, of Baring Securities in London. He added: 'However, this reaction is likely to be short-lived. Ibca is not as widely recognised as Moody's and Standard  Poor's, the two major American agencies. 'Their ratings, expected next month, will provide more of a benchmark.' Although the country has borrowed money in the European markets without an official rating, the government is known be particularly keen to get access to the US market. If Moody's and SP give the same rating, this would preclude some major funds from buying South African bonds and force the country to pay a premium on any international issues it might make. In its June budget the government announced its intention to raise R1.8bn (Pounds 320m) from international capital markets in the current financial year. In its report the Ibca acknowledged South Africa benefited from good physical infrastructure, an advanced financial system, good managerial talent and relatively low foreign debt. However it warned that the economy's propensity to import remained high and said that exports remain overly dependent on primary commodities. Mr Christopher Huhne, Ibca Managing Director, said that although the rating may have been lower than government officials hoped, 'the overall tone of the report is optimistic. If the government can establish a credible fiscal track record over the next couple of years, the rating could well improve.' Mr Major, speaking in Johannesburg, said overseas investment was vital if South Africa was to generate the jobs needed to achieve economic prosperity and avoid social disruption. He urged British companies to add to the UK's Pounds 10bn investment in South Africa, which accounts for nearly half of all foreign investment. Economic liberalisation has been a key theme of Mr Major's three-day visit, during which he had talks with President Mandela, Deputy Presidents Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, and cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, and Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party. Mr Major said the South African government would face 'many difficult problems' and forecast 'setbacks as well as advances'. The key to confidence would be clear indications that the government was moving in the right direction. 'I think that if that is the case the South African government, although there will be difficulties, will have every chance of carrying its programme through,' he said.

These  elections also constitute an obvious achievement for the  stability, solidarity, and cooperation in the southern subregion  of the continent, and at the same time open new prospects for  cooperation between South Africa and the rest of Africa.    Mali is happy about the advent of majority rule and pays  tribute to all the pioneers of the struggle against apartheid  who made enormous sacrifices for the principle of one man one  vote to prevail. Mali hails the great work accomplished by the  South African people to make this day a reality. It assures  them of its friendship [words indistinct].

0,FT943-13711 ,"FT943-13711 _AN-EGRD8AFSFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (33): Missions abroad have doubled - Foreign policy      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   If South African newspaper headlines are taken at face value, President Nelson Mandela is the diplomatic equivalent of Superman. Barely a week has gone by since the new government took office without what is presented as yet another presidential foreign policy initiative, exciting unrealistic expectations. Mr Mandela is, it seems, single-handedly reforming the Organisation of African Unity, in which newly-admitted South Africa is 'destined to play a leading role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution', according to local reports. He is much in demand. Over the past few weeks Mr Mandela has been described as 'brokering' peace efforts in Rwanda and Angola, and contemplating imposing democracy on troubled Lesotho. Thanks to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation, he will attend the next gathering of Francophone states, while the French leader's championing of South Africa placed the country 'firmly on the agenda' at last week's Group of Seven leading industrial nations' meeting in Naples. Meanwhile South Africa has rejoined the Commonwealth and looks forward to playing an active role in the Non-Aligned Movement. New ties have also been forged with Japan. Tokyo's aid package, said to be worth R4bn, will, says Mr Mandela, help to 'kick-start' the country's reconstruction and development plan. But closer examination of the package suggests it may be worth less than the initial estimates suggest. If all this is not enough, President Mandela appeared on video at President Bill Clinton's White House conference on Africa last month to lend his weight to calls for a Marshall Plan for the continent, the name given to the US-led programme to rebuild Europe after the second world war. Included in Mr Mandela's speech was an appeal for radical measures to ease Africa's external debt burden. While these initiatives - real, imagined or exaggerated - take place, one arm of foreign policy seems to be operating with its past efficiency: the state-owned arms manufacturer, Armscor. With sanctions lifted, and its activities given the endorsement of Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, officials are now lifting at least a corner of the veil of secrecy. The defence industry provides 70,000 jobs and foreign exchange, say government officials, who add defensively: 'If we didn't sell weapons, someone else would.' To be fair to Mr Mandela, he and his senior advisers have tried to play down expectations. On the one hand, Mr Mandela's integrity and moral authority makes him the acceptable voice of Africa on behalf of its many causes. At the same time, he makes clear that that he has no easy answers to offer. Advisers also point out that an effective diplomatic role is not made easier by the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the throes of reorganisation. South African missions abroad have doubled since the transition to respectability began, while new entrants to the diplomatic service have to be trained, and suitable ambassadors found to replace many of the pre-election incumbents. Meanwhile the overstretched service is still getting to grips with issues in which it has had little or no experience. These range from getting to know the OAU to the implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal, or reconciling relations with countries with whom ties were initially forged by the African National Congress, or the former government. Thus, the new South Africa has to weigh its relationship with Taiwan, one of its biggest trading partners, against recently-established official links with the People's Republic of China. The latter's trading potential is bigger, and its position as permanent member of the UN Security Council will have to be taken into account by Pretoria should South Africa have aspirations for a council seat as Africa's representative. Nominally in charge of this demanding portfolio is Mr Alfred Nzo, the foreign minister. His surprising appointment is put down to years of loyal service to the ANC. It may also be explained by the fact that policy will be shaped by Mr Mandela himself, and his senior deputy president, Mr Thabo Mbeki. As the initial euphoria and excitement dies down, South Africa's foreign policy is likely to become more cautious. Mr Aziz Pahad, the deputy foreign minister, acknowledges the dangers of taking on too much. But expectations are nevertheless high. In an interview with the Financial Times he echoes the explanation he gave to the Johannesburg Sunday Times: 'We have captured the moral high ground in nonracialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader in this area.' First of all, however, South Africa has to consolidate its success and build a stable, flourishing, democracy: 'If we don't sink, they (Africa's donors and creditors) see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region doesn't sink, they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of other parts of Africa.' Mr Pahad hopes that foreign investors do not ignore South Africa's neighbours: 'If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South Africa and, given that our borders are so big, we will not be able to prevent it.'

Both U.S. special envoy for Yugoslavia Charles Redman and  his  Russian counterpart Vitaly Churkin are attending the talks in  which the 12 European Community states, Canada and UN officials  are also represented.    The talks, in a hotel at Bad Godesberg, come as Russia is  proposing an international conference to try to settle the  situation in former Yugoslavia.    Moscow's return to the world diplomatic front line on the  issue coincides with the despatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo  to join in UN demilitarisation efforts following the withdrawal  of Serb artillery under threats from NATO.    Germany has also been closely associated with latest Bosnian  peace efforts.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl who has been in close telephone touch  with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin on the Bosnian crisis, Monday backed the proposal of a  ""high-level"" international conference.    Yeltsin said Monday that the main three themes of the talks  would be the situation in Sarajevo, other intended zones of  security in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a peace plan.    French President Francois Mitterrand said Monday he was  calling on the UN Security Council to put Sarajevo under UN  administration.     "
0,FT921-13556 ,"FT921-13556 _AN-CAUBNACXFT 920121   FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: South Africa in Ecu250m landmark offering      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICA's return to world capital markets yesterday received considerable impetus with the announcement that the government was raising Ecu250m (R890m). The issue is the first by South Africa in the Ecu market since 1984, and follows the country's re-entry last September into world capital markets with a DM400m issue, after an absence of six years. The issue, which was mostly pre-placed, is 'new money', unlike the D-Mark issue, half of which was used to refinance a maturing issue. The issue underlines the change in attitudes towards South Africa since the dark days of mid-1985, when the refusal of foreign banks to roll over the country's loans forced South Africa to declare a standstill on debt repayment. Since then, Pretoria has maintained what Mr Gerhard Croeser, director-general of the department of finance, yesterday called a 'meticulous' record in meeting debt commitments and complying with the conditions of the three Interim Debt Arrangements, to which South Africa's foreign debt has been subjected since the 1985 standstill. The South African authorities believe the launch also showed that international investors felt the country's political and economic prospects had been enhanced by the formation in December of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for the country's constitutional negotiations. The funds, Mr Croeser said, would contribute towards the financing of the national budget, play an important role in strengthening the country's reserves, and promote economic stability and the further normalisation of South Africa's relations with its foreign creditors. Strengthening the country's foreign reserves is particularly important as it will allow the Reserve Bank (central bank) to pursue a less restrictive monetary policy, and enhance economic growth. In recent years, South Africa's ability to finance economic growth has been constrained by the need to export savings to finance debt repayments. The country exported about R30bn of capital in this way between 1986 and 1990. In international terms, South Africa is an under-borrowed country. Total external debt at December 1990 totalled USDollars 19.3bn, equivalent to 70.2 per cent of annual export earnings. The interest service ratio is 7.1 per cent. South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 23.7bn at the end of August 1985, when the standstill on international borrowing was declared. The Ecu issue, for maturity in 1997, has a coupon of 10.375 per cent. The Department of Finance said this was a premium of about 1.77 basis points over the average for three benchmark Ecu issues, of similar maturity, by Spain, Norway and Belgium. The premium is partly a function of political risk, the debt standstill, and the fact that having been out of the market for so long, South Africa lacks liquid issues, and it is liquidity which brings marketability and a lower price. Last week Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the country would push for a final debt arrangement to deal with the outstanding Dollars 5bn when the third interim arrangement ended in 1993. He said a further arrangement was necessary because South Africa could not afford to repay the whole amount in 1993. The removal of the debt standstill, and South Africa's readmission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are the biggest remaining obstacles to the normalisation of South Africa's relations with the international financial community.

""We are meeting at a time to celebrate the  victory of South Africa but also to stop the agony of the  conflict in Rwanda and Africa as a whole,"" he told the  correspondent of the PAN AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) in Tunis.  The situation in Rwanda, he said, would remain one of concern  as long the parties to the conflict failed to agree on a  ceasefire. ""We are actively involved in getting Africans to  contribute troops for peacekeeping and are quite satisfied with  the response,"" [word indistinct] Salim. Apart from Ghana,  Ethiopia and Senegal, he said, Congo and Nigeria had given firm  commitments to contribute forces. He said some African  countries which were unable to contribute troops had offered  other help in resolving the crisis. Namibia, Salim said, had  pledged 500,000 US dollars to assist UNAMIR [UN Assistant  Mission in Rwanda] in the peacekeeping mission. ""The African  commitment and African readiness to do something is there,"" he  said. The current ministerial session, he said, would focus on  how to strengthen the organisation's capacity to manage and  prevent conflicts but would also create conditions for what he  called the ""second liberation of the continent.""    Speaking earlier at a press conference Salim said the  peaceful elections in South Africa was a miracle, commending the  spirit of reconciliation in which the elections were held and an  all-race government installed. ""South Africa has demonstrated  something more: It has shown that notwithstanding the  complexity of a situation, given national dialogue, leadership  and foresight, it is possible to resolve the most intractable  problem including that of Rwanda,"" he said.    Rwanda is represented at the current session by the foreign  minister of the interim government, Jerome Bicamumpaka. The  Rwanda Patriotic Front is represented by Bizimungu Pasteur,  member of the front's executive committee and minister designate  for internal affairs of the broadbased government put in place  after the Arusha August 1993 accord. Rwanda's warring parties  ended ceasefire talks last week without making progress towards  a truce and with the front vowing to fight on. The OAU is  supporting international efforts to bring to account the  individual leaders responsible for the killings in the country.  The carnage has claimed 500,000 lives in eight weeks.     "
0,FT944-58 ,"FT944-58 _AN-FAAACADJFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: How to remain safe in Africa - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots)      By JDF JONES   I was once staying in a game lodge in Uganda when a Belgian tourist met a painful death because he tried to feed a sugar lump to an elephant. No doubt his friends back home concluded that Africa was a dangerous place and resolved never to visit the savage continent. They would not have understood that this had been a most rare and unlikely accident. Many potential visitors to South Africa, who do not already know the country, probably have similar, and excessive, fears about what might happen to them. After all, an awful lot of people get killed there - you see it on television all the time, and this is no longer political violence but criminal (ie anyone can be a victim). South Africa is a world leader in the incidence of violent crime (just one statistic: 60 of every 100,000 South Africans are likely to be murdered next year, compared with 10 in the US and two in Britain). The overall crime rate continues to rise, with heavy increases in rape and assault this year. Is this not bound to enter the mind of the first-time visitor? Is it safe (or rather, because South Africa palpably is not as 'safe' as Bournemouth or Biarritz) - is it safe enough? The answer, as foreigners begin to pour into South Africa to visit this most beautiful of countries, is that the new South Africa is adequately 'safe' so long as you are sensible, which is to try to understand the roots and the manifestations of a security situation which obviously cannot be compared with the Cotswolds: The present situation in certain districts of the big cities is undeniably tricky, by which I mean that it demands caution and commonsense on the part of the visitor. Downtown Johannesburg is the best example: you would not dream of walking the streets after dusk and you would exercise some care during daylight. More generally, the visitor should learn the habit of locking car doors on the inside, concealing handbags and parcels, driving through red lights if there are suspicious youths at the junction, not flaunting jewellery, not carrying too much cash. Outside the towns, the open countryside is much safer on the nerves. But the sensible rules still apply: do not drive through certain areas (eg the Transkei) at night - not so much because of any danger of brigands as of cattle on the unfenced roads; do not drive yourself into a township unless you have a guide or know where you are going; do not pick up people at the roadside without looking carefully; and do not go walking in remote areas without taking advice (best to stick to the national parks, where security is good). Bear in mind that South Africa has an appalling record for simple road accidents. Drive very carefully. There is no point in denying that South Africa today is an even more violent society than it used to be, which is saying something. But that does not begin to make it a no-go area. Let us keep a sense of proportion. How much of the above would also apply to New York City or Florida, Rio or Zimbabwe? I am writing this from a delightful hotel on the Indian Ocean coast of the Transkei. We are protected by an electrified fence. At least, that is what it says: I have not tested whether the current is turned on. PS: I am actually filing this piece from another, equally delightful hotel on the edge of Zululand. We are only a few miles from an area where horrifying tribal bloodletting has featured in the international press this year, yet they do not bother to lock the doors. But they do have a dozy Alsatian, a puppy, in the garden.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P7999 Amusement and Recreation, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The row, which threatened to overshadow a three-day official visit to South Africa by Mr Major, erupted after Lady Thatcher during a trip to India dismissed South Africa's hopes of attracting international investment. She told businessmen at an official British gathering in Bombay that investors were afraid of violence and social unrest in South Africa, in spite of the formation of a government of national unity after the country's first all-race elections in April. 'What you are getting is people who look at the rest of Africa. They say 'Look at Rwanda, look at Somalia'. Are we going to have the same thing happening in South Africa?' she said. Lady Thatcher, who also described Nigeria as 'a terrible mess', pointed to tensions between Zulu leaders as evidence of continuing friction in South Africa. 'There will be a certain amount of trouble there. This is why people are holding back,' she said. However, after a vigorous rejection of her views by Mr Major and British business leaders, Lady Thatcher issued a statement saying that she 'fully supports the new democratic government of South Africa and feels that the country will attract the inward investment it so much needs'. In a clear attempt to repair the diplomatic damage in South Africa, the statement said that Lady Thatcher 'further hopes that the prime minister's present mission to that country will be highly successful'. Her views contrasted with the tone of Mr Major's visit, during which he has expressed confidence in the South African government's ability to achieve economic prosperity. British officials are also aware that Lady Thatcher is a controversial figure among black leaders, many of whom were angered by her reluctance to endorse sanctions against the former all-white government. Without responding directly, Mr Major went as far as he could to rebuke Lady Thatcher without naming her, suggesting that she was out of touch with events in South Africa. 'I do not think there is a shred of doubt about the confident future South Africa can look forward to,' he said. 'You don't have to sit back in your armchair abroad and wonder what is happening. People should come here. It would be good for South Africa and good for them too.' Mr Major told businessmen that optimism about South Africa's future was well founded.

And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African  heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan  wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday  both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to  meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict.  He said Mandela would meet the two parties.    Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis  yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan  war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President  Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit  in Tunis.    He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total  Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi  to help resolve the Angolan dispute.    On possible reparations by South Africa to African  countries,  he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had  helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not  for reward but from a sense of duty.    Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to  requests for reparations in the light of indications that the  Angolan government might seek such payments.    ""We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving  past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a  demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider  that matter seriously"".    He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring  country about damage done by the previous government ""we cannot  take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we  are not responsible for its crimes.    ""But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully.    ""We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and  as  people not affiliated to any particular organisation.    ""Now that we are free we are not going to give any material  resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than  to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have  a secure future.    ""It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped  us.""    Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to  attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him  and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times  had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.

[Derycke] During the parliamentary debate, it was only the  Flemish Bloc which shocked me, arguing for the abandoning of an  Africa which they see as on the road to ruin. If that is the  position of Belgian society, as the Flemish Bloc claims, then I  am almost ashamed to be Belgian. Europe has a tradition which  will not allow it to act in this way. I have also been  surprised by the extent to which certain deputies, and no doubt  public opinion, are ill-informed on the subject of Rwanda,  unaware that we have redirected 80 percent of our aid for this  country to basic activities, far removed from political  intrigues.    [Stroobants] Specifically?    [Derycke] In the field of education, health care, and  agriculture we have given the minimum necessary for these people  who, without us, would have nothing. In the future, we will  have to discuss cooperation within the government, with the  Parliament, and with the people. Like everyone else, I too am  pained by the death of our paratroopers and civilians. They  were all in Rwanda to help with the country's democratization.  But we must not forget that the drama experienced by the vast  majority of Rwandans is, at the very least, as awful as our own.    [Stroobants] Could democracy really be envisaged in Rwanda?    [Derycke] We created an elite which was ready for democracy,  in accordance with the policy defined by the European Union.  Africa is not entirely a disaster, even if seven or eight  countries are still lagging behind on the question of freedoms.  The other donor countries must understand this, together with  the IMF and the World Bank. The socio-economic problems, the  poverty, are also factors which partly explain what is happening.    [Stroobants] Belgian cooperation will continue?    [Derycke] We are already providing humanitarian aid, as of  today. For the rest, it is clear that we must now consider the  situation and it is not going to start up again overnight. But  I cannot stand those who say ""It's all over, let them get on  with it."" Africa can be our principal partner. Improving the  life of the people of Africa can also bring benefits for us. I  myself am proud that Belgium is maintaining a policy of  cooperation. In 80 percent of the countries we aid, the policy  is a genuine success. [passage omitted]     "

This was the message which Organisation of African  Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim conveyed in his  discussions this week to a wide range of political leaders and  roleplayers.    Speaking at a Johannesburg press conference on Friday [25  February] night, Dr. Salim said more efforts should be made and  political leaders should get together to find an all-inclusive  political settlement. It was in the interest of South Africa  and Africa that dialogue continued, no matter how difficult the  process. ""No stone should be left unturned to see even at this  11th hour if a solution can be found.""    He welcomed the announced meeting next Tuesday between  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and  African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. ""This is a  challenge coming at a critical moment and I hope it will be  successful,"" he said.    Dr. Salim said his two-hour meeting with Mr Buthelezi in  Ulundi earlier on Friday had been ""very interesting and candid"".  The IFP president had explained his concerns and reservations  to participating in the election, while Dr. Salim had spelt out  to him Africa's expectations of a peaceful election in which all  parties took part.    Dr. Salim said he had pointed out to Mr Buthelezi that in  any  negotiations, participants had to be prepared to make  compromises. The government and the ANC had made some  ""significant"" concessions, he said.    Asked whether he believed the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [National Front -- AVF] demands for a volkstaat [homeland] were  reasonable, he said this was a matter for South Africans to  decide.    The OAU would like to see a united South Africa in which  Afrikaners played an important and constructive role in the  democratic process, like respecting and understanding the  country's cultural diversity, he said.    Dr. Salim said he remained optimistic about South Africa's  future for as long as leaders were prepared to talk to each  other. What gave him hope was that all roleplayers had  indicated that they still wanted to be part of the democratic  process, he said.    During his fact-finding mission Dr. Salim also had in-depth  talks with among others Mr Mandela, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik  Botha, Gen Constand Viljoen of the AVF, Pan Africanist Congress  Deputy President Johnson Mlambo, Independent Electoral  Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and Mr Justice  Richard Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission. He is to meet  state President FW de Klerk before his departure on Saturday.     "

Speculation that Tokyo will not extend the voluntary export  restraint arrangement beyond the current year to March grew  after Japan's trade minister recently made remarks in favor of  terminating the system.    The auto industry also sounds reluctant to maintain what it  views as a practice against free trading.    Moreover, Washington does not regard the practice as a  useful  tool any more for reducing its huge trade deficit with Tokyo, at  a time when U.S.-bound Japanese car exports have slipped below  annual ceilings in recent years.    ""The U.S. Administration of Bill Clinton basically does not  support the auto export quota system,"" said Hiroshi Kumagai,  international trade and industry minister. ""If the practice is  preserved for another year from April, Tokyo may face  accusations from the U.S. that it is forming a cartel,"" the  trade minister said.    Japan began to set annual car export limits in 1981 as a way  to ease trade frictions with Washington.    In the first year, Japanese carmakers shipped a total of  1.68  million vehicles to the U.S., a volume that was exactly the same  as that year's ceiling. Export records in the next five years  also filled ceilings that were raised to as many as 2.3 million  vehicles by 1985 in response to brisk Japanese shipments.    But auto exports to the U.S., after turning lower in 1987,  are on the decline, chiefly due to increased production by  Japanese makers at their U.S. plants in the wake of the yen's  sharp gain against the dollar.    As a result, shipments have been below set limits in the  past  six years despite the gradual lowering of ceilings, finally to  1.65 million vehicles from fiscal 1992. Last year, exports  totaled 1.57 million vehicles against the 1.65 million vehicle  limit.    For the current year, the situation remains unchanged.  Toyota Motor Corp., for example, expects its U.S.-bound  shipments to sink below its quota, a Toyota spokesman said.  ""Car shipments to the U.S. will further drop next year,  affected by the operation from March this year of the second  Kentucky plant,"" the spokesman said.    Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said, ""Japanese makers'  car exports to the U.S. in a manner of a local torrential  downpour as seen in the past are unlikely to take place in the  future.""    Washington appears to have no objection to Japan not  extending the current voluntary restraint arrangement expiring  within a week. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten said,  ""This is not an issue for us any more.""    It would be ""a waste of time"" for Tokyo to think that  keeping  the practice would appease Washington in trade disputes, said  Garten.    Japan has other reasons to end the voluntary auto export  curb.    New trade frameworks established under the recently  concluded  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) call for practices  like voluntary export restraints to be phased out in four years.  Such trade practices are what the government of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa is adamantly against under its major policy  goal of deregulating government controls.    The stance is also in conformity with Japan's opposition to  managed trade, a concept Tokyo rejected repeatedly in its trade  ""framework"" talks with the U.S.    Auto industry observers think the latest remarks by Garten  may signal Washington's preparedness not to raise objections to  Tokyo's decision to terminate the export practice. But MITI  appears very guarded about showing new commitments on the issue,  voicing fears over possible repercussions on the bilateral trade  front at a time when economic ties are in a sensitive phase  following the February 11 breakdown of the trade talks between  Hosokawa and Clinton.    Hideaki Kumano, vice MITI minister, told Thursday's press  conference that MITI Minister Kumagai's recent comment on the  issue should not be taken as showing any policy change by Tokyo.    ""The trade minister just stated his general impression of  Washington's attitude toward the issue,"" Kumano said. ""MITI is  still uncommitted about whether or not to extend the trade  practice next year.""    Auto industry leaders also fear any new commitments from  their own side for now may create unnecessary sources of  contention with the U.S.    Yutaka Kume, chief of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, said, ""The industry wants the auto trade practice  to wither away and disappear without noticing it.""    MITI is likely to postpone its announcement on the issue  beyond the March 31 end of the current year, industry observers  said.     "

It was only a few days ago that he toured this huge black township, looking in  on a migrant workers' hostel reeking of human waste, a primary school and a new  shopping center where he stopped to buy a pack of Camel Lights.    When he appeared at the door of a neat yellow stucco home, he surprised  Henrietta Mafokosho by asking if she'd give him and his wife a house tour.    ""I was shivering,"" Mafokosho, 21, recalled. ""I couldn't believe such a great  man was here in my house, shaking my hand. He's a nice guy.""    There haven't been many white South African leaders in this troubled country's  history whom Sowetans would call great men -- or even, for that matter, nice  guys. But De Klerk is like none before him.    Since he was sworn into office a year ago last week, the 54-year-old head of  state has shaken up South Africa and the world with his stunning reform  program.    Upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Sunday, he  quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and declared that his nation  is on ""a great journey"" toward full democracy.    A smiling De Klerk, recalling the words of King, said: ""Peace and freedom are  the goals of all men. South Africa has embarked on a great journey. It is a  journey for full democracy at home, and abroad full participation in the family  of nations.""    He added that ""the new South Africa is at hand"" and promised that the ""walls of  apartheid are coming down.""    De Klerk, who meets President Bush today, has said his mission is to persuade  Americans that he is serious about reform.    ""Many people (in America) are still looking at South Africa through glasses  they should have discarded by now,"" De Klerk said before embarking on his trip.  He added that it would be ""a great challenge to change the image burned into  their minds by years and years"" of violent scenes from South Africa on their  television screens.    But the trip comes as De Klerk's program to dismantle apartheid and begin  negotiations, warmly welcomed both here and abroad, runs into its most serious  difficulties since the government opened talks with the African National  Congress in May.    A month of factional violence in Johannesburg-area townships has left more than  760 dead and put new obstacles on the road to peace. De Klerk has sent extra  police into the townships in Operation Iron Fist, which seemed to halt the  trouble, at least temporarily.    The president also ordered razor wire put up around flash points of trouble,  prepared to impose curfews beginning Tuesday and declared a 10-day amnesty for  the surrender of dangerous weapons.    The ANC has criticized the crackdown, saying it amounts to a reimposition of  the state of emergency and is designed to repress legitimate political  activity. The ANC blames the current violence on right-wing white agitators who  are stoking black fighting to undermine the peace process.    De Klerk says the fighting stems primarily from ethnic and political  differences among blacks, although he says it is possible other, unknown,  forces are behind some of the attacks.    Incidents of unrest have increased sharply since De Klerk normalized black  political activity by legalizing the ANC and other black organizations in a  landmark speech Feb. 2.    The rising expectations of blacks living in ghettos has touched off hundreds of  demonstrations. Some have been peaceful but others have been broken up with  police tear gas and bullets.    A recent judicial inquiry recommended that charges be brought against three  dozen black and white police officers who killed five demonstrators without  provocation in Sebokeng during a March protest.    The scenes of unrest have been replayed nightly for nervous whites on state-run  television, driving many into the lap of the government's right-wing political  opponents.    Adding to De Klerk's woes is the almost daily criticism from militant white  groups who complain that whites suspected in right-wing attacks and bombings  have been detained without cause and tortured while in custody. Police  officials express private fears for De Klerk's life.    The growing power of the right wing has put pressure on the president to prove  that his reforms will be good for the country's whites in the long run.    ""De Klerk tries to project an image of sweet reasonableness, and he's done it  successfully,"" said Sampie Terreblanche, a political analyst at Stellenbosch  University. ""But in the next six months, he'll have to deliver some of that  sweetness.""    Most analysts agree that the lifting of economic and other sanctions against  South Africa would go a long way toward easing the anxieties of whites, who  have been financially and emotionally hurt by the campaign to isolate them from  the West's markets, culture and sports fields.    ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, during a U.S. tour in June, won assurances  from many congressional leaders that sanctions will remain in place until  apartheid reform is irreversible. The ANC says that point has not yet been  reached.    So far, De Klerk has said he's disappointed that foreign governments have  refused ""to acknowledge that the process in South Africa has become  irreversible. We sincerely say . . . there will be a new constitution. And that  constitution will be fair and just.    ""The time is right for the international community to re-evaluate the situation  and to put their money where their mouths are,"" De Klerk added.    The president said, though, that he did not come to the United States ""with hat  in hand"" to plead for an end to sanctions. ""That will take care of itself as  South Africans prove that we mean business,"" he said.    Sanctions against South Africa, passed over President Reagan's veto in 1986,  are among the most severe Pretoria faces. The American law outlines specific  steps that must be taken by the South African government before the  Administration can consider removing those sanctions.    The Bush Administration believes De Klerk has met most of those conditions. One  obstacle will be removed when the government releases about 2,500 political  prisoners. The government and the ANC have agreed on a plan to identify and  release those activists, beginning in a matter of weeks.    A more formidable obstacle is the lifting of the state of emergency in Natal  province. Three years of black faction fighting in Natal between supporters of  Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has  killed nearly 4,000 people.    Even if De Klerk receives no promises from Washington, the trip still will be  heralded back home as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The last South African  leader to visit the United States was Gen. Jan Smuts, in 1945, three years  before the National Party came to power.    Many white South Africans have chafed under the diplomatic and economic  isolation engendered by their country's system of apartheid, which segregates  neighborhoods, schools and hospitals and denies the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    Since 1983, the number of American firms doing business in South Africa has  dropped from 386 to 129. Nevertheless, many South Africans still admire  Americans and delight in American entertainment and products.    Two of the most popular programs on state-run television are ""LA Law"" and  ""thirtysomething."" Theaters here show many American movies. And South Africans  snap up everything from American canned goods to computers -- despite mark-ups  that average 400% of the U.S. sales price.    De Klerk's promises to negotiate a new constitution that will end apartheid and  extend voting rights to black people has greatly improved Pretoria's relations  with the United States, Europe and Africa. But that has yet to translate into  trade agreements to aid South Africa's sagging economy. Many foreign  governments are looking for more concrete signs of change.    The president already has promised that the next session of Parliament, which  opens in February, 1991, will scrap the Group Areas Act, a pillar of apartheid  that carves the country into separate neighborhoods for blacks, mixed-race  Coloreds, Indians and whites.    He has moved less quickly on opening schools. White public schools will be  allowed to open their doors to blacks next year if 72% of a school's parents  agree. But the government still maintains veto power and, even in integrated  schools, whites still will get first choice for openings.    De Klerk has been heartened, though, by the warm reception many blacks in South  Africa have given to his reform program. The graffiti artists in South Africa's  townships have splattered his first initials -- ""Viva F. W."" -- next to their  anti-apartheid slogans.    And recent opinion polls suggest that if a multiracial election were held  today, the white Afrikaner president would get one in five black votes.  (Mandela would get three of the other four.)    De Klerk was cheered by hundreds of Sowetans during his recent tour here. Many  were surprised to hear him admit that the conditions of many township  residents, especially those living in the hostels that have been the flash  points of recent violence, ""were absolutely unacceptable.""    ""My impression is that so much needs to be done,"" he said.    He had told Soweto primary school pupils that he and ""other leaders, the black  leaders, all of us, are trying to work out a new South Africa in which you will  be able to live happily.""    And at least some Sowetans were impressed by his sincerity.    ""A lot of people in the township really like F. W. They believe in him,""  Henrietta Mafokosho said. ""And they believe that in a few years, everything  will be OK.""    Times staff writer Jim Mann, in Washington, contributed to this story.

0,FT933-4400 ,"FT933-4400 _AN-DIIB8ABUFT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / End of S Africa sanctions era in sight      By PHILIP GAWITH   THE breakthrough made this week by South Africa's constitutional negotiators towards establishing a multiracial government promises significant relief to an economy that is short of good news, writes Philip Gawith. Agreement on a Transitional Executive Council (TEC), after many false dawns, has at last brought the end of the sanctions era in view. Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, has said the ANC will probably call for the lifting of remaining financial sanctions - most notably the embargo on International Monetary Fund/World Bank financing - by the end of the month. It is likely also to mark the start of an era of considerably increased international development assistance. As Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, made clear during a recent visit: 'The international community wants to help and to help substantially once the next step has been taken towards representative government.' The US and European Community have expressed similar intentions. Although white South Africans have for years with bravado dismissed sanctions as ineffective there will be no disguising the joy when they finally go. While a minority found succour in the romance of the besieged volk in its laager, most longed to be rid of the burden of being an international pariah. It could not come at a better time. Economists believe South Africa's net reserves have fallen as low as one month's import cover, while capital outflows and the lower gold price have driven the rand to a record low against the dollar. Top of the list will be re-establishment of links with the IMF. Since declaring a moratorium on the repayment of part of its external debt in 1985 South Africa has been forced to run a current account surplus to finance more than Dollars 1bn a year in debt repayments. This has seriously hampered growth. Renewed access to the IMF will allow South Africa to run a deficit and growth prospects will be improved. Banks will also be much happier to do business in South Africa when it enjoys the financial backing of the IMF. The IMF has made no secret in recent months of its willingness to lend to South Africa again, most recently in July when President FW de Klerk held talks in Washington with Mr Michael Camdessus, its managing director. The World Bank has also made clear it is ready to lend large sums, most for infrastructure and human resource development. Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the central bank, believes that the TEC agreement will be seen by the IMF and World Bank as the signal that the time is ripe to re-engage formally with South Africa. He said yesterday that in terms of the IMF's compensatory and contingency financing facility (CFF), South Africa is eligible for about Dollars 800m in assistance arising from balance of payments shortfalls related to the severe drought in 1992. The technical groundwork for the loan has already been done, but he stressed that an application would have to come from the finance sub-committee of the TEC. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, the Cape-based life office, argues that when the world economy starts growing again, South Africa's current account will benefit more directly than in the past when its trade was hampered by such factors as having to accept a political discount on goods and incur the cost of routing trade through a third party. Although nobody is expecting big capital inflows to the country, the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations should help stop the haemorrhage on the capital account. In the year to June, the total net outflow of capital not related to reserves amounted to R9.8bn (Pounds 1.4bn). Mr Stals argues that this 'is not a sign of economic weakness, but of the difficult political situation in which we find ourselves'. He believes that the removal of sanctions will allow investors to assess South Africa more in terms of conventional risk criteria, without 'extraneous' political distractions. There remain of course, as he is quick to recognise, ample reasons for believing that investors are likely to hold back until well after an election. At the very least, uncertainty about political stability, the shape of future economic policies, and the economy's seeming inability to emerge from a prolonged slump give considerable cause for caution. From the point of view of the US investor there are other obstacles too. At the last count, 26 states, 90 local authorities and 24 counties still had sanctions in place. The effect of these has been to prevent US bank lending to South Africa and US pension fund investment in companies with South African ties. The fact that some sanctions still remain in place against Namibia, which received its independence in March 1990, is a reminder of the obstacles that lie ahead.

0,FT924-6026 ,"FT924-6026 _AN-CKXBJAA3FT 921124   FT  24 NOV 92 / SA lures back investors      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   DISINVESTMENT from South Africa has been reversed over the past year, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC), an independent Washington-based research institute, writes Michael Holman. According to the 1992 edition of the IRRC publication, International Business in South Africa, 508 non-US companies have direct investment or employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. Of these, 153 are British, 142 German and 111 are American. US companies are also returning to South Africa, but in much smaller numbers, says the report. Since President George Bush lifted the ban on new investment in July 1991, five US companies have established offices, bringing the total of US companies with direct investment or employees up to 111. US disinvestment from South Africa began on a substantial scale after the violence of the mid-1980s, with the number of US companies in the republic falling from 267 in May 1986 to 168 by October 1987 to a low of 106 in 1991, according to IRRC statistics. But the report notes that US companies remain reluctant to invest in South Africa 'because of more than 60 state, city and county selective contracting laws that penalise companies doing business in South Africa when awarding contracts'. Investors are also discouraged by violence and political uncertainty, the report adds. The trend towards establishing non-equity links with South African companies 'has continued to increase dramatically', the report continues. It says that 303 non-US companies have non-equity links (such as licensing or distribution agreements) with South African companies, a net increase of 132 from a year ago. US companies with non-equity links rose by 23 to 256. International Business in South Africa 1992, IRRC, 1755 Massachusetts Ave NW, Suite 600, Washington DC 20036. Phone (202) 234-7500. Dollars 250.

The Dollars 500m global offering of five-year bonds is likely to pave the way for a flood of new issues from other South African borrowers in both the public and private sectors. It is being closely watched by major South African companies and institutions as a measure of the acceptability of South African bonds on the global market and of confidence in the economic policies of the new government. The state-owned electricity utility Eskom and telecommunications company Telkom as well as several private companies are expected to approach the international capital markets over the next few months. Although South Africa has borrowed on the international markets before, this is the first time it has been able to approach the US market directly. The bond offering is expected to be launched either today or tomorrow. Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, the banks lead-managing the deal, were last night unable to comment on the pricing of the bonds, but the market expects a price about 170 to 200 basis points (1.7 to 2 percentage points) over US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. This compares with a margin of about 175 basis points available on Greek bonds of a similar maturity. Mexican debt is trading at about 200 basis points over US Treasuries. Both countries have a similar credit rating to South Africa. Earlier this year, South Africa was awarded an investment grade rating by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. Japan's Nippon Investor Services also gave the country an investment grade rating. However, Standard  Poor's, the other major US rating agency, awarded a sub-investment grade rating, albeit with a positive outlook. The launch follows the completion yesterday of a series of investment presentations in Asia, Europe and the US by a South African delegation, including Mr Chris Liebenberg, the finance minister; Mr Alec Erwin, his deputy; Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank; and Mr Tito Mboweni, labour minister.

He  also spoke of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the backup  measures being implemented, and the effects of the monetary  adjustment on the balance sheet of the Bank of Central African  States [BEAC]. He also mentioned the steps to take in response  to the presentation of the experts' report on economic and  monetary integration. Taking stock of the summit, the president  stated that the Libreville meeting helped adopt practical steps  to implement the backup measures. [passage omitted]    Analyzing the incidence of the monetary adjustment on the  balance sheet of the BEAC, the heads of state noted the negative  effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction  accounts, all of which are now in debt. Central Africa,  President Patasse said, is lagging behind its West African  counterparts and its issuing bank is not doing well, mainly  because of the selfishness of some states. This attitude has  worsened to such extent that the BEAC's balance relies on the  fragile economies of two states in the subregion.    [Begin Patasse recording] It is very easy to note that  Central Africa is ill as a result of the selfishness shown by  each of the subregional states. As a result of exaggerated  nationalism in the subregion, Central Africa is now lagging far  behind West Africa. I stress that if Central Africa does not  realize the danger we will get lost, and that is the main lesson  to draw from our Libreville meeting. When you analyze the  report presented by the BEAC governor, you will note that the  Central Bank hinges on the CAR in the first place and then on  Chad. When we take into account the transaction accounts, we  can say that as far as the Central African Region is concerned  there is a deficit. It is thanks to our country that the  Central Bank survives. But we must avoid boasting because the  essential element needed first of all is solidarity. [end  recording]    The main decisions made by the heads of state in Libreville  include: checking increasing inflation, reducing increases in  the prices of essential commodities, and negotiating with the  IMF the possibilities of ensuring an influx of funds to Central  Africa necessary to reestablish financial balance in the  subregion. But the main announcement that the head of state  made was the creation in the days ahead of the CEMAC. The heads  of state agreed on the examination of two draft texts to be  submitted to them for signature in order to rapidly put in place  the institutions of the new community. All this is expected to  be ready for the next summit slated for Ndjamena. Let us listen  to the president again:    [Begin Patasse recording] We will find solutions to our  problems. We will meet in Ndjamena in one or two week's time,  and we will find solutions. We have transcended the chauvinist  stage to tackle major problems confronting all of us, that is  how we will create the CEMAC. That is the main point of our  meeting in Libreville. We also examined security problems in  the subregion. Concerning this point, there are the examples of  our Chadian brothers that we have accepted on our territory and  the Cameroon- Nigeria conflict. These are the current problems,  but we are convinced that if political will exists in such a way  that we can pool our resources to rejuvenate Central Africa, I  am convinced that we shall overcome micro-nationalism which  constitutes an obstacle to Central Africa's development.

Even under sanctions and with high levels of violence and political uncertainty, it is the continent's second largest tourist industry, accounting for almost 20 per cent of regional tourist income, more than double Kenya's 9.6 per cent. In 1991, Morocco headed the African league with 24 per cent of tourist revenue. Globally, South Africa is a tiny player accounting for less than 0.25 per cent of the international tourist business. Excluding African visitors, there were some 560,000 tourist arrivals last year, the bulk of whom (70 per cent) came from Europe, with the UK as the main market (26 per cent) followed by Germany (16 per cent) and the US (9 per cent). With a growth rate of 18,5 per cent in 1992, the Asian market - especially Taiwan (4 per cent) and Japan (1.5 per cent) - is becoming increasingly important. Growth accelerated in the first seven months of 1993 with the number of arrivals increasing 12.7 per cent. Overseas tourists spend an estimated R4,800 (Dollars 1,750) per visit (excluding air fares to and from the country) and the industry earned R2.75bn (Dollars 1bn) in foreign exchange in 1991, making it the fourth largest foreign currency earner, after manufactures, gold and other minerals. Aside from the lifting of sanctions, the main factor making for tourism growth at a time of global recession has been the liberalisation of the aviation policies and the expansion of air traffic capacity. In the past three years, 18 new airlines have started services to South Africa. A more market-driven aviation policy has resulted in more competitive market prices and the opening up of the charter market. The number of tour operators has more than doubled, while government has become more active in tourism promotion allowing accelerated tax write-offs for the accommodation industry, a R600m (Dollars 180m) loan programme for Eco-tourism projects and support schemes for small entrepreneurs. On the debit side, tourist perceptions of personal safety in South Africa have deteriorated markedly. In January 1990, some 70 per cent of overseas visitors rated the safety factor in South Africa good but by January this year, this rating had fallen below 30 per cent. The government's target is to more than treble the number of arrivals by 2000 reaching 1.75m visitors earning some R24bn in foreign exchange. With hotels operating at below 50 per cent of bed-night capacity, there is considerable scope for expansion without significant new investment in hotels. Nevertheless, three leading global players - Hilton, Hyatt and Sheraton - have expressed interest in opening up in South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

""Only firm action will dissuade  the similarly-minded from more of the same as the new order  finds its feet.""    U.S. Interest in South Africa -- On the same page Peter  Fabricius writes ""In Washington"" on the amount of U.S. media  attention to South Africa. Fabricius says that according to THE  WASHINGTON POST, ""by many of the traditional definitions of  national interest, the U.S. might appear to have little stake in  the SA elections. There are no oil fields to protect, no U.S.  troops or bases in the region, no Soviet surrogates to contain  and no colonial guilt to assuage."" Fabricius therefore believes  part of the explanation for the U.S. interest in South Africa  ""seems to be enlightened self-interest. The Clinton  Administration has identified South Africa as one of the world's  10 best emerging markets and is trying hard to buy in while the  prices are low, so to speak.""

The IEC ""was operating in a  situation without precedent, necessitating guesswork and  assumption about how many people would vote, and where.""  Inkatha's last-minute decision to participate in the election  also ""put a huge additional burden on an already pressed  organisation."" Therefore, ""if an extra public holiday,  additional polling hours, a few million more ballot papers and  some careful negotiation about controversial ballot papers can  overcome the problem, the nation will have come off lightly.  The new South Africa was never going to be easy, but it is  here.""    SOWETAN    IEC Electoral Arrangements `Fine Job' -- ""It would have been  a miracle for yesterday's elections to have gone off without  technical hitches,"" states a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 28 April. The paper notes that the IEC  was blamed for ""shoddy arrangements in various areas."" ""In the  first place, such shortcomings are common to all elections. In  the second place, this country undertook this gigantic exercise  for the first time. Finally, the politicians should take much of  the blame for hindering the process towards election day and  making the work of the IEC difficult by the constant changing of  deadlines. The IEC, in fact, must be congratulated for doing a  fine job under difficult circumstances.""     "

Mr Jemal-ud-din Kassum, IFC vice-president for operations, said that the investments - which will be made in a franchise financing fund and a life assurance company - would 'help bridge the gap between the first and third world parts of the economy'. The IFC, which promotes private sector activity, will invest R12.5m (Pounds 2.4m) in the South Africa Franchise Capital Fund. This will be a R50m vehicle to provide loans and equity to members of 'previously disadvantaged groups' so they can acquire franchises in businesses such as fast food, dry cleaning and photocopying chains. The IFC will also invest R41.6m in a 10 per cent stake in African Life Assurance (Aflife), a life assurance company that does most of its business with poor blacks. The franchise fund will help black businesses overcome shortages of capital and give them access to accounting and marketing expertise as well as the research and development facilities of larger organisations, Mr Tei Mante, director of IFC's sub-Saharan Africa department, said. The life assurance company, which is being restructured to be predominantly owned by black interests, will provide a home for savings from people in the townships and provinces. The two investments 'are all part of building a climate that provides a stable base for economic growth', Mr Mante said. The Aflife restructuring, which will entail the building up of a new sales force to cover black residential areas, was an 'example of the changes in ownership and control that are necessary for increased participation by previously disadvantaged groups in the formal economy.' IFC's partner in structuring and arranging the leasing fund was Nedcor Bank of South Africa. Nedcor will take a 25 per cent stake in the fund. The rest of the shares will be placed with a small group of international and South African institutional investors. In remarks to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Mr Christo Liebenberg, the South African finance minister, said the Bank's multilateral investment guarantee agency would soon give its first guarantee for an inward investment into South Africa. It is understood that this concerns an investment in the manufacturing sector.   Companies:-  South Africa Franchise Capital Fund.     African Life Assurance.     Nedcor Bank.

Beck, Karl S. Beck, longtime resident of Southern Africa, is a  senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.      WASHINGTON      In the nasty climate that is South African politics, Pieter W. Botha's sudden  resignation has quelled the thunderstorm over which National Party oligarch  will run the government. Unfortunately there is no sign things will get  substantially better soon. Frederik W.de Klerk, Botha's interim successor --  who appears certain to be elected president after whites choose their new  Parliament in September -- inherits a country that has been in a debilitating  crisis for more than a decade. De Klerk enters office with countless problems  and three assets: relief, expectations and opportunity.    Everyone is happy to see Botha go. His irrationality and tantrums are  legendary. Botha screamed at Cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors and  visiting U.S. congressmen. He once told his own vice president to ""shut up"" at  a meeting where Botha personally fired the director-general of the South  African Broadcasting Corp. for straying from his prescribed line for TV news.  He told Cape Town's Catholic cardinal to ""listen or get out"" when the cardinal  asked Botha to stop human-rights violations by the police and army. Given  Botha's close connections to South Africa's dreaded intelligence and security  forces -- forged during 14 years as defense minister -- his ire was terrifying.  Few had the guts to tell Botha the truth, and he clung to a dream world where  he relied on thugs, rogues and political alchemists to respond to the demand  for black rights, the most pressing issue confronting the South African  government.    Botha never accepted the fact that the majority of black South Africans support  the African National Congress, he never comprehended the effects of burning  barricades in Soweto on the decisions of bank presidents in Zurich and New  York. Botha also reserved a special contempt for foreigners who sought to be  involved in South African affairs. Two exceptions were British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but Reagan fell from grace after the U.S.  President imposed mild sanctions on South Africa in 1985, to ward off harsher  measures then gaining support in Congress. Botha still believes Reagan betrayed  him.    In August, 1985, as international financiers and Western governments waited for  Botha to deliver a speech drafted by the South African Foreign Affairs Ministry  to restore confidence in South Africa's stability, Botha threw away the text  and declared he would keep South Africa on a course of repression and  segregation. The next year, Botha promulgated state-of-emergency laws that the  police and army used brutally in an attempt to kill off support for the ANC and  its internal allies in the United Democratic Front. They failed, and the  effects of the state of emergency, still in force, were to strengthen the  resolve of anti-apartheid dissidents, to increase black support for the ANC and  to prolong the political stalemate while the government refused to talk to  legitimate black leaders.    Meanwhile large sums of money continue to flow out of South Africa, and no one  will lend South Africans capital needed to modernize industries and put  employment opportunities in sync with population growth. Black unemployment is  already dangerously high -- more than 60% in some areas. Blacks are  increasingly being politicized and activated against the government because of  their desperate economic conditions. Ironically whites, whom Botha claimed to  protect, are also pinched by the deteriorating economy, while feeling ever more  threatened by the country's permanent political crisis. Botha saw his role as  that of a parochial, white Afrikaaner politician. He leaves South Africa in a  terrible mess.    Many people expect, or hope, De Klerk will find a way out of the mess.  Principal among them is Thatcher, who met with De Klerk in London last month  and told him it is getting tougher everyday for her to defend South Africa from  those in the European Community and Commonwealth who want to punish Pretoria  for its treatment of blacks. De Klerk, for his part, probably responded by  assuring Thatcher of his plans eventually to release ANC leader Nelson Mandela  and to enter into negotiations with blacks.    What is less likely is that De Klerk could have told Thatcher he is prepared to  allow blacks equal political rights with whites. De Klerk is a segregationist  who wants to maintain white privilege despite spiraling political and economic  costs. He is solidly within the National Party right wing that hopes to attract  blacks away from the ANC by imposing black quislings on the black masses as  ""leaders"" and sponsoring public works projects in areas where blacks live. This  will never succeed. Similarly, De Klerk opposes admitting blacks into a  national Parliament on a one person-one vote basis. When he told Thatcher  recently that he will seek a system of government in a South Africa where no  racial group will be able to dominate any other, Thatcher reportedly  interjected impatiently: ""What are you, afraid the blacks will do to you what  you did to them?""    Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes  repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years  ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was  fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government  to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that  the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in  close touch despite their differing politics.    De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president  above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious  circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC  has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals  outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even  more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each  other about how they would relate during negotiations.    Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such  negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at  a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South  Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the  state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the  National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it  was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling  Namibian independence to South African whites.    Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to  arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the  steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party  hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A  group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk  when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening  patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the  crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: ""Gentlemen, I am prepared to  accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as  it keeps the National Party in power."" If this is indeed De Klerk's goal, God  help South Africa.

Beck, Karl S. Beck, longtime resident of Southern Africa, is a  senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.      WASHINGTON      In the nasty climate that is South African politics, Pieter W. Botha's sudden  resignation has quelled the thunderstorm over which National Party oligarch  will run the government. Unfortunately there is no sign things will get  substantially better soon. Frederik W.de Klerk, Botha's interim successor --  who appears certain to be elected president after whites choose their new  Parliament in September -- inherits a country that has been in a debilitating  crisis for more than a decade. De Klerk enters office with countless problems  and three assets: relief, expectations and opportunity.    Everyone is happy to see Botha go. His irrationality and tantrums are  legendary. Botha screamed at Cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors and  visiting U.S. congressmen. He once told his own vice president to ""shut up"" at  a meeting where Botha personally fired the director-general of the South  African Broadcasting Corp. for straying from his prescribed line for TV news.  He told Cape Town's Catholic cardinal to ""listen or get out"" when the cardinal  asked Botha to stop human-rights violations by the police and army. Given  Botha's close connections to South Africa's dreaded intelligence and security  forces -- forged during 14 years as defense minister -- his ire was terrifying.  Few had the guts to tell Botha the truth, and he clung to a dream world where  he relied on thugs, rogues and political alchemists to respond to the demand  for black rights, the most pressing issue confronting the South African  government.    Botha never accepted the fact that the majority of black South Africans support  the African National Congress, he never comprehended the effects of burning  barricades in Soweto on the decisions of bank presidents in Zurich and New  York. Botha also reserved a special contempt for foreigners who sought to be  involved in South African affairs. Two exceptions were British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but Reagan fell from grace after the U.S.  President imposed mild sanctions on South Africa in 1985, to ward off harsher  measures then gaining support in Congress. Botha still believes Reagan betrayed  him.    In August, 1985, as international financiers and Western governments waited for  Botha to deliver a speech drafted by the South African Foreign Affairs Ministry  to restore confidence in South Africa's stability, Botha threw away the text  and declared he would keep South Africa on a course of repression and  segregation. The next year, Botha promulgated state-of-emergency laws that the  police and army used brutally in an attempt to kill off support for the ANC and  its internal allies in the United Democratic Front. They failed, and the  effects of the state of emergency, still in force, were to strengthen the  resolve of anti-apartheid dissidents, to increase black support for the ANC and  to prolong the political stalemate while the government refused to talk to  legitimate black leaders.    Meanwhile large sums of money continue to flow out of South Africa, and no one  will lend South Africans capital needed to modernize industries and put  employment opportunities in sync with population growth. Black unemployment is  already dangerously high -- more than 60% in some areas. Blacks are  increasingly being politicized and activated against the government because of  their desperate economic conditions. Ironically whites, whom Botha claimed to  protect, are also pinched by the deteriorating economy, while feeling ever more  threatened by the country's permanent political crisis. Botha saw his role as  that of a parochial, white Afrikaaner politician. He leaves South Africa in a  terrible mess.    Many people expect, or hope, De Klerk will find a way out of the mess.  Principal among them is Thatcher, who met with De Klerk in London last month  and told him it is getting tougher everyday for her to defend South Africa from  those in the European Community and Commonwealth who want to punish Pretoria  for its treatment of blacks. De Klerk, for his part, probably responded by  assuring Thatcher of his plans eventually to release ANC leader Nelson Mandela  and to enter into negotiations with blacks.    What is less likely is that De Klerk could have told Thatcher he is prepared to  allow blacks equal political rights with whites. De Klerk is a segregationist  who wants to maintain white privilege despite spiraling political and economic  costs. He is solidly within the National Party right wing that hopes to attract  blacks away from the ANC by imposing black quislings on the black masses as  ""leaders"" and sponsoring public works projects in areas where blacks live. This  will never succeed. Similarly, De Klerk opposes admitting blacks into a  national Parliament on a one person-one vote basis. When he told Thatcher  recently that he will seek a system of government in a South Africa where no  racial group will be able to dominate any other, Thatcher reportedly  interjected impatiently: ""What are you, afraid the blacks will do to you what  you did to them?""    Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes  repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years  ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was  fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government  to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that  the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in  close touch despite their differing politics.    De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president  above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious  circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC  has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals  outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even  more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each  other about how they would relate during negotiations.    Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such  negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at  a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South  Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the  state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the  National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it  was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling  Namibian independence to South African whites.    Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to  arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the  steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party  hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A  group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk  when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening  patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the  crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: ""Gentlemen, I am prepared to  accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as  it keeps the National Party in power.""

The substantial flow of direct foreign investment has  injected new life into economic development in China. However,  we must see that the pattern of the sources of direct foreign  investment, which directly determines where investment goes in  the Chinese economy, is not ideal, thereby adversely affecting  Chinese economic development. This article offers a preliminary  analysis of China's foreign investment incentives from a legal  perspective.    I. How the Pattern of Origins of Foreign Investment Affects  Distribution    The bulk of direct foreign investment in China comes from  Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Little originates in Japan and  United States and even less comes from developed nations in  Western Europe.    It should be noted that the imbalance in the origins of  direct foreign investment undermines our effort to utilize  foreign capital effectively and speed up economic development in  a way that cannot be ignored.    1) Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are related to China's  southeastern coastal provinces geographically and through  consanguinity in myriad ways, which explains why investors in  these places are so inclined to pour capital to China's  southeastern coast, particularly the two provinces of Guangdong  and Fujian, creating a striking geographical imbalance in the  distribution of foreign investment. Furthermore, since there is  a dire shortage of natural resources in China's southeastern  coastal region, the restaurant, hotel, and other service  industries naturally became the destinations of most of the  investment dollars. According to statistics, the tertiary  sector accounted for 54.96 percent of the total value of  projects involving foreign capital that were approved in the  period between 1979 and 1988. Within the tertiary sector itself,  more foreign investment went into the building of hotels and  recreational facilities and real estate than anything else,  constituting 57.57 percent of all foreign investment in the  tertiary sector. In other words, geographically foreign capital  is over-concentrated in the southeast and industrially it is  over-concentrated in nonproductive industries. It is only too  obvious that this pattern of foreign investment hampers the full  utilization of the abundant natural resources in the interior,  the optimalization of the industrial structure, and the  achievement of balanced economic development in China.    2) Most foreign investment projects are small projects. Take  1991 for instance. Projects with a price tag over $10 million  each accounted for just 2 percent of the total value of foreign  investment projects negotiated in that year; between $500,000  and $1 million, 24 percent; and under $500,000, 52 percent. The  main cause of this phenomenon is the influx of Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan capital financing small projects. With so many small  projects, economies of scale do not come into play.    3) Most direct foreign investments come from Hong Kong and  the bulk of them are destined for labor-intensive projects. Of  all enterprises financed with foreign investment and approved in  the past dozen years or so, an overwhelming majority of those in  the primary and tertiary sectors were labor-intensive projects.  In the secondary sector labor-intensive projects such as those  in the light and textile industries also accounted for a  substantial portion. These labor-intensive projects were  technologically low-grade and few were at an internationally  advanced level. According to statistics compiled by the  departments concerned, only 660 projects were rated  ""technologically advanced"" by late 1990, a mere 4.55 percent of  all enterprises financed with foreign capital that opened for  business in the period concerned. This militates against our  drive to create an export-oriented economy and participate in  international economic competition and cooperation.    II. How Incentives in China's Foreign Investment Laws Impact  Pattern of Origins of Such Investment    The imbalance in the pattern of origins of foreign  investment  adversely affects the distribution of foreign investment by  industry, thereby constraining the nation's economic  development. While there are many factors behind such an  imbalance, I think the law plays a major role in steering the  flow of investment. The reason is that of the numerous factors  shaping direct foreign investment, the legal factor is most  critical. Direct foreign investment has been increasing steadily  in recent years, which proves that incentives written into  China's foreign investment legislation have been enormously  effective. Yet they are precisely the reason why the pattern of  origins of direct foreign investment in China has been so  lopsided.    1) Tax incentives. Most tax incentives in China's foreign  investment laws are contained in provisions regulating corporate  income taxes. They include not only lower tax rates than those  found in other developing nations or regions, but also longer  tax abatement periods, something absent from other nations.  Nevertheless, China's tax incentives do not tie in with the  appropriate tax laws in the United States or Europe. All these  countries take a compensation and exemption approach toward the  issue of double taxation on foreign investment, which means that  it is the government of the investment-originating nation, not  the investor, which gets to enjoy foreign investment tax  incentives. Therefore even though China has reached an agreement  with some nations aimed at avoiding double taxation, China's tax  incentives have only limited appeal to investors from the United  States and Europe. In contrast, China's tax incentives,  especially its array of liberally applicable tax exemptions and  tax cuts, are tremendously appealing to capital in Macao,  Taiwan, and, particularly, the free port of Hong Kong. Moreover,  China's foreign investment legislation discriminates in favor of  investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Both Article 11 of  the ""State Council Regulations on Encouraging Investment by  Taiwan Compatriots"" and Article 11 of the ""State Council  Regulations on Encouraging Investment by Overseas Chinese and  Compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao"" stipulate explicitly that  enterprises financed by compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan are not required to pay import tariffs or the combined  industrial and commercial tax on imported machinery, vehicles,  and office equipment essential to the operations and production  of their enterprises. Also exempt from import tariffs and the  combined industrial and commercial tax are the articles of daily  use and means of transportation imported for the personal  consumption of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  during the period of operations of their enterprises provided  such imports are within a reasonable quantity. With the  exception of products whose export is restricted, enterprises  are allowed to export their output without paying export tariffs  and the combined industrial and commercial tax. These incentives  are not available to enterprises financed by other foreign  investors. Not only are such practices inconsistent with  international tax rules, but they also do nothing to improve the  pattern of origins of direct foreign investment in China.    2) Non-tax incentives. China's foreign investment laws also  confer more nontax incentives on Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  investors than their counterparts from elsewhere. About the  methods of raising capital, for example, when an enterprise  financed by a Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan investor applies for a  loan from a financial institution on the mainland or overseas,  it can ""use its own assets and rights as collateral."" In  contrast, most Sino-foreign joint ventures are required to  report to the State Administration of Exchange Control or one of  its branches for the record when they want to borrow foreign  exchange funds from a foreign bank. Furthermore, things are  easier for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors when it comes  to entry/departure procedures. All of this facilitates the  influx of investment from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.    3) China distinguishes among three kinds of enterprises  involving foreign investment, namely Sino-foreign joint  ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, and  enterprises wholly owned by a foreign investor, and treats them  differently, its incentives in such areas as taxation, methods  of raising capital, and degree of market openness becoming  progressively less generous as we go down the three kinds of  enterprises. This arrangement is a magnet for Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan capital because as a form of investment, the joint  venture is the right choice for most investors from those places  who are small-time investors or who want to build small or  medium-sized enterprises. In contrast, most investors from the  United States and Europe are well-heeled multinational  corporations which have a long investment history, which are  technologically advanced, and which traditionally invest heavily  overseas. For these corporations, setting up a wholly  foreign-owned enterprise in China is better suited to their  needs. The practice of favoring joint ventures helps attract  capital from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan but works against the  effort to woo investors in the United States and Europe.    III. Measures To Improve the Pattern of Origins of Foreign  Capital    Laws adopted to encourage an inflow of Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan capital into China are well-intentioned, but objectively  the results have not been satisfactory. To improve the pattern  of origins of direct foreign investment and hence eliminate  their negative effects on the distribution of foreign  investment, it is proposed that:    1) Enterprises financed by foreign investment should be  regulated by a single set of rules. China distinguishes among  three different kinds of enterprises financed by foreign  investment and has adopted different legislation to regulate  them separately. The idea is to encourage foreign investors to  invest in China by setting up joint ventures. However, in recent  years it is foreign-funded enterprises that have been growing  the fastest. As enterprises financed by foreign investment  mature and develop, the formulation of a single law  for""enterprises financed by foreign investment"" has become a top  priority in foreign investment legislation in China. Moreover,  no time should be wasted in preparing related legislation, such  as an ""Insurance Law,"" ""Anti-Illegitimate Competition Law,"" and  ""Mortgage Law.""    2) Considering the fact that Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  capital makes up an excessive share of all direct foreign  investment and that most of it goes into small projects, China's  investment incentives should bias in favor of large- and  medium-sized projects. The larger an enterprise financed by  foreign investment, the more extensive its area of related  operations, the more advanced and scientific its methods of  management, and the greater its overall social benefits. Thus,  building more large- and medium-sized enterprises financed by  foreign investment will accelerate the modernization of China's  industry and is in line with the need for China to participate  in global competition and cooperation. Accordingly, we must  offer special incentives to large- and medium-sized enterprises  financed by foreign capital, giving priority to their  applications to ensure that production needs are met. Needless  to say, to be effective, the policy of favoring large- and  medium-sized enterprises must go hand in hand with the  industrial incentive policy.    3) Open up the domestic market selectively, step by step. It  is the large markets inside developing countries that mainly  attract developed nations in Europe and the United States to  invest in them. In this repect, China, with its vast territory  and huge population has an overwhelming edge. In my opinion, we  should target large- and medium-sized projects,  technology-intensive projects, and projects in primary  industries such as agriculture, energy, and transportation as we  open up the domestic market. In view of the fact that China's  price system has not been sorted out and the practice of  underpricing certain primary products, including energy and raw  materials, we should give enterprises financed by foreign  capital more leeway in setting the prices of their products. In  industries whose development the government is trying to  promote, foreign enterprises should be allowed to charge higher  prices than official prices.     "

Castro and the high-level delegation accompanying him  arrived  in Cuba at 2119 GMT and were welcomed by Army General Raul  Castro, vice president of the Council of State and Council of  Ministers and Armed Forces chief, and other ranking leaders.    Fidel Castro's arrival in South Africa on 9 May to attend  Mandela's presidential inauguration ceremony was a milestone in  the traditional ties of friendship and solidarity between Havana  and Africa.    The Cuban president and his entourage held several bilateral  meetings in Pretoria with over 20 statesmen and well-known  figures from Africa and the Middle East. Castro also granted  interviews to various news media from South Africa and other  countries.    Significant and historic were among the descriptives used by  sources close to Fidel Castro in reference to his conversation  with the African National Congress (ANC) leader and new  President Nelson Mandela, to whom Castro expressed Cuba's  resolve to initiate and develop multilateral cooperation.    Another important event was the establishment of diplomatic  relations between both states on 11 May, based on a protocol  signed by Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto  Robaina and Alfred Nzo, respectively. This, reports indicated,  was the first foreign policy decision of the new ANC government.    Fidel Castro thus concluded a tour that began in Barbados,  where he attended the First World Conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May.    At that regional forum, he urged developed nations to stop  polluting the environment and called for the equitable  distribution of wealth in the world to bridge the growing gap  between poor and wealthy states.    After the meeting in the Barbadian capital, where he also  met  with dignitaries and well-known conference attendees, the Cuban  president visited Ghana in western Africa during a technical  stopover en route to South Africa.    His stay in Accra, although brief, was considered official  by  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who welcomed Castro at  Katoka Airport for a friendly meeting.    The Cuban delegation, comprised also of National Assembly  President Ricardo Alarcon and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of  science, technology, and environment, traveled from Pretoria to  Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which, in July 1993, hosted the Third  Ibero-American Summit.    On that stopover en route to Havana, the head of the Cuban  Revolution also conducted various official activities with the  authorities in Salvador de Bahia, capital of Bahia State, who,  last night, gave a reception in his honor at Ondina Palace,  headquarters of the state government.

Even though  the visit to Burkina Faso by Velayati and the high-ranking  political delegation accompanying him is the second phase of our  foreign minister's tour that began on Tuesday, the delegation  actually stopped in two countries before arriving in Burkina  Faso. In addition to meeting and talking with officials of  Guinea, the delegation stopped briefly at the airport in the  Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on its way to Burkina Faso and talked  with the Chadian foreign minister.    During the meeting between the Iranian and Chadian foreign  ministers, Chad requested that the Islamic Republic of Iran  assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation  among countries of the South. This request is vitally important  to Chad, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield  in southern Chad.    In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on  economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Tehran and  Conakry, including discussions on cooperation in the  exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of  hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways.    In Burkina Faso our foreign minister and his delegation met  with the prime minister and discussed political and economic  relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the  initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic  and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a  joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic  cooperation between Tehran and Ouagadougou. To acquaint the  government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high  economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition  including products and industries of Islamic Iran be set up in  Ouagadougou.    Iran's diplomatic activities in Africa are of interest to  political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first  is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of  Iran strengthens the position of Muslims in Africa, especially  in Black Africa. The second is that this activity is  significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis  the array of forces by the North against the South. The third  is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and  political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with  experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial  experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an  important objective in our country's diplomatic policy.    At any rate, Tehran's new look toward Africa has attracted  the attention of many political experts.     "

After an intense competition among international merchant banks for the right to represent the country, the new government in May appointed Goldman Sachs as its agent to secure a grading from the leading agencies, who are expected to announce their assessment later this year. Although South Africa has long borrowed money on European markets without a rating, it wants access to the American market, hence the the new move. Following the successful agreement with international banks on a repayment schedule for outstanding debt that had been caught in the 1985 standstill, and given its new-found political stability, the country feels the time is ripe to make formal entry into global capital markets. Depending on the success of the present initiative, a similar move into the Japanese market may follow early next year. Although political and economic uncertainty has long forced South Africa to pay a fairly hefty premium on offshore borrowing, government authorities are confident of achieving an investment grade rating of at least BBB. 'I would actually prefer a lower rating that we can improve upon, rather than a higher one which might be downgraded,' notes Mr Chris Stals, South African Reserve Bank governor. Even with the rating, however, initial borrowing is likely to be limited. The new budget makes allowance for about Dollars 500m, but Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, says that figure may well be increased, depending both on the final rating achieved and the comparative strength of international markets at the time of borrowing. The outcome of the government's initiative will also have a bearing on South African companies seeking to raise money offshore. Assurer Liberty Life recently announced plans for a Dollars 360m-Dollars 500m rights issue, and electricity utility Eskom and the Development Bank of South Africa are both likely to float issues some time later this year.

According to local officials, in the past year the city  approved the establishment of 1,134 foreign-funded projects,  with contracts involving a promised foreign investment of 3.3  billion U.S. dollars. The two figures represent sharp increases  compared with the corresponding figures of the previous year.    The officials said the total investment, as well as foreign  investment of the approved projects last year both surpassed the  related totals of the past 14 years.    The officials attributed the achievement to the fact that  since last year the city has made active efforts in launching  investment promotion activities at home and abroad, and has made  painstaking efforts to improve its investment environment.    The emergence of foreign-funded enterprises in large numbers  has greatly promoted the development of the export-oriented  economy, said the officials.    Foreign-funded enterprises have developed into the main  contributor of the city's economic growth. For instance, in  1993 foreign-funded firms in the city completed 10.8 billion  yuan-worth of industrial output value, accounting for 48 percent  of the city's industrial output value created by enterprises at  or above township level.    These foreign-funded enterprises last year exported goods  amounting to 730 million U.S. dollars, making up 80 percent of  the provincial capital's total exports.    Many of the foreign-funded enterprises have settled down in  the city's economic and technological development zones, making  these zones into areas of great vitality for economic  development.    As more and more overseas investors have begun to try their  luck in Fuzhou, many of the city's existing foreign-funded  enterprises have also started to enlarge their investment  scales. Last year 128 foreign-funded firms in the city  increased their investment, and the increase totalled 300  million U.S. dollars.    According to the officials, the city has 1,146  foreign-funded  enterprises in operation.     "

For the  previous publications, see the issues of our newspaper for 22  and 29 December 1993.    Investment in the economy of the country, that is, making  outlays for its development, means laying a foundation for the  future prosperity of society. The growth of investment means  drawing closer to a such a future; slowing investment down means  eating away at our own potential, eating away at our own selves.    What is the investment situation in the economy of Estonia  today? We must note, first, that we lack any kind of clear-cut  statistical base with regard to all sectors. Why do we lack it?  It is impossible to gather the necessary data all at once for  the tens of thousands of enterprises, mostly small and  medium-size ones, and analyze all of them to see what kinds of  processes are developing there. However, we can discuss  estimates.    So, the total volume of investment in the economy of Estonia  in nine months of 1993 came to about 2 billion kroons and, in  comparable prices, remained at the level of the corresponding  period of 1992. Under our circumstances, this is a positive  note. Investment on the whole did not decrease, although it did  not grow either, while we know how difficult the period is our  society is now going through. The enterprises themselves have a  bare minimum of funds for investment, and this is well known.    It is no accident that under the circumstances we are  placing  our bets on foreign investment, on luring foreign investors to  Estonia. We clearly lack our own capital.    However, in this instance the numbers are quite  contradictory. There are statistical data, but they take into  account only foreign investment as of the moment of the  establishment of a given joint venture or foreign enterprise.  This is their original contribution, and it is reflected by  statistics. However, current contributions to already operating  joint ventures or foreign enterprises, or the same enterprises  established earlier, do not show up in the statistics.    According to statistical data, the following quite  approximate picture emerges. As of the end of the first quarter  of 1993, the volume of foreign investment came to just 2.2  billion kroons, and by the end of the third quarter, had  increased to 2.5 billion kroons. That is to say, the total  volume of investment during the year, as has already been noted,  remained at the same level--2.2 billion kroons during the year,  but the share of foreign investors increased. How are these  numbers to be evaluated?    There is a council of experts at the Institute for the Study  of Trends. This council believes that the course of the  investment process is unsatisfactory; there is little  investment, more is necessary.    However, this is after all a maximalist approach. We wish  well, but realistic potential must be taken into account, too.  It is good in and of itself that we are registering a continuous  growth of foreign investment, although of course more can be  desired.    It is also necessary to note that at present only one-fourth  of all investment goes to industry, and the rest goes to other  sectors. In other words, a process of structural changes in the  economy is underway. Indeed, industry used to be the sector that  got investment first. Foreign investors now understand that this  is not the best investment there is, and are investing in the  service and trade sectors. Therefore, structural changes in the  economy occur in our country under the influence of foreign  capital, among other things.    Statistical data indicate that during the nine months of  1993  foreign investment came to 625 million kroons, of which 208  million kroons were in the third quarter. In turn, according to  the balance of payments, that is, data from the Bank of Estonia,  it turns out that in the nine months of 1993 foreign investment  came to 1.5 billion kroons. We have already said which data show  up in the statistics and which do not. The discrepancy results  precisely from this. Therefore, the data of the Bank of Estonia  should be considered closer to the truth.    Who precisely are the largest foreign investors? They are  companies from Sweden and Finland. The volume of investment by  Russia keeps decreasing. In the third quarter of 1993 Russia  merely ranked seventh, with a volume of investment of 8 million  kroons.    Data on investment in its own economy are published in  Russia  accurately, quarter after quarter. Naturally, the high rate of  inflation hampers foreign investors, and a drop in the volume is  being registered. Nonetheless, the level of investment remains  quite high. Thus in the first quarter of 1993 the volume of  investment came to 97 percent compared to the corresponding  period of 1992, and in the third quarter--93 percent.    The total volume of foreign investment in Russia came to $7  billion as of the end of the second quarter of 1993. Germany and  the United States are the main investors.    If we compare the per capita volumes of foreign investment  in  Russia and in our country (based on statistical data), we will  obtain $46 for Russia and $115 for Estonia in the first half of  1993.    Here are a few more numbers. In Russia the number of joint  ventures comes to 7,000, and in Estonia--4,000. These are  absolute numbers, and they speak volumes. At present Estonia  amounts to a more attractive bridgehead for foreign investors  than Russia.     "

First the press  provided information on the upcoming joint exercise by the U.S.  3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th Motorized Rifle  Division for the purpose of rehearsing cooperation in  peacemaking actions. A little later we learned of the bombing  strikes by U.S. peacemakers in the south of Bosnia. The  southern Urals and southern Bosnia are separated by many  thousands of kilometers, but the upcoming event and the past one  are tied up in a tight and intricate logical knot.    Our own correspondent Ivan Gavrilenko reports that the news  of the military maneuvers on the Totskiy range elicited a  sharply negative reaction from the peasants of Orenburg Oblast,  which was singed by the flash from the first atomic explosion  conducted in the Soviet Union.    Until recently the Totskiy range, where the exercise is  planned, was top-secret. This region also has other military  installations which are of undoubted interest to foreign  specialists, and it has to be thought that the Pentagon will  certainly not be sending new recruits to Russia.    We have managed to ascertain from the Ground Forces Main  Staff that the measure is being conducted in accordance with the  plan of contacts between the armed forces of Russia and the  United States. No more than 250 servicemen will be involved on  each side. The Americans will land up to 50 units of wheeled  equipment at the Totskiy Training Center, where they have  already been to reconnoiter. Joint actions will be rehearsed as  part of a peacemaking force from 6 through 14 July.    A detail of some importance: In the opinion of the military,  this measure will not require of us any unplanned expenditure,  since one of the 27th Division's regiments is due to hold a  planned exercise at precisely that time. But the Americans will  have to fork out $2 million. They will pay our military to  operate engineer equipment and for fuel, lubricants, water,  food, and all the services provided. So there is even an  opportunity to earn a little currency.    In general, the Russian military leaders have, at first  sight, undertaken a good and profitable thing. It is  undoubtedly necessary to strengthen and develop contacts between  the two countries' armies. But how are we to avoid the  importunate questions of fellow citizens? Why do the Americans  need to send over their aircraft together with servicemen and  hardware from the German city of Wuerzburg, where the 3d  Infantry Division is stationed, right over to the Urals, deep  inside Russia? Would it not be simpler to hold exercises of a  very simple nature at Khodynskoye Pole, for example, or  somewhere in Moscow Oblast?    Interest is also aroused by the NATO division's highly  original service record. It performed ""peacemaking"" combat  operations in Korea and Iraq. Where will future itineraries  take it? To the former Yugoslavia, maybe. General M. Rose,  commander of the UN troops, needs just such decisive combined  units. The whole world shuddered at the blasts of the bombs  dropped by NATO aircraft in southern Bosnia, but the general is  insisting on new strikes. The U.S. President has pronounced a  sentence which sounded roughly as follows: We work closely with  Gen. Rose, and I believe that his aggressiveness is a good thing.    Here are peacemakers for you!    Our newspaper has already written about the political  aspects  of the recent NATO action. Let us touch on the military  aspects. We are seeing for the umpteenth time that NATO has  very mediocre airmen in its ranks. Obviously embarrassed, a  White House official spokesperson recently declared on  television that one of the U.S. pilots tried to drop four bombs  on the Serbs, but succeeded in releasing just three, and two of  them did not explode. It also is not entirely clear what was  destroyed as a result of the bombing strikes -- a tank or a  medical vehicle. It is perfectly clear that peaceful people  died as a result of those raids.    It is worth recalling that U.S. pilots were also  distinguished by similar results in Iraq three years ago: They  aimed at military targets but hit peaceful houses and even their  own positions. Incidentally, they have also distinguished  themselves during these days: They downed two of their own  helicopters with accurate rocket fire and dispatched 26 officers  to the next world.    The punitive actions undertaken by the United Nations  without  coordination with Russia have sharply exacerbated the situation  and galvanized combat operations by the opposing sides. But  maybe the politicians will realize that neither bombs nor  missiles can bring the Serbs to their knees. Only a peaceful  way out of the crisis will be productive.     "

The initiative was devised at a summit of leaders of black church groups here  Tuesday and Wednesday. The denominations represented at the meeting -- the  African Methodist Episcopal Church, AME Zion Church, Christian Methodist  Episcopal Church, Church of God in Christ, National Baptist Convention of  America, National Baptist Convention U.S.A. and the Progressive National  Baptist Convention -- have a combined membership of 19 million.

The discussions were carried  on in neighboring countries because delegation members had been denied visas to  enter South Africa.    The leaders vowed at the meeting to engage their memberships in actions that  would support:    * Stronger U.S. economic sanctions against South Africa. In particular, they  pledged support for a bill by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-California) that would impose further sanctions on South Africa.    * U.S. economic aid for the black-ruled states that border South Africa. The  church leaders said South Africa has punished these nations economically and  militarily for their opposition to apartheid.    * An end to U.S. backing for the South Africa-supported rebels trying to  overthrow the government of Angola, which has had the aid of Cuban troops. The  group also said it would seek a meeting with President-elect George Bush, who  has assured Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of continued U.S. support.    * The international boycott of Shell Oil Co., which has clashed with  anti-apartheid activists and churches over its activities in South Africa.    Boesak said at the meeting that U.S. sanctions against South Africa have been  effective and that they played a role in South Africa's recent decision to  settle conflicts in Namibia and Angola. As part of the U.S.-brokered  settlement, South Africa agreed to withdraw its forces from Namibia and to end  its aid to Savimbi's anticommunist rebels; Angola agreed to an evacuation of  Cuban troops. Boesak also said the sanctions have helped cool South Africa's  economy, which has made it harder for the country to maintain its military  campaigns.

The IAEA also has sent a purchase order for $160,000 for the  cobalt-60 the plant will require.    Perishable foodstuffs will be irradiated at the plant in  order to preserve them for export. Roots, for example, may be  preserved for eight months without spoiling. According to their  natural properties, fruits have different preservative lives.     "

A fast-breeder reactor, which can turn spent uranium into  usable plutonium while producing electricity, is one of the core  facilities for nuclear-fuel recycling.    The postponement is partly a reflection of the increasingly  cautious attitude toward the use of plutonium among Western  nations, including the U.S., Britain, Germany, and France, which  have already suspended research into this new type of reactor,  experts said.    A further factor in the delay is that the project will cost  1.5 times as much as the construction of a light-water reactor,  which can generate the same amount of electricity, officials  said. Also, the construction will be time-consuming.    The planned reactor, designed to generate 670,000kw of  electricity, is intended to be a follow-up to the Monju  fast-breeder reactor in Fukui Prefecture. Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. is preparing to put Monju into  full operation with an output capacity of 280,000kw.    The federation has set up a panel comprised of senior  officials of nine electric power companies to discuss the timing  of the building of the new reactor. In an interim report, the  panel decided to propose that the construction be postponed.     "

So argues political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba in a  commentary published in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27  May on page 16. Mandela, the commentary continues, ""is so firmly  committed to allaying the fears -- perceived and real -- of  whites and the business community that he is in danger of soon  finding himself a captive of white South Africa."" Nyatsumba  cites as examples of Mandela's efforts to appeal to the white  community his state of the nation address in which he ""unveiled  remarkably moderate plans"" and Mandela's decision to appoint  Leon Wessels as deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly  despite the ANC parliamentary caucus decision to nominate  Bridgit Mabandla to the position. The commentary argues that  there is now a need for ""a voice to the left of the ANC...in  Parliament to remind the new ANC-led government of its  responsibility to the black masses."" Nyatsumba concludes his  commentary: ""For Mandela's own sake, for the ANC's and indeed  the whole country's we must hope our leaders will be able to  combine reconcilatory moves with concrete steps, to send a  message that the lot of blacks will not stay the same, and that  some sacrifices by those who have been beneficiaries of  apartheid in the past will have to be made.""    WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN    KwaZulu Land Deal -- A brief editorial in the Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN in English on page 28 of its 27 May  to 2  June issue keeps alive the recent KwaZulu land transfer. The  editorial says that while President Mandela, ""master unifier  that he is,"" might have been expected ""to play down the  seriousness"" of the ""secret land deal,"" no one else has ""to fall  in step."" The paper sees the incident as ""an early test of the  way in which this country will work under the government of  national unity. The government, without effective parliamentary  opposition, will try and brush aside embarrassing conflicts  and...encourage the media to go along with this."" ""We won't,""  promises the paper.

We ""welcome the President's approach in making the  RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] a `people-driven'  process."" ""This approach played a critical role in giving a  voice to voters' needs and also shaped the programme of action  which was pursued by their leaders. It would be tragic if we  were to fail like the United States of America did during the  presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when the privileged white  community proved unwilling to share their material success with  people of other races."" The South African plan should succeed,  however, because it ""is aimed at unlocking the energies of the  multitudes who were denied the opportunities given their white  counterparts through the country's draconian apartheid laws.""    BEELD    Mandela's Parliamentary Address Viewed -- ""A people-centered  community -- this was the theme and refrain yesterday of  President Nelson Mandela's opening address in Parliament,""  begins a page 12 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg  BEELD on 25 May. ""Freedom and human dignity formed the basis of  the vision offered by Mr. Mandela, and the fact that he  mentioned the word vision confirms that he is aware of his task  -- that is, leading through inspiration. If the New South  Africa accepts these ideals then a good future awaits the people  of this country, and a people-centered community will be  established. Each government must have a philosophy, but that  alone will not create jobs or feed mouths. The real test will  be in the program of action -- the practicality of the policies,  the management, and the good leadership by government in  realizing the above."" ""Our impression is that President  Mandela's approach reflects a reasonable and sound policy.""    Country's Admission to OAU `Positive'-- A second editorial  on  the same page notes that ""South Africa's formal admission to the  Organization of African Unity is the fulfillment of a dream.  This will have a positive influence on the country itself, on  southern Africa, as well as in the rest of Africa."" ""For as  long as whites withheld equal rights from their fellow citizens  this dream would have been impossible to realize. Africa was  often placed in a serious dilemma because of South Africa. The  advantages of technical and economic contact often overcame  ideological aversion to the 'apartheid regime'. In addition to  this Africa was often guilty of worse atrocities than those it  accused the 'regime' of. Now that South Africa is allowed to  fulfill its rightful role, South Africans should not expect too  much, because Africa and the OAU carries very little weight  globally. In befriending the rest of Africa, South Africa  should not neglect its most valuable friend, the West.""     "

Hideaki Kumano, vice minister at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI), was referring to an  accord on industrial cooperation between the two countries for  increased foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market.  The agreement was reached during a two-day regular meeting in  Hawaii that ended Wednesday.    Japan agreed to a U.S. request for Tokyo's efforts to help  expand use of U.S.-made microchips by Japan's automobile,  telecommunications and game equipment sectors.    The Japanese Government is prepared to encourage these  industrial sectors to step up purchases of U.S. semiconductors,  Kumano told a press conference. But he added that does not  represent ""any government guarantee"" that the foreign share of  Japan's market will stay above the benchmark 20 percent.    Kumano noted that the government does not ensure any results  on ongoing voluntary efforts within the auto industry to expand  purchases of U.S.-made auto parts and automobiles.    ""It is impossible for the government to ensure results  regarding private-sector matters,"" he said.    On Japan's restraints on car exports to the U.S., Kumano  said  MITI has yet to decide if it will extend the practice for fiscal  1994 starting in April. U.S. officials have said there is no  need for Japan to continue the restraints.     "

This is the first sharp rise in more than a dozen years,  when  the bank has been putting China's per capita GNP at around 370  to 380 dollars.    China used to be the 11th largest economy. But in ""world  development indicators"" released today, China's GNP ranks the  eighth, after the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain  and Canada.    With a total population of 1.16 billion, China is now the  28th poorest country in the world, according to the World Bank's  updated list.    Since 1980 when China joined the World Bank, there has been  little change in the calculation of China's GNP. ""World Bank  Atlas"" published in December put China's per capita wealth at  380 dollars.    According to sources from the China executive director's  office, the bank started to reevaluate China's GNP early this  year.    The change of methodology, bank officials said in  interviews,  is aimed at more accurately reflecting the changing nature of  China's economy, which grew 12.8 percent and 13 percent in 1992  and 1993 respectively.    Since 1981, the bank has supported 140 projects in China,  with cumulative lending at 18.6 billion dollars.

The report's lack of confidence in the private sector raises the danger of  allowing Africa to repeat the errors of the past when bureaucracies paralyzed  progress. If nothing else, the report may serve to underscore one issue on  which all agree, and that is the desperate need for more money. The United  States, for example, has failed to provide the increased aid promised in  exchange for economic reform, but the debt relief plan announced Thursday by  President Bush will help many nations significantly.    Africa stands out among the developing continents, the only region where there  has been a decline in almost every element of society and the economies. Unlike  Asia and Latin America, Africa is seeing a steady decline in per capita food  supplies and per capita gross national product, despite what had been a  relatively high flow of aid. That has now reversed into a net outflow because  of declining new credits and debt repayment burdens. Internal organizational  failures have been made worse by the collapse of prices for primary commodities  on which most African nations depend for export earnings. Droughts and civil  wars have compounded the misery, flooding already impoverished nations with  tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring states.    Some of the ECA report's proposals may contribute constructively to fine-tuning  the essential reforms to minimize the impact on the already impoverished  people. It may be possible to do that without turning off the flow of resources  so urgently needed. That, however, will require a process of collaboration and  consultation rather than the confrontation that appears implicit in the new  report.

The United  States, for example, has failed to provide the increased aid promised in  exchange for economic reform, but the debt relief plan announced Thursday by  President Bush will help many nations significantly.    Africa stands out among the developing continents, the only region where there  has been a decline in almost every element of society and the economies. Unlike  Asia and Latin America, Africa is seeing a steady decline in per capita food  supplies and per capita gross national product, despite what had been a  relatively high flow of aid. That has now reversed into a net outflow because  of declining new credits and debt repayment burdens. Internal organizational  failures have been made worse by the collapse of prices for primary commodities  on which most African nations depend for export earnings. Droughts and civil  wars have compounded the misery, flooding already impoverished nations with  tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring states.    Some of the ECA report's proposals may contribute constructively to fine-tuning  the essential reforms to minimize the impact on the already impoverished  people. It may be possible to do that without turning off the flow of resources  so urgently needed. That, however, will require a process of collaboration and  consultation rather than the confrontation that appears implicit in the new  report.      Editorial    "

0,FT934-7752 ,"FT934-7752 _AN-DKRC7AGCFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (1): A new nation starts to take shape - Nearly four years after Nelson Mandela's release, South Africa begins a fresh era      By PATTI WALDMEIR   YESTERDAY South Africa broke the twisted mould of apartheid, and cast away the bits. After decades spent fighting the tide of history, which submerged other racist regimes long ago, South Africa yesterday opted to join the modern world. It can now play a full role at the United Nations, rejoin the Commonwealth, become a member of the Organisation of African Unity, and play a much-needed, constructive role in the development of southern Africa and beyond. Yesterday's agreement on a post-apartheid constitution is the first irrevocable step on the path to full democracy; but it is only a first step. The next few months and years will show whether South Africa's tenure as a democratic nation will be nasty, brutish and short, or stable, happy and prosperous; whether it will substitute black domination for white repression; whether it will defy the logic of divided societies worldwide, and nurture true multi-ethnic democracy. Though the mould of apartheid has been broken, Africa provides other unfortunate models for the new state: tyrannical regimes which abused power, crushed dissent and lay waste whole economies through maladministration, corruption and theft. South African politicians, black and white, bridle at the comparison: Finance Minister Derek Keys offers the consensus view when he insists that South Africa 'will be totally different from the rest of Africa. It always has been and it always will be'. Economically, that is obviously so. Mr Keys points to South Africa's clear superiority in terms of 'indigenous capital', both human and financial. The new leaders will manage the continent's most powerful economy, with gross domestic product equal to 75 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's gdp, with an economic hinterland which stretches as far north as Zaire, generating half of Africa's electricity. Even in broader international terms, it compares well: with a well developed stock market, banking sector, and body of company law, South Africa offers more to the investor than, for example, eastern Europe; and with foreign debt at USDollars 17.3bn, or 15 per cent of gdp, it is underborrowed by any standard. In political terms, too, South Africa is different. In 1957, when Ghana became the first African nation to gain independence from Britain, Kwame Nkrumah inherited a position of largely unfettered power. But South Africa's first black president - likely to be the African National Congress leader, Nelson Mandela - will find his room for manoeuvre far more circumscribed, in law, and more importantly, in fact. 'South Africa is too big for the ANC,' says one ANC member who bemoans the complexity of a society which imposes manifold constraints on the party of government: he believes they will inhibit the ANC's ability to transform South Africa virtuously; others welcome these constraints as curbs to abuse of power. But all would agree that South Africa does not fit the classic African mould of a society which easily falls prey to bad government. Strong interest groups counterbalance the power of government: chief among them is a strong, diversified and battle-hardened corporate sector; the 1.2m-strong labour federation Cosatu, historically allied to the ANC, has recently begun flexing its independent muscle, and is well organised and powerful enough to play the role of democracy's watchdog. The highly politicised and motivated township 'civics', or community associations, could also prove an important check on government power: for South Africa's 'masses' are not the fawning crowd which greeted Kwame Nkrumah, African liberator; they are demanding, well organised, and used to fighting their political corner. The list of powerful interest groups outside the ANC's sphere goes on and on: the 1.2m strong civil service is dominated by Afrikaners, who are scarcely natural allies of the ANC. The defence force, though professional and committed to supporting the government of the day, is also Afrikaans-dominated, as is the police. Last, and arguably least of the factors constraining an ANC government, is the constitution agreed yesterday by the main political parties. That constitution was meant to prevent majority domination through power sharing: it was supposed to guarantee democracy by ensuring that the minority losers in any majority-rule election would still enjoy a powerful say in government. It falls some way short of so doing: minorities will be represented in government, with every party earning 5 per cent of the national vote entitled to a seat in cabinet; but the power of minority parties in cabinet is precarious. The ANC, which will have both a president and a deputy president, will have its own way on any disputed decision. And though it has promised regular consultation with the second deputy president, drawn from the second largest party (probably Mr FW de Klerk, current president), he will have no statutory powers to frustrate Mr Mandela's will. The constitution fails to deliver other checks and balances which the ruling National Party had insisted were essential. The party's 1991 constitutional proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not interfere'. In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional governments: the constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms so vague (to impose uniform national norms and standards, to ensure proper regulation, and where there are implications for national security or economic policy) as seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred from imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'. National Party negotiators believe that they will not need entrenched constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC: they believe the ANC's assurances that it does not wish to govern alone (and does not believe it could do so effectively); and they judge their electoral strength will give them an important say in cabinet, though only if they are able to better their poll showing of 11 to 13 per cent. But clearly, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on crucial issues; probably, it had no choice. As a minority government whose power diminishes by the day, negotiators calculated that a deal done now would be preferable to that available next month or next year. And whatever the shortcomings of the constitution, agreement is better than continuing deadlock. Though it is not strong enough, it is far from illiberal, and should help to reinforce democratic forces. But if South Africa does escape some of the more grotesque abuses of power for which Africa is famous, it is scarcely likely to become a prosperous liberal democracy overnight. The new bill of rights enshrines tough emergency powers which can be used to restore stability after the April 27 elections. Agreement seems to exist between the ANC and NP that restoring stability, through temporary repression, is the highest post-election priority. According to this scenario, democracy will be a temporary casualty while the new government pursues stability and economic development; and if it succeeds in restoring law and order without repeating the oppression of the past, it will be widely popular with an electorate (white and black) fed up with crime and violence. Much will depend on whether the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be persuaded to participate in next year's elections: though he has made clear that he rejects yesterday's constitution, he could decide he has more to gain by fighting rather than boycotting an election. If he actively opposes the poll, the security situation could become untenable, especially if the white right wing, now in tactical alliance with Inkatha, also opposes the election. The ANC and NP must guarantee that there is critical mass at the political centre, and that the crackdown need only suppress the lunatic fringe. If Inkatha and the right wing, with their numbers and their firepower, are to be suppressed in unison, stability may be unattainable. But in the end, it is economics - and not politics - which will seal South Africa's fate. For yesterday's constitution marks a decisive shift in electoral power from the 'haves' to the 'have-nots' of South African society.' Popular expectations will soon strain the intentions of even the most benevolent government; at that point, it must either give in to populism, or suppress it. The latter now seems most likely: the new South Africa will start with a hefty dollop of the old. That will be unfortunate, but bearable; what will destroy South Africa's democratic prospects forever is failure to deliver a better economic deal to the masses. It is a tall order.

The officials said this figure is 85 percent up from 1992,  and represents 60 percent of the province's agricultural and  industrial output value in that year.    In 1993 the province's village and township industrial  enterprises produced an industrial value of 68.7 billion yuan,  exported 17 billion yuan-worth of goods and contributed a total  of eight billion yuan to the state coffers in taxes, the  officials noted.    According to the officials, the shareholding system has  proved to be especially suitable for rural enterprises.    In 1993 the province registered 19,000 rural joint stock  companies with a total capital of more than 10 billion yuan.    In Zhangzhou city alone over 4,000 stock companies were  launched in 1993, representing 80 percent of the newly-formed  rural enterprises. They boast a total registered capital of 800  million yuan.    Over the past year, while launching 1,800 joint ventures  with  overseas businesses, rural enterprises in the province also  started 31 ventures abroad, the officials said.    In 1993 rural enterprises received 800 million U.S. dollars  of overseas investment, which accounted for 40 percent of their  total capital input in the year. They also gained 3.9 billion  yuan in investment from other Chinese regions.    In the same period rural enterprises formed 94 group  companies and launched 700 industrial development areas. One of  them, the Fuxing Development Area on the outskirts of this  provincial capital, has 132 projects in operation or under  construction. Supported by 300 million U.S. dollars in  contracted overseas investment, its production value is expected  to reach one billion yuan a year.    The officials said rural enterprises have greatly boosted  the  economies of the rural areas and increased the incomes of  farmers. The province now has 69 villages each with an annual  production value of 100 million yuan.     "

The ceremony was presided over by Army General Raul Castro,  second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who moments before the ceremony  made exclusive comments for this newscast:    [Begin Castro recording] This is the most important event of  the century, and Mandela -- I was thinking the other day -- is  the greatest leader of the century. I even dare say the greatest  leader Africa has had in its long history.    As you know, ceremonies such as this are being held in over  150 mausoleums nationwide as a salute to the death of apartheid;  the birth of the new South Africa; and to remember our comrades  whose blood and effort, as leaders of the ANC including Mandela  have pointed out, were instrumental in reaching 10 May, a day  such as today. This is a highly moving day for us, a day of deep  remembrance and immense gratitude toward all our dead comrades.  Once again, this shows that in a third country -- first Angola,  then Namibia, and now South Africa -- the effort and the  bloodshed were not in vain.

According to the  GCA's African Population Advisory Committee (APAC) report  presented in Harare, nine million adults in Africa were infected  with the HIV virus.    The report was presented by prof H Okoth-Ogendo on behalf of  Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, the current APAC chairman,  the ZIANA news agency reported.    The session was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert  Mugabe, Botswana's President Kethumile Masire and other  dignitaries.    The report said many African countries, including Zimbabwe,  had the highest HIV prevalance among adults worldwide.    AIDS was also increasing health care costs while orphaning  large numbers of children and leaving many elderly people  without protection.    The report said advances made in health and welfare were  being eroded by AIDS and it quoted United Nations Children's  Emergency Fund estimates as showing that under-five mortality  rates were likely to be pushed back to the 1960s level.    ""In summary, the epidemic will likely increase the number of  people in poverty and thwart efforts to develop sectors that  rely on skilled or scarce manpower.""    The report noted African efforts to contain the virus had  had  mixed results. Zimbabwe, along with six other African countries,  had been successful in changing behaviour through use of condoms.    APAC recommended focusing prevention programmes on the  youth,  making condoms easily available and improving management  programmes to control the AIDS epidemic.     "

AFRICA LEAVES 11 DEAD      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      A bitter dispute over South Africa's homelands policy erupted in weekend  rioting, leaving nine black police officers and two civilians dead in  Leeuwfontein, a village recently forced by Pretoria to become part of the  nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana.    Bophuthatswana police went door to door Sunday, arresting at least several  hundred residents of the town, including two key tribal leaders. And police  helicopters scoured the countryside for others who had fled onto white-owned  farms in South Africa seeking refuge. By nightfall, only a few women and  children remained in the shacks of the rural community of 18,000.    The melee came six months after South Africa's white minority-led government  decreed that Leeuwfontein and next-door Braklaagte were to become part of  Bophuthatswana, a homeland comprising seven separate tracts of land inside  South Africa. So far, court challenges to the South African proclamation have  been unsuccessful, and the angry residents are seeking permission to appeal.      'A Desperate Point'    ""It had reached a very desperate point where people had lost faith in anything  ever returning to normal,"" Aninka Claassens, a spokesman for the Transvaal  Rural Action Committee, said in an interview Sunday night. ""They had tried  everything.""    The Action Committee provides legal support for Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte and  has worked extensively in the towns, about 180 miles northwest of Johannesburg.    The violence was the latest in a series of incidents that have hampered  Pretoria's 13-year-old attempt to force blacks into ethnic homelands, thereby  depriving them of their South African citizenship. More than 11 million of  South Africa's 26 million blacks live in 10 homelands, four of which, like  Bophuthatswana, have been declared independent states but remain almost totally  dependent on South Africa.      Little Recognition    Most of the world refuses to recognize the Pretoria-created homelands as  sovereign states. In fact, international anti-apartheid groups have  consistently called on entertainers to boycott the Sun City casino resort,  which is located in Bophuthatswana and pays taxes to its 12-year-old black  government.    The latest trouble broke out Saturday afternoon during a meeting of several  thousand Leeuwfontein residents that was called to discuss the efforts to  extricate themselves from Bophuthatswana's control. The town's population had  swelled because it was the end of the month and many migrant workers had  returned home with their paychecks.    Some residents said fighting erupted after police arrived to break up the  meeting. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and  witnesses said they heard automatic weapons fire.      Four Officers Killed    The Bophuthatswana authorities said four police officers were killed when their  armored personnel carrier was destroyed by a gasoline bomb. South African  authorities, who last year stepped in to put down an attempted military coup  d'etat in Bophuthatswana's capital, Mmabatho, said they were not involved in  the weekend incidents.    But Paul van der Merwe, a farmer who lives near Leeuwfontein, said he saw South  African security forces on Sunday conferring with Bophuthatswana police  officials on a remote section of his farm, in South Africa just outside the  Bophuthatswana border.    Van der Merwe said dozens of residents of Leeuwfontein have used his farm to  escape harassment by the Bophuthatswana police in recent months. And the farmer  has refused requests by South African and Bophuthatswana authorities to press  charges against the villagers for trespassing, saying he relies on them to help  him plant and harvest his 4,000-acre farm and ranch.    ""I'm not going to do that. We are neighbors,"" he said.    Before Jan. 1, the land that includes Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte had been part  of South Africa, in between two distinct sections of Bophuthatswana. The  government proclamation incorporating the two villages into the homeland  surprised most residents, who said they had not been consulted, as required by  South African law.    The two communities didn't want to lose their South African citizenship, but  they also feared retribution from Bophuthatswana authorities. The region's  Tswana tribal chiefs have been violently opposed to Bophuthatswana's South  Africa-supported president, Lucas Manyane Mangope, also a Tswana chief, since  the 1950s.      Patrolled by Police    Since they became part of Bophuthatswana, Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte have been  heavily patrolled by the homeland police, and sporadic violence has been  reported. Eighty people were injured during a police raid in Leeuwfontein in  March, and residents said that the authorities beat or arrested anyone who  refused to say they loved Bophuthatswana.    About one-third of South Africa's residents -- or about half of the nation's  blacks -- live in the homelands, which cover only 13% of the country's land  area. Pretoria's original intent was to counter the increasing demands for  black voting rights in South Africa by creating independent states outside  white-designated South Africa where the country's voteless black majority could  exercise their political rights.    But the policy has been a drain on Pretoria's coffers, and it has come under  heavy criticism from outside and inside the government in recent years. South  Africa spends more than $1 billion annually supporting the homeland  governments, but, because the land is generally rugged and the homeland leaders  often corrupt, poverty remains endemic.

0,FT943-13709 ,"FT943-13709 _AN-EGRD8AFUFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (36): Fresh markets opening - The tourist industry      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   The Umngazi River Bungalow Hotel nestles sleepily in its Indian Ocean cove, where rollers break on the crescent-shaped white beach, deserted but for a lone fisherman and two dogs, gambolling in the adjoining lagoon. Anywhere else in the world it would be the retreat of the rich, a private playground in an unspoilt environment. It's within easy reach from Johannesburg - a 60-minute flight east to Umtata, and then an hour's drive through the green hills of what used to be the Transkei homeland. On the cove's grassy slopes are scattered 42 bungalows. A tennis court and swimming pool are in easy reach, while alongside the jetty on the river which feeds the lagoon, a motorboat stands ready for fishing or bird-spotting expeditions. The hotel is not a retreat for the well-off. Dinner, bed and breakfast costs R125 a night - just over Pounds 20 - but the resort has only a handful of guests.* It is as if Umngazi is still cocooned and isolated from the outside world by the country's apartheid past. In the grim period after the mid-1980s, when Mr PW Botha, prime minister, defied the world and angry black teenagers took to the streets, Umngazi and hundreds of other resorts suffered the consequences. South Africa seemed to have put up the shutters against political reform, and the outside world shunned it: barely 250,000 tourists came to the country in 1988. But with the political transition and the inauguration of a stable government of national unity, Umngazi awaits discovery by visitors to the new South Africa. Many of those travellers who already knew what this spectacular country has to offer are looking back with something akin to guilty nostalgia to a time when a berth in the luxurious Blue Train could be obtained at short notice, or a room at the Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town with a view of Table Mountain - provided it wasn't the school holidays. Those days are well passed, for a vigorous promotion campaign is getting under way. 'Explore South Africa 95 Year' will be its theme, exploiting events such as the World Rugby Cup, the Comrades Marathon in Natal, the Million Dollar Golf Classic at Sun City and the Grahamstown festival 'The aim is to to achieve R9.5bn in foreign exchange earnings by 1996, based on 1m overseas visitor arrivals and 3.7m arrivals from Africa', says the South African Tourism Board's marketing plan. It may seem an ambitious target, but when the world discovers what South Africa has to offer it will beat a path to beaches, game parks, mountains and lakes served by an excellent transport and communications infrastructure, and offering lodges and hotels that range from budget class to the luxurious. Since the lifting of sanctions, direct air links with Australia and the US have been re-established, existing airlines have increased their services, and more than 20 new airlines are serving South Africa. Tourist sector officials acknowledge that coping with a million holidaymakers a year will strain the country's existing hotel capacity. But the sector is already preparing for a boom that will encourage hotels to upgrade their facilities and, above all, create jobs. And while the 1m target is four times the annual number of holidaymakers who came during the political traumas of the mid-1980s, Satour points to last years' figures as evidence that it is within reach. In 1993, the country earned about R6bn from 618,000 overseas tourists - 10.5 per cent up on 1992 - making the sector the fourth-largest foreign exchange earner after manufactured goods, gold and mining, and employing approximately 430,000 workers. Notwithstanding this increase, the potential has barely been tapped, say Satour officials. South Africa has less than a 1 per cent share of the international market and tourism accounts for only 2 per cent of South Africa's gross national product, compared to the world average of 6.1 per cent. There is scope for growth even in traditional strongholds. The UK is by far South Africa's largest overseas market, accounting for about 23 per cent of visitors - excluding those from Africa - and Germany is the second-largest source. But thanks to the new political environment and the number of new airlines serving Johannesburg, Satour can now exploit lucrative markets hitherto out of reach, such as India and Japan, and Scandinavia. But it is Africa itself that is expected to provide the most dramatic results, from a mere 200,000 arrivals in 1991 to a targeted 3.7m in 1996. Good news for the South African economy, but not happy reading for those who now have to share the country's scenic beauty with millions of newcomers. So don't delay: visit South Africa while the hotels are relatively cheap and underbooked, the beaches are not crowded, tourists are not fleeced, and Umngazi River Bungalows are not taken over by the package tour business. *Umngazi River Bungalows, near Port St Johns (0471) 22370   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Cairo yesterday for a three-day visit during which he will discuss establishing diplomatic links with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart. These will be the first bilateral talks between the two countries. The South African minister's arrival in Cairo follows his tour last month to Jordan, Oman and Qatar. It underlines Pretoria's determination to increase trade and investment and develop political relations in the region. Egypt, which formally applies the international embargo against South Africa, has very limited ties with the republic. These amount to the exchange of a handful of tourists and a small amount of informal import and export trade. But Egyptian officials said that once an election date and transitional executive council - which will advise the South African government before the planned elections - were named, Cairo would see no great impediment to diplomatic relations. Parties to constitutional talks in South Africa earlier this month said they hoped to fix an election date by early next month. The officials did not expect any progress on South Africa's desire to join the Organisation of African Unity, which will hold its annual summit in Cairo at the end of next month.

0,FT942-11536 ,"FT942-11536 _AN-EEED1ADQFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / Personal View: An example for the rest of Africa      By Lord CALLAGHAN   South Africa's elections were a reminder to those with jaded political palates how much the vote means when it has been denied for so long. Now comes the hard part - the fulfilment of the masses' expectations that the election of a government of their choice will in a very short time transform into reality their demands for decent housing, better schooling and more jobs. Not that their leaders were extravagant in their pre-election promises, although enthusiastic local activists over-egged the pudding. Among the national leaders, there is a sober appreciation of the tremendous tasks that they will face. I doubt whether this has gone home to the electors in the excitement of living through a truly revolutionary era. In truth, although a beginning can and must be made quickly, a levelling up process will take several years. As many as one-quarter of black people are living in miserable lean-to huts and shanty towns with flimsy housing materials, and with a lack of water, proper sanitation and electricity. The ANC believes that extra social expenditure can be financed by the faster rate of economic growth that they expect now sanctions have been lifted - and in fact the economy has already begun to expand. Another favourable factor is that the country's small international debt should permit additional borrowing, and it will have renewed access to IMF drawings and to World Bank loans. There are signs that many of the 200 to 300 overseas companies which ran down their operations as a result of sanctions are considering returning. The economy of South Africa is altogether larger and stronger than any of its neighbours. It manufactures nearly as much as the whole of sub-Saharan Africa put together and exports twice as much as all the rest. By comparison with its neighbours, it is an industrial giant in every respect. But when viewed against the industrialised west, its deficiencies are glaringly apparent. Sanctions had a bigger impact than was admitted. New investment declined seriously during the 1980s and, if it is to increase to the level at which it can sustain a fast rate of growth, the present low levels of domestic savings need to improve and a favourable climate needs to be established to encourage overseas capital to return. Both big parties in the new government favour lower tariffs and less protection with a reduction of subsidies to domestic industry. And both recognise the need to recover South Africa's international position in price and quality, despite the lack of skilled technical, managerial and professional manpower. But the incoming government must strive to formulate economic policies that will give confidence both at home and overseas, while at the same time transform the social landscape, finding work for the near 50 per cent unemployed, and deliver those basic services which the African people expect. Without economic success, the social improvements will not bear fruit. But without social reform, a democratic society would collapse, and the boldest multi-racial venture ever undertaken in Africa could dissolve in disorder or worse. It will be as difficult a task as any government has undertaken. The world cannot turn its back on South Africa at this crucial moment. Additional resources are needed to enable it to transform itself and to assist its re-integration with the rest of the continent. Whilst it is imperative that South Africa's revolution should succeed for the sake of its own people, an additional bonus will be the enormous impact it would have on sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. It is already a magnet for Africans in other African countries. A few of its continental neighbours have recently embarked on far-reaching reforms and show signs of progress. But that is not the general picture. Some are in turmoil: agriculture stagnates; many are unable to break free from the burden of foreign debt; there is corruption and an absence of sound government, indifferent and sometimes no education, grossly high military expenditure, ethnic tension; and so on. The example of a successful South Africa would galvanise other sub-Saharan countries. What energies might be unlocked if South Africa could hold out a vision of a future in which neighbours could integrate their resources and skills as a means of realising the potential of Africa's rich diverse resources and bringing hope to poverty-stricken millions? What better international role for a newly democratic, multi-racial country emerged from decades of isolation than to assist friends and neighbours weaker than itself to rejoin the mainstream of the international community? South Africa's revolution must not fail. The author was British prime minister from 1976 to 1979   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

0,FT932-7951 ,"FT932-7951 _AN-DEUB0AA9FT 930521   FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: W Africans hurt by EC beef policy      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   EC SUBSIDIES for beef exports to West Africa are destroying the livelihood of 4m pastoralists who rely wholly on cattle-rearing in the semi-arid Sahel region south of the Sahara, according to the British charity Christian Aid. With other European aid agencies, Christian Aid has launched a campaign for the abolition of these subsidies. Since 1984, EC beef exports to West Africa have increased seven-fold, subsidised to the tune of Pounds 280m by European tax-payers. Local beef prices have collapsed. The low-quality, subsidised EC beef sells at half the price of locally produced meat. Sahelian farmers are finding that no-one is prepared to buy their herds. EC beef dumping is not only threatening the survival of Sahelian communities, it also undermines aid from the EC itself to support livestock production in the Sahel. Hundreds of millions of Ecus from the European Development Fund have been spent on building refrigerated abattoirs in Burkina Faso, on improving cattle breeds in Mali, Gambia and Senegal, and on promoting disease control in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. An EC council of ministers meeting is expected to discuss the issue at the end of the month. Christian Aid argues that to stop the export of subsidised beef to West Africa would not seriously damage farmers in Europe. Less than 0.5 per cent of total EC beef production of 8.7m tonnes in 1991 was exported to the region.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     EHZ  Western Sahara, Africa.

Laut, a shot putter, was at Pilditch Stadium on the outskirts of Pretoria,  South Africa, on that October day in 1988, part of a contingent of 14 track and  field athletes from the United States who had chosen to ignore an international  ban on competition in South Africa. They were risking their eligibility by  competing in a country where apartheid in sanctioned by law.    Laut admitted he had mixed emotions as he stepped into the shot-put ring at  Pilditch, with 16 pounds of metal tucked between shoulder and chin.    ""I mean here I was, about to throw the shot in South Africa, and I'm thinking,  'Are you sure you want to do this?' "" recalled Laut, who swallowed his emotions  long enough to launch a 66-foot put -- the longest ever on South African soil.  ""I really had the adrenaline going on that one.""    The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United  States, recognized Laut's record by handing him a four-year ban from  competition. However Laut, an Olympian in 1984, is far from repentant --  recently he returned from his third trip to South Africa, a decision he fully  expects will earn him yet another ban, this time for life.    ""I'm guessing, but they'll probably give us a lifetime (ban) now because we  went back,"" said Laut of the five-meet tour in which he and 13 teammates  participated in November. ""I'm waiting to get the letter any day.""    Nine of the U. S. athletes who participated in the original October, 1988, tour  received TAC suspensions ranging from two to 12 years.    Laut, 33, said there is no simple reason for his decision to risk punishment by  competing in South Africa, although money was an important factor.    A standout shot putter at Santa Clara High, Moorpark College, San Jose City  College and UCLA, Laut earned a bronze medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. The  following year he won the TAC outdoor championships and, buoyed by those  performances, drew a bead on the 1988 Olympics.    Looking for a job that would provide him with both the cash and the time to  train, Laut tried out in the summer of 1986 for a position with the Oxnard Fire  Department. While running with a fire hose, he felt a sharp pain in both knees.  Ruptured tendons sent him sprawling to the pavement.    The following year, which Laut should have spent in training for the Olympics,  was consumed instead with rehabilitation. His few performances were poor and he  lost both his momentum and valuable financial support from Nike.    When he took a part-time time as a realtor, his training suffered. At the 1988  Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Laut, who needed to finish in the top three to  win a spot on the team, placed fifth.    When Skip Robinson, the track coach at Pasadena City College, approached Laut  at the trials and proposed a possible tour of South Africa, Laut was  apprehensive. Robinson was straightforward -- he told Laut this would be the  first such tour since 1962 and the first since the International Amateur  Athletic Federation banned South Africa from international track and field  competition in 1976.    Any athlete who went likely would face repercussions. Laut, however, was ready  to take a chance.    ""It sounded like a pretty serious commitment, but I'd lost my contract (with  Nike) and things were looking pretty bad, so I thought, 'Well, why not take a  chance and see?' "" said Laut.    According to published reports, the U.S. athletes were paid a minimum of  $10,000 per meet during the 1988 tour and, with performance bonuses, could earn  much more. Miler Jim Spivey claimed he was offered $200,000 to compete in the  meets.    Spivey declined the offer.    Though Laut refused to discuss specifics, he said he was paid somewhere between  $10,000 and $30,000. Whatever the sum, said Laut, money was the only way to get  athletes to take the risk.    ""You're not going to ask an athlete to risk his eligibility and his whole  sports career without paying them for it,"" Laut said.    Though money spurred Laut to take his first trip to South Africa in the fall of  1988, subsequent trips in April and November were taken for other reasons.    ""South Africa is the only place in the world I can compete now,"" Laut said.    ""I think that everyone who's gone over there has a goal and we're committed to  seeing it through,"" added Laut, whose tour teammates have included Olympians  John Powell, Ruth Wysocki, Tom Petranoff and Gregg Tafralis. ""Hopefully through  our efforts and what we're doing we'll maybe make a dent on this ban on sports  over there.""    Not everyone agrees. When plans for the first tour were announced, many decried  the idea, saying it would lend legitimacy to a political system that allows  South Africa's 27 million blacks no vote and little voice. Critics say the  tours have fostered no change, and many accuse the athletes who participated of  ignoring moral concerns for financial benefit.    ""The people that went there, they know its wrong,"" said George Mehale, a South  African who coaches track and field at Cal State Long Beach. ""Nothing changed  because they went.""    ""If anything, people are telling me informally that in a way they hurt the  cause -- not major injury, but they certainly did set things back,"" said TAC  President Frank Greenberg, one of several TAC officials who voted to ban the  athletes who participated in the 1988 tour. ""I think it's counterproductive  when individuals go. Global reaction against South Africa is getting stronger,  that pressure has already produced some changes.""    Supporters of sanctions against South Africa say the sanctions contributed to  President Frederik De Klerk's recent decisions to release political prisoners  such as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela.    De Klerk also lifted a decades-old ban on the African National Congress and  more than a dozen other groups dedicated to the abolition of apartheid; eased  government censorship of the media; and asked his justice department to reserve  capital penalties for the most severe crimes.    But De Klerk, whose Nationalist Party has ruled South Africa since 1948 and is  thus responsible for instituting the most repulsive separatist laws, left most  of the pillars of apartheid intact. The pass laws, which require blacks to  carry legal documents when traveling outside their townships, are still  enforced and the nation's black citizens are still not entitled to participate  in the government or in national elections.    Laut prefers to steer clear of debate. Others, however, vehemently defend the  tours.    ""We spent time doing clinics, promoting goodwill and helping people of all  colors,"" said tour organizer and coach Dick Tomlinson. ""Ours is a purely  humanitarian effort. We're trying to bring understanding and turn the lights on  the South African situation so people will realize that there are millions of  black South Africans who are being deprived of international sport.""    Laut said he has seen few signs of segregation during his trips to South  Africa. Critics argue that Laut and his fellow athletes were sheltered from  apartheid's worst. Although they were free to travel as they wished --  including visits to the volatile black townships of Soweto and Crossroads --  one team member admitted there was ""a strong possibility"" she and her fellow  athletes were sheltered during their visit.    ""We did go different places, but they had an itinerary set up with where they  were going to take us and what we were going to do,"" said Pamela Page, a  hurdler who participated in the most recent tour. Page, who is black, also said  that despite outward appearances of normalcy, something was amiss.    ""People were nice and they kept saying, 'We're trying to change, we're trying  to change,' but it was still strange,"" Page said. ""I'd be shopping and they  (white South Africans) would just kind of stop and look at me like, 'Wait a  minute.' It kind of caught them off guard.""    But while Laut admits he knows little about South Africa's politics, he does  know something of sport and he sees in South Africa a potential track  powerhouse.    ""There's just an unbelievable amount of talent over there, it's just amazing,""  Laut said. ""If they could become a part of the world, they would be a major  power in track and field in 10 years. That's my sincere belief.""    During the November tour, Laut and the rest of the U. S. contingent met briefly  with De Klerk. According to Laut, the president lent his support to the tour  and expressed hope that the South African athletes would soon be able to  compete internationally.    ""They've got a lot of national pride and I think they would really like to see  their country get back into international competition,"" Laut said.    Laut also expresses admiration for the South African athletes who continue to  train and compete in the face of an international ban that keeps them at home,  leaving them to compete against the same faces in the same places.    ""When I was in high school and college I always had that Olympic medal as my  dream. That was my focus, the driving force that kept me going . . . ,"" Laut  said. ""The South African athlete doesn't have that dream, but he keeps working  as hard as we do, maybe harder. To me that determination is amazing.""    For Laut, training and competition have also taken on a slightly different  slant from his college days. He has pared his training substantially --  slipping away from work in the afternoon to put the shot at Hueneme High or  lift weights in the garage of his home.    ""If I'm lucky, I can get in two hours of training a day,"" Laut said. ""It's not  what I need, but I know what to do now and I can eliminate a lot of the  nonsense stuff that I used to do. I just do the exercises that will help me  throw the shot, which is basically the whole name of the game.""    Laut will return to South Africa, possibly as early as April for the South  African national championships. According to Laut, a full team will probably  return to South Africa again this fall and there is talk of a contract with  sponsors and the South African Athletic Union that would guarantee such visits  for the next three to five years.    Laut's ultimate goal, however, is to compete in South Africa as a member of an  official U. S. team.    ""I'd like to be able to represent the United States, have USA colors, raise the  flag and compete for the United States,"" Laut said.

Vice-President Carlos Lage told a news conference in Havana at the weekend that the government was also preparing a new foreign investment law that would give more protection to overseas investors, who are already active in Cuba in activities ranging from oil exploration to citrus production. Cuba began opening up its state-run economy to external investment after 1989 to offset the devastating impact of the collapse of its preferential trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc. 'From now onwards, no productive sector will be excluded from investment by foreign capital,' Mr Lage said. Up to now, raw sugar production, traditionally the island's biggest export earner, had been explicitly closed to foreign investment. But the sugar industry is in deep crisis and has suffered two consecutive disastrously low harvests. Mr Lage also announced that, in defiance of a continuing US economic embargo against Cuba, representatives of more than 69 US companies had visited the island in the first half of this year to discuss business prospects. In some cases, letters of intent for future contracts had been negotiated to take effect when the US embargo was finally lifted by Washington. Representatives of two British sugar companies, Tate  Lyle, and EDF Man, have held talks this year with Cuban investment officials. Shortages of essential inputs previously supplied by the former Soviet Union, such as fuel, spare parts, fertilisers and herbicides, have crippled Cuba's sugar production since 1990. On Cuba's economy, Mr Lage said it was still too early to talk of recovery. But he cited some positive signs, such as the growth of foreign investment, particularly in tourism and oil exploration, improvements in construction, cement and nickel production and progress in the government's efforts to stabilise the country's internal finances.

The president-in-exile's spokesman specified that  the government's position will be known this week. Reacting to  the initiatives undertaken in Port-au-Prince attempting to apply  Article 149 of the Constitution, spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau  stated that the problem of democracy is not a question of  applying some article of the Constitution, but to neutralize  those who constitute an obstacle to democracy. Mr. Martineau  also rejected the calls for resignation by some opponents and  even some supporters of the president-in-exile. He answered  Clarence Renois' questions:    [Begin recording in Creole] [Martineau] The U.S. plan to  solve the crisis is still being studied. Before long, I suppose  that President Aristide will give an answer, his opinion on this  plan.    Concerning the people who are in Haiti -- the political  parties that want to refer to Article 149 -- there is one thing  we would like to point out to them and I believe they already  know: Article 148, 149, 250 or 3000, will not solve the crisis  in Haiti because the crisis in Haiti does not lie there. The  president's absence is not voluntary. It is an absence which  came after a coup d'etat. That is the first thing they should  know. I believe they know that. The second point to consider is  that no matter the article they refer to, and no matter how they  try to replace the president -- the unconstitutional way they  would like to do it -- it will still not solve the crisis.  Because the crisis is simply because Haiti, instead of being a  country, a republic, has become a drug warehouse where people  are killing people, manhandling people as they please. This  crisis cannot be solved with articles. Haitians who favor  democracy must stand up to change things so the country then has  peace and with peace, it can rebuild itself.    [Renois] Mr. Martineau, some supporters and opponents of  President Aristide asked the president to resign in order to  allow a solution to the crisis. Does President Aristide take  into account those considerations? Does he take into account  those positions. What does he intend to do?    [Martineau] No. I suppose those people should know who  should resign under these conditions. I think the people who  are killing people should resign. I think if those people can  ask President Aristide to resign, they should first ask the  Haitian people if they have changed their vote. Are they giving  the Haitian people the right to say yes or no, whether they  changed their 16 December vote? That is what they ought to do  if they have the courage. I think there is a sort of cowardice  when President Aristide is asked to resign and at the same time  one kowtows to the military who are murdering people. I think  those people know exactly who should resign under these  circumstances -- people who are killing, who are selling drugs  and who are manhandling people -- those are the people who  should resign. In Haiti there should not be a resignation of  peace, but rather a resignation of the pressure tactics of sorts.    [Renois] Mr. Martineau, it appears then that there is a bit  of Indian wrestling going on between President Aristide's  legitimacy and the authority of the current government or the  military who overthrew him. In the end, it harms the Haitian  people, since sanctions have been imposed. What is now being  done by the government-in-exile to effect an improvement of the  situation? Are there some steps being taken at that level?    [Martineau] Certainly some steps are being taken at that  level. Meanwhile, do not forget that a president in any country  is an advocate of the Constitution. Do we have a Constitution  or do we not? No matter the compromise that can be reached,  should those compromises violate the Constitution? In Haiti,  everyone violates the Constitution, except one group, the group  that favors democracy. The most stupid thing is that they are  asking this group to resign. In this case, what is the future of  elections, of the Constitution in Haiti? Every time a president  is elected, if the military does not want him, they overthrow  him and they assert that everything must change. Well! Some  things must change in Haiti. But, it is not the Constitution,  it is not the law. It is force, selfishness, and thievery that  must change in Haiti.    [Renois] A final question Mr. Martineau. Does the  government-in-exile hope the situation will change in favor of  President Aristide so he can return to power?    [Martineau] It is not something that should change in favor  of President Aristide. It must be in favor of the Haitian  people. Yes, we hope that things will change and we hope that no  matter what happens, the Haitian people will win. [end  recording].     "

0,FT923-6037 ,"FT923-6037 _AN-CH1BVABLFT 920827   FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Neighbours build up links with Pretoria - Philip Gawith on a struggling region which has found a new level of co-operation      By PHILIP GAWITH   ECONOMIC need has concentrated political minds in southern Africa where seven countries are co-operating in the handling of 8.2m tonnes of maize imported into the region, which has been devastated by one of the worst droughts this century. At the heart of the scheme is Spoornet, the state-run South African rail company, enjoying a level of regional co-operation which would have been unthinkable during the apartheid years. Although co-operation over the shipments was prompted by fears in some areas of possible starvation, it is also a sign of it being more acceptable for South Africa's neighbours - Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia and Malawi - to be seen doing business with it now that a transition to democracy is under way. This raises the question of what steps South Africa should take to integrate itself formally into the region and what sort of economic assistance the international community can offer. At the heart of these issues lies one broad plank of consensus: the southern African region will prosper or perish as a unit. Although differences in wealth and resources between countries mean that there will not be an even rate of progress or failure, it is inconceivable that South Africa will flourish in splendid isolation or that its neighbours will progress without it. South Africa is well aware, in the phrase of Dr Anton Rupert, the famous tobacco entrepreneur: 'If your neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep peacefully.' Already there are 27,000 Mozambican refugees living in the eastern Transvaal, victims of drought and civil war. Refugees are also filtering into the northern Transvaal from Zimbabwe. Not only does this sort of inflow strain limited resources, but the economic fragility of South Africa's neighbours also limits what ought to be important markets. According to a study by the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI)*, Africa accounts for only 7 per cent of South Africa's exports, with a quarter of this going to Zimbabwe. Aside from trade and humanitarian concerns, regional politicians are also aware that, in an era of capital scarcity, they have a lot of work to do if they are to garner even a fraction of international capital flows, very little of which currently come to Africa. The main obstacles to foreign investment in the region are problems of political instability, economic decay and a dilapidated infrastructure. However, the recent talks between Mozambican President Joachim Chissano and rebel Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, the upcoming elections in Angola, and South Africa's transition process all represent important progress, albeit of a very fragile kind. Peace, however, is only the first step. The extent to which governments will subsequently be able to forge a framework of economic co-operation remains to be seen. The potential for regional integration is also complicated by South Africa's dominant position whereby its gross national product (GNP) exceeds the combined GNP of the 20 member countries of the two regional trade groupings  -the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the new version of SADCC - by about 40 per cent. Conventional wisdom suggests that greater economic convergence is necessary for successful integration. In their more sanguine moments, South Africa's neighbours look on it as a market for their goods, and a source of funds for projects which other international investors or governments won't fund. Underlying that, however, is an anxiety that the normalisation of South Africa's political situation may be to their disadvantage. Thus the ODI special report, which investigates the possibility of granting financial and trade privileges to South Africa, found that the most common reaction outside South Africa when the possibility of EC preferences was raised was 'incredulity'. The report finds, however, that the gains from preferential trade regimes with the EC would be small because the bulk of South Africa's exports are metals and minerals which face low barriers. The authors conclude, therefore, that since South Africa's principal economic problems are domestic, not external, foreign assistance would probably best be directed elsewhere. This thinking is likely to be consonant with the priorities of any future government, which will face overwhelming pressure to improve domestic social conditions. Trade concessions will be welcome, and regional integration may provide a warm feeling of returning to the fold, but these issues will not top any list of economic priorities. *Trading with South Africa: the policy options for the EC.

0,FT941-12258 ,"FT941-12258 _AN-EA4DIAEYFT 940131   FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (3): 'Knowledge gap' is still widening - Education shows only patchy improvement      By JOHN AUTHERS   The world's young people, in the 1990s, live in the shadow of a 'knowledge gap'. While it continues to widen, the chances of the young generation in the developing world being able to help their nations achieve lasting economic progress remain slight. The second report on world education, published at the end of last year by Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation), provides stark evidence of the gulf in educational provision between richer and poorer nations. While many nations are now making real progress, goaded by the improvements made by the Pacific Rim countries on the back of strong national training systems, other areas - particularly sub-Saharan Africa - are being left further behind. The nine most populous developing nations - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - last December demonstrated that they thought increased educational provision was the key to economic progress, and stemming population growth, by pledging to provide their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest possible moment'. Within the poorer nations, research reveals another 'gap'. In the developing world, girls are still thought unlikely to contribute economically, and receive far less education than boys. In many cases their families do not think it is worth it, thwarting any attempt by the state to improve girls' chances in life. Unesco's figures on the school life expectancy - how long a child can expect to stay in formal education - in different countries make depressing reading. Africa south of the Sahara and southern Asia suffer the greatest problems. In the Saharan nation of Niger, girls can expect to stay 1.4 years in school, while boys do scarcely better with 2.8. In Guinea, girls can only expect 1.6 years in school, while in populous Bangladesh, boys receive 5.8 years at school, compared with 4.2 for girls. In both Niger and Guinea, textbooks are available for less than 30 per cent of primary school children, and the school year is short. Comparative figures show that Canadian girls can expect 16.5 years of formal education (a year more than their brothers). Both boys and girls devote more than 15 years to formal study in the US. However, some parts of the developing world now provide as much education as member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, South Korea educates its children for an average of 13.3 years  -more than Australia, level with Japan and Sweden, and only slightly behind the UK. Several Latin American nations now have an educational life expectancy of more than a decade. Unsurprisingly, low educational provision has led to illiteracy in later life, and according to Unesco, most adults in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are illiterate. The total number of illiterate adults is still increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab states, and in southern Asia. However, the overall 'literacy gap' appears to be declining, as better-educated children in other parts of the developing world reach adulthood, and there is some confidence that much of the current disparity - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa - can be explained by the wide range of local languages. In Ethiopia, for example, the education ministry has introduced the use of four nationality languages - Oromigna, Tigrigna, Sidamigna and Wolaitigna - in primary schools, rather than the official language of Amharic. The reform should improve the standards of general education, because children will be instructed in the language they use at home, but it may be that overall literacy statistics will prove harder to compute. While problems with basic literacy and other skills may prevent emerging generations from providing the 'engine room' of increased economic output which developing countries need from them, disparities in higher education may in the short term be even more damaging. Lack of a developed higher education system critically damages competitiveness, as it becomes impossible for a nation's industrial and research and development communities to keep abreast with developments elsewhere. Most Latin American and Asian countries now have university enrolment levels which conform broadly with university entries in the OECD nations - Unesco reports show that sub-Saharan Africa is now alone in suffering from a 'higher education gap' by comparison with the rest of the world. Foreign exchange programmes account for a smaller proportion of students than they did 10 years ago, and most aid for developing countries now comes through direct aid from banks and funds. Nearly half of this goes to the Pacific Rim countries, whose education systems have already been extensively reformed. As this aid is in the form of loans which will have to be repaid by the countries which receive it, and much money has been spent on physical infrastructure and buildings, which create their own recurrent costs, it seems, still, that nobody has a clear grasp of how the 'gap' in higher education can be closed.  -------------------------------------------------------------------              PUBLIC RECURRENT EXPENDITURE PER PUPIL  ------------------------------------------------------------------- In pre-primary, first and second level education 1990  -------------------------------------------------------------------                            dollars  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub-Saharan Africa            58 E.

The campaign's first phase begins with local Pentecost worship services and  vigils focusing on South Africa and culminates June 17 with a rally at the  Washington Monument.    The campaign grew out of a meeting here in October of eminent U.S. church  leaders -- calling themselves the ""South Africa Crisis Coordinating Committee""  -- who responded to calls for support from South African churches concerned  about increasing incidents of violence against the churches.    In August, the headquarters of the South African Council of Churches in  Johannesburg, Khotso House, was bombed. And just 6 weeks later, an arson fire  gutted two floors at Khanya House, the Pretoria offices of the Southern African  Catholic Bishops' Conference.    Diana Scott, who is coordinating activities for the United Church of Christ's  Board for World Ministries here, said that a number of UCC events related to  the campaign have already been held, including workshops on apartheid and the  circulating of petitions.    She reported that 7,000 information packets were mailed to UCC anti-apartheid  activists across the country to bring the campaign to the grass-roots level.    Backers of the U.S. campaign include the historic black churches and mainline  Protestant denominations. The U.S. Catholic Conference and Evangelicals for  Social Action are also involved, providing a broadened ecumenical base for the  campaign.    After the Pentecost Sunday observances, the committee is calling for a day of  fasting and prayer May 26, a series of national speaking tours by North  American and South African church leaders June 1 to 15 and a day of lobbying  for sanctions in the states and on Capitol Hill June 16 before the Washington  Monument rally the following day.    The coordinating committee is also asking opponents of apartheid to sign a  ""covenant"" statement that says: ""The time has come for the faith, prayers and  energy of the worldwide church of Jesus Christ to be clearly focused on  bringing to an end the diabolical system known as apartheid. We hereby make a  covenant with the church and people of South Africa -- until South Africa is  free.""    Signers of the pledge card are being asked to assist in adopting campaigns in  their communities to pressure the South African government to abandon  apartheid, focusing on support for comprehensive economic sanctions and  ""people's sanctions"" such as corporate campaigns and bank boycotts directed at  institutions doing business with South Africa.    High on the agenda of the coordinating committee are two pieces of legislation  under consideration in Congress. The bills were introduced by Rep. Ronald V.  Dellums (D-Berkeley) and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.).    According to the committee, the proposed legislation would ""significantly  expand"" existing U.S. sanctions that now permit American businesses to continue  basic operations in most industries.

No adverse comments were received on the proposal that a refinery which primarily produces gasoline blendstocks from crude oil (including crude oil derivatives) and mixes those blendstocks to form gasoline be subject to baseline determination using any, or a combination of, the three data types described below in paragraph 3. The requirements are being promulgated essentially as proposed.   Likewise, no adverse comments were received regarding the proposal to exempt (from the anti-dumping requirements) those entities which produce and/or supply gasoline blendstocks to refiners and blenders, but do not produce gasoline. Hence EPA is not promulgating anti-dumping requirements for such entities.   b.     Requirements for purchasers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks.     As proposed in April 1992, refiners who exclusively purchase blendstocks and/or gasoline and mix these purchased components to form another gasoline (i.e., blenders) must use Method 1-type data (as described in paragraph 3 below). Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the blender shall have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. Most who commented on this issue suggested that blenders should be allowed the same opportunities as refiners to use 1990 and post-1990 gasoline and blendstock data. Otherwise, a blender may have to ``reformulate'' its conventional gasoline. Commenters also stated that this provision penalized blenders for not sampling their 1990 fuel when there were no such requirements. As discussed in the proposal, EPA does not believe that use of blendstock data or post-1990 gasoline or blendstock data would allow an accurate portrayal of a blender's 1990 production. Additional comments are discussed in the RIA; however, none led to a change in the proposed requirements for blenders.   c.     Requirements for importers of gasoline.     On April 16, 1992, EPA proposed that those who imported gasoline into the U.S. in 1990 must use Method 1-type data (as described in paragraph 3). Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the importer would have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. An importer who did not import gasoline into the U.S. in 1990, but who does so after 1994, would also have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. EPA proposed that if a U.S. importer is also a refiner and imported 75 percent or more of the 1990 gasoline production of a refinery into the U.S. in 1990, it could determine a baseline for that refinery using the three data types described in paragraph 3 below.   Most commenters agreed with EPA's overall proposal concerning importers. Some felt, however, that the ``75 percent'' criteria was self-selecting"," FR940216-0-00142   FR940216-0-00010        2.

Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the importer would have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. An importer who did not import gasoline into the U.S. in 1990, but who does so after 1994, would also have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. EPA proposed that if a U.S. importer is also a refiner and imported 75 percent or more of the 1990 gasoline production of a refinery into the U.S. in 1990, it could determine a baseline for that refinery using the three data types described in paragraph 3 below.   Most commenters agreed with EPA's overall proposal concerning importers. Some felt, however, that the ``75 percent'' criteria was self-selecting_only those importer/refiners with higher baseline emissions relative to the statutory baseline would choose to develop an individual baseline. Those importer/refiners with relatively low baseline emissions would use the statutory baseline, and thus dumping could result, since they would be complying with a baseline which was less stringent than one based on their own 1990 gasoline quality. EPA agrees that ``dumping'' could occur, but expects it to be minimal since few importing refineries are likely to meet the ``75 percent'' criteria. Nonetheless, EPA is requiring that all importers which are also refiners utilize Method 1-, 2- and 3-type data to determine the individual baselines of their refineries which meet the 75 percent criteria.   One commenter claimed that location, not percent of production imported, dictates enforceability. However, EPA believes that enforcement of a non-domestic refinery is governed less by location and more by the willingness of the company and/or country to open its refinery for compliance visitations. Another commenter specifically stated that Canadian refineries should be treated the same as domestic refineries for the purpose of establishing baselines. As stated, EPA believes that it will be relatively easy to accurately determine the quality of the gasoline produced in 1990 at a refinery outside of the U.S., for sale to the U.S., if a significant amount (i.e., 75 percent) of the production of the refinery came to the U.S. Independent of where the refinery is located, if less than this amount was imported, it will be more difficult to combine information on refinery operations and blendstock and gasoline data (i.e., Methods 2 and 3-type data) and allocate such information so as to establish the quality of the refinery's 1990 gasoline which was sent to the U.S.   Some commenters felt that an importer should be allowed to use all available 1990 and later data to establish a baseline and have its baseline verified by an auditor. However, as stated in the proposals, EPA believes that significant dumping could occur if post-1990 data is allowed since that data may not represent the importer's 1990 gasoline. EPA is thus promulgating this essentially provision as proposed.   d.     Requirements for exporters of gasoline.     EPA's proposals did not explicitly discuss whether gasoline exported from the U.S. in 1990 would be included in individual baseline determinations. However, because exported gasoline did not contribute to pollution in the U.S. in 1990, a producer of gasoline exported from the U.S. in 1990 shall not include the exported gasoline properties or volumes in its baseline determination. A refiner which exports all of its future gasoline outside of the U.S. is not subject to the anti-dumping requirements.        "

The  meeting starts on Thursday [2 June].    On Friday, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will host what  is expected to be the final meeting of the Frontline states, the  regional alliance of southern African nations which opposed  apartheid. Officials said leaders of the seven-nation grouping  would discuss a new organisation to replace it.    Already in Harare is Benin leader Nicephore Soglo who hosted  the previous GCA meeting in June last year. Due to arrive on  Wednesday are the heads of state of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique,  Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Ivory Coast  and Botswana, and former World Bank head Robert MacNamara and  former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.    Founded with World Bank finance and based in Washington, the  GCA was established as an alliance of African nations and  Western donor nations with close ties to the continent. It was  part of a bid to counter a shift of Western financial support  from Africa after the fall of the Communist bloc. Backers  describe it as dedicated to ""keeping alive the good news in  Africa"".    Frontline heads of state are expected to support moves to  keep the body alive in spite of the transition to democracy in  South Africa. However, the group is expected to change its  ""confrontational"" name and adopt a new direction, working for  peace and political stability in the region and to provide a  forum for conflict mediation.

An editorial by the newspaper GRANMA, official organ of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, salutes the  electoral triumph of the African National Congress (ANC) in the  South African elections which, with its victory, has crowned the  process sealed in the fierce fighting of Cuito Cuanavale in  Angola.    GRANMA says that, the historic battle and defeat suffered by  the racist army in the face of the resistance of the Angolans  and Cuban international fighters changed the correlation of  forces in South Africa and led to the current triumph of the  South African people.    Regarding the struggle and merits of ANC leader Nelson  Mandela, the paper states that when he assumes his nation's  presidency, the world will have occasion to render tribute to  his wisdom, courageous revolutionary stance, and unwavering  principles.    It can be seen in all its dimensions that the triumph  corresponds to those who struggle and the example offered must  be again appreciated. The value of this example is heightened  at this shameful moment when so many have lowered their flags  and have repented for what they once were, it states.    The newspaper criticizes the regime of racial discrimination  that existed in South Africa, noting that capitalism and  imperialism were responsible for instilling in that state the  notion of superior and inferior races.    We are proud to have been and to continue to be close  companions of arms of Nelson Mandela and of the South African  people, the GRANMA editorial concludes.     "

HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer      ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar      Pope John Paul II, starting his fifth trip to Africa as Pope, raised the  possibility Friday of a formal visit to South Africa sometime in the next year.    The issue of a papal visit to South African came up at a press conference on  the Pope's flight from Rome to Madagascar, an island nation of more than 2  million Roman Catholics, the first of four stops in nine days.    Among the stops is Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters of the anti-apartheid African  National Congress, where the pontiff is expected to make a powerful  denunciation of apartheid. The racial separation policy in South Africa is an  important obstacle to a papal visit, he indicated.    ""Speaking sociopolitically,"" the Pope said, ""we all know very well what the  moral problems are in this sphere in South Africa.""      Not Directed at Leaders    But he added that papal visits are directed at Catholics, not necessarily their  leaders, and he suggested that he would make the evil of apartheid the theme of  any visit to South Africa.    ""The Pope must be respected in his role as someone who tells the truth,"" he  said.    Vatican officials said later that John Paul expects to make two further trips  to Africa in the next year, and a stop in South Africa could be included.    In his remarks en route to Madagascar, the pontiff also made one of his  strongest statements yet on another subject he is likely to take up during this  trip -- AIDS. He said that AIDS, which in the West generally strikes  homosexuals and intravenous drug users but in Africa is largely a problem for  heterosexuals, is something that reflects the decline in the moral order of the  times.    ""It is not a case of personal blame in each instance,"" he said, ""but many times  it is.""      AIDS Affects Up to 20%    AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is estimated to affect up to 20%  of the people of Zambia and Malawi, his two final stops on this trip. Among the  more prominent victims is the son of Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.    The Pope also said he might meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  when Gorbachev travels to Italy in November. Such a meeting would be the first  between the Pope and a Soviet leader.    Meanwhile, the pontiff's arrival in Madagascar placed him squarely in the  middle of a developing political maelstrom. He landed amid a ""papal truce""  called by opposition parties whose contention that last month's presidential  election here was rigged has led to riots that left six dead and 74 injured  last week in downtown Antananarivo.    The election, which was overseen by a committee of churches, including the  Catholic Church, gave President Didier Ratsiraka his third seven-year term with  62.7% of the vote, his smallest margin ever.      Foes Charged Fraud    The opposition complained of widespread fraud and of an electoral code that  allowed Ratsiraka to schedule the vote during the rainy season, when only he  could reach remote rural districts to campaign.    At one point the government hinted that unless the opposition halted public  demonstrations, it might be forced to cancel the Pope's visit.    The opposition, led by Manandafy Rakotonarina, a key figure in the 1972  revolution that drove out the colonial French, promptly declared a treve, or  truce.    ""No politician wanted to take responsibility for the cancellation of the  visit,"" a diplomat in the capital said.    On greeting John Paul at Antananarivo's Ivato airport Friday evening, the  Jesuit-educated Ratsiraka laced into the opposition, charging them with  fomenting ""anarchy and political bad faith.""    The Pope listened impassively from his seat in the airport's VIP lounge. In his  response, he made no allusion to Madagascar politics.    Madagascar's Catholics, about 20% of the population, are slightly outnumbered  by Protestants and overwhelmed by the 55% who profess belief in animism and a  mystical brand of ancestor worship.    Elaborate tombs adorn the countryside, and the streets are often blocked by  processions of carts carrying coffins. These are not exactly funerals, but  rites in which the bodies of the dead are exhumed at regular intervals,  reclothed, and led around the neighborhood to reacquaint the dead with the  living. The Malagasy people often make decisions based on what they gather to  be their ancestors' wishes.    The Catholic Church here long ago came to terms with these beliefs. One  prominent Malagasy noted that priests, far from objecting to such rites, ""often  themselves preside at the ceremonies. They coexist very comfortably.""    In contrast, Catholics have often had an unhappy relationship with the  country's rulers and nationalists. Four priests were killed last year by what  are thought to be political groups. Three were killed the year before, among  them an Italian priest who was beheaded by a nationalist youth group that was  later disbanded.    The killings were discomfiting echoes of trying times in the past. These  included a period in the 19th Century when a Malagasy queen had Catholics flung  off the cliff behind her palace, the peaked black roof of which rises over the  site of several events scheduled in connection with the papal visit.    Still, Ratsiraka is trying harder to appeal to Catholic leaders, as he is to  other Western powers. Press censorship has been lifted for the most part, and  opposition candidates were permitted to wage unusually energetic presidential  campaigns last month.    Furthermore, the president appears to be trying to reverse more than a decade  of economic decline here by shifting his economic policies from a brand of  socialism to Western-style free enterprise.      THE POPE IN AFRICA    1 -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Madagascar on Friday, the first stop in a  9-day African tour.    2 -- May 1-2. The Pope will make an overnight call at the French island of La  Reunion in the Indian Ocean. There he will beatify a 19th-Century holy woman  and meet with French Premier Michel Rocard.    3 -- May 2-4. The Pope will be in copper-rich Zambia, where per capita income  among the 6.7 million people is less than $500 a year and the economy is  stagnant.    4 -- May 4 -- Malawi, the Pope's last stop before returning to Rome, is, like  Madagascar and Zambia, about 25% Catholic, but its president is an elder of the  Church of Scotland. Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has led Malawi since independence from  Britain in 1964. The average Malawian earns only about $200 a year.

The election, which was overseen by a committee of churches, including the  Catholic Church, gave President Didier Ratsiraka his third seven-year term with  62.7% of the vote, his smallest margin ever.      Foes Charged Fraud    The opposition complained of widespread fraud and of an electoral code that  allowed Ratsiraka to schedule the vote during the rainy season, when only he  could reach remote rural districts to campaign.    At one point the government hinted that unless the opposition halted public  demonstrations, it might be forced to cancel the Pope's visit.    The opposition, led by Manandafy Rakotonarina, a key figure in the 1972  revolution that drove out the colonial French, promptly declared a treve, or  truce.    ""No politician wanted to take responsibility for the cancellation of the  visit,"" a diplomat in the capital said.    On greeting John Paul at Antananarivo's Ivato airport Friday evening, the  Jesuit-educated Ratsiraka laced into the opposition, charging them with  fomenting ""anarchy and political bad faith.""    The Pope listened impassively from his seat in the airport's VIP lounge. In his  response, he made no allusion to Madagascar politics.    Madagascar's Catholics, about 20% of the population, are slightly outnumbered  by Protestants and overwhelmed by the 55% who profess belief in animism and a  mystical brand of ancestor worship.    Elaborate tombs adorn the countryside, and the streets are often blocked by  processions of carts carrying coffins. These are not exactly funerals, but  rites in which the bodies of the dead are exhumed at regular intervals,  reclothed, and led around the neighborhood to reacquaint the dead with the  living. The Malagasy people often make decisions based on what they gather to  be their ancestors' wishes.    The Catholic Church here long ago came to terms with these beliefs. One  prominent Malagasy noted that priests, far from objecting to such rites, ""often  themselves preside at the ceremonies. They coexist very comfortably.""    In contrast, Catholics have often had an unhappy relationship with the  country's rulers and nationalists. Four priests were killed last year by what  are thought to be political groups. Three were killed the year before, among  them an Italian priest who was beheaded by a nationalist youth group that was  later disbanded.    The killings were discomfiting echoes of trying times in the past. These  included a period in the 19th Century when a Malagasy queen had Catholics flung  off the cliff behind her palace, the peaked black roof of which rises over the  site of several events scheduled in connection with the papal visit.    Still, Ratsiraka is trying harder to appeal to Catholic leaders, as he is to  other Western powers. Press censorship has been lifted for the most part, and  opposition candidates were permitted to wage unusually energetic presidential  campaigns last month.    Furthermore, the president appears to be trying to reverse more than a decade  of economic decline here by shifting his economic policies from a brand of  socialism to Western-style free enterprise.      THE POPE IN AFRICA    1 -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Madagascar on Friday, the first stop in a  9-day African tour.    2 -- May 1-2. The Pope will make an overnight call at the French island of La  Reunion in the Indian Ocean. There he will beatify a 19th-Century holy woman  and meet with French Premier Michel Rocard.    3 -- May 2-4. The Pope will be in copper-rich Zambia, where per capita income  among the 6.7 million people is less than $500 a year and the economy is  stagnant.    4 -- May 4 -- Malawi, the Pope's last stop before returning to Rome, is, like  Madagascar and Zambia, about 25% Catholic, but its president is an elder of the  Church of Scotland. Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has led Malawi since independence from  Britain in 1964. The average Malawian earns only about $200 a year.

0,FT942-915 ,"FT942-915 _AN-EF0DGADRFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: South Africa   Two months after its first all-race elections, South Africa is reaping the reward in terms of access to international capital. Liberty Life, the country's largest insurance company, is leading the way with a Dollars 500m convertible bond offering. Smaller debt and equity issues are sure to follow. Last week's budget included a government overseas borrowing target of R1.8bn (Pounds 320m). Yet buying rand-denominated assets remains difficult. Despite being the world's 10th largest equity market, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is notoriously illiquid thanks to a complex web of cross-holdings. Until South African companies and institutions are free to invest overseas, equities will remain gridlocked. The financial rand - a closed pool of currency through which all inward investment must be channelled - is another hurdle. True, foreign investors enjoy exceptionally high bond yields because the financial rand trades at a discount to the domestic currency. But the closed pool restricts liquidity, making it difficult to buy and sell. These factors are likely to limit the flow of foreign investment in South Africa, however promising the economic fundamentals may seem. While the discount on the financial rand remains high, the government may be too worried about capital flight to abolish exchange controls. The danger is that the discount will not close because international investors dislike dealing in the volatile financial rand. Unless the government takes the initiative, South Africa could find itself locked into a damaging stand-off.   Companies:-  Liberty Life Association of Africa.

Even though these utterances may be  projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise  examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned  U.S. objectives.    In this regard, the presidential adviser for national  security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian  Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks,  in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of  the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy  of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers  from both these countries to the regional countries.    Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual  containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding  of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S.  foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is  paving the way for a greater presence in the region.    In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of  ""extremism."" Dividing it into religious and national extremism,  he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and  the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently  used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they  actually mean by this term.    Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of  Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf  officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with  the usual concept.    From Washington's point of view, the term ""extremism""  applies  to any individual or government not willing to officially  recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries  around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not  succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they  have not yet presented any specific definition of this term.    For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a  conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried  out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last  resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately,  in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by  false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the  subsequent struggle is labeled extremism.    Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and  Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism.  While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against  Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United  States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States  should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure  of communism.    Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of  dominating  the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that  progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern  countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy  and the lives of their people instead of squandering their  resources purchasing weapons.    The realities in the region however belie his allegations.  The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain,  Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples  of this fact. The White House adviser on national security  affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been  stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use  is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs.    In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting  the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between  that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new  front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations.    The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state  to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding  the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims  of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of  generating tension in the region.    Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is  part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the  region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into  the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following  precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to  raise tension.    In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King  Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded  to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the  handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the  UAE.    These remarks can only result in raising tension in the  region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune  for the region, with more domination and profit making by the  United States.

Even though these utterances may be  projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise  examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned  U.S. objectives.    In this regard, the presidential adviser for national  security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian  Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks,  in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of  the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy  of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers  from both these countries to the regional countries.    Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual  containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding  of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S.  foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is  paving the way for a greater presence in the region.    In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of  ""extremism."" Dividing it into religious and national extremism,  he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and  the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently  used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they  actually mean by this term.    Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of  Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf  officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with  the usual concept.    From Washington's point of view, the term ""extremism""  applies  to any individual or government not willing to officially  recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries  around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not  succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they  have not yet presented any specific definition of this term.    For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a  conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried  out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last  resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately,  in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by  false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the  subsequent struggle is labeled extremism.    Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and  Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism.  While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against  Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United  States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States  should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure  of communism.    Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of  dominating  the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that  progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern  countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy  and the lives of their people instead of squandering their  resources purchasing weapons.    The realities in the region however belie his allegations.  The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain,  Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples  of this fact. The White House adviser on national security  affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been  stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use  is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs.    In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting  the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between  that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new  front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations.    The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state  to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding  the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims  of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of  generating tension in the region.    Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is  part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the  region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into  the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following  precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to  raise tension.    In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King  Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded  to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the  handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the  UAE.    These remarks can only result in raising tension in the  region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune  for the region, with more domination and profit making by the  United States.

The TEC has ""demanded the government suspend its  planned salary increases for senior civil servants,"" despite the  ""objections of government members."" THE CITIZEN fears the TEC  ""is going to act increasingly as if it is the government, and  the government is going to be outvoted on major issues.""  President de Klerk is advised to tell his TEC members to ""take  a stronger line."" ""There is, after all, an election ahead of  us, and the government, which is going to campaign to win, must  be able to show that it is governing in the transition period --  and is strong enough to make its voice heard in a government of  national unity.

THE STAR    South Africa-Frontline States Reconciliation--""This week  Mugabe was gracious and warm in receiving President de Klerk and  Nelson Mandela at the Gaborone mini-summit,"" points out a  page-10 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28  January. The significance of the encounter ""extends well beyond  the formal reason for the calling of the meeting--the crisis in  Lesotho. In effect it amounted to a historic act of  reconciliation between South Africa and the Frontline states, of  which Mugabe is the chairman. It also signaled South Africa's  return to the regional fold, where it is bound to become a major  power. Mugabe's generous acknowledgement of De Klerk's role in  breaking the Republic's isolation was also revealing and might  give some of the South African president's critics back at home  food for thought.""    Peacekeeping Force Commander Appointment `Mistake'--A second  editorial on the same page finds the appointment of Brigadier  Gabriel Ramushwana as commander of the National Peacekeeping  Force to be ""a mistake.""

The alleged self-enrichment took place while he  was chairman of the Venda Military Council, meaning that he is  suspected of abusing power for self-gain. Ramushwana may be  innocent.

""It was a brief meeting between the two South  Africans, the presidents of Zimbabwe and Botswana and the deputy  prime minister of Lesotho, but it was loaded with symbolism and  promise. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe is current chairman  of the Frontline States. He and Botswana President Quett Masire  are prominent members of the Southern African Development  Community (SADC), while both countries and Lesotho are members  of the Commonwealth, whose secretariat was consulted. The  regional linkages were clear, deliberate and relevant: South  Africa was being asked by other African states to help resolve a  regional problem."" This first meeting between Mugabe and De  Klerk ""should presage more amicable relations, both now and  after the April election. Doors are opening further afield,  too: the next government will be invited to rejoin the  Commonwealth and this week's events may help influence opinions  on both sides.""    SOWETAN    Botswana Meeting Platform for De Klerk To Meet  Mugabe--Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 January in a  page-10 editorial says many people must be ""disappointed at the  outcome of the meeting"" in Botswana between President Masire,  President Mugabe and President de Klerk concerning Lesotho's  military crisis. ""Here were three presidents who listened to a  presentation by Lesotho's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Selometse  Baholo, and then appointed a task force to investigate the issue  further. Why not act on the information provided by Baholo?""  This ""vacillation must stop if the Lesotho crisis is not to  develop into a major regional crisis. Unless the purpose of the  meeting was not to discuss Lesotho, but to provide a platform  for F.W. de Klerk to meet Mugabe before his term expires. Which  would be a pity, for people may have died in Lesotho and many  more may die unless effective steps are taken now, which we urge  the leaders of southern Africa to do without any more  commissions and committees.""

Its MPs ""will be subject to ANC discipline and the  orders of ANC parliamentary whips. If they vote against ANC  orders, they will lose their seats.

The pro-Beijing daily, in a report from Changchun City in  Jilin Province, called the agreement a measure to accelerate the  birth of a northeast Asian economic triangle centered on the  Tuman River.    The triangle runs from Chongjin port in North Korea to Yanji  City in China and Vladivostok in Russia -- all near the Tuman  River.    The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), South and  North Korea, China, Russia and Japan are trying to develop the  Tuman River basin as a special economic zone.    The state-run Yanji Trading Co. of China has, in a series of  contacts with North Korea, agreed to invest 370 million yuan (37  million U.S. dollars) in joint development of Chongjin.    When the project is completed, South Korean, Taiwanese,  U.S.,  Japanese and Hong Kong ships will be allowed to call at the  port, the paper said.    It did not reveal the amount of investment by North Korea.    Under the agreement, Yanji will jointly develop the port  with  North Korea, build a 95km-long road between Chongjin and  Hoeryong and erect a hotel with a floor space of 30,000 square  meters.    The paper said that the joint development will greatly  increase the berth and cargo handling capacity of Chongjin port  and promote economic cooperation and trade between northeast  Asian countries.

Addressing the World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, Mr  de Klerk told international business leaders that South Africa  would be foolish if it ""precipitately tore out the stitches from  wounds which are only now beginning to heal"".    But Mr Mbeki, speaking from the same platform, said his  sister-in-law was still looking for her unionist husband who had  disappeared without trace in Durban about seven years ago. ""We  are trying to find him and we are hoping somewhere in South  Africa there is somebody who knows what happened, who will come  and say I am sorry...because of the particular times in which we  were, we took him and because of who he was and what he was  doing, given those times, unfortunately we got rid of him.  That's why you can't find him. Because then his wife and two  children can at last say he is dead and do whatever custom and  tradition demand they do in the circumstances. It's that kind  of truth, (Deputy) President de Klerk, that we are looking for.""  His sister-in-law could then become part of the process of  national reconciliation, Mr Mbeki added.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk said South Africa had to be very  careful  how it approached sensitive questions relating to the past,  particularly with regard to amnesty, indemnity and the truth  commission. ""We agree that processes have to be developed to  put the political crimes of the past behind us once and for all,  that the wounds of the past must be healed. But such a process  cannot be allowed to develop into a tug of war or even a running  sore which might continue to suppurate for years."" The reality,  he said, was that during the past conflict, unacceptable crimes  were committed by followers of all sides and factions. ""We have  just completed four years of hard negotiation aimed at resolving  that conflict. We would be foolish if we precipitately tore out  the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal.""    Mr de Klerk also said it was important that South Africa  ""build well"" and not make basic errors that could weaken its  national structure in the future. He had no problem with  affirmative action, but the country should be very careful about  the way it implemented such programmes, and dared not throw  merit out of the window. ""Instead of drifting into new  state-sponsored discrimination against some members of our  society, we should redouble our efforts to remove any vestiges  of discrimination against any South African.""    Other issues that would have to be handled with sensitivity  and care were land ownership, financial discipline, the size of  the civil service and the funding of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme.

Wang left for the southern island of Hainan on Wednesday and  nothing was heard of him since. Li disappeared Monday, while the  unnamed board member was arrested Tuesday, the activists said.

0,FT933-5763 ,"FT933-5763 _AN-DIAB3AGHFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (10): An optimistic outlook - Stock markets      By TONY HAWKINS   PROBABLY there is more optimism and enthusiasm about stock market development in Africa than about any other aspect of the business landscape. The strong rebound in Latin American markets since the end of the 1980s shows what could happen in sub-Saharan Africa as reform programmes take hold. Zimbabwe's experience is a case in point. Reforms introduced mid-year, including reduced taxes and guaranteed free exit for dividends and disinvestment proceeds, saw the ZSE index rise more than 50 per cent, driven by an influx of more than Dollars 2m in foreign money. Initiatives from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private investment agencies will boost the sector. In mid-1991, there were no funds operating in the region, but in the past two years, a number have been established, most notably the Africa Growth Fund (a venture capital vehicle), the Commonwealth Equity Fund, the Emerging Markets Fund and the Mauritius Fund, while London-based Genesis Emerging Markets Fund has minor African holdings. Also active in the fund field is the Wall Street-based Aidoo group, headed by a Ghanaian American, Judith Aidoo, which earlier in the year formed an investment advisory arm, Aidoo Group Asset Management. AGAM plans to market African fixed-interest and equity securities to US investors. Initially, it is using a niche market approach seeking to interest expatriate Africans living in the US and elsewhere in investing back home, while also targeting black Americans. The fund, of about Dollars 20m to Dollars 30m is likely to be followed by a purely equity fund at a later stage. South Africa comes into the picture here too, with scope for reversing the sanctions process of pension funds and institutional investors that divested from the country during the sanctions era. Ms Aidoo is also developing innovative ways of tapping into privatisation and debt restructuring financings. One of these involves linking the Clinton administration's proposed 'Russia Fund', designed to finance Russian privatisation, with debt relief for African countries that owe money to the Russians. Angola, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia together owe the former Soviet Union some Dollars 14bn. She suggests that Russia should sell its African debt to western donors in the G-7 group at deep discounts. The Aidoo group puts the market value of African debt owed to Russia at no more than 10c in the dollar. So a Pounds 1bn Russia privatisation fund could purchase Dollars 10bn of the total Dollars 14bn African debt owed to Russia. The purchasers could then either cancel the debt outright or use it for debt-for-nature or debt-equity swaps. Debt trade is also a growing area. The Aidoo group estimates the outstanding debt paper at around Dollars 180bn - or almost 30 per cent of the global market in emerging market debt - covering 60 to 70 issues with an annual turnover of some Dollars 13bn. Prices range up to 50 per cent of nominal value, but the average is lower at around 15 per cent. This year, Salomon Brothers in New York calculated Nigerian par bonds were the highest yielding collateralised Brady bond paper in the market, offering a yield of some 15 per cent compared with 9.3 per cent for Mexico. But the fundamental need is the return of sub-Saharan Africa's 'stock' of flight capital, which may exceed 80 per cent of GDP, according to the World Bank calculations. Only after Africans show themselves willing to invest in their own countries will foreigners follow.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.     ZWZ  Zimbabwe, Africa.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Speaking  at a press conference at the World Economic Forum summit in Cape  Town he said the African National Congress' economics department  and Finance Minister Derek Keys believed the controls should be  lifted as soon as possible. The way South African Business  responded to the political transition was going to be a key  determinant of this.    Mr Manuel welcomed their response to the programme and their  willingness to establish a fund for it. ""I think political  certainty will also see more investment by South African  corporations in new opportunities. All that will hasten the  date by which we will be able to announce the lifting of  exchange controls. It is a matter under discussion.""    Vice-chairman of the United States-based Citicorp and  Citibank Bill Rhodes told journalists he was ""very impressed""  with the realism of the new government. South Africa needed to  demonstrate it would continue to show fiscal and monetary  discipline to obtain a positive credit rating in international  markets. He said Citicorp had recently been granted a licence  to open a representative office in South Africa and hoped to be  able to do so in the next few months. It was already allocating  funds to trade finance facilities. He sensed a strong  recognition by the South African Government that they needed to  maintain the balance between economic reforms and providing  social necessities.    Mr Manuel said funds raised by merchant banks in the US for  investment in South Africa had done exceedingly well. ""They've  surpassed expectations. That must say something about the way  people are reading the moment in South Africa.""     "

Officials said millions of people will be affected, AP reports from Washington. Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import substantial quantities of grain. As the drought persists, estimates of the grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously. The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the continent's overall food crisis. The north-east is the most deprived area in Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The lives of 15m people are thought to be at risk. Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come soon. The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that the drought could lead to widespread famine. About 98m people live in the affected regions in southern Africa. 'Considerable donor assistance will be needed to avert a major humanitarian crisis in the region,' the US State Department said last week.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

C. Tsai]    [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African  police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental  Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan  diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade.    Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection  Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said  the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's  National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU  on wildlife protection.    None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved  in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said.    Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been  interviewed by the EIA.    The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to  express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In  addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation  group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations.    During a meeting of nongovernment organizations (NGO)  following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva  Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South  African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino  horns.    A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a  diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of  the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body.    The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in  February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was  found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued  by the South African Government.    Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing  Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.     "

The Mach-5 engine is being developed as a joint effort by  aerospace engine makers from Japan, the U.S., Britain and  France. The design calls for an engine which combines a  turbojet, like those used on conventional subsonic aircraft,  with a ramjet, like those used on missiles. The turbojet would  accelerate the aircraft up to Mach-3, after which the ramjet  would kick in.    A one-third scale model of the turbojet part of the engine  has been constructed which is capable of withstanding  temperatures of 1,600 C--a temperature at which conventional  engines melt. To achieve this high heat resistance, the engine  blades were made from a special nickel alloy and a more  effective air-cooling system was designed.    This model was then loaded with fuel and fired up for the  first time to verify the engine's power characteristics and its  ability to withstand shaking. The tests were carried out on 15  November at a plant operated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries Co.    The small-scale model engine did not reach an internal  temperature of 1,600 C during the tests, but the international  research group does not plan to test the heat-resistant  characteristics of the engine until fiscal 1995. The goal is to  develop a practical Mach-5 engine by the year 2020.     "

Today we  celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the  people of South Africa.    Our country has arrived at a decision. Among all the parties  that contested the elections, the overwhelming majority of South  Africans have mandated the African National Congress to lead our  country into the future. The South Africa we have struggled  for, in which all our people, be they African, coloured, Indian  or white, regard themselves as citizens of one nation is at hand.    Perhaps it was history that ordained that it be here, at the  Cape of Good Hope that we should lay the foundation stone of our  new nation. For it was here at this Cape, over three centuries  ago, that there began the fateful convergence of the peoples of  Africa, Europe and Asia on these shores. It was to this  peninsula that the patriots, among them many princes and  scholars, of Indonesia were dragged in chains. It was on the  sandy plains of this peninsula that first battles of the epic  wars of resistance were fought.    When we look out across Table Bay, the horizon is dominated  by Ro?ben Island, whose infamy as a dungeon built to stifle the  spirit of freedom is as old as colonialism in South Africa. For  three centuries that island was seen as a place to which  outcasts can be banished. The names of those who were  incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll call of resistance  fighters and democrats spanning over three centuries. If indeed  this is a Cape of Good Hope, that hope owes much to the spirit  of that legion of fighters and others of their calibre.    We have fought for a democratic constitution since the  1880s.  Ours has been a quest for a constitution freely adopted by the  people of South Africa, reflecting their wishes and their  aspirations. The struggle for democracy has never been a matter  pursued by one race, class, religious community or gender among  South Africans. In honouring those who fought to see this day  arrive, we honour the best sons and daughters of all our people.  We can count amongst them Africans, coloureds, whites, Indians,  Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Jews -- all of them united by a  common vision of a better life for the people of this country.    It was that vision that inspired us in 1923 when we adopted  the first ever bill of rights in this country. That same vision  spurred us to put forward the African claims in 1946. It is  also the founding principle of the Freedom Charter we adopted as  policy in 1955, which in its very first lines, places before  South Africa an inclusive basis for citizenship.    In the 1980s the African National Congress was still  setting the pace, being the first major political formation in  South Africa to commit itself firmly to a bill of rights, which  we published in November 1990. These milestones give concrete  expression to what South Africa can become. They speak of a  constitutional, democratic, political order in which, regardless  of colour, gender, religion, political opinion or sexual  orientation, the law will provide for the equal protection of  all citizens.    They project a democracy in which the government, whomever  that government may be, will be bound by a higher set of rules,  embodied in a constitution, and will not be able govern the  country as it pleases.    Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is  especially true in a country such as ours where the vast  majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the  same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political  and other minorities be safeguarded.    In the political order we have established there will be  regular, open and free elections, at all levels of government -  central, provincial and municipal. There shall also be a social  order which respects completely the culture, language and  religious rights of all sections of our society and the  fundamental rights of the individual.    The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated  us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority  lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work  with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the  future. The cornerstone of building a better life of  opportunity, freedom and expression is the most dynamic program  of social upliftment in the history of this country. The  Reconstruction and Development Programme -- this needs unity of  purpose. It needs unity in action. It requires us all to work  together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and  build a nation united in our diversity.    The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections.  They want change! And change is what they will get. Our plan  is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to  guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the  widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our  people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to  support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a  central role we will try to change our country from a net  exporter of raw materials to one that exports finished products  through beneficiation.    The government will devise policies that encourage and  reward  productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities -  African, coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we  can assist them to make inroads into the productive and  manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale  distribution to which they are presently confined.    To raise our country and its people from the morass of  racism  and apartheid will require determination and effort. As a  government, the ANC will create a legal framework that will  assist, rather than impede, the awesome task of reconstruction  and development of our battered society.    While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit  of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate  and bring about the change that our mandate from the people  demands.    We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South  Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the  conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the  past with the intent of constructing a new order based on  justice for all.    This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today,  and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.     "

It won't work like that,' says Mr John Kane-Berman, director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, highlighting the most daunting problem of the post-apartheid era: how to meet the enormous economic expectations raised by the prospect of black rule. For any new government will immediately face one grim truth: that South Africa simply does not have the resources to raise black living standards overnight to white levels, and there is no explosion of economic growth on the horizon to meet the country's huge development needs. South Africa's under-educated population lacks the skills needed for economic revolution along Far Eastern lines. And over the next generation, the sheer weight of numbers will depress efforts at economic upliftment: by 2010, South Africa's 1980 population of 29.1m will have nearly doubled to 59.7m, according to the Urban Foundation, a business-funded policy institute. It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be up to the task of housing, educating and employing nearly 60m people. Black South Africans may well find that life remains a struggle. The first post-apartheid government will inherit a country where, in the words of the authoritative Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa, published in 1989, 'poverty is deep and widespread and . . . the degree of inequality is as great as in any other country in the world.' For a nation so advanced - the World Bank classifies it as an upper middle-income developing country - the extent of poverty is striking. The charity Operation Hunger feeds 1.8m people daily, victims of the three-year recession and this year's catastrophic drought. In 1989, 40 per cent of the population (excluding the nominally independent homelands where poverty is rife) is estimated to have lived below the so-called 'minimum living level' or poverty line. A recent IMF report* notes that in terms of social indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality 'black South Africa has done at best only moderately better than its neighbours despite its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy'. The gap between white and black incomes further emphasises black deprivation: according to the Development Bank of Southern Africa, though black incomes have risen more than white incomes in recent years, the white share of total personal income was 54 per cent in 1988 (whites are 13 per cent of the population) while blacks representing nearly 80 per cent of the population had a 36 per cent share. Apartheid has ensured that state spending on social services is similarly skewed. According to the IMF, government spent R4,087 per capita educating whites in 1990, and only R907 on blacks, R2,406 for coloureds and R3,055 for Asians. Pensions, which are a principal source of income for the poorest South Africans, are also unequal: whites get a R345 monthly payment, blacks R293. Health spending is also distorted. And while whites are all at least decently housed - South African cities boast some of the world's most luxurious suburbs on earth - over more than 7m non-whites live in informal urban dwellings such as shacks. Racial disparities in social spending have narrowed substantially in recent years, and the government has devoted an extra R3bn of extra-budgetary funds for special education and housing projects. But the cost of introducing per capita parity between races would be extremely high. The IMF report states: 'Equalising spending levels at the present white level would result in an overall level of social spending dramatically beyond the capacity of the budget.' It notes that overall spending on education and health (though not on pensions) is already high in relation to GDP: indeed, education spending, as a share of the budget and of GDP, substantially exceeded not only that of middle-income countries, but also industrial nations. Abolishing the senseless duplications of apartheid would generate some savings: the new South Africa will not need 15 racially-based departments of finance, 15 education departments and 14 health ministries, complete with Mercedes-driving ministers in each one. But the cost of reincorporation is likely to exceed any savings: to raise per capita socio-economic spending on homeland blacks to the level which prevails in the Republic would mean a 38 per cent overall increase. And given that independence governments elsewhere in Africa have tended to increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it, there seems little chance that bloated homeland civil services or central government will be streamlined. The IMF report concludes: 'The scope for further compressing non-social spending (eg defence) . . . is limited and therefore implies that social expenditures will need to be re-ordered if the budget is to attend to the needs of the least privileged groups of society without significant resort to deficit financing or to higher taxes.' What this means in practice, according to minister of (black) education and training, Sam de Beer, is that if South Africa continues to spend 6 per cent of GDP on education (assuming 3 per cent overall economic growth and a 1:32 pupil/teacher ratio), government will be able to finance only seven years of compulsory education by 2000. The inevitable conclusion is the one drawn by the late Mr Simon Brand, formerly Development Bank chairman: 'We don't have the resources for the kind of welfare state we have been running for whites.' Substantially increasing taxes to fund greater social spending on blacks would be counter-productive, the IMF argues: 'The tax burden on the white community appears to be relatively high even by industrial country standards. This would argue against raising tax rates in South Africa and running the risk of heightening disincentive effects.' The IMF concludes: 'Redistribution policies will need to be firmly supported by growth-orientated policies if the social spending gap is to be effectively bridged.' For without economic growth, very little progress can be made toward a more economically just society. Yet sustaining growth at the 3.5 per cent required for what the IMF calls a 'meaningful increase in living standards' - during a period of great political and social turmoil - could well prove a tall order.* Economic Policies for a New South Africa, IMF, January 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EDUCATION INDICATORS IN 1990*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           White   Black   Coloured   Asian  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pupils (m)                 1.0     7.7       0.9      0.3 Pupil/teacher             18.6    40.8      23.3     21.7 Expenditure/pupil (R)    4,087     907     2,406    3,055  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Including public ordinary schools, secondary schools and technical training colleges  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: South Africa department of National Education: IMF staff estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SELECTED SOCIAL INDICATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                            White   Coloured   Asian   Black  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Life expectancy at birth                                          (in years) 1970                            68.5      58.0      62.5 1979                            69.9      61.5      64.8 1980*                           69.5      58.6      65.5    58.5                                            Literacy                                   (rates of adult literacy) 1970                            98.0      69.0      74.0 1979                            99.3      84.5      92.4 1980                            99.3      84.5      92.4    67.0                                        Infant mortality                                (deaths per 1,000 live births) 1950                            35.7     134.3      68.5   165.0 1960                            29.6     128.6      59.6    95.0 1970                            21.6     133.5      36.4    85.0 1980                            13.1      60.7      24.4    70.0 1988                            13.2      57.5      17.4    57.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *1980 figures are computed at age 12 months  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Eckert (1986); South African Department of Information, Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa; Department of National health and Population, 1990 Health Trends in South Africa  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page VIII  "

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania      The Tanzania-Zambia Railway could well be a metaphor for Africa's path in the  1980s.    Known as Tazara, the 1,100-mile, Chinese-built line linking the copper belt of  Zambia to this Tanzanian port was turned over to the governments of the two  abutting countries just before the decade began. Included were 128 new  locomotives and hundreds of passenger and freight cars to run on the gleaming  rails. Western countries contributed millions of dollars to maintain the right  of way and to train railroad staff.    Today, little more than a decade after its opening, only 39 of the engines  remain in working order. Another 39 are awaiting repair, and 50 have been  destroyed by collisions and derailings on the deteriorating line.    Last year, a Swedish development agency donated 350 new cars to the railway --  enough, it has been estimated, to last only seven years at the current rate of  wreckage. Some of the cars derailed on their maiden journey, the Swedes  recently complained in a blistering letter to the two governments.    Like Tazara, whose fate is the result of chronic African maladies of  inattention, lack of maintenance, and penury, so went most of the continent in  the 1980s. Development experts describe sub-Saharan Africa as a train running  downhill to disaster.    After a period of genuine hope in the 1970s, these experts describe the 1980s  as the region's lost decade. By almost every measure of human welfare and  economic health, the area retrogressed during that period, in some cases so  sharply that Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, remarked recently that  most Africans today are every bit as poor as they were 30 years ago, at the  dawn of the continent's era of independence.    ""There was general deterioration in the main macroeconomic indicators,  widespread disintegration of productive facilities, a rapid worsening in the  social scene, repeated droughts and accelerating environmental degradation,""  says a U.N. report. ""The unending crisis did not affect only the current  well-being of the average African; it threatened the long-term development  prospects of the region as a whole.""    The 1980s saw many of Africa's modest gains of the previous 10 or 15 years  swept off in a windstorm of deteriorating roads, disappearing forest and  cropland, collapsing schoolhouses, and mushrooming military budgets.    One can debate which African capital has the biggest potholes on its  thoroughfares. Efforts to stem deforestation by planting fast-growing  eucalyptus trees fail because Africans who need wood for fuel cut them down  faster than they can grow. Ethiopia, which ranks close to rock-bottom in almost  every measure of welfare and development known to humankind, spends more than  50% of its budget on weapons to fight a largely stalemated 30-year civil war  with Eritrean rebels.    Many fear that the 1990s will be worse. For one thing, the rest of the world is  losing interest in a place that never seems to get better.    ""The broad international support for helping a continent in distress in the  1980s has been dissipated now by repeated calls for assistance,"" says Salim  Lone, a Kenyan who edits Africa Recovery, a U.N. journal of development news.  ""How long can people accept that Africa is a special place, when the economic  and political returns from Eastern Europe are infinitely greater?""    Africa no longer has a geopolitical card to play. Gone are the days when  Ethiopia and Somalia could play the East and West off against each other by  switching allegiance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zaire can  no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels  in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side.    ""In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning  to the East or West,"" Lone says. ""But now East-West amity has stripped the  continent of whatever strategic value it had before.""    The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are  increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their  export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their  appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign  currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for  want of spare parts.    At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29  billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and  higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan  Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%.    The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population  of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium.    There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement:  the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in  terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life  expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life  expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are  Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic  and Chad (46).    Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also  African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the  worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and  Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134).    Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10  countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan  Africa.    There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social  fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a  demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every  country.    More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in  Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's  one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who  fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis.    The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be  rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should  be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with  significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper  Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and  Malawi are landlocked.    A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or  ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where  weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent.    But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of  this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to  issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and  wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of  these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya,  perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts  to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it.    When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's  post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's  highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its  colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic  policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that  have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant.    Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil  servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a  two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford  less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs.    Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a  surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan  Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new  customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as  the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either  collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States,  proven totally ineffective.    The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax  machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These  machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one  person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's  and one-sixteenth that in Latin America.    ""These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the  1990s and beyond,"" warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission  for Africa.    Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate  among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the  extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue  that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and  administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the  amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa.    ""You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that  actually benefits Africans?"" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in  West Africa. ""Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to  support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the  money in any program is spent.""    Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of  demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the  rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices.    In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied  statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a  multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of  Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen  obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so  severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and  crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction.    African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges,  30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices  collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still  depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign  earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the  countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets.    The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to  the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small  horticulture industry. Today the country is the world's fourth-biggest exporter  of cut flowers.    African leaders talk incessantly about how the national borders drawn up by the  former colonial powers institutionalized political tensions by arbitrarily  dividing some tribes and combining others.    Thirty years of economic history suggests the problem is not necessarily the  wrong borders, but too many of them. Many sub-Saharan countries are simply too  small or too deprived to be self-sufficient. Eleven are landlocked. Thirty-four  have fewer than 10 million people. The distribution of natural resources is  uneven: Zambia, with 7.5 million people, has copper and broad swaths of arable  land -- largely unused -- while in neighboring Malawi, a similar population is  crowded on one-seventh as much territory and with no mineral deposits at all.    African leaders complain, quite fairly, that in granting independence their  European colonial masters left them with inadequate roads and railroads and a  pitifully small cadre of university-educated leaders. But it is clear now that  these leaders themselves must shoulder much of the blame for their countries'  problems.    One key is the persistence of failed policies. Many African statesmen formed  their economic ideas in the crucible of anti-colonialism: They reacted against  not only European politics, but also European free-market economics, which they  saw as exploitative. Great leaders like Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania created something called ""African socialism,"" based on what  they contended was Africans' unique sense of community and self-help.    Today Zambia and Tanzania are among Africa's most dismal failures. Nyerere's  catch-phrase, articulated in the ""Arusha Declaration"" of 1967, was ""socialism  and self-reliance."" But after decades of receiving the highest per-capita  foreign aid in all sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania is one of the world's least  self-reliant countries.    Kaunda, whose frequent emotional, even tearful, public speeches on the evils of  nuclear proliferation and other scarcely relevant issues have made him a figure  of worldwide respect, has presided over the collapse of one of Africa's most  promising lands. Zambia became independent blessed with the best industrial  base in southern Africa; it has been left a rotting skeleton through the  mismanagement of state-owned enterprises operating in an environment of  unbridled corruption.    ""Everyone knows that to run a socialist enterprise you need good management to  make up for the lack of individual incentives like the profit motive,"" one  Scandinavian development official said in discussing the disastrous record of  state-owned farms in nominally Marxist Ethiopia. ""Of course, management skills  are the one thing most lacking in Africa.""    Wherever the blame lies, the toll of Africa's marginalization is enormous. The  U.N. Development Program recently noted that ""between 1979 and 1985 the number  of African people below the poverty line increased by almost two-thirds,  compared with an average increase of one-fifth in the entire developing world.""    The urgency embodied in this figure has, oddly enough, led development  officials to contemplate how the ""quick fixes"" of the 1970s and 1980s went  awry: The manipulations of currency rates and the rapid infusions of aid money  and project ideas that frequently canceled each other out or duplicated effort  -- all without helping Africans build and sustain their own institutions.    Some development experts say what Africa needs may be something approaching  benign neglect. If the developed world does begin to withdraw attention and  resources from the embattled continent, one notes, it may finally wean itself  from the diet of aid.    ""There is a positive side,"" he says. ""It may actually encourage governments to  adopt policies that will be much more self-reliant and not as dependent on  outside resources.""    Africa and Third World: Region Falls Behind    Not only do the nearly 40 countries of black Afric live in a different economic  world than the industrialized countries; they are slipping behind the rest of  the THird World by many key measures of development.

Zaire can  no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels  in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side.    ""In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning  to the East or West,"" Lone says. ""But now East-West amity has stripped the  continent of whatever strategic value it had before.""    The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are  increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their  export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their  appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign  currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for  want of spare parts.    At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29  billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and  higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan  Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%.    The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population  of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium.    There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement:  the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in  terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life  expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life  expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are  Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic  and Chad (46).    Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also  African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the  worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and  Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134).    Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10  countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan  Africa.    There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social  fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a  demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every  country.    More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in  Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's  one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who  fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis.    The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be  rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should  be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with  significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper  Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and  Malawi are landlocked.    A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or  ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where  weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent.    But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of  this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to  issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and  wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of  these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya,  perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts  to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it.    When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's  post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's  highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its  colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic  policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that  have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant.    Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil  servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a  two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford  less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs.    Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a  surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan  Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new  customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as  the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either  collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States,  proven totally ineffective.    The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax  machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These  machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one  person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's  and one-sixteenth that in Latin America.    ""These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the  1990s and beyond,"" warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission  for Africa.    Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate  among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the  extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue  that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and  administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the  amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa.    ""You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that  actually benefits Africans?"" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in  West Africa. ""Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to  support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the  money in any program is spent.""    Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of  demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the  rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices.    In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied  statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a  multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of  Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen  obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so  severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and  crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction.    African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges,  30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices  collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still  depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign  earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the  countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets.    The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to  the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small  horticulture industry. Today the country is the world's fourth-biggest exporter  of cut flowers.    African leaders talk incessantly about how the national borders drawn up by the  former colonial powers institutionalized political tensions by arbitrarily  dividing some tribes and combining others.    Thirty years of economic history suggests the problem is not necessarily the  wrong borders, but too many of them. Many sub-Saharan countries are simply too  small or too deprived to be self-sufficient. Eleven are landlocked. Thirty-four  have fewer than 10 million people. The distribution of natural resources is  uneven: Zambia, with 7.5 million people, has copper and broad swaths of arable  land -- largely unused -- while in neighboring Malawi, a similar population is  crowded on one-seventh as much territory and with no mineral deposits at all.    African leaders complain, quite fairly, that in granting independence their  European colonial masters left them with inadequate roads and railroads and a  pitifully small cadre of university-educated leaders. But it is clear now that  these leaders themselves must shoulder much of the blame for their countries'  problems.    One key is the persistence of failed policies. Many African statesmen formed  their economic ideas in the crucible of anti-colonialism: They reacted against  not only European politics, but also European free-market economics, which they  saw as exploitative. Great leaders like Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania created something called ""African socialism,"" based on what  they contended was Africans' unique sense of community and self-help.    Today Zambia and Tanzania are among Africa's most dismal failures. Nyerere's  catch-phrase, articulated in the ""Arusha Declaration"" of 1967, was ""socialism  and self-reliance."" But after decades of receiving the highest per-capita  foreign aid in all sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania is one of the world's least  self-reliant countries.    Kaunda, whose frequent emotional, even tearful, public speeches on the evils of  nuclear proliferation and other scarcely relevant issues have made him a figure  of worldwide respect, has presided over the collapse of one of Africa's most  promising lands. Zambia became independent blessed with the best industrial  base in southern Africa; it has been left a rotting skeleton through the  mismanagement of state-owned enterprises operating in an environment of  unbridled corruption.    ""Everyone knows that to run a socialist enterprise you need good management to  make up for the lack of individual incentives like the profit motive,"" one  Scandinavian development official said in discussing the disastrous record of  state-owned farms in nominally Marxist Ethiopia. ""Of course, management skills  are the one thing most lacking in Africa.""    Wherever the blame lies, the toll of Africa's marginalization is enormous. The  U.N. Development Program recently noted that ""between 1979 and 1985 the number  of African people below the poverty line increased by almost two-thirds,  compared with an average increase of one-fifth in the entire developing world.""    The urgency embodied in this figure has, oddly enough, led development  officials to contemplate how the ""quick fixes"" of the 1970s and 1980s went  awry: The manipulations of currency rates and the rapid infusions of aid money  and project ideas that frequently canceled each other out or duplicated effort  -- all without helping Africans build and sustain their own institutions.    Some development experts say what Africa needs may be something approaching  benign neglect. If the developed world does begin to withdraw attention and  resources from the embattled continent, one notes, it may finally wean itself  from the diet of aid.    ""There is a positive side,"" he says. ""It may actually encourage governments to  adopt policies that will be much more self-reliant and not as dependent on  outside resources.""    Africa and Third World: Region Falls Behind    Not only do the nearly 40 countries of black Afric live in a different economic  world than the industrialized countries; they are slipping behind the rest of  the THird World by many key measures of development.

General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with praise during his visit, the first by a South African leader. He said Mr de Klerk deserved a place alongside the most famous black South African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric. These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian, given the open hostility which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades. But Gen Babangida went beyond rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation. Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in South Africa, likely within months. Reconciliation with South Africa may prove the largest foreign affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a civilian government at end of the year. Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis which they hope will give the continent new clout in international relations. There were protestations of African brotherhood from both, each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two superpowers.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

This policy, called  the ""New Frontier Program,"" aims to provide comprehensive  assistance to southern African nations, which are attracting  much global interest, so as to improve the economic situation of  the whole region on the occasion of RSA's achieving the  historical change from white domination to multiracial  coexistence. Japan especially aims to stress the expanded  range of its international contribution, which tends to be  regarded as ""Asian-oriented.""    Providing ODA to the RSA has been allowed since 1990 only  for  the purpose of helping black citizens to become self-reliant.  However, by the end of 1992, Japan had only provided about 100  million yen in small-scale grants and technical cooperation.    Following the new administration's inauguration, it is  expected that larger assistance will be needed in the future.  Therefore, Japan wants to positively extend cooperation in the  form of loans and other aid on the premise that the OECD's  Development Assistance Committee will designate RSA as a  qualified recipient of assistance.    With regard to Mozambique, Japan has already decided to  provide it with full-fledged ODA in the form of bilateral  assistance, while also participating in UN Peacekeeping  Operations. Japan is now studying details of the plan.  Moreover, in light of the establishment of the new  administration in the RSA, Japan will expand its assistance  program to cover Botswana, where the Southern African  Development Community's secretariat is located, so that Japan  can carry out comprehensive assistance. Japan provided  Mozambique with about $200 million in bilateral assistance from  1988 to 1992, and Botswana with about $5 million from 1987 to  1992.     "

0,FT941-10902 ,"FT941-10902 _AN-EBGC7AFBFT 940207   FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (25): Continent of hazard and opportunity - Africa      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Which of the world's emerging markets can boast an investment fund where a Dollars 1,000 stake a year ago has risen to nearly Dollars 1,500? Surprisingly, the answer is Africa. Even more surprising, the country concerned is Nigeria, where the economic reform programme has collapsed  - but a shrewd purchase of Nigerian debt is paying off for investors. The New York-based International Asset Transactions decided in 1992 that Nigerian promissory notes (issued in the mid 1980s to clear Dollars 4.2bn in trade arrears) and par bonds (which discounted commercial bank debt at 40 cents to the dollar in a 1991 settlement with the London Club) were underpriced. Gus Udo and Donna Young of IAT noted that servicing these deals cost Nigeria comparatively little - around 14 days a year of the country's 1.4m-barrel daily production of oil. They reckoned that no sensible government would alienate the banks and the trading houses by defaulting on the terms of the two settlements. So, in January 1993 they launched the Nigeria Emerging Market Fund, an open-end mutual fund registered in the Cayman Islands, with about two thirds in Nigeria Central Bank promissory notes and most of the balance in Brady par bonds. The results have been remarkable. Behind the general view that Africa's debt instruments are generally undervalued lies a fundamental reappraisal of the continent's prospects. 'Africa is poised for growth,' declares Morgan Stanley, which has launched a Dollars 40m Africa Investment Fund. Its bullish 50 - page appraisal of the continent argues that the economic and political reforms under way for the best part of a decade are coming good. Prices for the region's exports such as cocoa, coffee, gold are recovering, and industrial metals are bottoming. Africa, argues the report, which includes a useful guide to the dozen stock markets operating and the 20 others being developed, 'harbours undervalued assets, particularly in the natural resource and manufacturing sectors'. 'Where stock markets are up and running,' says Morgan Stanley, 'investors can find attractively priced issues, both on a price-earnings and price-to-book basis.' By international standards the African market - excluding South Africa, which ranks just outside the world's top 10 - is tiny. Its exchanges have a combined market capitalisation of around Dollars 12bn compared to India's Dollars 91bn. Nevertheless, the belief in the resurgence of Africa's fortunes, led by hopes for a thriving post apartheid South Africa, has caught the imagination of international fund managers. Mr Miles Morland, of London-based Blakeney Management, calculates that at least Dollars 3bn of foreign money is being targeted at South Africa and a further Dollars 1bn at the rest of Africa in 1994: 'Peanuts in Mexico or Hong Kong, but they are liable to blow the African market apart at the seams.' The total amount of stock available in the whole of Africa (excluding South Africa) is about Dollars 2.2bn, he reckons: 'If almost half of this turns over in 1994, a huge increase on the 1993 levels, there will still only be Dollars 1bn of African equities to be fought over by local investors, global investors and all the new Africa funds.' The continent's heavyweight is South Africa. With a market capitalisation of some Dollars 150bn, South Africa is not so much an emerging market but a re-emerging market, comments Nigel Scheckter of Micropal, the Boston-based fund performance measurement service, which monitors 26,000 funds. But 'the true float is tiny relative to the wave of US guilt money that will elbow its way into the market this year,' says Mr Morland. Foreign buyers have already made their mark on Diagonal Street. Figures supplied by Baring Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthing in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. 'The market is the best one-way ticket I can think of, barring the 20 per cent bloodbath prospect' - a reference to fears that the April elections may trigger destabilising violence. Elsewhere, Mr Morland singles out Ghana, a tiny market but likely to grow rapidly as the privatisation programme led by Ashanti Gold moves ahead, Zimbabwe, where foreign buying in the second half of 1993 helped more than double the industrial index, Morocco and Tunisia. Is the excitement warranted, are the risks appreciated, and how well do the analysts know Africa? Morgan Stanley's upbeat view of the continent does not overlook the problems  -pointing among other things to weak management, and what it calls Africa's 'fear and distrust of foreign business influence'. But the overall picture that emerges may strike some readers as too rosy. The assertion that 'tribal tension in most of black Africa is probably less of a problem than racial tension in the US' may simply be an unorthodox view. More serious is the assertion that 28 of Africa's 50 states 'have economic reform programmes in place'. This list is based, says Morgan Stanley, on World Bank evaluations - not always, it should be said, the best judge of its own reform efforts. Some examples of reform listed by Morgan Stanley are risible - such as Zaire, where the political and economic malaise deepens by the day. Also on the list is Burundi, where the recent coup (which took place after the report's publication) illustrates the volatility of the African condition. The inclusion of Sao Tome, little more than a dot in the ocean, trivialises the list. Nigeria - 'a powerhouse waiting to happen', according to Morgan Stanley - 'perseveres with its structural adjustment programme, launched in 1986', writes the analyst. At the time the report was published (October 1993) it was clear that Nigeria's erratic attempt to implement the programme was the reason an IMF agreement lapsed some two years ago. Any hopes that Nigeria's military regime would revive the lapsed programme were set back last month, when it fixed the exchange rate and local interest rates at unrealistic levels. Africa's performance in general has been weak. As Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe writes in a recent paper: 'More than a dozen years after the launch of aid-funded structural adjustment programmes, it is impossible to identify a single mainland sub-Saharan country that has made a success of economic reform.' 'The best that can be said,' he continues, 'is that in countries such as Ghana and Uganda, the spiral of decline has been reversed, but it will take well into the next century before earlier living standards are regained.' A somewhat tougher investment appraisal comes from the Meridien BIAO group which runs a network of banks in 20 countries across Africa, led by Andrew Sardanis and Colin Goodwin, two veteran Africa hands. The investment climate is improving, says Colin Goodwin, president of the group, 'but by nothing like enough. 'Investment through individual African stock exchanges is not the best route for the emerging market fund,' he adds, 'as these exchanges are still too small and surrounded by too many restrictions'. The response of Africans with resources abroad may well prove the acid test of whether an African investment makes sense: if the continent's politicians, businessmen, civil servants are not risking their capital, foreign investors may suspect that Africa's elite knows something they do not. *Africa: Wrestling with the stigma of history.

The sources said that Dennis Ross will carry with him new  Israeli proposals regarding the negotiations on the  Syrian-Israeli track and an amendment to the Israeli plan on  withdrawal from ""Majdal Shams First"" so as to include in the  first phase a withdrawal from five villages on the Golan  Heights, then diplomatic relations would be established between  Syria and Tel Aviv.    The sources said that Syria has told the U.S. Administration  that the guarantees offered to it so far under the Israeli plan  are insufficient and conflict with the basic principles of the  bilateral negotiations and the need for Israel's commitment to a  full withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the implementation of  the land for peace principle, and that security guarantees  concern not only Israel, but all the parties concerned.    The sources pointed out that the U.S. administration is  seeking to get Syria to agree to resume bilateral negotiations  on the Syrian-Israeli track, especially after Jordan's agreement  to resume negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track.    In the context of a new tour of the region for U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher in a new bid to revive peace  opportunities between Syria and Israel, Syria has expressed its  indignation at the Israeli position and the Rabin government's  continued refusal to withdraw, which, in the Syrian officials'  view, freezes the peace process and keeps it at a standstill.    A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that what  Rabin said, namely that there has been nothing new with regard  to the talks with Syria and the existence of huge gaps between  the Syrian and Israeli positions on the peace process, is  attributable to the fact that the Rabin government continues to  deal with the basis of the peace process from the angle of  retaining the Golan and not withdrawing fully from the occupied  Arab territories, thus exposing itself as a party that has no  desire for a just and comprehensive peace. Meanwhile the Syrian  position is fully responsive to the requirements of peace and to  all the political efforts being made to achieve it on the basis  of just and comprehensive foundations. Syria proceeds from its  eagerness to achieve a secure and lasting peace that cannot be  shaken by storms.    The Syrian official said that, if Israel is really and  seriously seeking peace, all it has to do is to withdraw fully  from the Arab territories, implement the resolutions of  international legitimacy in order to achieve peace in the  region, and stop -- it and its leader -- swimming against the  tide.    Meanwhile a Syrian military official has told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that Israeli armament is a threat to the region's  security and stability. And that Israeli military thinking --  regardless of the costs -- is working to make Israel a military  state. It is not interested in peace. It is interested in war  and in expanding the aggression. The source said that Israel is  in the forefront of the states receiving arms, and it is the  most prominent with regard to the purchase of various types of  military equipment, despite what is being said about control of  the arms race in the region.    The military official criticized states that supply Israel  with arms while they continue to talk about peace endeavors and  efforts. He said that when the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which  the United States believes is within the framework of peace, was  being signed, Israel was supplied -- by airlift -- with 24  Apaches. They were supplied under U.S. military aid. These  helicopters are among the best in the world. A squadron of  these helicopters took part recently in shelling Lebanese  resistance positions in Lebanon, causing great devastation.    Israel has also a group of pilotless planes like Harvey  Searcher Falcon, Eagle-eye, Kurns-2000, and modified Hunter  ""Binar"" [names as transliterated]. There is information  confirming Israel's possession of a group of Patriot missiles,  which were supplied to the Israeli Army during the Gulf war.    The Syrian military official added that the quantity and  quality of the arms in Israel's possession and those which it is  seeking to possess is not in line with the peace proposals and  confirm that Israel does not want peace, but, rather, is  preparing for war, as Washington continues to officially declare  its eagerness to maintain Israel's military superiority over  neighboring Arab states, safeguarding this superiority within  the equations of military strategic balance and confronting the  advanced weapons owned by some Arab states with weapons that are  superior.    The official pointed out that this military superiority  represents a real threat to peace in the region, and no peace  can last where the military balances of power are disrupted.     "

Mr Mandela, on a two-day visit to London, is due to hold talks today with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and address members of both houses of parliament. The ANC expects the constitutional negotiations under way in South Africa will soon set a date for the country's first all-race elections, paving the way to a government of national unity. The election itself would follow within a year. Mr Mandela told a press conference that the ANC had 'issued an investment code which provides that there will be no expropriation of property of investors. They will be allowed to repatriate their dividends and profits, and we think that will go a long way to reassuring investors to invest in our country'. The ANC leader once again appealed to whites to stay in South Africa: 'They have the knowledge, the skills . . . without them it is going to be difficult to address many of the socio-economic problems facing the country.' An early foreign policy decision of a new government would be to rejoin the Commonwealth, Mr Mandela said later at a lunch in his honour hosted by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general.

The issuance of permits provides a means of monitoring trade and determining if it is having a significant impact on the species. In conjunction with CITES, States are required to have a management program and a harvest season for the species. Presently only five States have a trapping season for lynx_Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. In 1984, Minnesota closed its lynx season and Washington followed suit in 1990. Presently only Idaho and Montana of the lower 48 States allow a limited annual harvest of two and three animals, respectively. These quotas include the incidental take of lynx by bobcat trappers. From 1982 to 1992, only three lynx were trapped in Idaho. From 1993 to 1994, only four animals were taken in Montana. These low harvest levels are contributed to the low level of hunting and trapping occurring in the remote areas inhabited by lynx. Hunting and trapping pressure on the lynx has been historically low in the U.S. and there is little evidence that these activities pose a threat to the continued existence of this species in the wild.        C. Disease or Predation        The Canada lynx could be displaced or eliminated by expansion of competitors such as the bobcat (    Lynx rufus    ) or coyote (    Canis latrans    ) into their present range. However, lynx are more restricted to areas that receive deep snow cover where they are more highly adapted than are bobcats. Neither disease nor predation is known to be a threat to the lynx.        D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanism        The lynx is protected in each State where it occurs in the lower 48 contiguous States. Seven States classify it as threatened or endangered or a species of concern. Idaho and Montana have a trapping season with annual Statewide harvest quotas of two and three animals, respectively. Hunting and trapping with dogs and taking with firearms is illegal in every State except one in which the lynx occurs. Few if any States ever had a bounty system for the species. In addition to State protection, the lynx has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1977, and its status and harvest levels have been monitored by the Service's Office of Scientific Authority.        E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence        Lynx distribution has not significantly changed from historic ranges except for periodic peripheral shifts of distribution with cyclical changes of its chief prey, the snowshoe or varying hare (    Lepus americanus    ), and local losses due to loss of habitat in southern-most areas. Fire suppression in the contiguous 48 States has had some effect on lynx numbers, since early successional habitats are important to lynx due to a greater abundance of snowshoe hares in these areas. Although early regeneration stages of habitat are preferred by hares, lynx hunt primarily in more open mature and later successional stages of forest.        Finding        The Act requires the Service to make determinations regarding listings solely on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial data after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts being made by State and Federal agencies to protect the species. The Act also allows for the Service to list ``distinct population segments'' of vertebrate fish and wildlife.    The Service was petitioned to list the Canada lynx in the 40 contiguous States as a vertebrate population pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The Service conducted a status review of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. After carefully evaluating the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present and future threats faced by this species, the Service finds that listing of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. is not warranted. The Service also finds that the petition did not present substantial information that the southern Rocky Mountain population of the Canada lynx meets the definition of a ``species'' under section 3(15) of the Act.

TALKS  WITH GOVERNMENT BEGIN THIS WEEK.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MITCHELLS PLAIN, South Africa      The highest-ranking exiled leaders of the African National Congress, speaking  directly to South Africans for the first time in three decades, told a rally  here Sunday that this week's talks with the government signal the beginning of  the end of ""the misery of apartheid.""    ""South Africa shall never be the same again,"" ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo  told about 10,000 supporters gathered on a soggy sports field on a cold,  blustery day. ""Ours is a society in transition to a new order.""    In one of the most remarkable scenes in the nation's history, Nzo, South  African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo and other leaders who direct the ANC's  guerrilla war against Pretoria mounted a stage in this mixed-race township near  Cape Town.    ""It's so weird . . . so very strange to see Joe Slovo up there,"" said Alexandra  Noble, a 20-year-old white college student in the crowd of black, white,  mixed-race and Indian faces.    Nzo, Slovo and their colleagues, who returned Friday from exile in Zambia, have  for years been the most notorious of the white government's enemies. Until  February, their words and even their photographs were banned from the country's  books, newspapers and television.    Their public appearance Sunday, guarded by their aides as well as South African  police officers, indicated just how far South Africa has come in the 2 1/2  months since President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the bans on anti-apartheid  groups and invited the ANC and others to the negotiating table.    ""We are together at last, and we are here because you, the people of South  Africa, made it happen,"" said Slovo, a 63-year-old white lawyer who fled South  Africa at age 35 under threat of arrest.    Until recently, Slovo was the ANC's chief military strategist and directed  operations that killed or maimed hundreds of black and white civilians. As  leader of the Communist Party and member of the ANC's executive committee, he  is a key figure in the ANC-Communist Party alliance and the leader most feared  by many white South Africans.    Slovo and Nzo, the day's keynote speakers, abandoned much of the war talk that  has characterized ANC speeches in the past.    ""We have come in a spirit of conciliation,"" Slovo said. ""If there is a way  forward without bloodshed, the whole world knows we will grab it with both  hands.""    During three days of talks beginning Wednesday, an ANC delegation, led by  Nelson Mandela, and a government team, led by De Klerk, will discuss the  remaining obstacles to negotiations.    Among those hurdles are the ANC's insistence that the four-year-old state of  emergency be lifted, that political prisoners be freed and that the 15,000 ANC  exiles be indemnified from prosecution. The government wants the ANC to abandon  its armed struggle, which De Klerk claims has fueled an upsurge of township  violence in recent weeks.    The ANC leaders used the forum Sunday to explain their reasons for agreeing to  government talks, a move that has been criticized by many young ANC supporters  who believe De Klerk has not yet moved far enough to warrant talks.    ""We have come to the table in search of a future of peace and equality,"" Slovo  said. He criticized ""armchair revolutionaries,"" an apparent reference to the  radical black Pan-Africanist Congress. Groups like the PAC ""scream treason when  the word dialogue is mentioned,"" he said.    Slovo praised De Klerk's ""courage"" in removing some of the obstacles to peace  in South Africa. But he said the president ""has only removed one or two bolts  from the door. The master lock has not yet been opened.""    Part of the blame, he said, lies with white South Africans ""who have allowed  their human feelings to be washed away by their swimming pools and champagne.""    Slovo said the ANC needs to see more reforms from the government before it  considers relinquishing its 30-year-old armed struggle.    ""It is because we spoke with the AK-47 (rifle) that dialogue is at least in the  air,"" he said. ""We will be ready to walk through the door (for negotiations)  when we see signs of real democracy. Short of that we will have to break down  the door.""    Slovo also outlined the ANC's negotiating strategy, reassuring opponents of the  government that his organization would not back down from its demands for  majority rule, a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution and a  redistribution of wealth. The government has said it will grant the 27 million  black majority the vote but it wants political protection for the 5 million  whites.    ""We accept that the time may arise when a degree of compromise is needed,""  Slovo said. ""But there is a limit -- and this is the gap that must be closed.    ""We can't go to the negotiating table ready to abandon (the ANC's demand for)  majority rule or forget that 90% of the productive property in this country is  owned by whites,"" he said.    ""A future South Africa without majority rule is a future South Africa in which  we cannot touch the economic fruits of our country. It's just apartheid by  another name.""    Until the government shows its willingness to meet the ANC's demands for  negotiations, foreign governments should maintain their economic sanctions and  diplomatic isolation of Pretoria, Slovo added.    ""There should be no reward yet for a country that still has all the main  ingredients of apartheid,"" he said.      Photo, South African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo at rally Sunday.

TALKS  WITH GOVERNMENT BEGIN THIS WEEK.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MITCHELLS PLAIN, South Africa      The highest-ranking exiled leaders of the African National Congress, speaking  directly to South Africans for the first time in three decades, told a rally  here Sunday that this week's talks with the government signal the beginning of  the end of ""the misery of apartheid.""    ""South Africa shall never be the same again,"" ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo  told about 10,000 supporters gathered on a soggy sports field on a cold,  blustery day. ""Ours is a society in transition to a new order.""    In one of the most remarkable scenes in the nation's history, Nzo, South  African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo and other leaders who direct the ANC's  guerrilla war against Pretoria mounted a stage in this mixed-race township near  Cape Town.    ""It's so weird . . . so very strange to see Joe Slovo up there,"" said Alexandra  Noble, a 20-year-old white college student in the crowd of black, white,  mixed-race and Indian faces.    Nzo, Slovo and their colleagues, who returned Friday from exile in Zambia, have  for years been the most notorious of the white government's enemies. Until  February, their words and even their photographs were banned from the country's  books, newspapers and television.    Their public appearance Sunday, guarded by their aides as well as South African  police officers, indicated just how far South Africa has come in the 2 1/2  months since President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the bans on anti-apartheid  groups and invited the ANC and others to the negotiating table.    ""We are together at last, and we are here because you, the people of South  Africa, made it happen,"" said Slovo, a 63-year-old white lawyer who fled South  Africa at age 35 under threat of arrest.    Until recently, Slovo was the ANC's chief military strategist and directed  operations that killed or maimed hundreds of black and white civilians. As  leader of the Communist Party and member of the ANC's executive committee, he  is a key figure in the ANC-Communist Party alliance and the leader most feared  by many white South Africans.    Slovo and Nzo, the day's keynote speakers, abandoned much of the war talk that  has characterized ANC speeches in the past.    ""We have come in a spirit of conciliation,"" Slovo said. ""If there is a way  forward without bloodshed, the whole world knows we will grab it with both  hands.""    During three days of talks beginning Wednesday, an ANC delegation, led by  Nelson Mandela, and a government team, led by De Klerk, will discuss the  remaining obstacles to negotiations.    Among those hurdles are the ANC's insistence that the four-year-old state of  emergency be lifted, that political prisoners be freed and that the 15,000 ANC  exiles be indemnified from prosecution. The government wants the ANC to abandon  its armed struggle, which De Klerk claims has fueled an upsurge of township  violence in recent weeks.    The ANC leaders used the forum Sunday to explain their reasons for agreeing to  government talks, a move that has been criticized by many young ANC supporters  who believe De Klerk has not yet moved far enough to warrant talks.    ""We have come to the table in search of a future of peace and equality,"" Slovo  said.

Botha and Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned head  of the African National Congress, was of historic consequence. It recognized  the reality of the black majority, the need for negotiations, the inevitability  of change.    For Botha, 73, two months from retirement and already replaced as leader of the  ruling National Party, the meeting culminated a cautious relaxation of  apartheid that he has implemented. For Mandela, almost 71, perhaps close to  release from prison, it was almost certainly the beginning of formal  consultations in which the ANC will play a major role.    Both Botha and Mandela emphasized the importance of peaceful change in their  45-minute meeting. That is consistent with what the government in Pretoria has  been saying recently about the need for change and what the ANC has been saying  about the need to restrict the use of violence to avoid further acts of  terrorism against civilian populations. There is, of course, no guarantee that  peaceful change is possible at this late date, for neither Botha nor Mandela  can control what whites and blacks will do, and neither can promise an  equitable agreement on the future of the nation. But there is a hope that was  not there before the two men met.    If constructive negotiations do, in fact, result, they will coincide with moves  elsewhere in Africa to resolve a variety of disputes with talk, rather than  arms. There are new proposals for negotiations to end the rebellion in the  southern Sudan and the war between Eritrean liberation forces and Ethiopia.  South Africa has stopped sending arms to the UNITA guerrillas fighting the  government of Angola as part of a broader peace agreement to bring independence  to Namibia and end the Cuban intervention in Angola itself. Only the United  States is continuing to supply lethal equipment to the Angola rebels. And in  Mozambique, there are signs of progress in ending the murderous scorched-earth  warfare of the RENAMO rebels.    Most whites in South Africa apparently cling to the hope that they will be able  to contrive a formula for the future of their country that will guarantee  continued control by the white minority. However, the new Democratic Party,  claiming support of 24% of the white voters, has put forward a proposal for a  nonracial political system, with guarantees for minorities, that would emerge  through a lengthy transition. And the new leader of the National Party, F.W. De  Klerk, in line to succeed Botha as president after the Sept. 6, is expected to  accelerate efforts to eliminate apartheid and extend the vote to the black  majority.    The clandestine meeting between Mandela and Botha is no substitute for the  release of Mandela from prison, for amnesty, for recognition of the ANC, for  accepting the open negotiations. As Mandela explained in a press statement  Wednesday, a negotiated settlement is what the ANC has sought for 28 years.  Until this latest meeting, however, the government has not seemed to understand  that the violence it does through repression and denial of rights is as lethal  to the cause of peace as bombs in crowded streets.

With Wall Street stocks posting strings  of record highs while Japanese shares lagged, net Japanese  buying of U.S. securities jumped to 21.93 billion dollars in  1993 from 8.75 billion dollars, the ministry said in an annual  report.    Surging share purchases from October in the roaring Hong  Kong  and Southeast Asian bourses pushed net Japanese securities  buying in the ministry's ""other"" category 3.63 billion dollars  from net sales of 1.85 billion dollars in 1992, a ministry  official told reporters.    Steady bond markets helped boost net purchases in Germany to  17.38 billion dollars from 8.13 billion dollars and in France to  10.03 billion dollars from 2.53 billion dollars, he said. But  Japanese sold a net 17.96 billion dollars' worth of Luxembourg  securities, compared with earlier net sales of 2.81 billion  dollars, on redemptions of dollar-denominated Japanese warrant  bonds there, the official said.    As foreign exchange losses forced them to bail out, Japanese  investors sold a net 4.38 billion dollars of securities in  Australia, against previous net sales of 1.73 billion dollars,  and sold 5.76 billion dollars' worth in Canada, a turnaround  from 1992 net purchases of 1.58 billion dollars.    Net purchases of British securities dipped to 16.76 billion  dollars from 17.06 billion dollars, while those in Switzerland  climbed to 2.05 billion dollars from 708 million dollars.    As previously reported, net foreign securities purchases  totaled 43.51 billion dollars, up from 32.47 billion dollars.     "

At a news conference, the Russian minister claimed that the  planned NATO air attacks, especially the massive ones, can make  the conflict uncontrollable and result in its spreading outside  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    He argued that NATO air strikes did not and will not at  present bring any results within the military sphere.    In Grachev's opinion, settlement of the conflict lies in a  summit meeting involving Russia, the U.S., European Union allies  and the United Nations, which can be held in any European state  and should include the political leadership of the whole former  Yugoslavia.    The defense minister urged the Peace-Keeping Forces in the  Moslem-held town of Gorazde be reinforced to avert bloodshed,  adding that Russia intends to send a 19-men strong platoon to  the stricken city.    He strongly opposed the withdrawal of Russian troops from  war- torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, warning that this would be an  untimely and inappropriate decision fraught with a further  political isolation of Russia in the world community.    Grachev said that it was not only Serbs but both conflicting  sides who are to blame for the current crisis.    Gebnardt Von Moltke, NATO deputy secretary general for  political issues, who is heading a NATO delegation participating  in an international conference here, said earlier Monday [25  April] that NATO is going to cooperate closely with Moscow in  solving the Bosnian crisis.

The action was  launched by 10 of the country's labor union federations which  are demanding a minimum salary increase of 30 percent to  compensate for the loss of purchasing power following the  devaluation of the CFA franc. The strike is said to be 75  percent effective, and is taking place in an atmosphere of  absolute calm. From Cotonou, Ange-Hermann Gname reports.    [Begin Gname recording] Government offices, schools, customs  offices, the main post office, and some parastatal offices have  complied with the 72-hour strike order issued by the Federation  of Beninese Workers' Unions, and have done so in absolute calm.  This morning, the few workers who turned up at their workplaces  either went to provide minimum services or to see for themselves  the absence of their colleagues from work. Since this morning,  the national radio has only been broadcasting a very light  program which has not exceeded two and a half hours of air time.  Policemen have been guarding the deserted government offices  against any possible acts of vandalism. The Agency for Air  Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar has also joined the  strike and there was no movement of planes this morning at the  Cotonou International Aiport. Only a minimum service permitted  the flight by a Nigerian military aircraft of President  Nicephore Soglo -- chairman of the Economic Community of West  African States -- to Liberia, where he is supposed to chair the  inauguration ceremony of the new democratic institutions in  Monrovia today.    As we can see, the strike order has been well followed by  the  workers at a time when the Cotonou government is having a lot of  difficulty in easing the social tension which has worsened since  the devaluation of the CFA franc.

First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence  was  the the subject of a MAIL  GUARDIAN front page story last  week,  which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that  South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or  material from another country, or provided another country with  nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted  that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel,  and its provision of yellow cake uranium to Israel, were not  part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and  conventional weapons.    His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation  chief  Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that  Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive  military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium  and yellow cake.    It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for  State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get  tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g  Blaauw ultimately secured ""was sufficient for the manufacture of  12 atomic bombs"".    The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South  African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments  of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were  notified each time a shipment was successfully completed,  according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S.  journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem.    Much of what South African officials withheld from the  public  was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's  compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According  to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying  numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy  Corporation ""received some tritium in 1977, but after the  withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its  quality, the material remained in store until 1987"".    During that time, according to the IAEA document, South  Africa was engaged in ""theoretical and practical"" research on  ""lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible  future use in boosted devices"".    The government also did the preliminary engineering work on  a  reactor -- ""to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay""  -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA,  repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration.  It adds: ""In September 1985 the South African government  decided to...stop all work related to possible plutonium devices  and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow further  development work on implosion technology and theoretical work on  more advanced devices.""    The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the  refusal  of international financial organisations to roll over their  loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if  sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government  would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose  could be to attack--or threaten--nations within range of its  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.    Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice,  South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With  extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions  of Israel's Jericho missiles.    After the two countries jointly tested a South African  Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S.  officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel  was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering  nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa  only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only  intended the six which were actually made as a ""deterrent"".  This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail  Washington to save the established order from ""total onslaught"".    At an international conference last weekend to discuss  future  nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African  National Congress] science and technology department, Roger  Jardine, slammed De Klerk's ""list of lies"" about South Africa's  nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry  to be opened to full public scrutiny.     "
0,FT941-5911 ,"FT941-5911 _AN-ECDC4ABMFT 940304   FT  04 MAR 94 / Fund managers watch S African cliff-hanger with bated breath: South Africa is on the threshold of an investment 'third wave'      By MATTHEW CURTIN   A select group of visitors to South Africa with around half a billion dollars to invest are following the country's nail-biting political negotiations with particular interest. They are 28 fund managers from some of the most prominent European and North American investment institutions on a week long tour. They will be seeking the answer to one question above all else: what are the prospects for a stable, post-apartheid South Africa? Signs are that the representatives from New York's Lazard Freres and Merrill Lynch Asset Management, London's IDC International and Toronto's Goodman  Co, among others, have liked what they have heard from minister of finance Derek Keys, the ANC's economics department, the Reserve Bank, and businessmen such as Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries (SAB), and Mr Hans Smith, managing director of the steel-maker Iscor. Mr Richard Jesse, at stockbrokers Martin  Co, which arranged the visit, says there is no doubt that even the most cautious foreign investors 'like the concept' of investing in South Africa. A successful outcome to the political negotiations currently under way would remove much of the remaining unease about the country's investment risk. But with elections so close, many will take the attitude that waiting a few weeks more before committing funds 'can do no harm when you have been waiting for 50 years'. When they do take the plunge, South Africa is likely to see indirect foreign investment which will dwarf the sums spent on shares since the lifting of sanctions in September which saw records broken on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 'The JSE has seen hundreds of millions of rands of foreign money. Now it will see hundreds of millions of dollars,' says Mr Jesse. The change in sentiment is dramatic (only 10 companies accepted Martin  Co's last invitation for a fund managers' visit in October), and has been fuelled by the feverish interest in emerging markets. Mr Miles Moreland of the London-based Blakeney Management, which specialises in discovering 'new' markets, says South Africa is on the threshold of a third wave of offshore share buying. The first wave saw hedge funds and the 'more nimble, unrestricted' investors buy South African shares for much of 1993, and move quickly to take profits this year. Then came the specialist Africa funds such as Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.3m) Africa Investment Fund, and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern African Fund, listed on Wall Street on Friday. Mr Moreland says the more cautious global investors, the large mutual and pension funds, are about to follow. This comes about as much the result of growing confidence in a growing South African economy as the JSE's forthcoming inclusion in the International Finance Corporation's emerging market index and Morgan Stanley International's developing market index. The JSE in one of the world's largest stock markets by capitalisation (about Dollars 170bn) but is under-represented in emerging market portfolios. When the JSE is added to indices by which the performance of share portfolios are judged, emerging market fund managers will have to redirect some of the Dollars 8bn assets they manage to South Africa to ensure they have even exposure to a market which represents at least 10 per cent of the value of all emerging markets. Ms Maria Ramos, an ANC economist, says any increase in indirect investment is welcome, as its improves market liquidity and economic confidence. That will be vital if a new government is to raise new funds on international capital markets. But she points out it does not create jobs. Direct foreign investment will be critical if the estimated 6m unemployed South Africans are to find work. Job creation has risen swiftly this year to the top of the agenda at the National Economic Forum, which links government, business and trade unions. However, as high-profile as the announcement of the return of Industrial Business Machines (IBM), Kodak and Reebok have been, the sums involved with the companies' reinvestment are small. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic), the US government agency which helps US businesses invest abroad, completed a 10-day visit on Tuesday by announcing a Dollars 75m equity investment fund aimed at black business, and small business partners. Mr Richard Morningstar, an Opic vice-president, says the trip was an 'unqualified success' but admits the agency can only make the smallest, albeit important, contributions to the economy. Even if the political transition proves surprisingly free of violence, and fears of future macro-economic indiscipline are unwarranted, foreign companies contemplating direct investment are entering a competitive domestic market. Mr Jesse says it is easy to say a foreign brewer or pharmaceutical company should be able to rush into South Africa, but large indigenous groups are unlikely to give ground easily to competitors. Foreign investment will be good for stockbrokers' pockets but promises no free ride for the economic planners. See World Stock Markets   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

He emphasised the mission was not designed to raise funds yet, but to pave the way for future funding when appropriate. He said the high-powered roadshow was the first opportunity the government, which took power after the country's first all-race elections in April, had had to go abroad to market the country's policies and philosophy. The officials would use the credit ratings assigned to South Africa in October by American and Japanese risk assessment agencies 'to establish ourselves in the minds of potential investors'. Moody's Investors Service and Nippon Investors Service gave the country investment grade ratings, while Standard  Poor's gave it its top speculative ranking, with a 'positive' outlook. The ratings will enable South Africa to tap a wider range of markets and investors than would otherwise be possible. Mr Liebenberg said three teams of officials would travel to Europe, east Asia and the US. Apart from Mr Liebenberg, they would include Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, deputy finance minister Alec Erwin, and labour minister Tito Mboweni. The officials would be accompanied by represen- tatives of Goldman, Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, which have been named lead managers for the country's first global offering. The national budget for the 1994/5 fiscal year ending in March provided for R1.8bn (Pounds 327m) in possible foreign loans, but Mr Liebenberg said South Africa did not need to borrow abroad to meet the budget.

A White House statement said Mr Clinton had asked Mr Brian Atwood, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, to head the bipartisan delegation including members of Congress and private organisations. The group would try to prevent mass starvation in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya by investigating and then raising and co-ordinating more help from global organisations. 'The crisis in the east Africa region threatens every nation in the region and is caused by drought conditions and civil conflicts,' the White House statement said. 'At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid widespread famine, but an estimated 20m people are currently at risk and may have to leave their homes to search for food.' It said concerted regional and international action two years ago prevented a similar drought in southern Africa from becoming a severe famine. 'Our effort to head off the incipient famine will be both short- and long-term and will help the nations of the region address what have become chronic food shortages.' The delegation is to examine programmes sponsored by the US government and other donors in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya, and meet heads of state and government representatives. The current delegation will travel to Rome, Geneva, and Brussels to seek increased aid for east Africa.

First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence  was  the subject of a MAIL  GUARDIAN front page story last week,  which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that  South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or  material from another country, or provided another country with  nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted  that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel,  and its provision of yellow cake urinium to Israel, were not  part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and  conventional weapons.    His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation  chief  Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that  Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive  military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium  and yellow cake.    It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for  State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get  tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g  Blaauw ultimately secured ""was sufficient for the manufacture of  12 atomic bombs.""    The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South  African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments  of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were  notified each time a shipment was successfully completed,  according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S.  journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem.    Much of what South African officials withheld from the  public  was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's  compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. According  to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying  numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy  Corporation ""received some tritium in 1977, but after the  withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its  quality, the material remained in store until 1987.""    During that time, according to the IAEA document, South  Africa was engaged in ""theoretical and practical"" research on  ""lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible  future use in boosted devices.""    The government also did the preliminary engineering work on  a  reactor -- ""to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay""  -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA,  repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration.  It adds: ""In September 1985 the South African government  decided to .. stop all work related to possible plutonium  devices and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow  further development work on implosion technology and theoretical  work on more advanced devices.""    The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the  refusal  of international financial organisations to roll over their  loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if  sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government  would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose  could be to attack -- or threaten -- nations within range of its  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.    Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice,  South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With  extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions  of Israel's Jericho missiles.    After the two countries jointly tested a South African  Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S.  officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel  was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering  nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa  only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only  intended the six which were actually made as a ""deterrent"".  This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail  Washington to save the established order from ""total onslaught"".    At an international conference last weekend to discuss  future  nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African  National Congress] science and technology department, Roger  Jardine, slammed De Klerk's ""list of lies"" about South Africa's  nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry  to be opened to full public scrutiny.     "

The U.S. has notified the secretariat of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that it will retract a 60  to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as proposed  under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the  officials said.    Washington is frustrated over Tokyo's failure to meet  repeated U.S. calls for removal of wood product tariffs in  Japan, the officials said.    The latest U.S. action prompted rescheduling from the  originally set deadline of Tuesday for each GATT member country  to show an item-by-item plan for reducing tariff rates, the  officials said.    In the Uruguay Round talks concluded last December, Japan  agreed to halve lumber tariffs. But the step did not fully  satisfy the U.S., which called for total abolition in order to  improve American access to Japan's lumber market.    The latest move is apparently targeted at Japanese exports  as  part of trade sanctions following the collapse of trade  framework talks last week.    The U.S. is likely to exclude from the tariff cut plan  electronic components which serve as Japan's mainstay export  items, the officials said.    The Japanese side, dismissing the U.S. move as against the  GATT accord, is expected to form an alliance with South Korea  and other Asian countries in seeking the tariff reductions on  electronic parts, the officials said.

As Ukraine's Economics Minister, Roman Shpek,  said during the talks, Kiev is not prepared to ""use $350 million  in the near future.""    The leadership of Ukraine's Cabinet criticized Washington  for  having advanced too many conditions for granting concrete  economic aid. According to Deputy Premier Valentin Landik,  under American proposals the granting of $95 million to support  private enterprise will become possible only if leasing as a  means of privatizing property is given up.    According to American experts, leasing may hinder the  ""voucher privatization,"" which they view as the most progressive  method of reforming property.    Landik urged members of the U.S. delegation to refrain from  advancing conditions for the granting of aid, and to stop their  calls for ""starting reforms.""    As he said, the lowering of inflation to 5.7 pct and the  start of privatization indicate that reforms in Ukraine have  already begun, and that concrete support for them is necessary.    During the talks American negotiators also insisted that  Ukraine should introduce a market rate for its karbovanets in  relation to hard currencies. Landik for his part declared that  the state will continue to regulate the karbovanets rate till  the crisis is overcome.    The two delegations are led by the Ukrainian Deputy Premier,  Valentin Landik, and by Nicholas Burns, a senior official from  the U.S. National Security Council.     "

In a statement issued at the end of the 30th African  Development Bank (ADB) and 21st African Development Fund (ADF)  annual meetings in Nairobi, temporary governor for the People's  Bank of China Yin Jieyan said that Africa's development relies  on the unremitting endeavours by the governments and peoples of  African states, but the international community also bears a  significant responsibility for this.    Yin Jieyan, who is also the head of the Chinese delegation  attending the meetings which started officially on Wednesday [11  May], said the founding of the ADB embodies the aspirations of  the African people in pursuing economic independence.    Yin Jieyan said ADB in the past 30 years has surmounted  various difficulties in her efforts to promote the industrial  and agricultural development on the African Continent, to  improve the living standard of the African people, and to  enhance the close cooperation among its member countries.    He noted that for promoting the economic development in  Africa, the ADB had adopted positive policies, including forest  development and population control.    Referring to difficulties the African countries are facing  in  economic development, Yin Jieyan said Africa has been developing  at a low speed for several years, the balance of payments has  shown a sustained deficit, the terms of trade have been  deteriorating further, the debt service ratio has exceeded 25  percent in several consecutive years. Other difficulties  include the natural disasters and trade protectionism of the  Western countries, he said.    On China's commitment to the African Continent, the head of  Chinese delegation said while developing her domestic economy,  China has never forgotten her duty to support Africa's economic  development. ""China is ready to continue making due  contributions to Africa's economic development through the ADB  and ADF, which we consider the most important financial  institutions in Africa,"" he added.

Rising operating costs on the island have taken their toll on inward investment, and the world recession has affected both inward and outward investment, according to economists, Foreign investment interest centred on trade and the electronics industry. However, foreign investment in electronics fell nearly 80 per cent from last February, and investment in the plastics sector increased more than 10-fold. Analysts say, however, that these statistics are based on applications approved, not on funds actually entering the country, and that duplicate applications by foreign companies in several countries in the region can lead to over-estimation of foreign investment. Although Taiwanese investment abroad decreased overall, funds approved for investment in the US were up by nearly 40 per cent on the same period last year, to Dollars 44m, 19 per cent of all outward investment approved from January to February. Officials say the outward investment figures measure only investments made through official channels. Many companies making smaller investments overseas often do so without registering with the government. Taiwanese investment in China is increasing, bringing with it the fear of over-dependence on mainland markets. Taiwanese companies invested Dollars 1.5bn in Fukien province alone in 1991, and Dollars 15.6m in southern China in January and February, Dollars 11m of which was in metals, electronics and plastics.

The petition also asks the FCC to turn down KCET's request for a new  transmitter in Bakersfield.

At a speech delivered to the chamber of commerce of Belgium  and Luxembourg and the ACP states (Africa, Caribbean and the  Pacific), he stressed that (black) Africa was changing and the  continent's image as the ""black"" continent which it had until a  few years ago no longer corresponded to the reality of the  situation.    The Zambian president, who peacefully succeeded Mr. Kenneth  Kaunda following elections in 1991, an almost unique event in  Africa, has been on a three-day visit to Belgium since  Wednesday, during which he is to meet European Community  officials.    Mr. Chiluba, a former trade unionist, added that ""new  leaders"" and ""new regimes"" had appeared, who were asking for  time in order to continue with democratization.    ""The best way of helping us in this matter is by investing  in  my country,"" he added.    Mr. Chiluba believes that Zambia now possesses a pluralist  political system. ""I could be beaten at the next elections,"" he  stressed.    The Zambian president also affirmed that his government had  been insisting on the privatization of the economy since 1991.  ""Previously"" (under the regime of the single party of the left,  editor's note) it had been 80 percent nationalized. Other  priorities are the fight against inflation and investments in  roads and education.    Mr. Chiluba was received by King Albert II on Thursday  morning. Following a meeting with the ambassadors of the ACP  states, he met in the afternoon with European Commission  President Jacques Delors.    Friday morning, he will be meeting with Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes, and the secretary of state for cooperation  development, Mr. Erik Derycke, over a working lunch.     "

But today, as SWAPO sits on the verge of realizing its dream in Namibia's first  free and democratic elections, the rhetoric of war has given way to the  practicalities of politics.    SWAPO leaders still call each other ""comrade,"" reiterate their devotion to  socialism and promise a redistribution of wealth from the mostly white  landholders to the black masses. But, having seen Africa littered with failed  Marxist policies, they have promised a mixed economy, freedom of speech, no  mass nationalization and protection for the property of whites who want to  stay.    ""Our policy is to leave the sad history behind us, to adopt a much more  flexible approach and to write our future on a clean sheet of paper,"" says  SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, the bearded leader who has spent half his 60 years  in exile. His efforts will be watched closely in neighboring South Africa,  especially by whites who fear that a black government in Pretoria would usher  in communism and force them out.    SWAPO is heavily favored to win at least a majority in the five-day Namibian  elections, which ended Saturday. Initial results are expected to be announced  late today. Ten political parties have been vying for power in the  U.N.-supervised elections, and SWAPO needs a two-thirds majority to control the  72-seat constituent assembly and write a new constitution for Namibia.    No one knows for sure what SWAPO will do with the new power. Although Nujoma's  chief aides hold advanced degrees in political science from American and  European universities, they have no practical experience in government. Until  last June, in fact, SWAPO was only a liberation movement with a dream. Now it  is a political party with a constituency to keep happy and, perhaps soon, a  country to run.    The Marxist principles to which SWAPO held fast for so long have been dated by  recent ideological changes in the Soviet Union. And today, African countries  founded on Marxist principles, from Angola to Mozambique and Ghana to Tanzania,  are embracing free-market solutions to their economic troubles.    This may be the first and last multi-party election in Namibia. SWAPO has long  favored a one-party state, believing that the Western model of multi-party  democracy does not work in developing African countries. But Nujoma also has  said he would consult with all other parties in mapping the country's future.    ""If SWAPO doesn't turn us into a Communist nation, we'll be OK,"" said Anton  Ferreira, a white Namibian who waited in line more than six hours to vote on  the first of five days of balloting last week.    A white woman standing nearby added: ""If SWAPO wins, people are going to get  used to standing in lines like this.""    Despite its talk of unity and conciliation, SWAPO's history of planting land  mines on white farmers' land and allegations that it tortured black Namibians  believed to be spies has made many here wary.    SWAPO's foreign affairs chief, Theo-Ben Gurirab, says the organization  regretted the torture. But others, including Nujoma himself, have not been  penitent.    ""I'm not regretting anything,"" Nujoma said as voters went to the polls. ""We  lost hundreds of our comrades in the war because of information those traitors  supplied to South African troops. Do you think we were stupid enough to let  them carry on?""    Nevertheless, SWAPO now says it wants to establish a bill of human rights for  Namibia. And Nujoma says the fighters of his People's Liberation Army, who  surrendered their arms to return to Namibia for the elections, will form the  basis of a small national army designed only for defense.    Few of the country's 80,000 whites, who account for less than 10% of the  population but own 65% of the land, relish the prospect of a SWAPO government.  But many agree with SWAPO that South Africa has siphoned off much of Namibia's  wealth over the years.    ""We've been exploited by South Africa for 75 years, why not give Sam Nujoma a  chance,"" said J. P. D. Blaauw, a retired brigadier in the South African air  force. Blaauw, who lived in Namibia as a child, flew from South Africa last  week to vote and said he plans to move here permanently after independence.    SWAPO will face many of the same logistical problems that South Africa has  faced in trying to administer the territory, which is twice the size of  California, with a dozen ethnic groups and only 1.3 million people, 60% of them  illiterate. To help the South African administration stage the first one-man,  one-vote national elections in the vast, rugged landscape, the United Nations  had to bring in more than 7,000 peacekeeping troops, police monitors, election  supervisors and administrative workers.    An independent government in Namibia will have to accept, at least at first,  its economic links with South Africa, whose government it calls the ""apartheid  colonialists."" About 90% of its exports go to South Africa and three-fourths of  imports, mostly food, come from there.    Its primary port city, Walvis Bay, will remain a South African enclave even  after independence.    SWAPO has promised over the years to redistribute the country's resources and  exert more centralized control over the economy. The main target for land  redistribution is whites, especially foreign absentee landlords.    ""There are white farmers here who own up to 20 farms. That is a crime,"" Hidipo  Hamutenya, SWAPO's chief spokesman, says. ""They will be asked to choose the one  they like best and give the rest to the people.""    But SWAPO leaders also have said that farmers using their land effectively and  producing food for the country will be left alone. And they say no land will be  confiscated without negotiation with the owners.    SWAPO is counting on the country's reserve of diamonds, uranium and other  minerals, which now make up 75% of foreign exchange earnings, to help it  improve the schools, health care and housing of black Namibians.    Although it once believed in nationalizing the mining industry, SWAPO now says  it intends to negotiate new contracts with the mining companies. It  specifically has said that the companies will be required to reinvest ""a  substantial part"" of their profits in Namibia.    The mining companies, which currently have a tax rate of 60%, doubt they can  afford to pay more. But they believe Namibia's mineral potential has been  largely untapped and that more mining companies will be lured here if trade  sanctions against Pretoria, which still extend to Namibia, are lifted.    SWAPO's biggest headache, though, may be dealing with the raised expectations  of the black masses, most of whom are landless and 30% jobless.    ""We will educate the people that independence is not a panacea, that they will  have to work hard and produce,"" Hage Geingob, SWAPO's election director,  recently told the South African magazine Leadership. ""It would be a serious  mistake to believe that independence is the time for people to make big claims  on the state.""

Mr. Mugabe ordered the release of an official in the secret  Central Intelligence Organization, (Elias Khenagoni), and the  provincial youth leader of the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe  African National Union Patriotic Front] party, (Khezito  Tshibambu). The two were last year sentenced to seven years in  prison for shooting (Patrick Khumbayi), who was contesting a  parliamentary seat against the vice-president Simon Muzenda in  the 1990 election. They were pardoned hours after their appeal  against their conviction was thrown out by the country's supreme  court.     "

The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be  more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing  full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed  the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special  envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met  Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the  Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau.    Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go  along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and  decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended  last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the  stalemate.    In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement  on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future.    Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as  the  three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North  Korea in the future, the sources said.    The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be  forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if  North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental  nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang  without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel  rods.

The show of solidarity was to have begun with  a rally addressed by ANC President Nelson Mandela and Namibian  President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on January 27, but Mr Mandela  cancelled his visit. ANC spokesman Gill Marcus said the ANC  President had other engagements.    SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said senior ANC and  SWAPO officials would address meetings and rallies across  Namibia to raise money for the ANC's election coffers. He said  SWAPO's support for the ANC was part of the responsibility it  felt towards South Africa. SWAPO was confident of, and hoped for  an ANC landslide victory and felt a need to contribute in the  same way the ANC had helped SWAPO to victory in the 1989  Namibian elections.    Mr Garoeb said SWAPO believed the ANC, with its ""pragmatic  and experienced leadership"", was the party best structured to  manage a post-election South Africa and keep southern Africa  stable.    Money would be raised at SWAPO branch and regional level in  cooperation with the National Union of Namibian Workers. Mr  Garoeb appealed to all South Africans living in Namibia to  register and vote for the ANC on April 27.    In an editorial on Monday, the Windhoek Advertiser warned  that SWAPO's support for the ANC risked drawing Namibia into a  partisan role in a potential future civil war. ""In the event of  a troubled South Africa plunging into civil strife of  proportions where factions go over to guerrilla war and  unrestricted sabotage, Namibia will not be spared. Our  allegiance with the ANC will under such circumstances be on the  debit side of Namibia's interests,"" wrote editor Hannes Smith.    Mr Garoeb dismissed Mr Smith's comment as the ""cry-baby  attitude and professional negativism from a confirmed pessimist""  who could not see anything good about the SWAPO government.     "

Nelson Mandela talks about the  obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its  path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to  practice an ""open-door policy"" toward the international  community, without ""tyrannizing"" investors. Pre-election  opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes.    [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is  officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to  the transitional government whose task is to organize the first  free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the  enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be  multiplying. Who are the die-hards?    [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional  government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha  Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom  Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do  nothing but pursue an ""all or nothing"" tactic. Inkatha above  all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African  National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many  sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the  greatest number of political demands can be taken into account.  Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the  other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the  negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we  had set, just to keep the negotiations open.    [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an  armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the  country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the  extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to  apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups?    [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to  talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner  People's Front included. As far as we have been able to  establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front  are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how  dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our  discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are  understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say  the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the  negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling  that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual  understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with  Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the  negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27  April.    [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's  negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance  reached?    [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather  the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the  Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim  constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election  that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the  parties and organizations forming the transitional executive  council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress  in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to  speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go,  issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the  election itself, which is set for 27 April.    [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this  connection?    [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely  central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we  are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the  interests of South Africa above any party interest.    [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising  difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations  between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment?    [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are  obviously differences between us, but we are working together as  partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the  Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April  election.    [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and  AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization?    [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of  the fact that we are both organizations working for the  liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa.  However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is  exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election.  However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not  detract from its being an organization working for liberation.    [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC  could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is  your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in  government?    [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are  holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC  of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being  unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and  inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation  movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the  people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities.    [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international  economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are  they showing confidence in South Africa?    [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to  believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the  United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been  favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently  shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some  major international companies are still put off by the spread of  violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create  a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to  the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required  to attract further investment.    [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue  toward foreign companies?    [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids ""tyrannizing""  investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments  must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations  and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give  companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should  also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our  country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has  kept on the sidelines for a long time.    [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart  of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize,  apart from the South African people?    [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long-  suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize.  Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the  Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort  that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.

[passage omitted]    [Havel] I would like to say that the principle of civic  disobedience as such is a respectable form of defense by a group  of citizens in the conditions of a dictatorship, apartheid, and  so forth. In my view there is neither room, motive, nor logical  reason for such a principle of disobedience in a democracy where  power has really come from the people -- in free elections.    It also strikes me as somewhat alarming that this view is  voiced by an official of the party which has on many occasions  throughout its history proved its opposition to democracy. I  wonder if this appeal is not a harking back to the communist  methods of conquering power.    [Tamchyna] I hope it will not sound too lofty if I say that  all the world's eyes have over the past few days been focused  primarily on the Republic of South Africa [RSA], where the first  multiracial elections are over and the results known, and  probably no one expected those results and the new division of  political forces to solve all the problems of the Republic of  South Africa. My question is probably something like this: Will  the new political structure of the Republic of South Africa be  able to appreciate the concept of democracy not only in terms of  its advantages and rights but also with all the duties and  responsibilities it entails?    [Havel] The process of national liberation and extrication  from white domination is a logical, legitimate, and lawful one  which has taken place throughout the world, and I think that the  fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa is cause for  universal delight. The Republic of South Africa naturally faces  a difficult time ahead. All countries which freed themselves  from colonial domination have experienced and are still  experiencing difficult times, but they probably do have to pass  through this phase.    Since you are asking me, I would like to take the  opportunity  to praise the achievements of President de Klerk, who at one  time paid an official visit to our country during which we  talked at length. He really is a courageous man. He has made a  decisive contribution to these changes. He was well aware that  after putting into effect the changes he is now instituting and  which he considers to be right, he would lose the presidential  office. But he put justice before his own position. I think he  is a man who deserves worldwide recognition and who was rightly  awarded the Nobel prize. By this I do not mean to say that  Nelson Mandela did not deserve it. All that remains for me to  wish him is that, if he is indeed elected president at the  beginning of next week, he might lead his country wisely through  the period which awaits it.

Mr.  Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has decided to  suspend its participation in the electoral campaign in protest  against the assassination of three of its members, including a  deputy who was elected in the first round of the elections. The  CAR will not rescind its decision unless the security of its  members is totally guaranteed. Olabire da Cruz, who is in Lome,  explains the issue to Africa No. 1.    [Begin Cruz recording] Confirming the decision made by his  party's steering committee following a long meeting, CAR  Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor stated that this suspension will remain  in force until security is guaranteed for all candidates.  According to him, this is not possible for two of them at  present. Already, by early yesterday evening, the CAR's  decision was rather foreseeable, especially as this party and  its ally, Edem Kojo's party, had withdrawn from the state media  program arranged by the Ad Hoc Audiovisual Communications  Commission for 14 February. The Rally of the Togolese People,  the former single ruling party, therefore participated in the  program alone. All the same, it will not be surprising to see  CAR rescind its decision very rapidly.    Meanwhile, after vehemently condemning last weekend's  assassinations, the International Committee for Monitoring the  Ouagadougou Agreement did not hide its concern and fear for the  consequences that this act may have on the democratic process.  It therefore appealed for the restoration of confidence among  the various parties and hoped that security measures will be  taken as soon as possible.    Similarly, the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT] categorically  denied any implication in last weekend's assassinations. In a  statement, the FAT headquarters said that immediately a group of  people in military uniform does anything wrong, some  ill-intentioned and unscrupulous voices are raised and attribute  this to the security forces. A strong warning was sounded to  all those who use military uniforms to commit reproachful acts  in a bid to stain the honor of the Army. [end recording]     "

The U.S.  government has announced a new nuclear non-proliferation policy,  and vigorous international discussions are expected over the  management of plutonium. We interviewed STA Atomic Energy Bureau  Director Hiroto Ishida concerning the goal of Japan's plan and  the likely course of future debate.    Facilitate Mutual Understanding    Question: Why did Japan propose its own plan for the  international management of plutonium?    Reply: ``As far as overall atomic energy activities are  concerned, including Japan's use of plutonium, we carefully  follow the security measures of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, and we strive to provide the maximum amount of various  kinds of information. As a result, I believe that beyond a  shadow of a doubt we have created a system for the peaceful use  of atomic energy, and we shall continue to do so.''    ``However, the peaceful use of plutonium has become a topic  of concern with the operation problems at THORP, England's  reprocessing plant, and with the start of construction on the  reprocessing plant at Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture.  There is also the problem of dismantling Russia's nuclear  arsenal. It is important that we strive to create a system to  facilitate mutual understanding concerning the use of plutonium  throughout the world.''    Question: How do you think the international discussion over  plutonium management will proceed?    Reply: ``Last year in December the IAEA invited seven  nations--England, France, China, Russia, Germany, Japan, and the  U.S.--to the first informal meeting on plutonium management, and  a second informal meeting will be held this month. The positions  of the various nations should become somewhat clearer at that  time.''    ``We ourselves do not think that the STA's international  management plan will be the final product. The most important  thing is that Japan should take a positive approach by  presenting a proposal for international review. We want to make  Japan's intentions clear.''    U.S. Concerned About Surplus    Question: How have various countries reacted to Japan's plan  for plutonium management?    Reply: ``We have not reached the stage where specific  feelings are clear. Basically, there is a common understanding  that it is important to strive to increase openness in the use  of plutonium, but when it comes to specific policies, we can  expect a variety of opinions depending on the situation each  country finds itself in.''    ``For example, as we have learned in the nuclear  non-proliferation policy announced by the U.S. government in  September, the commercial use of plutonium will not be an option  in the U.S., at least for the time being, and naturally we can  expect the U.S. to take a strong position on preventing nuclear  proliferation.''    ``As far as Japan is concerned, the peaceful use of atomic  energy is guaranteed within the framework of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty. We will pursue both nuclear  non-proliferation and the peaceful use of plutonium. It is  important for Japan to increase our openness as seen from the  outside so that the world will recognize we are using plutonium  in a peaceful manner.''    Question: We have heard that there is a good chance the U.S.  will propose a plan with strong regulations for plutonium  management. What do you think?    Reply: ``I think that is only natural, but the U.S. has a  greater interest in the problem of excess plutonium.''    Question: Some people say that Japan has presented a  plutonium management plan as preparation for an excess of  plutonium in the future.    Supply/Demand Balance Maintained    Reply: ``I suppose there are people who are saying that, but  we do not think so. We will maintain the balance between  plutonium supply and demand to the end. Both the suppliers and  the demanders may have their plans, but things do not always go  according to plan. What is really important is carefully making  plutonium and carefully using it all up rather than forcing some  kind of delicate balance.''    [boxed material]    Perspective    Alarm at Stronger U.S. Regulations    Japan's peaceful use of atomic energy was made possible  because of the nuclear non-proliferation system centered on the  U.S. and former Soviet Union. This system is now in flux as  Japan approaches the era of full-fledged use of plutonium. The  reason Japan quickly put together a plutonium management plan  was that the government decided it must strive to strengthen the  nuclear non-proliferation system on its own.    Japan and the U.S. both have the same objectives in nuclear  non-proliferation, but their situations are slightly different.  The U.S., which has abandoned the commercial use of plutonium  domestically, is leaning toward a policy that will add  regulations to the use of plutonium. Japan is alarmed that those  regulations will restrict her development of atomic energy.    In that respect, Japan's concept for international plutonium  management sends a strong message to the U.S. It will be  interesting to see how Japan forms ``alliances'' with England  and France, countries that also use plutonium.

0,FT941-3811 ,"FT941-3811 _AN-ECODSABAFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / Long snakes and short ladders in Africa: A formula for development failure      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Unseen hands play Snakes and Ladders across sub-Saharan Africa. Democracy fitfully emerges in South Africa, is denied in Nigeria. Civil war revives in Angola, Zaire slides towards anarchy, a fragile peace pact holds in Mozambique. News is as unpredictable as the throw of the dice. Snakes marked Drought, Corruption or Civil War writhe across the board; ladders appear as Debt Rescheduled or World Bank Loan. Short ladders, long snakes. . . and loaded dice. As the latest World Bank Sub-Saharan Africa report published at the weekend makes clear, the destination labelled Recovery remains out of reach. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn (Pounds 113bn), has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warns the Bank. Whoever is to blame, the policy at the heart of relations between Africa and the west is failing. 'Good governance', the concept which links aid to Africa with economic reform, human rights and democracy has not got to the heart of the continent's predicament. Admirable in principle, complex in practice, today the policy appears confused. Increasingly the west is placing responsibility for Africa on the World Bank, but providing neither adequate mandate nor clear guidance. Once enslaved, later colonised, and marginalised in the 1980s, the continent faces a continuing crisis in the 1990s - but with a new dimension. Africa is not only in danger of losing the battle; the world is losing interest. The countries that led the scramble for Africa's resources some 100 years ago are now disengaging. 'If only the west cared enough to want to recolonise us,' an African diplomat ruefully observes. 'But we're hardly an attractive proposition.' At one level, the west continues to respond positively. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. But the critical link between economic and political reform is being neglected, and aid is ineffective. Under the auspices of the World Bank's economic recovery programme, Africa's governments were expected to cut budget deficits, curb inflation and monetary growth, introduce competitive exchange rates, reform tariffs and revive agriculture. The good news, says Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank's vice-president for Africa, is that the formula works: 'The six countries that improved their policies the most (over the period 1987-91) saw their GDP growth per capita jump about 2 percentage points per annum between 1981-86 and 1987-91.' The bad news is that this is not nearly enough. The Bank's claim in a 1989 report that African economies could grow at a rate of 4-5 per cent has proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Part of the reason for Africa's failure is made clear in the report. Implementation of the World Bank structural adjustment reforms has been poor, political will lacking, and management resources scarce. But essential to the success of economic reforms, donors have argued, is a matching programme of political reform. Transparency, accountability and democracy are vital to sustain development, they maintain. The World Bank report agrees, but it does not address how it can be achieved in practice, or assess the part political problems have played in Africa's failure to reach economic targets. The only reference is to 'a strong social consensus on the need to improve governance'. Corruption is not mentioned, nor military spending, nor is there any discussion of a central issue: how to reward reformers, punish laggards. Yet the experience of Bank representatives across Africa is that this is precisely the area which needs attention. 'Structural adjustment means reducing state patronage,' explains a Bank official in west Africa. 'Reducing patronage undermines the ruling party. Unless the president is prepared to risk political suicide, there is not enough I can do to force him down a path of reform, whether it's the big stick or the big carrot.' The reason for the report's reticence on 'good governance' issues is not hard to find. The Bank, officials privately point out, is constrained by a mandate which precludes it from a political role; and its mandate is determined by the directors - 'none of whom wants to rock the boat'. The board's third world appointees tend to reflect the views of their leaders, who would be the last to support tougher measures, say their domestic critics. Developed country directors, may be reluctant to jeopardise commercial or security interests. But the misgivings of directors representing the biggest donors about applying tougher pressure on reluctant African reformers stem from a further, more understandable concern: the generally poor performance of Africa's opposition parties. After the high hopes of the 'new wind of change', the wave of democratisation that swept through Africa in the late 1980s, opposition parties have turned out to have most of the weaknesses of the regimes they oppose: ethnically based, few carefully worked out policy alternatives and likely to be as corrupt if ever they won office. 'Who can blame us for our reluctance to follow through a policy that could destabilise Nigeria, with its 80m people and huge problems, and where the opposition seems as incompetent as the army?' asks an irritated European diplomat. The report leaves further questions unanswered. If democracy is essential to sustained growth - the assumption that underpins the concept of good governance - how can the position of Ghana, under military government until 1992 but the leading reformer, be explained? As long ago as 1981 the Bank called for 'a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'. World Bank officials and aid workers argue that Africa's need for such a compact is overwhelming. But until the west renews its interest in Africa, resolves the anomalies in its policies, and gives the Bank and other donors a clearer mandate, the compact will remain a pipe dream.

Several banks have been interviewed. Mr Etienne Calitz, director-general of the department of finance, said yesterday the multi-party Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which is in charge of government policy leading up to next month's elections, had compiled a shortlist of candidates. He declined to name the banks involved. However, they are thought to include First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers. The first task of the successful applicant will be to guide the new government through the delicate process of obtaining a credit rating from the two leading international rating agencies, Moody's and Standard  Poor's. Discussions with the agencies are expected to begin once the elections are over. South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating, as this would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. An investment-grade rating would also reduce South Africa's funding costs and allow a broader range of investors to buy its bonds. The adviser will be selected by the technical committee of the TEC's finance sub-council, which has the responsibility of drawing up a foreign loan finance strategy for the new government. The first foreign debt issue of a new government will be an important test of international confidence in South Africa's new administration, and of the ANC's economic policy in particular, given its likely victory in the April elections. Mr Calitz said a new issue would primarily have 'benchmark value'.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

We can share access to current real-time and on-line communication systems, such as Internet. To communicate with Esi, my uncle in Lagos, is much harder. Although Nigeria is one of the most advanced African nations, communicating can be difficult. Even in the most cosmopolitan places there can be problems. In April 1992, the international phone service connecting the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Europe was down for nearly a week. In fact, there is a distinct feeling of remoteness whenever I try to contact my Nigerian relatives. Nigeria, like many developing countries, is not part of the new communications order. Along with many others in the west, I enjoy the latest in communications technology. Most Nigerians, however, do not have easy access to a telephone or computer - never mind the infrastructure of a modern global communications network. In the west, the humble telephone is taken for granted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use. Cheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while international rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people. By comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive. The other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution is the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications world; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African context. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has only 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages. The 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the world, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only Internet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire African continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national telecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone lines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does not even feature. At a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society, there is a danger that the developing countries will become further marginalised and impoverished. In all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications technology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect, created a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the developing countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to be applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of the developed nations. Yet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an essential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and television were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations between north and south. The US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds in developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are eagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies, Africa is largely an IT desert. We are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'. This is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the gap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under international investment programmes, could help to develop more modern industries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to help improve agricultural production.

0,FT942-4194 ,"FT942-4194 _AN-EFJCMAGAFT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (5): Crocodile venture - Leslie Crawford looks at novel businesses      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   Crocodiles, vanilla pods, roses and the colossal Nile perch of Lake Victoria do not, on the face of it, have much in common, but they belong to a growing list of non-traditional exports which last year earned Dollars 40m for Uganda. The emergence of new, export-oriented ventures is perhaps the best economic news Uganda has had in years. Many analysts believe the country's future development depends on the multiplication of these small, private-sector businesses. Neither the privatisation of bankrupt parastatals, nor Uganda's international road shows to attract foreign investment, seem to hold as much promise as the eclectic activities of Uganda's new entrepreneurs. Tony Bristow left his native Zimbabwe to start up Uganda's first crocodile farm three years ago. A Ugandan friend, who had worked in Zimbabwe, convinced him the project would succeed with the tax breaks and liberalised foreign exchange environment available to new investors in Uganda. The novelty of the project at first baffled the authorities. Mr Bristow had to obtain the authorisation of three different ministries - Animal and Fisheries, the Game Department and National Parks - to set up Uganda Crocs Ltd. He also helped draft Uganda's proposal to join the UN Convention for the International Trade of Endangered Species (Cites), that regulates the export of crocodile skins. Cites allocated Uganda an initial export quota of 2,500 skins a year. Mr Bristow collects crocodile eggs in the wild, and breeds them in captivity. The cold-blooded creatures are warmed to an optimal temperature of 32 deg C to accelerate their development. After two to three years, the crocodiles are ready for marketing. Only half a dozen tanneries around the world specialise in exotic leathers, and they pay between Dollars 2.5 and Dollars 7 per centimetre for the soft underbelly of a young croc. The Gulf War, Mr Bristow says, depressed demand for crocodile skins. He thinks it may take four years before he sees a return on his Dollars 500,000 investment. In Mukono, a district near Kampala, more than 5,000 peasant farmers now have vanilla vines interplanted with their banana, maize and coffee bushes thanks to an export venture started in 1990 by Aga Sekalala, a local businessman. 'After the war ended in '86,' he recalls, 'I was looking for cash crops to plant on my farm.' He sought advice from the World Bank's Africa Project Development Facility, which noticed, during a visit to Mr Sekalala's farm, that vanilla was growing wild among the food crops. APDF came back with a proposal: it would find a guaranteed buyer for Ugandan vanilla if Mr Sekalala could persuade the farmers of Mukono to revive the vanilla production that had been abandoned during the Amin years. After testing Mr Sekalala's vanilla, McCormick  Company of the US, the manufacturer of seasonings and flavourings, signed a three-year agreement in 1990 to purchase his entire production. The contract has just been renewed for another three years. Meanwhile, the vanilla growers involved in Mr Sekalala's venture have multiplied from 50 in 1990 to 5,000. Vanilla fields now cover an estimated 600 hectares. 'Over the past four years,' Mr Sekalala says, 'we have exported more than nine tonnes of cured vanilla worth a total of Dollars 825,286.' Premium-grade cured vanilla commands about Dollars 72 per kg on the world market. Within 10 years, it is estimated Uganda could be exporting up to 150 tonnes of vanilla a year, pushing foreign exchange earnings up to Dollars 7.5m. Half a dozen Ugandan companies have launched themselves into the rose exporting business, after observing how floriculture has blossomed in neighbouring Kenya. 'Uganda has a more favourable climate for rose growing than Kenya,' says Rene Bartoli of Victoria Flowers, 'and it is not plagued by water shortages.' In addition, the cost of air freight - the largest outlay of any flower export operation - is more competitive from Entebbe airport than Nairobi. This combination of factors is leading many established Kenyan flower companies to look at Uganda to diversify their sources of production. Mr Bartoli and a Ugandan partner have bought a 3.3 hectare plot on the shores of Lake Victoria to start their rose farm. At Dollars 400,000 a hectare, their initial investment carries a considerable degree of risk, particularly as returns will depend on the price their roses can fetch at the flower auctions in Holland. The first roses will be ready for export in October. Launching a business in Uganda, however, is not for the faint-hearted. 'You have to be prepared to be completely autonomous and self-sustaining,' Mr Bartoli warns. Because power supplies are unreliable, he had to invest in a back-up generator. The lack of cold storage facilities at Entebbe airport means that Victoria Flowers will have to build its own. But the most common complaint of Uganda's new breed of exporters is the loss of competitiveness of Uganda's currency, the shilling, which has appreciated by more than 20 per cent against the dollar in recent months. 'The appreciation of the shilling could kill our business, particularly as Indonesia is also making serious inroads into the vanilla market,' Mr Sekalala says. 'I also had a project to export organic honey, but it is just not competitive at the current exchange rate.'   Companies:-  Uganda Crocs Ltd.     Victoria Flowers.

AFRICA BLACKS, STUDENTS PROTEST ON EVE OF VOTE      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Police using whips and dogs broke up a protest march Tuesday in the sleepy  white college town of Stellenbosch, and hundreds of thousands of voteless  blacks nationwide began a two-day strike on the eve of elections that will be  the most severe test of white support for the government since it came to power  41 years ago.    South African whites will cast ballots today in parliamentary elections that  have been upstaged internationally by attempts to crush a monthlong black  defiance campaign organized to discredit the voting and protest apartheid laws  and police curbs on peaceful protest.    Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party is favored to extend its  rule for five more years with a slim majority in the controlling white chamber  of Parliament, which includes less powerful houses for mixed-race Coloreds and  Indians but no representation for blacks.      Could Lose Quarter of Seats    The National Party's own leaders predict that it could lose up to a fourth of  its seats to the right-wing Conservative Party and the liberal Democratic  Party. Such a swing would affect De Klerk's pledge to lead the country away  from the ""distrust, suspicion and fear"" that grip white and black South  Africans.    At stake in the elections is the pace of reform in South Africa, where 26  million blacks are ruled by 5 million whites under the system of racial  segregation called apartheid.    Many blacks consider the elections meaningless, and the call for workers and  students to stay away capped a campaign of civil disobedience that has touched  off dozens of bloody confrontations with the police, 1,600 arrests and, the  government says, 70 unrest-related deaths.    ""Any political activity that ignores black people is doomed,"" said Anglican  Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has been  arrested twice in the past week. ""The driving force of change in this country  lies among the disenfranchised, not in Parliament.""    On Tuesday, police dispersed more than 500 white students and black workers who  marched from the University of Stellenbosch, the alma mater of most of South  Africa's white leaders, to the center of that town in the lush wine country  near Cape Town. Demonstrators ran screaming through the streets when the police  unleashed dogs. Some protesters were beaten with whips, and dozens were  arrested.    In Pietermaritzburg, 450 college students and faculty members were arrested in  a similar march, organized to present a petition calling for an end to police  violence against peaceful protest.      Predict Spread of Strike    Black union leaders predicted that the worker strike would spread today, and  most black, mixed-race and Indian students across the country were boycotting  classes as well.    In an open letter to De Klerk on Tuesday, the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose  affiliation of most anti-apartheid groups in the country, said the elections  ""still symbolize apartheid and the perpetuation of white minority rule. We  therefore demand that our right to peaceful protest be respected. . . .""    The Mass Democratic Movement began the defiance campaign Aug. 2, when 270  ailing blacks sought treatment at whites-only hospitals. Since then, it has  targeted whites-only beaches and schools as well as state-of-emergency laws  that prohibit most anti-government activity from meetings to marches.    Meetings in churches were generally allowed by the government until Monday,  when riot police blocked the doors of two churches in downtown Cape Town and  arrested a dozen leading clerics, including Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, the  mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. They were  released after a few hours in jail.      Tutu Reconsecrates Cathedral    Tutu reconsecrated his cathedral Tuesday, telling parishioners that the police,  in ""a scandalous breach of religious liberty . . . sank to new depths when they  desecrated my cathedral.""    The government has attempted to justify its crackdown by contending that the  defiance campaign is orchestrated by the outlawed African National Congress to  violently disrupt the elections. However, defiance leaders say they are using  nonviolent protests to highlight the plight of the black majority.    Although the escalating unrest has sullied South Africa's image overseas, many  political analysts believe it may actually help the National Party in the  elections by driving whites fearful of a black revolution away from the more  liberal Democratic Party.    However, it may also slightly boost the far-right Conservative Party, which  says the unrest is an example of the trouble the government can expect if it  makes good on promises to dismantle apartheid.      Controls 123 of 166 Seats    The National Party now controls 123 of the 166 seats at stake in the white  chamber of Parliament, while the Conservatives have 22 seats and the Democrats  20. National Party leaders concede that they may lose 20 to 30 seats, reducing  their majority from the current 74% to as low as 56%.    Government opponents have predicted an even greater swing of seats, which would  create a ""hung Parliament"" in which no party has an outright majority. In that  case, the National Party would be forced to form an alliance with the right or  the left, analysts say.    The Conservatives' platform calls for stricter enforcement of apartheid and the  partitioning of South Africa into separate white and black states. The  Democrats support a one-person, one-vote system that would bring blacks into  government on an equal footing with whites.    The National Party, which came to power in 1948 on a platform of strict racial  segregation, has sought the political middle ground. While De Klerk remains  committed to racially segregated schools, hospitals and residential areas, he  has promised to start negotiations with black leaders and draw up a new  constitution to share power but prevent ""black domination.""      Voting for All 3 Houses    The voting is for all three houses of Parliament, the white chamber as well as  smaller chambers representing the country's 3 million mixed-race Coloreds and 1  million Indians.    Black leaders have declined to endorse any party.    ""The elections are a non-issue,"" said Hilda Ndude, Western Cape publicity  secretary for the United Democratic Front, the 2-million-member anti-apartheid  coalition banned from political activity.

By CARLOS BREZINA, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      WASHINGTON      Most of the world is winning the war against poverty, ignorance and illness,  and the number of people can be further reduced by the end of the century with  adequate economic policies, the World Bank says.    It said only one major region -- Sub-Saharan Africa -- risks a degradation of  its economic and social conditions in the 1990s.    Despite ""tremendous"" progress the past three decades, 1.1 billion people in  developing countries -- one out of four -- still live on less than $370 a year,  World Bank President Barber B. Conable said.    The bank's annual report, ""World Development 1990 -- Poverty,"" said per-capita  consumption in developing countries rose by 67% between 1965 and 1985, life  expectancy lengthened to 62 years from 51 and primary school enrollment rose to  84% from 73.    Progress was uneven, with the greatest gains in East Asia. Yet even in  Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where consumption per capita stagnated  during the period, life expectancy and primary enrollment rates improved.    Moreover, the 1980s -- often called a ""lost decade for the poor"" -- did not  reverse the overall trend of progress.    ""The incomes of most of the world's poor went on rising, and under-5 (years of  age) mortality, primary school enrollment ratios and other social indicators  also continued to improve,"" the study said.    The setbacks of the 1980s occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America,  where poverty increased. In Latin America, however, overall social conditions  did not deteriorate as much as the fall in income would have suggested, the  bank noted.    Conable contended that, with adequate economic policies, the number of poor  could be slashed by 300 million by the end of the century.

The World Bank voiced optimism on prospects for the global economy for the  1990s, except for Sub-Saharan Africa.    It projected that industrial economies will achieve a 3% annual growth,  commodity prices will dip in the short term but gain an average 0.2% per year,  and real interest rates will fall to between 3% and 4% from almost 5.5% in the  1980s.

If the region achieved better income  distribution, the number of poor could fall by 20%.    For Sub-Saharan countries, the projected annual economic growth rate is 3.7%,  but high population growth may reduce the per-capita gain to 0.5%.    In contrast, South Asian nations will increase output at a 5.1% annual rate, a  per-capita hike of 3.2%. India's economy will expand at a 5.2% annual clip, a  3.4% per-capita advance.    East Asian countries will all but wipe out poverty, with an economic growth  rate of 6.6% per year and a per-capita advance of 5.1%. China's economy will  expand by 6.8% a year in the 1990s, down from 10.1% in the 1980s, with a  per-capita gain of 5.4%.    For Eastern Europe, the bank cautioned, the outlook is cloudy.

By CARLOS BREZINA, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      WASHINGTON      Most of the world is winning the war against poverty, ignorance and illness,  and the number of people can be further reduced by the end of the century with  adequate economic policies, the World Bank says.    It said only one major region -- Sub-Saharan Africa -- risks a degradation of  its economic and social conditions in the 1990s.    Despite ""tremendous"" progress the past three decades, 1.1 billion people in  developing countries -- one out of four -- still live on less than $370 a year,  World Bank President Barber B. Conable said.    The bank's annual report, ""World Development 1990 -- Poverty,"" said per-capita  consumption in developing countries rose by 67% between 1965 and 1985, life  expectancy lengthened to 62 years from 51 and primary school enrollment rose to  84% from 73.    Progress was uneven, with the greatest gains in East Asia. Yet even in  Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where consumption per capita stagnated  during the period, life expectancy and primary enrollment rates improved.    Moreover, the 1980s -- often called a ""lost decade for the poor"" -- did not  reverse the overall trend of progress.    ""The incomes of most of the world's poor went on rising, and under-5 (years of  age) mortality, primary school enrollment ratios and other social indicators  also continued to improve,"" the study said.    The setbacks of the 1980s occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America,  where poverty increased. In Latin America, however, overall social conditions  did not deteriorate as much as the fall in income would have suggested, the  bank noted.    Conable contended that, with adequate economic policies, the number of poor  could be slashed by 300 million by the end of the century.

""The country at large has  been caught up in social turbulance since Sharpeville, since  before Mr Mandela went to jail. and the backwash swirls around  him: unrealistic expectations, lingering angers and spites,  destructive behaviour designed to make a country ungovernable  rather than to make it succeed, and habits of dependency,  resentment and irresponsibility."" And the ""greatest threat to  the future"" is the ""flight of capital, the wariness of investors  that arise from perceptions of crime, random violence, labor  indiscipline, rampant white-collar crime, fiscal profligacy,  ostentatious mandarism and all the other social ills the country  inherits from the NP [National Party]."" ""Mr Mandela's first  challenge is to set a different tone"" and deal with a civil  service ""adept at looting, a parasite class."" ""Mr Mandela is the  only leader in a generation who has had the moral stature to  call this nation back to work, to impose a stern discipline and  to command patience. He should not hesitate to impose on his  administration his own instincts for order, frugality and  propriety.""    SUNDAY NATION    Vigilance -- Following the inauguration last week, this  country is ""bound together with a sense of optimism about the  future,"" ""the unfolding process could certainly represent a  genuine change of fortune for the country -- but only if some of  the basic needs of the deprived majority see signs that their  vote is working for them to usher a new era,"" an editorial in  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on May 15 on page 10 states.

""It is true  that in our newly-attained democracy, the right to strike is  part of the workers' democratic right in order to achieve their  desired result. But this should take place in a disciplined  fashion."" ""Our liberation was a costly one and we need to defend  it with everything at our disposal. Should we relax, we should  know that we are sitting on a powder keg which will consume all.""    BEELD    RSA Can Be Rainbow of Hope -- ""Yesterday at the Union  Buildings the world was witness to the formal birth of a new  South Africa committed to justice, peace, and dignity for all  its people,"" says a page 12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 11 May. ""President Nelson Mandela said after his  inauguration before world leaders that we are a rainbow nation  which has made peace with itself and the world. The leaders who  cheered his statement are now morally bound to help make the new  South Africa a success in its growth and development. But their  role is limited. The lead will still have to be given by  President Mandela and deputy Presidents F. W. de Klerk and Thabo  Mbeki. However, ""they cannot tackle the great task ahead alone.  There rests on the shoulders of all of us a great  responsibility. The people who set aside their grievances to  stand peacefully and patiently in line to vote will now have to  work hard to maintain peace and reconciliation, and make South  Africa a country of security and prosperity for all its people.""  ""If South Africa can achieve success, it will be a rainbow of  hope and promise to the rest of the world.""    Constsructive U. S. Approach Welcomed -- A second editorial  on page 12 of BEELD argues: ""The presence in South Africa of a  high level U. S. government delegation led by Vice President Al  Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Trade Secretary Ron Brown  is more significant that it would appear on the surface. Not  only do they represent the most senior U. S. delegation yet to  visit South Africa; their visit follows shortly after the  announcement of the `Clinton Plan' of economic and social  upliftment for South Africa involving 2.16 billion rands over  the next 3 years. It also follows on the U. S. President's  earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in  the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton  administration is busy putting words into action and reaching  out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done.  This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7  countries -- could provide the spark which the South African  economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually  contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach  is most welcome.""    Police Now Serve Accepted Government -- A third editorial on  the same page quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu's statement in Cape  Town on Monday that the police deserve praise for their role  that day, and his reference to them as ""our police."" BEELD  continues: ""These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive  new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African  society."" ""That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South  Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the  force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional  dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a  minority government, but of a generally accepted government of  all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the  development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new  symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal  the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact,  it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,'  it's `our country.'""     "

The wind tunnel  is to be used for thermal/aero-dynamic tests during development  of the Japanese `HOPE' space shuttle experimental plane.  Official tests will start in FY95.    The new wind tunnel is I27cm in diameter, twice as big as  that which the NAL currently owns. The new wind tunnel is  capable of creating a steady wind speed of Mach 10 only, while  the old wind tunnel can produce Mach 5 to 11, but the new system  can operate 5 times a day, enabling 2.5 time more experiments  than before.    This is one of the largest wind tunnels in the world,  measuring up to those in operation in the U.S., costing a total  of about 3.5 billion yen.    The wind tunnel has at one end an air pressure storage  facility capable of producing 200 atmospheres of pressure, and a  large vacuum vessel at the other end. A heater, nozzle, and  measurement chamber are located between the two ends. When high  pressure air flows into the vacuum measurement chamber through  the nozzle, the air in the nozzle expands under adiabatic  conditions and accelerates its speed to generate an air current  of Mach 10.    Thermal/aero-dynamic data for high velocity flight vehicles  is often calculated through numerical simulations using  computers nowadays. However, it is most effective to confirm  such calculations through wind tunnel tests using scale models.  The NAL believes that the new wind tunnel will be `useful for  the development of space shuttles.     "

Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year. However, Mr van Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.' His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern Africa could cause famine in much of the region. The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on the average. It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food. Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most seriously affected. The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for southern Africa this year. Total food imports for the region could be as high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year. Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said, with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail wagons. It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq and the Horn of Africa.

The court ruled that the section of the Law and Order  Maintenance Act that made demonstrations illegal, unless they  had the approval of the police, was in conflict with the  Zimbabwean Bill of Rights which guaranteed freedom of  association. The challenge to the law was brought by members of  the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions who were arrested in  1992 for staging a procession in Harare after police refused to  approve it.    They pleaded not guilty on the grounds that the law  infringed  their constitutional rights and the case was referred to the  Supreme Court.     "

The homeland's commissioner of police, Major General Manyane  Noqayi, has been taken hostage by striking policemen and is  being held along with about 30 of his officers at the police  college in Bisho. A spokesman for the striking policemen said  Brigadier Gqozo would be taken to the Bisho Independence Stadium  this morning to address the armed forces. The estimated 3,000  policemen who commandeered the police college said earlier that  they would only accept the fact that Brigadier Gqozo had  resigned if he informed them in person. The policemen, whose  ranks were bolstered by Ciskeian soldiers who refused an order  to surround the college, are sticking to their demands before  releasing the hostages. The demands include pension payouts and  an investigation into corruption among senior police officers.    Earlier, Brigadier Gqozo resigned and asked that South  Africa  take over the administration of Ciskei. South African minister  of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, said SADF [South African Defense  Force] troops along the border with Ciskei have been put on  standby in case they were needed to be deployed in Ciskei. The  number of hostages being held by the striking policemen has  grown to 42, and includes five women. A spokesman for the  striking policemen said they had asked the ANC [African National  Congress] to send marshals to protect businesses and government  buildings in Ciskei. He said they did not want a repeat of the  disruption which had occurred in Bophuthatswana.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has decided that  two  administrators should be appointed to run Ciskei. The council  would appoint one administrator and the government the other.  The TEC said that the administrators would be assisted by the  chief secretary of NEHAWU [National Education, Health and Allied  Workers Union], the director general of foreign affairs, and the  minister for administration.    The policemen on strike are demanding that their pensions be  paid out and that steps be taken against administrative  corruption.     "

This particularly applies to the Ukrainian president.  This was declared by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller  at a press conference organized today at the American House by  the mass media. The tripartite agreement adopted in Moscow is  an extremely important document opening broad perspectives in  the sphere of nuclear disarmament, he emphasized. William  Miller told the journalists about the negotiation processes that  led up to signing this document conducted by representatives of  the three states to coordinate nuclear disarmament efforts. The  drive in favor of reduction and, later on, elimination of  nuclear arsenals began in the late 1960's.

I am happy that people who live in our  countries can sigh with relief, because the threat that used to  hang over our heads has blown over, the ambassador said. He  described as very important the fact that the three presidents  reached an agreement on procedures for transportation to Russia  of nuclear warheads deployed in Ukraine based on compensation  and security assurances. Ukraine will receive 100 metric tons  of uranium for its nuclear power plants as compensation for the  removal of the warheads.     "

The two sides  exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues  of common concern.    Qian Qichen said: The Chinese and Angolan peoples have  enjoyed a traditional friendship. Since the two countries  established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed  smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations  and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close  attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan  Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts  it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that  the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an  early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability.    He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal  affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's  development. China hopes that African countries will realize  peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly  relations.    Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in  Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build  themselves according to their own situations. If big powers  really care about Africa, they should not fill out a  prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer  aid to Africa to promote its economic development.    Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in  Angola.  He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and  economic support that his country has received from the Chinese  Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for  national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on  one side. Following major changes in the international  situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together.    Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand  that  there is only one China, and that it will never develop any  official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that  economic relations and trade between the two countries will be  further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.     "

""A decision to this effect, which will not be easy to  materialize, has to be made by the UN Security Council and have  proper financing backing,"" Shevardnadze said. In his words, the  financing issue was solved to all practical purposes during his  visit. ""I have assurances from both the President and Congress,""  he emphasized.    Shevardnadze said that ""the proposal that international  peace  keeping units be sent was supported by nearly every member of  the UN Security Council.""

Mr Borlaug told a meeting at the Overseas Development Institute yesterday: 'Some people say that Africa's food problems can be solved without the application of chemical fertilisers. They're dreaming. It's not possible'. He said that the environmentalists advocating traditional farming methods failed to recognise the rapid growth in population expected in the continent. The population of sub-Saharan Africa was set to double in the next 22 years, he claimed, which would put a considerable strain on non-chemical farming. China had managed to transform its production of cereals in the five years between 1975 and 1980, increasing yields by a tonne a hectare by using chemical fertilisers, Mr Borlaug said. China's output of cereals had risen from 238m tonnes to 285m tonnes during that period even though farmers had already been using organic compost on the land. Today China produced the most cereals in the world with average yields of 4 tonnes per hectare, Mr Borlaug said. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest use of fertiliser in the world and soil nutrients were so low that other efforts to raise crop productivity would not be successful until fertility was improved. Mr Borlaug said, however, that it was extremely expensive for African countries to import fertiliser, and he called on industrialised nations to provide the continent's farmers with access to adequate inputs.

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Before the revolution, the regime did not pay much  attention to ties with Africa in its foreign policy. After the  revolution, for various reasons, that attention was considerably  increased. There was first the expansion of diplomatic ties.  The next step was the expansion of cultural, economic,  commercial, and industrial ties. By the expansion of industrial  ties, I mean those countries are eager to use Iran's industrial  goods. During that period there were very good examples of  cooperation with those countries in that field. The inception  of temporary or permanent trade and industrial exhibitions in  some countries was one of the first steps taken and was very  successful in those countries.    One of the main reasons for the extraordinary welcome by all  the African countries in which we opened exhibitions is that not  many countries can compete with Iranian prices, while the  quality of our goods is relatively high, particularly the  quality of goods offered there. In some commercial and economic  fields, the private sector could definitely be more active, and  in some other fields the public sector. Without exception all  the African countries we visited asked for the expansion of  economic and commercial cooperation.    [Correspondent] To what extent could cooperation with Africa  help our presence on the international scene?    [Velayati] Because of the end of the cold war, some Western  countries are today interfering more blatantly in the internal  affairs of Third World countries, particularly African  countries, without any consideration for their endemic  characteristics. They have disturbed the situation in some  African countries. The people of Africa are wise to this and,  therefore, seek cooperation with countries that have  particularly more influence on the international scene.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much.

0,FT942-11797 ,"FT942-11797 _AN-EEDEHADIFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: South Africa looks forward   South Africa's transition from minority rule to democracy is something to celebrate. Not even the painfully inefficient election count can spoil an event of such moment and one whose significance extends well beyond the region. A stable, democratic and economically successful South Africa might yet offer hope for a continent debilitated by debt, disaster and disease. It could even become a model for other countries where ethnic and racial tensions present seemingly insuperable barriers to economic progress. Fulfilment of these hopes will be as difficult as the transition itself, but South Africa has made an encouraging start. President FW de Klerk has left office with a grace that has enhanced his reputation and augurs well for his expected role as second vice president. General Constand Viljoen, the former armed services chief, steered the conservative right away from confrontation and into the election. He deserves credit for defusing what could have been a destabilising clash. Above all, the president-elect, Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the victorious African National Congress, is preparing for office with the pragmatism and compassion that is his hallmark. With the grim legacy of apartheid all around him, he was right to strike a note of urgency in his victory speech on Monday night, promising that he and his team will roll up their sleeves and get South Africa back to work. Cabinet places He was also wise to offer places in his cabinet to parties which failed to reach the 5 per cent that would give them automatic representation in a government of national unity: the liberal Democratic party, the radical Pan Africanist Congress and Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front, which seeks reassurance that Afrikaner culture will survive. It would be wise to extend a similar invitation to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, although his Inkatha Freedom party may have attracted sufficient votes to secure it a cabinet seat. Chief Buthelezi's difficulties with the ANC and its leader are well-known. Yet nothing can be lost by attempting to bring this prickly personality into the fold. In selecting his cabinet Mr Mandela must also look beyond his domestic constituency. A careful balance is needed to reassure international investors, who look for stability. They will wish to see continuity of the sound economic policies that have characterised the transition. The retention of Mr Derek Keys, the present finance minister, in one of the main economic portfolios would constitute a clear signal that this is understood. Mr Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank, should be asked to stay in his job. It may be difficult for Mr Mandela but room should be found for both men, not as token whites but as key players in South Africa's new economic team. Investment code Mr Mandela must also be on his guard against those who argue for an investment code. Rev Leon Sullivan, the US-based campaigner, achieved some success in urging foreign companies who decided to maintain their operations in the old South Africa to end discrimination on the shop floor, introduce training programmes and accept social responsibilities in the black community. He and others now advocate similar terms for would-be foreign investors. These objectives are well-meant, but to make them a condition displays a misunderstanding of the tough competition for investment. No lobby urges the same conditions for other developing nations. Some investors are showing strong interest in post-apartheid South Africa, whether as a market in its own right, or as a base for operations in the rest of Africa. Yet the new government is in no position to lay down terms that might drive investment capital to more attractive Asian homes. Indeed, Mr Mandela should bear Asian lessons closely in mind as he looks to the future. That implies a market-driven exchange rate, a competitive business environment, a close partnership between government and the private sector, trade liberalisation, encouragement of multinationals with their worldwide marketing facilities, technology and management skills and an efficient civil service. He will best serve the new South Africa if he applies these principles. He might also then galvanise the rest of Africa, for whom he is already an inspiration.

0,FT943-12701 ,"FT943-12701 _AN-EGXAHABVFT 940723   FT  23 JUL 94 / The sounds of a continent cracking: The west must recognise its self-interest in dealing with the crisis engulfing Africa      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   'The record is grim and it is no exaggeration to talk of crisis . . . What is needed is a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'  - World Bank, 1981 The warnings have gone unheeded. Now come signs of a continent under intolerable strain, poised between crisis and catastrophe, lacking both the capacity and the will to implement economic and political reforms. Rwanda is the latest in Africa's roll call of disasters over the past 20 years, during which at least 10m people have died and as many have become refugees. For some governments, the strain has proved too much. Zaire, almost straddling the waist of Africa, is less a state than a collection of fiefdoms. Sudan, Africa's largest country, has been destroyed by civil war, and Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Angola are joining them. Worse may be to come, for two of Africa's most important countries are now at risk: Nigeria in the west and Kenya in the east are both showing signs of stress. Nigeria's leaders squandered Dollars 100bn of oil earnings over the decade of the oil boom from the 1970s to the early 1990s. External debt, currently Dollars 34bn, rises by Dollars 6bn a year, the civil service is undermined by political interference and corruption, per capita gross domestic product has halved since 1980, the fault line is deepening between Moslem north and Christian south. Meanwhile Kenya is battling against impossible odds. Its population has tripled over the past 20 years to 25m, land hunger grows, unemployment rises, and 400,000 school-leavers compete annually for 20,000 jobs in formal employment. Corruption and vested interests stand in the way of effective reform. Meanwhile Africa's rare 'success stories' such as Ghana and Uganda, are not inspiring. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warned a recent World Bank review. The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Unless Sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, says the Bank. Dissenting voices suggest ways out of the predicament. 'More aid]' cries one. But aid has increased and the crisis deepens. Net aid transfers to Africa increased from 5.6 per cent of regional GDP in the early 1970s to 8.3 per cent in the late 70s, reaching 11.7 per cent of GDP by 1990. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn, has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Reform the international trading system,' cry others, pointing to Africa's deteriorating terms of trade. Perhaps, comes the response, but why has Africa lost its market share of cocoa, tea, coffee to other third world countries who live under the same system? 'Foreign investment is the key,' say others. But who will invest in a continent where the infrastructure has deteriorated, skills are in short supply, and instability endemic? 'Impose democracy by making aid conditional on good governance,' say western governments. But democracy isn't working; and +++++++ End of Leg 3 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ the World Bank's report on the 'east Asian miracle' suggests there is not necessarily a link, says another. What can be done? First, the World Bank, the continent's leading donor, and the aid agencies must find common cause. Africa needs their vigorous lobbying of the west's decision makers. John Clark, who used to work with Oxfam, put it well in his book, Democratising Development: The Role of Voluntary Organisations. Non-governmental organisations, he says, 'will make little headway unless their ideas are grounded in economic reality and unless they search for positive as well as negative lessons within the programmes of the World Bank and other practitioners of development orthodoxy.' Once there is agreement on the economic and political agenda, non-governmental organisations should play a greater role. In certain countries, where the mangement capacity of government is weak, NGOs should run primary health care, or primary education, or drought relief. The private sector should make investment decisions, rather than aid workers without the necessary skills. Increase transparency. Too often donors are willing to conceal what they know of corruption in African governments. They fail to insist on minimum levels of accountability and access to information. By withholding or denying African electorates information about structural adjustment programmes, they stifle debate about economic policy. Constitution making. Hopes for the revival of democracy will be dashed unless Africa draws up constitutions which take account of ethnic, religious and regional differences. Rebuild the parties and institutions of democratic government. Set levels of military spending at a percentage of GDP below spending on housing, education and health. Radical measures to ease Africa's debt burden should be accompanied by tougher monitoring of reform policies, including donor officials in institutions such as central banks and finance ministries. If governments are not willing to embrace structural adjustment and good governance requirements, then donors should only finance humanitarian projects. Above all, the west must be motivated by self-interest as much as compassion in its response to the African crisis. Possible solutions will only be implemented when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat and as a loss. As Africa's economy declines, so immigration to southern Europe will rise; Moslem extremism will intensify; drug-trafficking will increase; disease, whether Aids or the discovery of bubonic plague in Zaire, will pose a serious health problem; environmental erosion or neglect will lead to the destruction of valuable flora and fauna. Africa cannot be ring-fenced: and the longer a co-ordinated response to its crisis is postponed, the more daunting become the problems and more serious the consequences of failure.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  AFRICA: FROM CRISIS TO CATASTROPHE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country            Group      Major armed      Refugees from                  rebellion*    conflict**       the country                                                   ('000)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1980-89       1989-92          1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mozambique           no            yes           1,730 Somalia             yes            yes             870 Ethiopia            yes            yes             840 Liberia              no            yes             670 Angola              yes            yes             400 Sudan               yes            yes             270  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-state armed groups of over 1,000 fighters, in conflict with other such groups **Involving more than 1,000 battle-related deaths with government forces  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           WORLD LENDING RELATIVE TO MILITARY SPENDING  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country         Military        Average annual       Loans as                 expenditures    World Bank loans     % of total                as % of GDP      per capita          World Bank Loans                                  (dollars)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Major rise in military spending  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1960    1990     1960s  1989-91     1960s   1989-91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ethiopia        1.6     13.5      10.2     77.4        1.0     0.4 Tanzania        0.1      6.9       5.3    283.0        0.5     1.3 Zambia          1.1      3.2       5.7     92.7        0.5     0.4 Burkino Faso    0.6      2.8       0.1     68.2        0.0     0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Mandela, a political storm already was  brewing over whether the move warrants relaxation of U.S. sanctions against  South Africa.    From his retreat at Camp David, Bush telephoned South African President  Frederik W. de Klerk and ""pledged U.S. willingness to help create a climate for  negotiations"" between the nation's white minority leadership and its black  majority.    Bush also invited the South African leader for talks at the White House, adding  that Mandela would also be invited after his scheduled release today from 27  years of imprisonment.    In a separate statement, Bush praised De Klerk for showing ""bold and  imaginative leadership in recent days, which has earned the admiration of many  of us who hope for swift and peaceful evolution in South Africa.""    Under De Klerk, South Africa has legalized the African National Congress and  about 60 other banned political groups, freed leading black prisoners and  pledged to negotiate a new constitution. In his dramatic announcement Saturday,  De Klerk also said that a nationwide state of emergency would be lifted if no  further violence accompanied Mandela's release.    Although Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman J. Cohen said  De Klerk's initiatives could lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions ""within the  next few weeks,"" black leaders and key lawmakers cautioned the Administration  not to move too fast.    California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus, said the United States ""should continue to use the moral and  economic lever of even more stringent sanctions as a vehicle for helping to  accelerate the end of apartheid in a nonviolent context.    ""While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost three decades of  imprisonment for his political beliefs,"" Dellums said, ""I am concerned that no  mention has been made about the release of more than 2,000 other black South  Africans still in prison because of their struggle to end apartheid.""    The issue of imprisoned blacks has been controversial because many held on  criminal charges are considered by black opposition leaders to be political  prisoners.    Sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 over President Ronald Reagan's veto  prohibit new U.S. investment and bank loans in South Africa; bar imports of  South African iron, steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products; outlaw  sales of computers to South Africa, and prohibit U.S. landings by South African  Airways.    Under the terms of the law, Bush is empowered to modify or suspend the  sanctions if political prisoners are freed and if South Africa meets any three  of four other conditions.    The four conditions are:     -- Repealing the 1986 state of emergency.     -- Lifting a ban on democratic political parties and allowing all races to  participate in the political process.     -- Repealing the Group Areas Act, the apartheid law dictating where blacks can  live and work.     -- Negotiating with the black majority without preconditions.    The 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency allows South African police to detain  suspects for up to six months without charging them or bringing them to trial.  It also allows the government to restrict protests and to bar the press from  areas of unrest.    Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), House majority whip and author of the 1986  sanctions legislation, also indicated his opposition to a quick lifting to  sanctions.    ""Just because we freed one man doesn't mean that we freed an entire nation,""  Gray said.    Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, an anti-apartheid group,  also argued against lifting sanctions.    ""Clearly, the U.S. has played a significant role in bringing the South African  government to this historic point,"" Robinson said. ""Progress could be seriously  stalled by the failure of the U.S. and European governments to maintain  sanctions and continue pressure for further reform.""    Robinson termed Mandela's release ""a tiny step on a long road to dismantling  the apartheid system.""    Last week, President Bush hinted that he was interested in lifting sanctions.    ""I think when people move in the right direction, it is certainly time to  review all policy,"" he said.    Administration sources stressed that Bush would not move precipitously without  consulting Congress. But a congressional source involved in the issue expressed  concern that the White House might try to loosen sanctions before serious  negotiations between South Africa's blacks and whites are under way.    Among the possible first steps would be lifting the ban on landing rights for  South African Airways, the source said.    Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on African affairs,  announced that he was ""indefinitely suspending"" further action by his  subcommittee on a bill that would expand existing sanctions. But Simon also  noted that Mandela's release and the conditional pledge to lift the state of  emergency in South Africa ""still fall short of an end to apartheid, and it is  premature for the United States to begin lifting sanctions at this point.""    Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa who met  with De Klerk in South Africa last month, urged the Administration to be ""very  careful"" in handling the issue.    ""There are still hundreds upon hundreds of political prisoners in South African  jails, and the emergency is still in effect,"" Wolpe said in an interview. ""The  situation must be created in South Africa where anti-apartheid activists are as  free as the government party to organize, to move about the country and to  speak freely. Then we can talk about beginning negotiations.""    Wolpe also called on the White House to use as a model America's recent  approach to events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.    ""We did not move prematurely in relaxing pressures in place (in Eastern Europe)  until we believed that the process of change was irreversible and that  fundamental change was occurring,"" he said.

Mandela, a political storm already was  brewing over whether the move warrants relaxation of U.S. sanctions against  South Africa.    From his retreat at Camp David, Bush telephoned South African President  Frederik W. de Klerk and ""pledged U.S. willingness to help create a climate for  negotiations"" between the nation's white minority leadership and its black  majority.    Bush also invited the South African leader for talks at the White House, adding  that Mandela would also be invited after his scheduled release today from 27  years of imprisonment.    In a separate statement, Bush praised De Klerk for showing ""bold and  imaginative leadership in recent days, which has earned the admiration of many  of us who hope for swift and peaceful evolution in South Africa.""    Under De Klerk, South Africa has legalized the African National Congress and  about 60 other banned political groups, freed leading black prisoners and  pledged to negotiate a new constitution. In his dramatic announcement Saturday,  De Klerk also said that a nationwide state of emergency would be lifted if no  further violence accompanied Mandela's release.    Although Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman J. Cohen said  De Klerk's initiatives could lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions ""within the  next few weeks,"" black leaders and key lawmakers cautioned the Administration  not to move too fast.    California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus, said the United States ""should continue to use the moral and  economic lever of even more stringent sanctions as a vehicle for helping to  accelerate the end of apartheid in a nonviolent context.    ""While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost three decades of  imprisonment for his political beliefs,"" Dellums said, ""I am concerned that no  mention has been made about the release of more than 2,000 other black South  Africans still in prison because of their struggle to end apartheid.""

'We are in a position that when it is appropriate we can apply,' he said, welcoming a favourable US State Department pronouncement. The statement had been long in preparation but was made 'more pointed' after the by-election defeat of the National party at the hands of the right-wing Conservative party on Wednesday. It acknowledged that economic conditions in South Africa, with severe unemployment, will 'have a direct and decisive impact on the success of the new democracy which emerges from the current negotiations'. The State Department, while vague on its IMF policy, said the US was 'prepared to consider a proposal' for an IMF facility. A provision of law, the Gramm amendment, prohibits US support for an IMF facility unless four conditions are met. A Department spokesman said three had been, but it was not yet clear the fourth had. That requires South Africa to seek balance of payments support from the private markets before going to the IMF. Mr Michael Christie, Washington director of the South Africa Foundation, a private-sector South African group, said he had been privately assured the US would now back an IMF facility. The timing was subject to debate because inflation was now 15 per cent. But he said the country, which now desperately needs to expand its economy through imports, had the option of going to the IMF. A formal finding by President Bush earlier this week that South Africa has made 'significant progress toward the elimination of apartheid' has paved the way for new Eximbank lending to the South African government. 'We are also encouraging US exports to non-governmental South African importers who have endorsed and proceeded toward the implementation of fair labour standards,' the state department added. 'If the Secretary of State certified that a South African firm meets these standards, US exporters to such a firm would also be eligible for Eximbank support.' Companies owned by non-whites are exempt from any requirements.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

France, [words  indistinct], CEMAC, and UEMOA have big integration projects  concerning for instance insurance, provident fund, business  management rights, the creation of regional centers for economic  training, [words indistinct] and economic studies.    Concerning the conventions of the monetary and economic  union  which were not finalized, the heads of state have decided to set  up a committee of plenipotentiaries consisting of ministers of  economy, finance, external relations, and justice, as well as  the governor of the Bank of Central African States, and the  UDEAC secretary general. This committee is expected to finalize  these conventions before the next UDEAC summit slated for  Yaounde in December under the chairmanship of President Paul  Biya.    The council of heads of states also decided to convene a  meeting of the CEMAC and donors to study the means of mitigating  the negative effects of the devaluation in the countries of the  subregion. An act approving the restructuring of UDEAC was  signed by the heads of state. Gabon is expected to apply for  the post of deputy UDEAC secretary general which was declared  vacant during the summit. Other decisions were also made  especially in the air, land, and river transport sectors. The  heads of state decided to reactivate these sectors by reopening  the river route between Bangui and Brazzaville.

0,FT944-11415 ,"FT944-11415 _AN-EKGC8AAMFT 941107   FT  07 NOV 94 / Strong UK industrial growth forecast      By PHILIP COGGAN, RODERICK ORAM and ALAN PIKE   UK manufacturing industry, battered by contraction and plant closures during the 1980s, may be entering its strongest period of growth for 30 years. Forecasts by the London Business School predict that manufacturing output will rise by 4.5 per cent this year and 5.6 per cent in 1995. Manufacturing production from 1994 to 1998 will, according to the school, show an average annual increase of 4.3 per cent. If achieved, that would make it the best five-year period of industrial growth since 1964-68. However, a more gloomy report published yesterday by the National Manufacturing Council - an arm of the Confederation of British Industry - suggests that some of British manufacturing's traditional difficulties, including poor productivity and low investment, may become a barrier to achieving the predicted output growth. Manufacturing productivity, the council said, still lags some 20 per cent to 40 per cent behind output per head in leading foreign economies, and it warned that the gap might grow as economies abroad recovered. 'We need more investment in our plants and people,' the council said in its annual report. It added: 'The rate (of industrial growth) is insufficient to allow Britain to catch up with its main competitors, such as Germany, Japan and the US.' The council added other concerns about a manufacturing recovery, including a historically sluggish rate of investment, slower turnover of stocks than principal competitor countries, a persistent trade deficit in manufactured goods and lower workforce skills than competitor economies. London Business School, taking a more optimistic view, says changes on the supply side of the economy meant that handicaps once dubbed the 'British disease' - low productivity growth, poor industrial relations and a declining share of world trade - were 'a thing of the past'. Improvements in those areas, combined with shifts towards investment and export-led growth and a lower exchange rate, were reasons for expecting that manufacturing industry would perform well. The view that the overall recovery in the UK economy remains strong is supported by Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, in the bank's quarterly economic review today.

The document by the London-based African Rights is timed to coincide with the handover today of Washington's leadership of the international force to the United Nations. The authors say fighting and banditry have become worse in some areas, and claim aid workers are unanimous in describing the security situation as having deteriorated since western intervention. The report maintains that the overall food supply problem had been overcome as early as October 1992, before the US troops landed. Over-supply of food has damaged the agricultural sector, says the report. Efforts at disarmament of rival factions have been 'sporadic and half-hearted', and both the UN and the US have failed in the peace process by giving warlords an 'unwarranted legitimacy' and not consulting a cross-section of civil society. The highly critical analysis is by Ms Rakiya Omaar and Mr Alex de Waal, co-founders of African Rights. The small, UK-charity funded organisation was formed last December after they resigned from Africa Watch, part of a US-based international network of human rights monitors. The experience of the authors in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa will give weight to their analysis. Their judgment is also likely to be backed by several of the charities working in Somalia. The report calls for a UN commission of inquiry into the operation, disarmament of warlords, and greater attention to long-term economic rehabilitation and the peace process.

The daily wrote in its editorial that it was not solely a  product of ""Wahhabi house of Saud"" but a declaration jointly  engineered by the western forces of arrogance. It stressed that  King Fahd, for understandable reasons, could not tolerate even  peaceful demos against the U.S., Israel and other enemies of  Islam on `his' territory.    Turning to the deployment of Saudi security forces around  the  Iranian pilgrims headquarters this week, the paper noted that  the heavy military concentration around the building was  regarded as another recipe for disaster had the `deliverance  from unbelievers' rally taken place. ""The world is not unaware  of Saudi Arabia's military, political and economic ties with  Washington and how American strategists (with due help from  Britain) advise the royal family on everything from gardening to  foreign-policy making,"" wrote the article. ""If Muslims unite,""  the daily suggested, ""no earthly power can resist them. Evil  powers are well aware of this and thus cannot bear to see  hundreds and thousands of pilgrims condemning their interference  in Muslim affairs.""    KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL concluded by saying that the Saudi  rulers will never command the respect of the ummah for indulging  in practices detrimental to the lofty cause of Islam and its  followers. ""They should open their eyes to the stark realities  of today's world in which nations big and small want their  leaders to get out of America's satanic orbit. For how long can  the `guardians of the holy shrines' keep alien interest on the  top of their national agenda?""     "

0,FT934-7745 ,"FT934-7745 _AN-DKRC7AGJFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (10): Disliked but 'still necessary' - A look at the financial rand, the investor's torment      By PHILIP GAWITH   NEXT TO violence, political instability and concerns about ANC economic policy, what investors like least about South Africa is exchange control. In fact, outside of a few lawyers and tax advisers, it is difficult to find anyone who likes it. Even the Reserve Bank, which administers the policies, never tires of saying that it would like to rid the country of this albatross. Earlier this month Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented: 'An early end to the dual-currency system is not in the offing.' He also noted, that 'the financial rand will remain as long as the domestic political and social instability . . . continues'. With South Africa facing an election on April 27, 1994, and the immediate aftermath a great unknown, few believe the financial rand will go before the end of 1994 at the earliest. While most exchange control regulations are aimed at stopping people taking money out of the country, it is the dual-currency system that most affects foreign investors. In terms of this system South Africa has a commercial rand, the official rate of exchange used for all normal commercial activities; and the financial rand which is basically a currency for non-resident investment or disinvestment. The aim of the financial rand is to protect the country's foreign reserves. The system is designed to ensure that when foreigners repatriate their investments, they do not do so at the expense of the country's reserves. Foreign investors need to pay close attention to the financial rand as it is a highly volatile currency easily capable of negating any gains made in, say, an investment in equities or bonds. Indeed, many foreigners suffered heavy losses in the second half of 1992 when the currency weakened dramatically. Although turnover in the market has increased, it remains a very thin market, skittish and difficult to predict, and easily moved by a large order. Financial rands are created when a non-resident sells his South African investment to a South African. He must be paid in rand, which rands are then deposited in his account with an approved dealer in foreign exchange (all of the main banks). Once in his account, the rand becomes financial rand which can only be sold by the non-resident owner to another non-resident against payment in a foreign currency. By definition, residents can never own, and hence sell, financial rand (though, in very limited circumstances, locals may use financial rand for offshore transactions). Residents are also not allowed to buy financial rand as this would require foreign exchange - precisely what the system is supposed to avoid. In considering when the financial rand might be abolished, it must be remembered that this subject is inextricably bound up with South Africa's debt standstill arrangements. These were introduced in 1985 and covered the country's repayable foreign debt (then Dollars 13.6bn, now down to Dollars 5bn in terms of a final agreement reached last September). The government's position was that it would have been unfair if a restriction had been placed on repayment of foreign debt at that time without also restricting the repatriation of foreign investment in South African equities. This would have led to undesirable arbitrage transactions  -hence the introduction of the financial rand. Likewise, it is most unlikely that the Reserve Bank will scrap the financial rand system while foreign creditors remain subject to a debt repayment scheme. The latest scheme is due to run for eight years. For South Africa to consider ending it before then - that is, repaying the affected debt - will either require that it manages to roll over a substantial amount of the Dollars 5bn still subject to the scheme, or that its reserves grow to the position where it feels they can withstand a sizeable capital outflow. Current levels, which cover only about six weeks of imports, are a long way short of the required level. The best indicator that the financial rand is ripe for abolition will be when the discount to commercial rand, currently about 20 per cent, either narrows considerably or disappears altogether. This is unlikely before South Africa is seen to have achieved a stable and sustainable transition.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

They scored their latest success Sept. 16 when police smashed a major  international smuggling syndicate after months of investigation, arresting 25  suspects.    Officials seized 980 elephant tusks, weighing about seven tons and valued at  nearly $2 million, in what they believe was Africa's biggest haul of illegal  ivory.    ""This is the biggest haul made in Africa,"" said Col. Johan Meintjies, head of  the police diamond and narcotics squad, which also investigates poaching, after  the raid in the farming town of Okahandja, 43 miles north of Windhoek.    The tusks were found hidden behind a load of vegetables in a refrigerated  truck.    ""These tusks came from more than 500 elephants, but we believe most of them  were from animals killed in countries either to the north or the northeast of  us,"" Brian Jones, a spokesman for the Department of Nature Conservation, told  Reuters.      South Africa Police Help    Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the South African administrator-general of Namibia,  Louis Pienaar, said: ""It was with the assistance of the South African police  that the police in Namibia were able to achieve this result.""    Environmentalists say ivory is smuggled from Angola, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe  by way of Namibia or Botswana. It is then shipped to Taiwan and Hong Kong for  processing.    Some of the men detained in the raid could face 10 years in jail under  penalties that have been tightened since the latest poaching spate began.    Poaching has increased this year since the number of South African forces in  Namibia was reduced under the U.N. independence plan for the huge desert  territory, which had been ruled by Pretoria since World War I.    Since July only 1,500 South Africa troops have remained in Namibia, confined to  two bases in the north under the U.N. plan.

Rundu, on the Kavango River, has been a conduit for ivory from Angola and arms  supplies to the rebel movement there, the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola.    The area on either side of the river teems with elephants and other game, now  threatened by poachers.

They scored their latest success Sept. 16 when police smashed a major  international smuggling syndicate after months of investigation, arresting 25  suspects.

Mr. Meir Shumer, 48, an Israeli citizen, is in police  custody  after appearing in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on  Tuesday.    Police say this is the fourth time in 18 months they have  seized diamonds or gold smuggled on El Al flights from  Johannesburg to Tel Aviv.    Immigration records show that Mr. Shumer's arrest came on  his  thirteenth trip to South Africa since 1990.    On most of his visits, police said, he stayed for between  one  and three days before returning to Israel -- almost always  choosing to fly El Al.    Police say El Al's Saturday-night flight appears to have  become a hot favourite with professional smugglers and dishonest  emigrants in spite of El Al's reputation for having the  strictest security in the world.    The possibility that airline staff may be colluding with  smugglers has not been ruled out.    Last year Reserve Bank investigators working on a  R179-million fraud case were told by an informant in a sworn  statement that the airline's staff were helping wealthy South  Africans get their riches out of the country.    Within weeks of this, Germiston diamond and gold unit  detectives arrested El Al security officer Derek Joel Niss, 35,  for trying to smuggle a suitcase filled with more than 670  Krugerrands into a plane cargo hold.    Niss said after his conviction that he suspected a cartel of  emigrating South Africans had paid him the R5,000 cash bribe he  received for each coin-filled suitcase he slipped on the plane.    He said he had handled about 20 consignments before his  arrest.    Niss's arrest was the second time police had seized gold  coins destined for Israel on an El Al flight. Last February  they found a suitcase containing 1,100 Krugerrands which had  been checked in for transport to Tel Aviv. The owner has still  not been traced.    And in another diamond-smuggling case, police arrested  Israeli courier Moshe Landman when he tried to board an El Al  flight 18 months ago with R55,000 in diamonds hidden in one of  his boots. Landman had travelled to South Africa 15 times --  mostly with El Al -- before being caught.    Last Saturday police swooped on passengers travelling  overseas on various airlines at Jan Smuts.    Diamonds and gold unit detectives Colonel Clement Jackson  and  Captain Henk van Rensburg picked out Mr. Shumer from the line of  passengers moving through passport control.    Mr. Shumer, who claims to be a diamond consultant, was taken  to a cubicle and asked to strip down to his underwear, said  police. He was then arrested.    Police said Mr. Shumer arrived in South Africa with his wife  -- it was her first trip -- two weeks ago and the two apparently  took time off to holiday in George and Cape Town.    Mrs. Shumer, who was also searched, went on to Tel Aviv. Mr.  Shumer was not asked to plead when he appeared in the Kempton  Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. A bail hearing has been set  for February 23.    If convicted, Mr. Shumer faces a maximum sentence of 10  years' imprisonment and R250,000 fine.    Police says they are now obliged to carry out more frequent  and more thorough searches of passengers using El Al.    Explaining how smugglers were slipping past his security  officers, an El Al security spokesman said the airline was  mainly concerned with apprehending potential hijackers and  terrorists.     "

Discussions are expected to focus on inspection of Taiwan's  software exports and proposed revisions to the trademark and  patent law, according to Lin Yi-fu, head of the Taipei  negotiating team and deputy director-general of the Board of  Foreign Trade.    Lin said that Taipei will explain to the U.S. side the  measures it has been taking and the results of its efforts on  IPR protection.    Taiwan has invested a lot of money and manpower in  implementing a software export inspection system at the request  of the U.S., he said, but the inspection operation has  inconvenienced Taiwan software exporters and benefited only a  few American software makers.    Lin said he will call for the termination of the inspection  operation during the talks.    Meanwhile, Economics Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang noted that  the U.S. is expected to review its special 301 priority watch  list at the end of March and the talks offer Taiwan a chance to  try to relieve the imminent threat of U.S. sanctions.    Chiang said that Taiwan has performed well on the IPR issue  and should be removed from the priority watch list.    He added that his ministry and concerned government  departments have prepared a ""position paper,"" which details  Taiwan's efforts and results toward IPR protection over the past  one year, to persuade the U.S. to remove it from the list.    But Economics Ministry officials are not so optimistic about  Taiwan's full removal from the list. However, they said it may  be possible for Taiwan to be downgraded from the special 301  priority watch list to the watch list.     "
0,FT942-6829 ,"FT942-6829 _AN-EFBDVAG7FT 940527   FT  27 MAY 94 / South Africa aims to double arms exports      By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry. Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, said yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Dollars 270m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. Mr de Waal noted, for example that South Africa sold a variety of weapons - rifles, grenades, mortars - worth R100m to Rwanda over a five-year period. He said the deal was terminated late last year because of evidence the weapons were used against the Rwandan people. In recent weeks, Rwandan Hutus loyal to the government have been blamed for horrific slaughters of minority Tutsis and other Hutus that killed tens of thousands of people. Mr Peet Smith, Armscor general manager for imports and exports, said the new government's policy permitted arms exports to countries only to defend their sovereignty and not where the weapons might be used to violate human rights. Despite anxieties about exports to the rest of Africa, South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future. Selling more of its respected military hardware is the key to Armscor's survival, Mr de Waal said. The company currently more than R800m of arms per year, which he said represented less than 0.5 per cent of the international arms market. Products that could sell well abroad include sophisticated Rooivalk helicopters, frequency-hopping radio transmitters and receivers that avoid interception, landmine-proof armoured vehicles, advanced mine detection equipment, and G-5 and G-6 long-range artillery. Mr de Waal identified Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe as potential markets. This will be eased by Tuesday's UN Security Council decision to lift a mandatory ban on the sale of arms to South Africa. President Mandela said this week Pretoria should be allowed to sell weapons if it wanted to and Defence Minister Joe Modise, a former guerrilla fighter, said expanding weapons exports could create 20,000 jobs.

A statement from the administration said aid would be concentrated on the poorest 50 countries, which received three-quarters of bilateral aid in 1993-94. 'Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of know-how to countries in transition remain particular priorities for the ODA's work,' it said. The statement was disputed, however, by the World Development Movement which recently won a High Court challenge over the funding of the controversial Pergau Dam in Malaysia. It said the channeling of more aid through Europe and to commercially tied projects would leave fewer funds for poverty-focused country-to-country aid. Ms Harriet Lamb, development movement campaign officer, said Africa in particular would suffer as, on the ODA's own calculations, the percentage of total British aid to Africa was set to fall from 14.4 per cent in 1994-95 to 12.1 per cent in 1997. Mr Ben Jackson, the movement's campaigns co-ordinator, complained that the chancellor had had to stump up Britain's share of the Edinburgh summit's commitment to increase European aid by 60 per cent by the end of the decade. He said: 'Unlike some of his European counterparts, he has failed to match this promise with extra funding for the overall aid budget. 'Britain is punching well below its weight as an aid giver.

It will be the first time the two sides have met for formal constitutional negotiations since multi-party talks broke down last May at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Since then, the gap between the two sides on the crucial issue of power-sharing has narrowed, with the ANC proposing this week that South Africa be ruled by coalition even if one party wins a majority of votes in the first elections under a permanent constitution. ANC officials tried to force the pace of next week's meeting, which will be held over three days at a secret location, by rejecting as too slow the timetable announced on Thursday by President F W de Klerk, who forecast elections for an interim government by April 1994. Amnesty International human rights group has released a report documenting physical abuse of prisoners in ANC camps outside South Africa. The victims were often labelled as South African government spies, but most appeared to have been genuine ANC members, imprisoned because they raised grievances or policy differences, it said.

What is the size of the Iraqi Army now?    [Al-Rawi] From its formation until the 14 July 1958  revolution, the Iraqi Army was a small one, incapable of meeting  the national and pan-Arab requirements to defend the Arab nation  and serve its national objectives. The colonialists were trying  to impose their control over the Army and use it as a tool to  protect their colonialist objectives and schemes and crush any  nationalist movement by force. After 1958, the Army began to  grow gradually with the formation of new divisions. Then, the  17-30 July 1968 Revolution brought to power a nationalist  authority that believes in national and pan-Arab objectives.  That authority adopted a long-term policy to rebuild the Army  on strong revolutionary bases. Thanks to mujahid leader  President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve him, the  Army became the revolution's striking arm and vigilant eye that  protects the homeland and the people's achievements. The Army  was organized on modern, scientific bases, and its combat  capabilities and technical methods were improved. The formations  were significantly enlarged until today when it has become the  fourth largest Army in the world after the U.S., Russian, and  Chinese Armies. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT933-7680 ,"FT933-7680 _AN-DHTCQABFFT 930820   FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Focus of S Africa reforms shifts to trade  -The revised offer to be presented to Gatt      By PHILIP GAWITH   WHEN South Africa started on the road of political reform in 1990, this was as much a function of the crippling economic cost of apartheid as it was a reflection of the moral and political bankruptcy of that policy. Since then, the country's faltering political fortunes have hogged the limelight. Later this month, however, South Africa will present a revised trade liberalisation offer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which forms part of a revision of trade policy as fundamental as the political reform under way. Mr Stef Naude, director general of the Department of Trade and Industry, comments: 'Without a doubt, this is the biggest reform of trade policy ever undertaken in this country.' The aim of the reform is simple: the transformation of the existing industrial base, fed for decades on a diet of political isolation, import substitution and strategic self-sufficiency, into an internationally competitive, export-led manufacturing sector. The Gatt offer is but the first of many initiatives which include reform of export incentives, investigation of export processing zones, more efficient anti-dumping legislation, a trade agreement with the EC and the future of the South African Customs Union. Pursued against the background of a weak economy, unemployment running at over 40 per cent and fundamental political transition, it is a Herculean labour. No longer can government unilaterally decree policy changes. Democracy, transparency and consultation are the new watchwords. When it comes to economic policy, the imprimatur of the National Economic Forum, the tripartite body where business, labour and government are represented, must be sought. At least in the area of trade policy, there is fairly broad consensus among these three groups as to the way forward. Nobody would argue with the premise, contained in the government's recently published Normative Economic Model, that 'Much of the country's future economic prosperity will be determined by its ability to play a bigger role in international trade in industrial goods.' This clearly requires conformity to Gatt, whose signatories all benefit from 'most favoured nation' status and 'national treatment' - the first ensuring that any tariff cut offered by one country to a second must automatically be extended to all other trading partners, and the second guaranteeing that an exporter is treated just as a local company is treated. 'There is no way South Africa can fully reintegrate into the global economy outside Gatt,' said Mr Stef Naude. Conformity to Gatt is not the only reason for lowering tariff barriers. It is also necessary to remove the anti-export bias in South Africa whereby protection makes the local market more profitable than exports. It also raises input costs for local exporters, making them uncompetitive compared to exporters elsewhere who can obtain inputs at world prices. A recent World Bank study of South Africa's trade policy found that it was not overly protective, 'but far too fluid and complex, and biased against exports.' Compared to developing countries, the protection level is fairly average. According to NEM, South Africa's tariff barrier (weighted by import values) stands at 21 per cent, though this rises to 27 per cent when account is taken of special import surcharges  - which survive for fiscal rather than protection purposes. South Africa's revised Gatt offer will thus have two main features: first, it will involve a one-third reduction in average tariff rates. Second, it includes a dramatic rationalisation of the tariff structure which is virtually unmatched in its complexity. Instead of the current high degree of dispersion, tariff levels will range, at 5 percentage point intervals, from zero to a maximum of 30 per cent (with the exception of the motor industry). Also, almost all tariffs will be bound - which means, in theory, they can never be raised, only lowered. This compares with only 55 per cent in its original offer. South Africa has also committed itself to phasing out emergency dumping formula duties, - a measure which has been the main instrument to counter disruptive competition. to be replaced by proper anti-dumping measures, further reducing the overall level of protection in the country as formula duties often resulted in an increased overall level of protection. The Gatt offer - particularly the lowering of import tariffs - should not be seen in isolation. All parties agree that it will have to be accompanied by supply-side support measures to assist local industry to improve its competitiveness. With unemployment already at alarmingly high levels, the social and political costs of simply dropping tariff barriers, without other policies introduced in parallel, are unthinkable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICA: ESTIMATES OF EFFECTIVE PROTECTION (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Protection on Subsector                            Inputs     Output     Effective                                                           Protection  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Food, Beverages and Tobacco            15.2       13.7           8.8 Textiles, Apparel,  Leather           27.8       43.6          93.6 Wood  Wood Products                   14.0       21.7          39.7 Paper  Paper Products                  9.5       13.3          22.2 Chemicals                               7.5       18.9          50.6 Non Metallic Minerals                   5.2       19.8          34.3 Basic Metal                             4.7       11.2          23.2 Metal Products  Equipment             17.1       18.2          20.3 Other Manufacturing                     2.8       10.9          62.8 Manufacturing                          12.6       17.8          30.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Industrial Development Corporation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT932-9794 ,"FT932-9794 _AN-DELCNAEDFT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Break-up signals overhaul of corporate South Africa      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   GENCOR's announcement that it plans to unbundle came as no surprise, but this does not diminish the significance of an event whose political and business ramifications are likely to be widespread. It almost certainly heralds the beginning of a gradual, but far-reaching, overhaul of corporate South Africa. Over the next 10 years and beyond, groups such as Anglo American-De Beers, South African Breweries, Rembrandt, Anglovaal, Old Mutual and Sanlam, which dominate South African corporate life, are likely to be significantly restructured. Two factors will determine the pace and extent of this restructuring: the vigour with which a future government might pursue anti-trust policies, and the extent to which corporate South Africa voluntarily restructures, for reasons either of self-preservation or economic self-interest. The African National Congress, likely to be the largest partner in any future government, is committed to introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies weaken the influence of the country's largest groups, and promote private sector efficiency. There is also considerable support for unbundling in the investment community where many hold the view that the economy has become too concentrated, stifling initiative in the process. With the exception of Gencor, however, corporate South Africa has shown little enthusiasm for unbundling. Most captains of industry are not convinced unbundling has economic merit. Anglo American, in particular, has defended its size with vigour, sophistication and some success. Ultimately, however, these arguments, couched mostly in economic terms, are unlikely to sway the ANC, which objects to the degree of corporate influence exercised by a few whites. Yesterday's announcement is only the first salvo in a long debate. And practical barriers to unbundling have to be addressed - most obviously, who, other than the existing large groups, will buy the assets of companies that unbundle. Gencor's announcement will certainly force some of the other large groups to take a harder look at unbundling, if only because the onus of proof has shifted towards those favouring the status quo.

0,FT943-13 ,"FT943-13 _AN-EI3DUAIQFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (56): Not growing, but recovering - Africa      By TONY HAWKINS   After a dismal decade of stagnation and decline, sub-Saharan Africa can, at last, see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is the result of firmer commodity prices, faster world trade growth, accelerating economic reforms in many countries, and the remarkably smooth political transition in South Africa. The IMF forecasts growth of 3.4 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995  -well above the average 2.2 per cent over the past decade. However, this marginally brighter prospect should be seen in perspective. Africa is not growing, but recovering. In the past 10 years, per capita incomes fell 0.8 per cent a year. Nor is the recovery solidly based. Events in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda, ongoing hostilities in Angola and the uneasy mood in Mozambique ahead of the October elections underscore its fragility. Tensions in Nigeria and Zaire could any day spill over into serious regional economic disruption. A recent research paper by World Bank economists William Easterly and Ross Levine* explains the region's poor performance 'statistically' in terms of poor education, political instability, weak infrastructure and financial systems, overvalued exchange rates, ethnic diversity and 'troubles with neighbours'. This last effect is explained in terms of critical mass; the writers argue that if African neighbours act together to reform their economic policies, as indeed is happening increasingly now, there will be positive spillover and demonstration effects across national borders. This leads them to conclude, optimistically, that Africa's poor growth performance is 'very much reversible', even if some adverse factors, such as poor education and infrastructural decay, will have long-lasting effects. Factor into their analysis, a rejuvenated South African economy, and the potential for positive cross-border spillovers is considerable. At current exchange rates, following the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA Franc in January, South Africa's GDP of Dollars 120bn falls not very short of that of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa - Dollars 135bn to Dollars 140bn. South Africa's economy, too, has stagnated for the past dozen years, and its return to growth of 4 per cent annually, which is not unrealistic, would be a significant boost for the regional economy, especially for southern Africa. There are two distinct schools of thought on this. On one side, it is argued that the South Africans will be so preoccupied with their own internal problems - especially the successful implementation of their social advancement programme, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), that they will pay little attention to the rest of the region in the immediate future. The alternative viewpoint holds that South Africa is on course to become the locomotive for much of sub-Saharan Africa, partly as a growing market for African primary products and some low-price manufactures, but more importantly as an exporter of capital, skills and services. It's no coincidence that South African firms are in the forefront of the privatisation of hotels and cement plants in Mozambique, the planned sell-off of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, involved in tourism in East Africa, manufacturing and mining in Botswana and Zimbabwe and the development of the region's financial infrastructure. While western banks are pulling in their horns in Africa, Stanbic, South Africa's leading banking group, has expanded by taking over the African operations of ANZ Grindlays. Fledgling stock exchanges being set up all over the continent will benefit from South African advice and expertise. There is enormous, largely untapped potential for integrated tourism programmes linking destinations in Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Botswana and Zimbabwe with South Africa. South Africa's Escom is becoming the hub of a regional energy grid, drawing on Pretoria's excess capacity but also electricity imports from Mozambique's Cahora Bassa, and South African investors may develop the Pande gas deposit in Mozambique. The 1992 drought was a reminder of just how dependent southern Africa had become on South Africa's transport system, in spite of ambitious donor-funded programmes which were intended to reduce that dependence. The bulk of the maize and wheat needed came in through South Africa. The trade numbers tell the same largely lopsided story. In 1992, South Africa had an estimated trade surplus of R13.8bn (Dollars 4.8bn) with the rest of Africa. Most of this was with its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners - Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia - which between them accounted for R9bn. But it also had sizeable trade surpluses with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mauritius and Mozambique. While such a one-sided trade pattern - African exports to South Africa were worth R2.6bn compared with imports of R16.4bn - is a cause of concern to both sides, it is likely to get worse rather than better. African countries are finding South African products to be cheaper (in some cases), often more appropriate, and frequently more readily available with shorter lead times. The Dollars 225m Hartley Platinum development in Zimbabwe announced last month will source much of its capital equipment from South Africa. At the same time, there is little appetite in South Africa itself for the rest of the region's goods, which are largely poor quality, and cannot compete with imports from Asia. The signs are that the existing south-north trade and payments gap will widen, despite increased purchases of African primary goods - Kenyan coffee, Malawian tea, Botswana soda ash, Angolan oil, Zimbabwean tobacco and Zambian copper - by South African firms and increased tourist spending by holidaymakers from the south. Southern Africa, in particular, has much to gain from closer co-operation in transport, energy, tourism and even education, but hopes of a regional free trade area and of broadening the existing rand monetary area to include other countries, are almost certainly premature. The hearts are willing, the rhetoric is there in spades, but harsh economic reality speaks otherwise. At the end of the day, few African leaders are prepared to surrender an ounce of what little of economic autonomy they have managed to salvage from bilateral and multilateral donors, and multinational corporations. Whether South Africa's re-emergence will be the catalyst providing the neighbourly spillover for the rest of the region is highly problematic. President Mandela and his largely untried team have to prove that they can break the African mould, delivering the east Asian cocktail of rapid growth with improved equity, that has eluded the often-feeble efforts of the rest of the continent. History, and hard economic numbers are against them, but at the tail-end of a decade of wasted aid and often-ineffectual policy reform in sub-Saharan Africa, the new South Africa is the region's best bet. * Africa's Growth Tragedy.

The sight -- familiar enough in the clubs of New York -- of the tall, willowy  figure dressed in flowing white robes has been denied them for many years.

Despite reforms set in motion by President Frederik W. de Klerk, a cultural  boycott against Pretoria is still in place, and some people felt Ibrahim should  have waited for the November event.

""He used to be known as Africa's best pianist,"" said ANC information chief  Pallo Jordan, himself a former exile and a friend of Ibrahim.    ""But he's more modest now,"" he added with a smile.

His band, the Jazz Epistles, formed with Masekela and saxophonist Kippie  Moeketsi, had hit the top of the domestic market by the time the trio went  abroad in 1962.

[Begin James recording] Botswana is attractive to South  Africans because of its closeness, stability, and peace.  Already stories abound and are confirmed by top Bank of  Botswana officials of large amounts of South African rands being  handed over to banks here. Monday's (?free) fall of the South  African currency is not only a message of a collapse in overseas  confidence, but also a strong signal to those who have money to  get it out of South Africa. One such person handed over 300,000  in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana  bank account last week. Most South Africans are still not rich  enough to afford top Botswana hotels and are staying with  friends, but in Zimbabwe and Namibia the caravan parks are  already filling up. Some South Africans will simply be making  temporary use of neighboring countries.    Botswana itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic  drop in supplies of food. Over 80 percent of our food comes  from South Africa and traders have been warned that strikes,  hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited  supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior Bank of  Botswana official assured (?journalists) last week that  Botswana's currency will be protected, but a dramatic 6.8  percent drop in the South African rand since January is bound to  affect the Botswana pula, which is partly linked to the rand.  People in Botswana are filling their cupboards with tinned  food, as they hear of South Africans' advice to stock up with  food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great  days of election and freedom approach.    The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries  first, although the influx of money will be a temporary  blessing, as Botswana is merely being used a conduit for the  outflow of cash.

0,FT943-13714 ,"FT943-13714 _AN-EGRD8AFPFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (32): Generous Gatt 'window' - Exporters are finding new markets open for trade      By MARK SUZMAN   South African exporters are a little overwhelmed by their new-found international respectability. After years of developing expertise in such arcane skills as transhipping and re-labelling to try and counteract sanctions imposed as a result of apartheid, companies find that many countries are now rolling out the red carpet, and new markets from Asia to eastern Europe to Latin America - long out of bounds - are now open for trade. As part of this new order, the South African government is starting to formalise its trading relationships. At the top of the list comes readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. South Africa's formal submission to the Uruguay Round was accepted late last year and a fundamental restructuring of its tariff structure will shortly get under way to bring the country more in line with international norms. The adjustments required by Gatt will involve pain for some highly protected industries but, by securing classification as an 'economy in transition', South Africa has managed to get a generous eight-year window for leading employment-oriented industries, such as textiles and motor vehicles, to adjust to the new arrangement. The deal also allows some leeway in the reorganisation of South Africa's contentious, and widely abused, General Export Incentive Scheme. Meanwhile, new trade agreements are giving further impetus to trade growth. President Clinton gave South Africa GSP status in May, allowing preferential access to the US market for a wide range of goods, and the European Union has announced its intention to do the same by the end of the year. A more formal, separate trade treaty with the European Union is under discussion, as is the possibility of some kind of associate member status with the Lome aid group. Also on the agenda are a set of new regional trade arrangements. At the World Economic Forum meeting last month, President Mandela and other southern African leaders signalled their intention to work towards a regional free trade agreement. As a first step towards this goal, in August South Africa will join the South African Development Community, a grouping of 10 southern African states originally formed to try and reduce dependence on South Africa. In the shorter term, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has already signalled his intention to restructure the South African Customs Union, which South Africa shares with Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland and in which it currently pays out some R5.6bn of a customs and excise revenue pool of R16.3bn to its partners. It is also seeking to renew a bilateral trading arrangement with Zimbabwe. Reflecting all this activity, exports have been soaring, and in 1993 totalled R78.3bn as the country ran a current account surplus of R5.9bn  - although this year's surplus is likely to be lower due to a higher import bill. But despite this success, the majority of exports are still primary products and while the proportion of manufactured goods has been increasing there is still a lot of room for improvement. A survey of exporters by the South African Foreign Trade Organisation estimates that South Africa's manufacturing industry is at a 15 per cent cost disadvantage to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, with its only comparative advantage in electricity. In addition, the report notes that after years of focus on the domestic market, local manufacturers have a 'tendency to blame external factors' for failures, and many fail to take export promotion and planning seriously. 'South African manufacturers still lack an export culture,' acknowledges one senior trade official. 'Until that changes, growth will be disappointing.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Up to the end of 1993, this major tourist attraction had  approved more than 1,000 overseas investment projects, involving  a total capital of 3.026 billion U.S. dollars.    In 1993 alone contracted overseas investment amounted to  1.17  billion U.S. dollars, equal to the total in the previous ten  years, according to official sources.    Rich in cultural attractions and located in an advantageous  position on the middle of the second Euro-Asia Continental  Railway, the city has witnessed a marked improvement in its  infrastructure since the mid-1980s, in an effort to boost its  tourism industry.    The city's first expressway, linking it with Lintong, a  major  tourism attraction to the east, opened to traffic this year.  The upgrading of two other highways is also underway.    Also completed in 1993 was the Xian International Airport,  which links it with more than 40 domestic and international  cities and ranks among the top four airports in China. More  flights and routes will be opened soon.    The city's telecommunications system also saw a big boost,  with the installation of more than 200,000 digital-controlled  telephone lines. Direct calls can be made to 800 domestic  cities and towns and over 180 countries and regions worldwide.    The developed infrastructure facilities and powerful  technology development potential (the city's 503 scientific  institutions employ 332,000 researchers and technicians) have  made the city particularly attractive to overseas investment, as  it has been chosen as the site for a national high- and  new-technology development zone.    The past year has seen three major tendencies emerge in the  development of overseas investment in the city, according to the  officials.    Manufacturing and urban infrastructure construction have  become the major targets of foreign investment, in place of  housing and small-scale trade. Of the new projects approved in  1993, some 65 percent are in the manufacturing sector, the  officials said.    With the advent of world business giants on the Xian  investment scene, the volume of investment is becoming larger  and larger. A Sino-Japanese venture involves an investment of  30 million U.S. dollars and produces 236,000 industrial sewing  machines a year.    On a visit to Washington D.C. in the U.S. last November, a  delegation from Xian signed an economic and technological co-  operation agreement with the city which provided that Washington  would invest 40 million U.S. dollars to build the ""Washington  Industrial Park"" in the Xian High- and New-Technology Zone.

It was the first time the SDF backed the solo exercise by  planes from the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence. Previously  the SDF had cooperated with the U.S. Forces as part of a joint  military drill.    The U.S. Forces previously conducted NLP at Atsugi Naval Air  Station in Kanagawa Prefecture. But Japan and the United States  agreed to move the landings to Iwojima starting last year due to  complaints of noise from residents around Atsugi.    This year's practice is one of the largest, with 25 deck  planes and some 400 pilots participating.    In cooperation, the Air Self-Defense Force has dispatched 10  transport planes to carry U.S. ground crew officials and  materials, while the Maritime Self-Defense Force offered 20  officials to back up air control and ground support and a rescue  plane in case of an accident.    Japan has also spent some 17 billion yen to construct  lodging  and hangars for the U.S. forces in Iwojima. The U.S. is  expected to spend about 33 million yen for NLP this year,  according to official sources.    Speculation is that the SDF support is to pave the way for  concluding the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA)  with the U.S., in which the two forces provide each other with  materials.    Conclusion of the ACSA suddenly became an issue due to  concerns that North Korea may be building nuclear weapons.    The Defense Agency said the SDF Law and Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty permit Japan's support of U.S. night-landing practices  at Iwojima.     "

In addition to demonstrating that the SIP for the area would be adequate to timely attain and maintain the NAAQS but for emissions emanating outside the U.S., the SIP must continue to meet all applicable moderate area SIP requirements in order to qualify for the special SIP approval under section 179B. Among other things, the SIP must provide for the implementation of reasonably available control measures (RACM), including reasonably available control technology (RACT) (see 57 FR 13540). In international border areas, RACM/RACT must be implemented to the extent necessary to demonstrate attainment by the applicable attainment date if emissions emanating from outside the U.S. were not included in the analysis. The EPA believes that this interpretation of the degree of RACM the State is required to implement in moderate PM10 areas affected by emissions emanating from outside the U.S. is consistent with the purpose of section 179B. By directing EPA, under section 179B, to approve the plan or plan revision of a moderate PM10 area which shows it would attain the NAAQS but for foreign emissions and by excluding such an area from reclassification to serious, Congress clearly wanted to avoid penalizing States containing such areas by not making them responsible for control of emissions emanating from a foreign country over which they have no jurisdiction. Moreover, by excluding the area from reclassification, Congress also elected to avoid subjecting such areas to the more stringent control measures applicable in serious PM10 areas. In addition, as set forth in section 179B(a)(2), the second condition which must be met before EPA may approve a moderate area plan showing attainment but for foreign emissions, by its plain terms, requires the State to establish only that the plan submitted would be ``adequate'' to timely attain and maintain the NAAQS, but for emissions from outside the U.S. Nothing in section 179B relieves the State from meeting all its applicable moderate area PM10 SIP requirements, including the requirement to implement RACM. Nonetheless, if, in doing so, States containing such an area were also required, because of contributions to PM10 violations caused by foreign emissions, to shoulder more of a regulatory and economic burden than States not similarly affected (i.e., by implementing measures which go well beyond those which the SIP demonstrates would otherwise be adequate to timely attain and maintain the PM10 NAAQS) such a requirement would unfairly penalize States containing international border areas and effectively undermine the purpose of section 179B. Indeed, to the extent an affected State can satisfactorily demonstrate that implementation of such measures clearly would not advance the attainment date, EPA could conclude they are unreasonable and hence do not constitute RACM. Notwithstanding the above, in light of the overall health and clean air objectives of the Act, EPA does encourage affected States to reduce emissions beyond the minimum necessary to satisfy the ``but for'' test in order to reduce the PM10 concentrations to which their populations are exposed.

On the third day of anti-govermnent protests, riot police  fought running battles with protesters, firing buckshot and  teargas to put down the unprecedented unrest in the homeland.    To add to political woes besetting President Lucas Mangope's  government, the African National Congress [ANC] called for a  mass stayaway from work in Bophuthatswana on Thursday and the  launching of a consumer boycott.    Pule Sekwana, speaking for civil servants who have embarked  on a widespread strike that has triggered much of the unrest in  the homeland, said on Wednesday: ""The strike will continue and  we will bring down the government down.""    In the first death in the unrest, the homeland's information  service said the policeman was shot dead ""by members of the  public"" in the Bophuthatswana township of Mabopane, north-west  of Pretoria. The policeman was at a police post when gunfire cut  him down.    A doctor at a Mafikeng surgery told SAPA he had treated 35  people for gunshot wounds on Wednesday afternoon and another  victim for other injuries. Those treated were apparently victims  of police shooting protesters late on Wednesday afternoon around  the capital Mmabatho and in neighbouring Mafikeng. Another man  was treated for gunshot wounds at Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital.    ""Most of the people we treated were shot in the torso and  upper body, and we removed buckshot from many of the wounds. We  also treated a number of grazes which could have been caused by  sharp ammunition,"" said Dr Anwel Hoosenmia, who treated the 35  victims at his surgery.    Earlier, riot police clashed with students at the University  of Bophuthatswana, firing volleys of teargas shells as the  students erected barricades with rocks and tree branches and  hurled stones at the police. No injuries were reported. The  street outside the university campus resembled a battle field  with streets signs and huge garbage skips blocking the road and  access to the campus still being controlled by heavily armed  police.    The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], meanwhile,  failed  on Wednesday in its bid to impose its authority in the homeland,  after two-hour talks with President Mangope and his cabinet.  ""The government of Bophuthatswana stated it is unable to  accede to the iec requests as this would be tantamount to  acceptance of the non-recognition of Bophuthatswana's  sovereignity,"" said a joint statement released after the  meeting. The IEC delegation was headed by its chairman, Mr  Justice Johann Kriegler.    The IEC requested the homeland government to permit  electioneering and voter education campaigns and to allow voting  facilities for South African citizens.    Mr Justice Kriegler said the meeting had clearly failed to  achieve its objectives and delegates would have to continue  trying to negotiate an agreement. he told reporters after the  meeting that the Transitional Executive Council and the South  African Government might take ""such action as they see fit""  following Bophuthatswana's rejection of its demands.    The TEC said on Tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties with  the  homeland, cut financial assistance and restrict the movement of  the homeland's officials in South Africa if Bophuthatswana  failed to allow free political activity within a week.    Bophuthatswana's Economic Affairs Minister Ephraim Keikelame  accused South Africa on Wednesday of ""aggression and  intimidation"" and ""denying the rights of Bophuthatswana citizens  of self-determination"". He said south african citizens living  in Bophuthatswana had ""the right to vote freely if they want to  campaign on the soil of South Africa but not in Bophuthatswana"".    But the homeland's striking civil servants, demanding  protection for their pensions in the face of political  developments in South Africa, said they were now also pressing  for the immeditae reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South  Africa. The homeland is to be reincorporated into South Africa  after the April 26-28 elections.    The strike has triggered the worst unrest seen in  Bophuthatswana in its 17 years of ""independence"". Schools have  been closed and health services and general government  administration severely disrupted.    And a day after striking employees of the homeland's  broadcasting corporation took President Mangope's son hostage,  the president on Wednesday fired all workers and announced the  closure of radio and television broadcasts. The striking  Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation workers are demanding a  50 per cent pay increases.    ""The Bophuthatswana cabinet today decided to close Bop  Broadcasting Corporation's [BBC] two television stations, Bop-TV  and Mmabatho TV, and the three radio stations, Radio Bop, Radio  Mmabatho and Radio Sunshine, until further notice,"" BBC Chairman  Eddie Mangope announced in a statement.    President Mangope, who survived a military takeover in 1988  after South Africa sent in troops to put down the rebellion, has  accused Foreign Minister Pik Botha of stoking unrest in  Bophuthatswana to justify his ouster and military intervention.    Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  leader Euguene Terreblanche, joining the fray, on Wednesday  offered to send his militants to the homeland to help Mr Mangope  withstand what Mr Terreblanche called an African National  Congress/SA Communist Party/Pik Botha plot. On Tuesday the  Conservative Party charged the chaotic events in the homeland  were a ""communist textbook case"".    In another development striking teachers marched to the  South  African Embassy in Mmabatho on Wednesday to demand South  Africa's military intervention in the homeland.    Following the late afternoon clashes around Mmabatho, Dr  Hoosenmia said he and his wife, Dr Sumedha Munim, spent most of  the afternoon treating victims at their Mafikeng surgery. A  police armoured personnel carrier Hippo was parked outside. Dr  Hoosenmia said patients in the surgery were prevented from  leaving the premises by the police. Two of those treated in the  surgery were sent to hospitals in South Africa as their wounds,  both in the stomach, were too serious to be treated in the  surgery.    The centre of Mafikeng on Wednesday night still showed signs  of the running battles with dirtbins thrown on streets and  garbage littering most of station street in the city centre.  Many store windows shattered in the unrest had been been  replaced while glazers were working in the dark to repair other  damaged shopfronts.    Staff at PG Glass in Mafikeng went on strike at 4pm, leaving  only one company, Motorglow, to repair the many broken plate  glass windows. Motorglow also replaced more than 100 car  windows and windscreens on Wednesday afternoon.     "

Having based its foreign policy on defending rights of the  world's oppressed, from the triumph of the Islamic revolution in  1979, Tehran, which severed ties with racist Pretoria, is to  resume its economic and political relations now that a popularly  elected government has come to power in South Africa.    The Iranian Cabinet approved establishment of  economic-political ties with South Africa in January 1994 with  the collapse of apartheid and commissioned the Foreign Ministry  to pave the way for removing the sanctions against the country  and set up relations with it.    Economic and political experts anticipate establishment of  firm and multilateral relations between Iran and South Africa  and foresee steady expansion in the future.    According to informed sources, South Africa, which was once  the main consumer of Iranian oil, intends to resume its economic  ties with Iran by importing crude oil, and the first official  agreement to be signed between the two countries is expected to  include the supply of Iranian crude oil for South African  refineries.    Iran expressed interest in improving its economic and trade  ties with the country a month after the lifting of United  Nation's economic sanctions against it.    Now it is expected that Iran would play an active and  substantial role in South Africa's economic programmes and that  the two countries' volume of exchange would rise to dlrs.

The valuable experiences of Iranian experts and specialists  over the years of reconstruction following the victory of the  revolution would enable them to have an active part in  development of housing and power generation in South Africa  which declared it would spend dlrs. 108 billion on housing,  electricity and employment within the coming five years.

I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to  participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson  Mandela tomorrow.    Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by  his  friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at  the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international  airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house  and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral  and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation.  I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the  South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South  Africa is also a main point of their conversation.    Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over  the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in  office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the  sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when  he carried out a broad program of activities that included  participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province.    The two countries have also adopted, at different  international forums, common positions on just causes, when  firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to  great enemy pressures.    Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the  spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens  our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young  Ghanaians are studying in Cuba.    Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban  personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the  delegation members reported on the main activities taking place  in our country.    We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where  the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's  inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not  be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The  Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of  the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated.  [passage omitted]     "

U.S. officials briefed South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu on the meeting upon his arrival in Washington earlier  in the day after traveling to Canada and meeting with United  Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York.    After coordination with South Korea, U.S. officials are to  meet again with North Korean negotiators as soon as Friday,  Seoul officials said.    In Thursday's meeting, the two sides reportedly discussed  the  schedule for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspection team to enter North Korea, resumption of inter-Korean  contacts to discuss an exchange of envoys, announcement of the  suspension of the South Korea-U.S. ""Team Spirit"" military drill,  and the third round of high-level talks, while agreeing in  principle to exchange a memorandum of understanding on a ""small  package deal"" this week.    North Korean officials said an IAEA team may be able to  initiate inspections early next week, adding they will propose a  fourth round of working-level talks with South Korea to discuss  an exchange of envoys. The talks have been stalled since last  October. But the two differed somewhat on the timing of the  Team Spirit suspension announcement and on future bilateral  relations, Seoul officials said.    It is true there was some disagreement over setting exact  dates, but the two would have no trouble reaching agreement  within the week, a government official predicted.

0,FT943-9 ,"FT943-9 _AN-EI3DUAIUFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (63): The tigers are still growing - East Asia / Victor Mallet describes the region's success story      By VICTOR MALLET   It is as hard to meet pessimistic economists in east Asia as it is to find negative economic growth rates. If success is measured in gross domestic product, developing Asian countries have been and continue to be pre-eminently successful examples of how to manage high-speed industrial revolutions. According to the Asian Development Bank, per capita income in developing Asia grew at an average rate of 4.4 per cent a year between 1970 and 1992, compared with 1 per cent in Latin America and virtually nil in Africa. Last year, growth in the developing Asian economies was almost 10 times as high as in Africa and more than twice as high as in Latin America or the Middle East. There is no sign that growth is slowing. Cambodia is mired in a messy civil war, but the communist-run economies of Vietnam and Laos are being liberalised and are expanding. Economists predict that growth in China will moderate after the double-digit expansion of the past two years, but average GDP growth in the four south-east Asian economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore should rise to more than 8 per cent this year from 7.8 per cent in 1993 and 6.9 per cent in 1992. Even the Philippines and Burma, Asia's laggards, are recovering. Behind the rosy statistics lie some extraordinarily rapid industrial and social changes. Retailing, for example, is being transformed in south-east Asia. Giant, western-style shopping malls - Seacon Square, said to be the largest mall in Asia, was opened in Bangkok in August - are starting to replace markets and small shops. As international communications improve and Asian countries industrialise at an ever-increasing speed, Asians are leap-frogging whole stages of development experienced in previous industrial revolutions. Some people use cellular telephones before they know what it is to have a fixed telephone. Exports of rice and tapioca are replaced by exports of microchips, allowing western companies to exploit niche markets by exporting to Asia intermediate industrial goods. Asia's success has spawned a clutch of reports seeking to explain what Asia is doing right and what other regions of the world might emulate. The findings are not particularly startling: successful Asian countries have encouraged foreign investment, been fiscally responsible, and kept inflation low; their citizens save much of their income and do not have too many children. Predicting which factors might limit Asian growth in the future is more problematic. Several Asian countries lack the transport and communications infrastructure required to support their increasingly modern industrial economies, but such difficulties will probably be overcome in time with the help of money from foreign investors and fast-growing local capital markets; even Thailand, which has been notoriously lax in developing its infrastructure, is building new roads and is now installing millions of new telephone lines, although work on a mass transit system for congested Bangkok has yet to begin. The environmental damage caused by population growth and uncontrolled pollution and commercial exploitation could be another factor limiting Asian growth, especially since several of the region's economies still depend heavily on exports of natural products such as timber and fish. Environmentalists say the recent growth rates of high-performing Asian economies would be several percentage points lower if the benefits from asset-stripping of environmental resources were excluded from the figures. Another problem is the shortage of skilled labour that is already increasing costs in some fast-growing Asian countries, and the lack of home-grown technical skills. And although intra-Asian trade and investment are increasing, the worsening mood of Asia's international trading partners in the US and Europe could yet turn out to be the most important determinant of Asian growth rates. As the World Bank noted in a report* published in July, east Asia's exports have risen more than thirtyfold in the past quarter of a century to about Dollars 850bn, increasing the east Asian share of all world exports to 21 per cent from seven per cent. The result of this - industrialised countries' imports from east Asia have been rising by 15 to 20 per cent a year without their receiving greatly improved access to Asian markets in return - is a series of probably unsustainable Asian trade surpluses and rising trade tension between the US on the one hand and China and Japan on the other. The World Bank recommends that Asian exporters, for their own good, should therefore accelerate the liberalisation of their trade regimes. Import tariffs, for example, should be halved, bearing in mind that countries such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have sometimes been protecting manufacturing with effective rates of more than 40 per cent. Much of the industry protected for nationalistic reasons is not domestic. In Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the ADB says, foreign companies account for more than half of manufactured exports. 'Import protection is no longer justified by the old infant-industry arguments,' the World Bank report says. 'Many of the protected industries are no longer infants, and much of the protection is costly.' A number of Asian governments have already embarked on a new round of tariff-cutting and liberalising of foreign investment laws. Economists in Asia, for whom optimism has become a way of life, are betting that the region's dragons and tigers will once again adapt successfully to the international climate and that GDP will continue to grow both in absolute and in per capita terms. * East Asia's Trade and Investment: Regional and Global Gains from Liberalisation.

But it stopped short of blaming senior ANC officials for the abuses, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. In a report released yesterday, a three-man commission appointed by ANC president Nelson Mandela echoed criticisms from an earlier internal commission of inquiry, saying that ANC security officers had beaten, tortured, detained without trial, and in some cases executed detainees. But it named only two senior ANC officials and accused them of relatively minor abuses. More serious findings were made against members of the ANC's security branch, and the commission recommends that they be disciplined under the ANC's internal code of conduct.

In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television  that  was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: ""The  effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's  independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the  elimination of apartheid.""    Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle  waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their  objectives, saying: ""Sooner or later, Namibia would have been  independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway.""    Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's  leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban  leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to  reach ""this political miracle,"" which I view as a very great  victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the  progressive forces.    The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of  Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the  high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded  yesterday.    When asked about conditions for normalizing relations  between  Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the  economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than  30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel.    Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for  the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and  sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the  political, economic, and social system they consider best must  be respected.    Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and  that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install  socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro  affirmed: ""We have nothing against the United States.""    The Cuban president praised the recently concluded  conference  in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and  industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the  degradation of the environment.     "

The news outraged Ulster Unionist politicians, who accused  President Clinton of an about-turn on his administration's  previous demand that Mr Adams should publicly renounce violence  and back the Anglo-Irish peace declaration before being admitted.    But a statement from the White House said: ""The President  supports this difficult decision and believes it will help  advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.""    Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, will be  barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and from  engaging in ""direct or indirect fund raising"" during his visit  for Tuesday's [1 February] conference, the White House said.    For the past 20 years the Sinn Fein president has been  barred  from entering America despite numerous efforts to gain a visa.  He applied at the American embassy in Dublin on January 14 for  the visa to attend the conference organised by the National  Committee on American Foreign Policy. The honorary chairman of  the committee is former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  and all sides have been invited to attend the one-day  conference. But Unionist politicians have declined the  invitation, and tonight Ulster Unionist MP John D Taylor  condemned the U.S. decision as ""despicable,"" saying the Clinton  administration had ""given in"" to pressure from the Irish lobby  in Washington.    ""The White House now wishes to facilitate the apologists for  the IRA murder campaign in Ireland,"" the MP for Strangford  declared.    ""The people of Northern Ireland say to Clinton: `You should  be ashamed of yourself -- no longer can you condemn terrorism  elsewhere in the free world.'""    Mr Adams told reporters tonight that the object of his visit  was not merely to brief Irish supporters on the status of  current peace moves but to collect the views of Irish  expatriates.    The U.S. administration admitted it consulted the British  and  Irish Governments while considering the application.    London, which has an exclusion order preventing Mr Adams  from  entering mainland Britain, argued the ban should remain.    The Irish government made no public comment but is  understood  to have urged in private that the visa be granted. The Dublin  view prevailed. [passage omitted]    Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said tonight  it appeared the U.S. Government had ""watered down considerably""  its requirement for the Sinn Fein president to renounce violence.    ""I think it is disappointing that the Americans have  capitulated on something which for them should have been a  matter of principle,"" he said, adding: ""I think it diminishes Mr  Clinton.""    Mr Maginnis also said the conference would be undermined if  it was felt more important to have the presence of ""an advocate  of terrorism"" rather than representatives of the greater number  of people in Northern Ireland. [passage omitted]    Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's  obscene. I think the White House has lost all moral authority  and cannot condemn terrorism elsewhere in the world while they  facilitate someone like Gerry Adams.""    Mr Alderdice [Alliance Party leader] told the programme:  ""Clearly I am disappointed. There has been an enormous amount  of Republican and Irish nationalist pressure on Mr Clinton to  make this decision.""    Mr Alderdice, who is in the U.S., added: ""I'm going to put  forward the views of the majority of the people in Northern  Ireland who don't want to see the violence and regard the whole  position of Mr Adams as highly repugnant.""    Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for Belfast  East, said: ""Now the people of Northern Ireland will see that  democracy counts for nothing.    ""If you are a gunman then there are people who want to hear  you. There are people who will roll out the carpet for you. But  if you are a simple democrat who abides by the ballot box then  nobody wants to hear you.""    Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, told  the  programme he was surprised the U.S. had granted Mr Adams a visa  in advance of reaching agreement over the joint declaration.    ""It is exactly what Adams wants. He wants to go on being  able to procrastinate in order to put pressure on both  governments to make some more concessions before the killing  stops,"" he said.    Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, told the programme Mr  Adams was having problems getting agreement to the declaration  among the republican movement.    ""If getting a visa to participate in this so-called  high-powered discussion in the U.S., if this helps Mr Adams in  terms of his credibility amongst his own peers, his own  followers, then that can only be a good thing,"" he said.    Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley  accused the U.S. administration of ""kowtowing"" to the Boston  Irish Lobby and going back on previous decisions.    He said of Gerry Adams: ""He might declare a very short  ceasefire which will be hailed as a tremendous breakthrough.    ""This is a propaganda exercise. It is telling against the  British Government because the British Government are losing  every round of the battle.""    President Clinton had no authority in Northern Ireland, Mr  Paisley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, adding: ""He should  clean up the mess in his own back yard without interfering in  Northern Ireland.""

Rand Merchant Bank, one of South Africa's three largest investment banks, is to borrow Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) from a syndicate of international banks within the next two weeks, according to Citibank, the US bank which is arranging the deal. Although the amount is relatively small, larger deals are likely to follow. Gencor, the South African mining company, is expected to come to the syndicated loans market at the end of this year with a seven-year Dollars 537.5m loan to help finance the company's acquisition of Shell's Billiton metals and minerals business. These loans are emerging as South Africa seeks a debt rating from the international rating agencies, and follow the completion in July of the first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African company, a Dollars 300m deal for Liberty Life, the country's largest life insurance company. South Africa plans to tap the international bond market, when it has acquired a rating. Many international banks are keen to lend to South Africa which is viewed as a high growth area but which has been largely closed as a result of sanctions. In a syndicated loan, one or two banks arrange a transaction and parcel out portions of the loan in order to share the risk. Citibank, which is in the process of sounding out interest among other banks, said the loan will have a final maturity of one year with individual drawings maturing in 90 to 180 days. It said European banks are expected to be the main participants but also reported strong interest from the Middle East.   Companies:-  Rand Merchant Bank.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Once considered a luxury, rice has become the chief staple food and major source of calories for some 70m of West Africa's 200m people. Output in the 17 countries that make up the region has risen by more than 5 per cent a year since 1980, doubling to a record 6.6m tonnes last year, the highest increase for any of the major cereal crops. The popularity of rice in West Africa, particularly among urban dwellers, means that consumption has shot up at an even faster rate than output, exceeding 9.5m tonnes in 1992. Some 3m tonnes had to be imported last year at a cost of Dollars 600m, putting a severe strain on scarce reserves of foreign exchange. While countries in the region are trying to encourage yet higher output, and cut down on imports, farmers are facing a number of problems that could put a brake on expansion. Rice is still a relatively new crop in West Africa and high-yielding varieties suitable for the region have yet to be developed. A research institute, the West Africa Rice Development Association, based in Bouake, Ivory Coast, which is trying to develop improved varieties of rice and encourage sustainable farming practices, is facing a funding crisis. Warda, which was set up in 1970, was recently forced to close one of its stations in Sierra Leone because of the withdrawal of funds by USAid, The US government aid organisation. Two other research stations, at Bouake and at Saint Louis in Senegal, are down to skeleton staffs. The World Bank, one of Warda's largest donors, last year cut its annual funding from Dollars 1.785m to Dollars 1.5m, while the European Community slashed support from Dollars 532,927 to Dollars 324,000. Only two of the regions's 17 countries contributed funds for Warda's research, despite their interest in producing more rice from their own fields. 'If the countries who spend so much money importing rice, divert only a tiny fraction for us to do research it would help solve the problem,' said the association's director-general, Dr Eugene Terry. A panel of rice experts that conducted a review of Warda's work said that it had been 'reduced close to the level of critical mass, and in some aspects may already be below it. This is an extremely serious and urgent situation'. Most rice in West Africa is not grown in Asian-style paddies but by small farmers in upland areas without the benefit of irrigation. Africa's existing upland rice varieties are hardy but yield less than a tonne per hectare, compared with a global average of about 3.5 tonnes. Upland farmers in West Africa who apply fertiliser are averaging more than two tonnes a hectare, but fertiliser is not widely available. When Warda was first established, it concentrated on adapting high-yielding rice varieties developed in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere to West African conditions. It was hoped that these varieties could give Africans the benefits Asians were enjoying. But Warda admits that this approach proved 'misdirected'. In the hot dusty winds and extreme temperatures of West Africa the Asian varieties fared badly, and researchers are now trying to improve local varieties. Higher yielding varieties could have an important environmental spin-off, enabling farmers to allow longer fallow periods in between rice cultivation. Much of the expansion of rice output in West Africa has taken place because farmers have shortened these fallow periods, but at the risk of serious land degradation. Researchers point out that provided the right varieties can be found there is considerable potential to expand the output of rice from West African inland valleys. These valleys cover about 19m ha, and rice now only grows on about 5 per cent of them.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P0112 Rice.   Types:-  MKTS  Production.

0,FT943-7356 ,"FT943-7356 _AN-EHXE7AA9FT 940824   FT  24 AUG 94 / S Africa cautious on scrapping currency controls      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Liberalisation of South Africa's exchange control regulations will not be possible until the country gets an international credit rating, Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday. Delivering his annual report in Pretoria, Mr Stals said it was clear the existing system would have to be scrapped to ensure sustainable, long-term growth for the country. 'In the long run and in the interest of future economic growth, South Africa must liberalise its foreign exchange market and revert to a system of unitary floating exchange rates,' he said. However, Mr Stals noted that in other countries exchange controls were abolished only as part of a macro-economic restructuring programme, often with the help of international institutions, and that at the very least South Africa must wait until it had full access to international capital markets. South Africa's two-tier currency comprises the commercial rand, used for all regular balance of payments transactions, and the financial rand, used by foreigners as a discounted investment currency. Exchange restrictions have been in place since the 1960s. 'The abolition of exchange controls in isolation without any supportive measures may cause serious disruptions in the initial phase of the transition and force the reintroduction of old controls, or even the application of other new direct controls over markets, all of which may be more damaging to the economy,' he said. South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to help it get an international credit rating from the main agencies, a process expected to be completed by October. In addition, Mr Stals reiterated his previously stated preconditions for the scrapping of the financial rand, including a narrowing of the differential between the two exchange rates and a rise in foreign reserves, currently able to cover only five weeks' imports. In recent months, continued speculation over demise of the investment currency has led to severe gyrations in its exchange rate, while fears over the inflationary pressures such a move might unleash have contributed to soaring government bond rates. Responding to the recent upturn in the inflation rate, which rose in June to 7.5 per cent from a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, Mr Stals signalled that the Reserve Bank would probably have to tighten monetary policy to help lower inflationary expectations and cautioned the new government against trying to increase spending. 'Many of us have a desire to force-feed the economy beyond its actual potential and to exert pressure on the monetary system to accommodate these desires by simply creating more money,' he warned. Mr Stals also said that while he was confident the country's capital account would continue to improve, it would be 'naive' to believe that huge amounts of capital would flow into the country even if exchange controls were lifted. Social and political stability, economic viability, sound fiscal and monetary policies and productivity improvements were of even greater importance for most foreign investors.

AFRICA CURBS FOR 6 MONTHS      From Associated Press      KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia      Leaders of the 46-nation Commonwealth on Sunday gave South Africa six months to  deliver on reform promises or face new reprisals, and they called for tighter  financial pressure immediately. Britain alone dissented.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, rejecting key provisions of the Commonwealth  summit declaration on South Africa, charged that U.S. and Commonwealth  embargoes have strengthened white extremism in South Africa. But she went along  with a stipulation that current trade embargoes remain.    In its declaration, the organization of Britain and its former colonies held  off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months.    Britain objected to provisions setting up a new body to scrutinize South  Africa's financial links and declaring that a foreign ministers' committee,  which monitors sanctions and suggests new ones, will meet in six months.    The 12-page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reform moves by South  Africa's new president, Frederik W. de Klerk.    It said there is a ""possibility that significant changes in approach on the  part of the South African regime . . . may yet prove to be within reach.""    The declaration was issued Sunday after final approval by the Commonwealth  leaders at a weekend retreat at Langkawi Island, 210 miles northwest of here.

Britain alone dissented.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, rejecting key provisions of the Commonwealth  summit declaration on South Africa, charged that U.S. and Commonwealth  embargoes have strengthened white extremism in South Africa. But she went along  with a stipulation that current trade embargoes remain.    In its declaration, the organization of Britain and its former colonies held  off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months.    Britain objected to provisions setting up a new body to scrutinize South  Africa's financial links and declaring that a foreign ministers' committee,  which monitors sanctions and suggests new ones, will meet in six months.    The 12-page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reform moves by South  Africa's new president, Frederik W. de Klerk.    It said there is a ""possibility that significant changes in approach on the  part of the South African regime . . . may yet prove to be within reach.""

The deal will be financed through a share-swap, and the price - estimated at about IPounds 20m (Pounds 19m) - will be calculated on the average share price of the first 28 days of trading of Argus Newspapers when the group is floated in April this year on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Independent is purchasing its stake from the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company and the Anglo-American Corporation. The deal will give the two companies around 4m new shares in the Independent group, equivalent to a 5 per cent stake. Independent will have effective control of Argus with its 31 per cent stake. Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive officer of Heinz, added that the smoothness of the transaction confirmed the commercial sense of doing business in South Africa. A team from Heinz was evaluating partnerships with local companies. Last week Independent Newspapers acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing in the UK which publishes The Independent and Independent on Sunday. It also owns 20 per cent of APN, the Australian regional newspaper group. In 1992 it failed to acquire the Fairfax publishing group in Australia, and later failed to buy Mirror Group Newspapers in the UK. Argus Newspapers turned in pre-tax profit of R53m (Pounds 10m) on sales of R685m in 1993. The group's interests include the Star and the Sowetan, the country's most popular daily newspapers, as well as publications in Cape Town and Durban. Mr O'Reilly's ties with South Africa go back to his first visit in 1955 as a member of the British Lions rugby team. He shunned investment in South Africa during the apartheid era, but cultivated close links with Mr Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, and then Mr Nelson Mandela. His commercial activities in southern Africa have been restricted so far to Olivine Industries, a joint venture with the Zimbabwe government.   Companies:-  Independent Newspapers.

That is  their intent. They even included this in a document known as the  New South Africa Foreign Policy Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] Well, from the point of view of our relations with  Mandela, the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We  have had close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we  are family. Regarding foreign relations we are not demanding  anything, or putting conditions; the closer our friendship with  a country, the less we ask to establish ties. We allow  circumstances and the appropriate moment to determine the  establishment of ties. In the special case of South Africa, at  this time, we could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son.  However, we have not pressed the issue of formal ties. I believe  that perhaps tomorrow it will be brought up in the talks with  the foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with  the foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps he will bring this up and ties will be immediately  established. However, we will not bring it up. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up as a demand or as a  request from us.    However, it seems inevitable that those ties will be  established quickly because there are few countries with whom we  have stronger ties -- kinship and fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I do not speak with  ministers of other countries. We talked like old relatives. I am  convinced all of them want the prompt establishment of ties; but  out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    Now, it is a matter of formalities. That formality could be  fulfilled today, tomorrow, or the day after. Very soon.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, further on this issue but  on another aspect, independently of whenever the diplomatic ties  are established: In what fields do you believe that cooperation  could be developed the furthest in areas of common interest  between Cuba and South Africa?    [Castro] Whenever we speak with South Africans or South  African cadres, we discover great prospects. The first thing we  notice is in the spiritual sphere. When they talk with us, at  times, the things they say truly moved us. They express a  fondness for Cuba which leaves us really speechless. There is an  incredible bond of affection. I believe that few times has there  been such a great bond with any country. When we speak with them  and discuss their plans and ideas, given South Africa's  condition, on one hand they have great development and high  living standards; on the other hand, great social needs, for  example, enormous need for housing, public health, schooling,  and jobs. I was talking with the transportation people. I was  introduced to every minister today at the luncheon. I was told  they have many people who lack the means to move. I spoke with  the transportation minister who said he has a difficult task  ahead of him because means of transportation are inadequate even  though it is a developed country. South Africa is a developed  country. It has important technology, important industries; yet  it has a large population that for many years has lived under  apartheid and has a great stash of needs and dreams of a better  life.    Therefore, the government is faced with having to find  solutions to those problems. When you speak with the  transportation minister you find out about these needs. When you  speak with the housing minister, you find out about those great  needs. When you speak with the sports ministers, you find about  their dreams of developing sports. If you talk with the public  health minister, you see their dreams of improving their  people's health services; thus, the enormous social sphere on  which there are prospects for cooperation between both nations.  This would be beneficial both ways: cooperation from us based on  our experiences, as well as South African cooperation based on  their experiences, and technological development.    [Text] I also spoke with the education minister. They have  great education projects. In other words, all you need to do is  talk a while with each one of these cadres and ministers to  understand that there is a very broad field for cooperation  between Cuba and South Africa. This is undoubtedly the most  developed country in southern Africa.    You should see the road infrastructure. I was telling the  transportation minister: You may have a problem of not enough  means of transportation, but you have great roads. They have  good infrastructure in many areas. The problem is that the  wealth has not been distributed fairly. You find, next to a  superdeveloped world, let us say, an underdeveloped world.    With no other country, even in Latin America, are there such  prospects for cooperation as there are between South Africa and  Cuba, to the extent that we seriously work and study  possibilities and continue to develop that highly fraternal and  warm bond between our two peoples. I must add that we have taken  notice of the very respectful treatment extended to us by every  social sector, not only by ANC members but by the nonblack and  mixed blood sectors, as well. We have also been welcomed by the  white population. We have to keep in mind that this is a  multiracial nation with millions of people from diverse ethnic  backgrounds who have a vital need to cooperate among themselves.  Today, we saw this spirit of cooperation.    Everyone is saying, and justifiably, that the hardest part  begins now. Everyone knows that the hardest part follows the  period of change, of liberation. That is true. I do not think  his [Mandela's] task is easy. However, I believe that they have  developed a significant talent to find solutions. What we saw  today heightened our optimism regarding South Africa's future.  Although we cannot say that South Africa's problems are solved,  they have solved great problems. They have reached today, but I  think they are going to have to continue the struggle. There is  no doubt that Mandela is the man with all the qualifications to  lead this process. He has secured decisive support. I believe he  has to continue working to consolidate what has been achieved so  far and avoid divisiveness. A united country is essential. This  is what we most hope for, and we hope they attain it. Cuba will  be very proud to develop cooperation with South Africa.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, right now, in such a  convulsed world, what does Mandela's victory mean for the  progressive forces?    [Castro] I believe it is a great victory, a great victory of  the South African peoples, the African people, and all the  progressive forces in the world. It is a veritable example and  hope. I believe that South Africa is called upon to exert a  great and positive influence over the entire continent. It is a  renaissance, a revival, proof that great victories can be  achieved even after the disasters that have befallen the world  and that many things are still possible in a unipolar world.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and  South Africa had great differences because of Angola. Did you  ever think then, or later, that you would be here today in the  former capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South Africas and two moments  in  history. For specific reasons, strong clashes took place at a  certain time in history. Now, however, there is a new South  Africa in which such clashes no longer exist -- only peace,  harmony, respect, and affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. First of all, we had to save Angola and its  independence. We were in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning  of intervention by foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our  support -- for 15 years. So many things happened. We had a  strong presence, but it was not strong enough because we could  not, nor did it depend on us alone to, reach a solution to the  problem.    In Angola we fought with the greatest selflessness. The rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would say that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted -- difficult but not through our fault. Cuba  fulfilled its duty every step of the way. Cuba contributed to  the solution of the highly difficult problems that arose. I do  not want to criticize anyone. I believe today is not a day to  criticize. Perhaps history will record this.    This reminds me of what Jose Eduardo [dos Santos] said to  me during today's luncheon, the very heartfelt, friendly words  from the depths of his soul regarding the [words indistinct]  meaning of Cuba's support to the southern Africa nations of  Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. He pronounced truly moving  words. This is why, in the analysis of our conscience, we find  nothing to reproach.    In one of the most difficult periods, in the end, we had to  make very hard decisions; and we did so. They were the correct  decisions. The problem had to be solved. We could not afford to  be so weak that we had to endure foreign intervention and be  strong enough to solve the issues of foreign intervention. In  such cases, if you are weak, you may incur a great defeat; if  you are strong, you can spare many lives. This is the way it  happened in Angola. We accumulated such a potential that it was  possible to solve the conflict with a minimal loss of lives.  Those were decisions made by Cuba, alone and solely. History has  been distorted many times; but in 1975, when we decided to help  the Angolan people against foreign intervention, the decision  was Cuba's alone. At other times when we had to act in difficult  situations, the decisions were Cuba's alone; at times, it is sad  to say, in order to overcome mistakes made by others. I do not  want to say by whom. However, I am not going to blame the  Angolans; it was others.    We found we needed to act; even in the last, very difficult  situation, mistakes were made -- not our mistakes. That final  situation was decisive or Angola would have been lost, with all  the consequences and losses that would mean for the Angolan  people and ourselves. All this influenced the events that  afterward culminated in those negotiations by virtue of which  Namibia's independence was attained with the implementation of  Resolution 435.    I think this helped accelerate the process of the South  African struggle against apartheid. The main, essential, and  decisive merit belongs to the South African people. Our action  might have helped accelerate that process. This is how we see  it. This is a subject on which we have to be very careful. We  should not be the ones speaking about this, but others. The  South African and Angolan peoples have spoken of the selfless  and noble solidarity of Cuba with their countries. We lived  diverse moments which I believe shall be recorded in history as  they happened.    To date, I see the events and development of the situation  in  South Africa as something wonderful. Much depends on what  happens in South Africa, whether the country attains peace,  harmony, and unity. This is what all of us ought to struggle for  and contribute toward, so that the result of the efforts and  sacrifices of many create a country that can serve as a model to  the world on how to solve such complex problems as the ones  experienced here.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, do you not believe that  this history is being written now? Today, Mandela referred to  the guests at the inauguration, you among them, and said, and I  quote: Not too long ago, we had to fight and in that struggle  many nations helped us, nations represented here today.    [Castro] I believe he said more: Nations which even spilled  their blood.    Yes, I was moved by that part of the speech. We owe a debt  to  history for the possibility of giving, offering, and reflecting  on the essence of everything that has happened in the last 18 or  19 years. It is now 1994 and this began in 1975. Actually, it  began before 1975 with our cooperation with the peoples of  Guinea-Bissau and Angola, who were fighting against Portuguese  colonialism. All in all, it began over 30 years ago.    The main part took place after 1975 when Cuba made a full  commitment, when the Revolution committed itself fully. We have  to point out that our Revolution played all its cards in that  struggle, and more than once. A defeat under those conditions  would have meant the end of the Cuban Revolution.    All this happened after 1975. We have to gather all that  information. We have not yet written the history of the Cuban  Revolution, but one of the most brilliant pages of the history  of the Cuban Revolution was its selfless cooperation and  solidarity with Africa. As someone once said, the leader of  Guinea-Bissau, I remember, Amilcar [Cabral] said: When we are  independent, Cape Verde and Cuba should become a federation.  That is what he said. By this, I mean to say that he had  extraordinary internationalist feelings. He is the one who said  that someday our dead from Angola would rise up to negate the  smear campaigns against Cuba by those who say that Cuba had  ulterior economic and material motives in Angola.    He said those unforgettable words. Amilcar's death was  truly sad. He was assassinated as other leaders have been. It  pains me that (Zamora Machel) was not present in this  celebration. It pains me that Oliver Tambo was not here today.  There were so many people who struggled and deserved to see a  day like today. It is painful to remember that they are no  longer with us. However, we have the consolation of knowing that  their work yielded fruit and is present in all these things we  are seeing.    Well, our history could not have been more selfless, more  supporting, more noble than that we have written in connection  with the peoples of Africa and other parts of the world. I  believe we have been steadfast toward our African heritage, our  cultural heritage, our blood lines; toward our principles of  solidarity with people struggling to gain their independence,  their freedom; toward our principles of commitment to just  causes in this world. We will never regret this. I believe  future generations will always remember this with pride.    However, we must assume full responsibility with history, by  ensuring that it gets written. It is about time to write down  history. Or others will -- and who knows what they would write?    [Unidentified reporter] We have witnessed the burial of  apartheid, yet everyone is filled with happiness and joy; we  experienced it this morning at the inauguration.    [Castro] We have witnessed the burial of apartheid and the  birth of freedom. What we witnessed today is beautiful in the  extreme. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity  among the South African people, among every sector, and every  ethnic group. You cannot imagine how much we wish right now that  this process continue developing in that direction.    There are many things remaining in this world to be buried,  however; and it seems the number of undertakers is on the  increase everywhere. We also saw this in Barbados [words  indistinct] irresponsibility which with the world's natural  resources and living conditions are being destroyed. The number  of undertakers of evil is on the increase, as well as the number  of midwives of good.     "

In a message released in Pretoria by the Caribbean  delegation, Castro told the South African president-elect of the  Cuban people's joy over the establishment of a multiracial and  democratic government in South Africa.    The Cuban head of state said in brief statements to PRENSA  LATINA he wishes Mandela peace, harmony, and unity in the great  task he must fulfill as of tomorrow when, during a solemn  ceremony, he takes the oath as president of South Africa.    Castro had earlier expressed joy at being in South Africa  for  Mandela's inauguration. The two men will meet for the first  time in Pretoria tomorrow, during the solemn ceremony.    Castro added this is an important day: ""It is an opportunity  to experience an event of historic importance for the peoples of  Cuba and the world,"" he said.    The Cuban president is one of 42 heads of state who have  announced they would attend the event, which will also be  attended by many well-known figures.    The Caribbean statesman arrived in Pretoria by highway from  Johannesburg, where he arrived on Monday on a flight from Accra,  where he spent a 12-hour technical stopover en route from  Barbados.    Castro was welcomed in Ghana by his friend Ghanaian  President  Jerry John Rawlings, who within the past few hours also traveled  to South Africa where the presidents of Nigeria, Angola,  Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Palestine have already arrived.    A source close to the Cuban delegation disclosed Castro has  already received several requests for interviews and meetings  from heads of state and government, and from journalists who are  in South Africa.    Among the earliest requests were those from the presidents  of  Sudan, Nigeria, the PLO, and South African television stations.    It is expected the period following Mandela's inauguration  will be one of intense work for Castro, the source added.    The Cuban high-level delegation is lodged at the Arcadia  Hotel and consists of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon, president of parliament, and Environment, Science, and  Technology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon.

There was consensus among the heads of state  present in Gaborone yesterday, that it would be helpful, at the  request of the Lesotho Government, if a group of people could  take it upon themselves to liaise very closely with all the  parties concerned in Lesotho, with a view to, A, getting a very  clear picture as to what the prevailing circumstances are, and  B, to make a recommendation to government in the region as to  what action might be called for or might be helpful to resolve  any differences that still exist down there.    [Reporter] So the team, actually, who goes down will then  report back to the various presidents of the Frontline States?    [Evans] In fact there is an arrangement whereby there will  be  a ministerial meeting in Pretoria on Monday. This has already  been scheduled. The foreign ministers of the three countries  concerned, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, will be meeting  on Monday and the task group will be reporting to those  ministers here in Pretoria.    [Barker] But there is a chance that there could be a  military  presence from the Frontline States that you have just mentioned,  if it does not work out?    [Evans] I should imagine that, that's a conceivable option  but at this stage I think it's a little premature, frankly. I  think that one should allow the task group to do their work.  They are professional people. They are diplomats and very  senior personnel from the respective ministries of Foreign  Affairs and the Departments of Defense of the three countries.  The problem in Lesotho is essentially a military problem, so  you know, it's necessary to have military expertise in a group  of that nature. [end recording]     "

""We can make plenty of efforts to improve the standard of  living in North Korea. I would like to ask you to open your  hearts,"" Hata told an interpellation session in the House of  Representatives Budget Committee.    He stressed, however, that Japan should tie up with the  United States, South Korea and China to discuss a response to  the breakdown of negotiations between the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea.    IAEA inspectors left Pyongyang on Saturday after being  denied  an opportunity to take samples from spent fuel rods, discharged  from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, to verify  whether nuclear material has been diverted in the past.    The United Nations Security Council, which has the power to  impose sanctions to enforce the IAEA request, is slated to  discuss this latest development in the longstanding nuclear  controversy Tuesday.    Speaking at the same lower house budget panel, Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa said that the UN nuclear watchdog,  nonetheless, continues unofficial talks with Pyongyang over the  monitoring of the fuel rod exchange and full inspections of the  country's nuclear facilities.    ""The IAEA after its pullout is continuing (negotiations),  though it is not possible to say publicly where and with whom,""  Kakizawa said.    The U.S., South Korea and other Western nations allege that  North Korea is attempting to build atomic weapons.    North Korea claims its nuclear program pursues strictly  civilian purposes, but has repeatedly refused to comply with  nuclear safeguard accords it signed with the agency.     "

I'm  Tim Modise.    [Venter] And I'm Lester Venter, good evening. Tonight, we  bring you an election debate between Thabo Mbeki, national  chairperson of the African National Congress [ANC], and Pik  Botha, Transvaal leader of the National Party [NP].    [Modise] Lester and I will moderate the debate and we are  joined by a panel of four journalists who will put the  questions. They are Anna-Marie Mischke of RAPPORT, Ferial  Haffajee of the SABC radio news, Leslie Mashokwe of Newsline,  and Freek Robinson of Agenda.    [Venter] Earlier, the two parties drew lots to determine who  would make the opening statements and who would have the last  word. Mr. Botha's name came up first, so he will have the first  three minutes in which to make his opening statement and then  Mr. Mbeki will do the same. Both candidates will have an  opportunity to make closing statements of three minutes, and Mr.  Botha will make his, last.    [Modise] Let's go to the ground rules briefly. Freek  Robinson will ask the first question of Mr. Botha, and Mr. Botha  will then have two minutes in which to reply.    [Venter] Mr. Mbeki will then have two minutes to respond.  Mr. Botha will then have the floor for one more minute and Mr.  Mbeki will have another minute to reply.    [Modise] The second question will then go to Mr. Mbeki and  the same rules apply. Candidates will begin speaking on the  green light which is in front of them, a yellow light will flash  at 30 seconds before time up, as a warning, and time up is when  the red light flashes.    [Venter] Those are the rules of the game, so without any  further ado, Mr. Botha, you have three minutes to make your  opening statement.    [Botha] Thank you very much. We are indeed meeting here and  participating in this event under the somber and depressing  cloud of the events that occurred in Johannesburg today. I  would first of all wish to express, and I think everybody here  present this evening would wish to express our condolences to  the bereaved families and friends of those who died,  irrespective of which party or political persuasion they belong  to. I believe that the most important issues, matters of deep  concern -- there are many but the most important ones comprise  the following, first of all, the violence I believe is uppermost  in the minds of just about all our people. Secondly, I believe  the high crime rate -- because despite the multitude of deaths  that have occurred because of political motive -- I understand  that 90 percent of the violence is still attributable to crime,  coupled with that, unemployment, no jobs, not sufficient jobs  for our people, and then education and training, better  education, better training to equip our people for the strenuous  circumstances that the New World Order will require of South  Africans, and then of course housing, proper housing, the  provision of housing, as well as medical and health care. Now  let me make it very straight: The one party that is not involved  in violence is the National Party. The only party that has been  advocating that the leaders should get together is the National  Party, and the Goldstone Commission has made a very clear and  categoric finding as to the main cause of the violence. It is  the war between Inkatha and the ANC. As far as crime is  concerned the ANC would now like rapists to vote. They would  like the gangster of Cape Town, if caught and found guilty, to  vote.    [Venter] Thank you Mr. Botha. I'm afraid gentlemen we are  going to have to be inflexible with our time allotments.    [Modise] Well, the first opportunity went to Mr. Pik Botha  there. The opening statement this time around will be made by  the national chairperson of the ANC, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] Well, let me say this, that our country has reached  a  decisive point in its history. We are very close to the point  where the political order in this country should be changed, and  that's important. This is an objective for which many people  have sacrificed. Thousands of people have died. Thousands of  people have been injured to produce a united, nonracial,  nonsexist democracy. It's an important moment in our history,  and we believe that such is its importance that all South  Africans need to be involved in bringing about that kind of  South Africa. Now there are many challenges to that process,  some of...some of which were demonstrated today. There are  people who are opposed to change, who don't want democracy, who  want a perpetuation of apartheid, a white minority rule. We  believe that all of us as South Africans ought to join hands to  solve that problem, not to say this one is to blame, the other  is to blame, I'm innocent -- but to say as South Africans, what  do we do in order to ensure free and fair elections. As South  Africans what do we do to ensure peace. That's important,  because apart from ensuring free and fair elections part of what  we've got to do is to create the circumstances, when it would be  possible for us to rebuild the economy of this country. You  can't rebuild it in conditions of violence and instability, and  it doesn't help -- it doesn't help that anyone of us in  responsible positions blame the other. What we should be doing  is to say: What should I do? What should my party do to  contribute to this climate of peace? That's very important.  It's going to be very important that we have a program to  create an economy which provides jobs, which provides housing,  which addresses these enormous imbalances that exists in South  African society, apartheid imbalances, whether they are racial  or gender or regional. All of that has to happen. Now I'm  saying that in the end, here you have an African National  Congress, which for eight years plus has fought for these ideas.  We are at the point where we are saying that that victory for  which so many people have sacrificed is about to be scored, and  I do believe that a party and organization such as the ANC,  which for more than 80 years has sacrificed people in pursuit of  these objectives -- this is an organization that should be  trusted.    [Modise] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much and now time for  us...[crowd jeers] time for us to take the first question. Mr.  Freek Robinson of Agenda, and the question to Mr. Pik Botha.    [Robinson] Mr. Pik Botha, I want to relate my question to  the  events of the day and not about policy matters. You have  referred to violence as a major problem in the country today.  Mr. Thabo Mbeki referred to the fact that we must have all the  people of this country involved in the process and to ensure  that there will be free and fair elections, but I want to put it  to you that people in the right-wing and Inkatha supporters say  that you are in an unholy alliance with the ANC, and that you  are going to stick to an arbitrary election date, irrespective  of the cost to lives and that you are doing so for political  expediency, to get a few more votes. Will you therefore, in the  climate that we have today, consider postponing the election so  that temperatures can come down and we can have the conditions  for free and fair elections with an inclusive political  settlement?    [Botha] The decisive question is: Will it become better?  Will the circumstances in this country be better if the  election is postponed? That is a very, very important question.  I doubt it. With the cycle of violence rising as it does, I  have severe doubts that the climate will be better after 27  April, so it would seem to me at this moment of speaking to you,  that the sooner we get the election behind us the better,  because perhaps a lot of the stress and strain and tension can  be attributed to the fact that the country has not had an  election -- and then this date was not an arbitrary date. This  date was set long ago when all the parties of this country had  the opportunity to make a contribution and had an opportunity to  make suggestions as to a proper date. It is not our fault if  parties did not make use of the opportunities that were open and  available to them at the time, and this day was decided upon,  and the whole world is expecting us to stick to it. The whole  world is expecting South Africans now to come to peace with each  other, otherwise the world will turn its back against all of us,  and then it wouldn't matter who wins the election, or it  wouldn't matter what will happen next year. We will be  marginalized. The world will lose interest in us. The world  will say, you've had your chance. You have been negotiating for  three years. You cannot make peace with yourself. You are like  Yugoslavia. As a matter of fact, you are a doomed country.  [applause]    [Modise] And this opportunity now goes to Mr. Thabo Mbeki of  the ANC.    [Mbeki] Let me say this also. I agree with Mr. Botha that  elections.... [crowd jeers] I agree with Mr. Botha, the  elections must go ahead as planned and as agreed, but in order  to ensure that the elections go ahead as planned and as agreed,  there are certain responsibilities that fall on all of us -- to  create the climate so that those elections are free and fair.  Now you cannot have, you cannot have a situation where the ANC  books a stadium, legally, pays its deposit, does all of that,  and some people come and occupy that stadium with arms the  previous day. The result is that the ANC can't use the stadium.  Mr. Botha's government does not say to the security forces of  the country: You cannot allow that kind of thing to happen. Mr.  Botha is correct. The election must go ahead but I am saying  that the responsibility is on the part of government, to ensure  that this climate for free political activity exists. It has to  happen. It's their responsibility. The statement is correct,  but the actions, the actions, the actions are undermining the  possibility -- the actions of the South African government are  undermining the possibility for free and fair elections. That  has to be addressed.    [Modise] Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. And another  response from Mr. Pik Botha to what Mr. Mbeki has said.    [Botha] The point is just that there is now a Transitional  Executive Council [TEC]...[applause] on which we have agreed,  and there is a subcouncil on law and order, and one on defense.  It is not the responsibility of the government any longer  alone. It never was the government's responsibility alone.  [crowd jeers] The United Nations and the whole world and the  international observers here will make it clear to you that they  expect all parties.... President de Klerk is thrown against his  head with a stone, President de Klerk can't address a National  Party meeting, the National Party can't open offices in Transkei  and what is happening about it? Nothing. There is uneven  handedness and the TEC should attend to this matter urgently and  seriously. Judge Kriegler should not only fly to kwaZulu. He  should also fly to Umtata. He should also talk to the other  leaders. There is now structures. There is a structure in this  country to take care of this.    [Modise] Mr. Pik Botha, thank you very much. Another  minute...[crowd jeers] Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] The lights here, they are already showing red. What  I'm saying is this. If somebody comes and occupies Umlazi  stadium illegally, with guns, the commissioner of police should  say to the police force, if necessary to the defense force: Can  you please go and remove those people so that the meeting that  was permitted can take place. That's simple, straightforward.  The TEC cannot instruct Gen. Johan van der Merwe because you  insisted that when the TEC was set up it was not replacing the  present government. Government must instruct Johan van der Merwe  to say: Remove those people and that has not happened, and we  have the crisis we have today. [crowd jeers]    [Venter] Just before we go to the next question, which will  be from Leslie Mashokwe of Newsline, may I remind our  encouragingly lively audience that the candidates have no  flexibility in the times allotted to them, whatsoever. Bear  that in mind with your responses. You are taking their time  away. Leslie, it's your turn.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, the ANC speaks of jobs, peace, and  stability. If you look at today's action, particularly the  action of the security personnel around [ANC headquarters] Shell  House, one wonders whether it would contribute towards creating  a climate of job creation, peace, and stability, if we look at  how they reacted to whatever pressures that faced them.    [Mbeki] Leslie, there are many outstanding problems in terms  of the political process. It's been our view that whatever the  problems are that any of the parties have, those problems need  to be resolved through negotiations. The IFP walked out of the  negotiations. We nevertheless said, never mind that, to find a  solution, let's talk to them. The Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front, AVF] walked out of the negotiations. We said,  nevertheless, let's sit with them and find a solution. It is  our genuine belief that, let's find a peaceful negotiated  settlement. The matter of the king, the king of the Zulus -- we  have not met, up to now, the delegation of the king. Not  because we didn't want to, but that delegation hasn't come. We  are ready to discuss each and every single question that is an  obstacle to a peaceful resolution of their problems facing the  country as a starting point. You can ask anyone of these people  that I'm talking about. You can ask [former Bophuthatswana  president] Lucas Mangope what he wants, where he is now. We sat  with him in five meetings, to resolve whatever issues that he  had. Now, we wanted a peaceful resolution to these matters. We  want a peaceful resolution to the questions that the IFP faces.  What happened today had nothing to do with any of that. We  would have thought, given the fact that even today there was a  tripartite meeting -- the South African Government, IFP, and the  king, and ourselves -- [as heard] that it was not necessary to  march on ANC offices in Johannesburg. ANC headquarters, Shell  House, is at least eight blocks away from the venue of the  rally....    [Venter, interrupting] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much. Mr.  Botha, a two-minute response. [crowd jeers]    [Botha] Jobs will only be created if this country attracts  sufficient capital, if new factories, mines, and job  opportunities are created. The South African economy does not  have in itself, healthy as it is at present -- and it has  recovered remarkably, as we are now following the conditions of  the International Monetary Fund -- but it's as simple as that.  To create more jobs, you're going to need increased training.  You are not going to get money unless....[pauses] Overseas  investors are scared and frightened by the violence and by  statements made, inter alia, also by senior ANC members -- not  Mr. Mbeki, I agree, but this is what Mr. Ben Turok said: A new  South Africa will need to defend its interests against the  predating actions of international capital and its institutions  like the IMF and World Bank, etc. Their intentions to the Third  World are clear enough; to instal bourgeois democracy and a new  world order which recolonizes, integrates, subordinates, the  Third World in a system of so-called free market. I say this  with all respect to my ANC friend: Stop talking like this. This  is Marxist-communist talk. Stop talking like this. [crowd  jeers] This is what is chasing away investment, in addition to  the violence. We must first overcome the violence, but then we  must get in line with the IMF, because African countries who now  subscribe to the conditions of the IMF have shown economic  growth; those who did not, show economic decline. [applause]    [Venter] Mr. Mbeki, you have a one-minute response to that.    [Mbeki] Mr. Botha, let's not move away from the question  that  was posed. The question that was posed was events today which  might have an impact on jobs, peace, and stability. What I'm  saying is that what happened today was not necessary. The  reason it happened was, you have people who are not intersted in  peace, who are not interested in the creation of the conditions  which make that investment possible. People were supposed to be  demonstrating halfway across the town, were never supposed to  have been at the ANC headquartes. They came to cause trouble.  Second, the police were warned on Sunday to say, this was going  to happen, and no action was taken to block these people, to  disarm them, and you had the problem that you had. We want  peace, we want jobs. I was saying this. We've been bending over  backwards to find resolutions....    [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki.    [Botha] I spoke to....    [Venter, interrupting] Sorry, Mr. Botha, we have to move to  the next question. Forgive me.    [Mbeki] He's got one minute. Give him his minute.    [Venter] Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.    [Botha] You see what has become of the SABC? [laughter]    [Venter] You have me there, Mr. Botha. Your minute, please.    [Botha] No, Mr. Mbeki is absolutely right in saying what  happened today was unnecessary, but it's more complicated. It  is almost impossible for the police when, in a march, a group  splits up into other groups. You can't have police on every  street corner. What I want to say emphatically this evening --  and we have said it before -- mass action in general is not  needed. If the ANC feels that it has such an overwhelming  majority, then why should it resort to mass action? If they  believe they have such an overwhelming majority, help us to  arrange the election peacefully and you can prove your  overwhelming majority. Where there's intimidation, there are  threats. It is this fight between Inkatha and the ANC that must  stop. The mass action by both parties must stop.    [Venter] Mr. Botha, thank you.    [Modise] Thanks to Mr. Pik Botha there. Now the opportunity  will go to Ferial Haffajee of the SABC Radio News to pose a  question to Mr. Pik Botha. Ferial?    [Haffajee] Mr. Botha, just to move way from the events of  today. The homelands are collapsing like dominoes. They cost  many billions to create. Do you agree that it was a foreign  policy failure, and did any good come from the homeland system?    [Botha] No, its not a foreign policy failure, it's an  internal policy failure. The Department of Foreign Affairs  never created the independent states. [laughter] Those which  have collapsed, yes, I believe today that had they followed  different policies they would have been in a better position  because, even if they had never got independence, then still you  would have to administer the areas, they still would have needed  hospitals, clinics, a police force, road building, agriculture,  they would have needed to have dams built in those regions. I  predict here today that the cost of administration of the region  would perhaps exceed the cost of administration of the  independent states. Not that I prefer the independent states;  we have long ago decided that all of them should return to the  jurisdiction of South Africa, because of the economic  integration and the reality of our situation. What happened in  those two states is that the public service turned against the  governments of the day, and although a lot of instigation and  intimidation might have taken place, I think I must put the  record straight, and that is, that also National Party  supporters in Bophuthatswana were intimidated by members of the  Mangope government, and in the case of Ciskei, I'm surprised  that it took so long before we could make the change. [laughter]    [Modise] Thank you. Right now the opportunity goes to Mr.  Mbeki to respond.    [Mbeki] What has happened in this particular area is an  illustration of the wrongness and the bankruptcy of the system  of apartheid. The bantustans, the homelands, whatever name you  want to give them, are very typically apartheid, and what we've  seen happen is a general rebellion -- the minister is correct.  The civil service and other people said, We don't want this  thing, in much the same way as the overwhelming majority of the  population doesn't want apartheid. [jeers and applause] No, no,  it's true. The minister and myself have spent a long time  talking together. He has been administering these areas.  [laughter] He has been financing them, but at least he has the  decency to say, This thing has failed.    [Modise] Thanks, Mr. Mbeki, and we give another minute to  Mr.  Pik Botha.    [Botha] Yes, the big danger facing South Africa is that  South  Africa as a whole may fail if the policies are followed of the  Communist Party in this country, and there are elements within  the ANC who would wish to do exactly like that. Writing in THE  GUARDIAN yesterday or the day before, it was stated  categorically that what the Communist Party wants to do is to  set up a completely centralized, totalitarian regime. That is  the surest way to get this country into a catastrophe  economically speaking. The country has done well economically  over the past year, despite its isolation position. It has the  strongest economy south of the Sahara. There are investors who  are interested, but they wil only....    [Modise] Mr. Pik Botha, thank you very much, and another  minute...[jeers]...a final comment on this issue from Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] Minister, the Communist Party did not create the  bantustans. [laughter] The National Party created the  bantustans. That's a matter of fact, you don't have to dispute  that. What the people of this country are saying is that  they're against apartheid. It's not South Africa that will  collapse, it's apartheid that must collapse, and our common  responsiblity is to create a nonracial democracy.    [Modise] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki.    [Venter] Our next question is from Anna-Marie Mischke of  RAPPORT.    [Mischke] Mr. Mbeki, during the past decade or even a bit  longer the ANC, and before it the Mass Democratic Movement, have  abundantly and very often, very effectively, used mass action as  an instrument to get what it wants. We have seen examples of  this during the past week once more, in the toppling of some of  the homeland governments. But after 27 April, we're going to  have, presumably, a democratically elected government, most  probably with the ANC as a majority party in that government.  [jeers, applause] If this culture of mass action and what we  more and more see, political intolerance, is going to prevail  after the election, what is the ANC's attitude going to be to  mass action, not only from your own people but from other  parties who obviously are following the example?    [Mbeki] Anna-Marie, it's very important to protect, in any  political settlement, the rights of the people to take peaceful  action. The ANC will say, and insist on this, that even when it  is government, all conditions must be created, such that the  people can take such mass action as they wish. If they are  opposed to what an ANC government is doing, they must take that  action. So it is a fundamental democratic right. It's a right  of the people to go out into the streets and say, We protest, we  demand the following... [jeers] No, no, no. No, you say AK-47?  Let me tell you what happened. In Durban, a huge demonstration  over the weekend, and what happened? The police put barbed  wire, and ANC people walked up and down very peacefully.  Nothing happened...[jeers]...and you had a demonstration in  Johannesburg today, when the government and the police were  warned that it was going to be violent, and people came into the  center of Johannesburg, as demonstrators with guns. ANC people  didn't come with guns in Durban...[jeers] Anna-Marie, what I'm  saying is that we shall defend the right of everybody to engage  in mass action against an ANC government. It's a fundamental  democratic right. [jeers]    [Venter] Thank you very much. May I remind the audience of  their obligation to the candidates. Mr. Botha, you have two  minutes.    [Botha] I do not doubt the good intentions of Mr. Mbeki.  What I say is, that those intentions are not translated into  reality in practise. The fact of the matter is that we have  warned time and again both Inkatha and the ANC that in a tense  atmosphere you should not organize mass action, because criminal  elements are joining this mass action, innocent people are being  attacked, cars are being burned, human beings are being burned,  and then it's too late to come and say, later, that this was  intended to be a peaceful march. But let us look at the overseas  commentators. I invite the SABC to make a summary of reports in  all the influential newspapers all over the world, of the past  two to three weeks. Then you will get the answer, and that  answer is simply this one, that the ANC and Inkatha are to blame  for the violence. Yes, you have a right to protest, but  ordinary citizens also have a right to be protected. You cannot  march and then burn down people's cars. You cannot march and  then break into shops and steal goods from shop owners. And as  I said before, if the ANC is so sure of victory -- and someone,  I think you, implied that most probably they weren't -- we have  not yet had the election. Let us first have the election. The  National Party has every intention to come out as the strongest  party, and the way the ANC now conducts itself, we will come out  as the strongest party...[jeers]    [Venter] Thank you very much, Mr. Botha. Thank you very  much. We appreciate a lively audience. I remind you that a  courtesy would be to give the candidates the time that's still  alloted to them. Mr. Mbeki, you have 1 minute left.    [Mbeki] Mr. Botha, we need to understand, the NP needs to  wage a campaign to win elections. I understand that. But let's  look at the actuality. You know, the actuality of this country  is like what, for instance, the Goldstone Commission said. You  know, there are very serious charges that have been made about  who is behind this violence. [jeers] No, really, seriously, who  is behind this? The Goldstone Commission does not make those  charges lightly. I think we need to address those questions  seriously. I concede the objective you have of battling to win  elections. That's fine, but we must not, in the process of  that, turn our backs on the truth.    [Venter] Your final minute, Mr. Botha.    [Botha] There is all over the world, in all responsible  circles, today, it's accepted that apartheid is gone. That is  why the Nobel Peace prize was awarded also to President de  Klerk. That is why the UNESCO peace prize was awarded also to  President de Klerk, that is why the Philadelphia Peace Medal and  Liberty Medal was also allocated or awarded to President de  Klerk, In other words, it is only the ANC -- I think they feel  extremely sorry that apartheid was abandoned, because they've  lost their platform. Certainly the Communist Party feels that  apartheid should have continued a little longer. I have now  reached the stage where we must really objectively analyze our  situation. Unless we fall in line with the modern and  successful industrialized economies of the world, it wil not be  a pleaseant thing to govern this country, and the ANC have not  yet taken that step.    [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Botha.    [Modise] Again, the opportunity to ask the next question is  still with Anna-Marie Mischke of RAPPORT newspaper, and this  time the question goes to Mr. Pik Botha.    [Mischke] Mr. Botha, four years ago when the ANC and the  SACP  were unbanned, one of the reasons that were given by your  government was that the communist threat had disappeared, or  diminished to such an extent that you felt free to unban them,  because of what happened in Eastern Europe. Now, very soon,  members of your party will probably be in the same cabinet as  some communists. But suddenly a campaign against the Communist  Party and against communists has become a very definite feature  of your election campaign. What I'd like to know now: Has the  National Party had second thoughts about the communists?  [laughter] Or is it just very useful to take the old bogeymen  of the total onslaught years back from under the bed, where you  have always had the reds? What is the situation around the  communists in the National Party?    [Botha] No, we have never had second thoughts about the  South  African Communist Party [SACP], but the moment you decide to  legalize an organization, then you need not change your view --  you need not start liking them. You then put your hopes in the  people of the country to reject it. That is the democratic way,  and that was the basis of our decision. Our concern now is that  we were challenged by the SACP -- here I must say, not the ANC,  but the SACP -- to prove that more than 16 of the candidates on  the ANC's national list are communists, and we did so; 25 of  them are, and this is of major concern -- not suddenly -- to the  South African Government. Professor Johnson, an Oxford  academic, wrote three days ago in the LONDON TIMES that the SACP  had too strong an influence on the ANC, and that is posing a  danger for South Africa's economic growth. This is coming from a  well known and reputed expert on southern Africa. But what is  more, IMF economists share the same view. So this is not just  something that the NP suddenly have drawn into the debate. This  is there all the time, and our concern is that not even the ANC  will be able to resist this firm grip which the SACP now has on  the ANC... [jeers] ... and that will preclude investment.  There's not a single country in the world today where a  communist party is participating in an election. This is the  point I want to start making. The ANC has the wrong ally. We  shed apartheid. We got rid of that burden. We admitted the  mistake that it was. I'm waiting for my ANC friend to take the  same bold step.    [Modise] Mr. Botha, thank you very much. We give a  two-minute opportunity to Mr. Thabo Mbeki.    [Mbeki] The problem.... Can I appeal...?    [Modise, interrupting] Let me appeal to the members of the  various organizations, please, give the representatives of your  organizations the opportunity to state their cases, please.  Thank you.    [Mbeki] Can I appeal to the NP? Can you listen to what I'm  going to say? If you disagree with it when I've said it, please  object, but please listen. You see, the problem about this  issue is that the NP has gone back to old ways. It's gone back  to old ways. The NP does not say: This is what we find to be  wrong and communist in the program of the ANC -- which would be  legitimate -- to say we believe that what you say about this or  that or the other is communist, and therefore bad for the  country. The NP does not say that, which you can then debate.  The NP says: You've got secret files which show the following  about people. I'm saying, it goes back to what it has always  done, and what it's trying to do. The NP is, I think, very  unfortunate. It's trying to demonize the ANC, to say to the  people out there, its constituents, that this is a demon which  must be destroyed. That is precisely what produced the killers  that we have on our streets. [jeers] Brian Mitchell, who was  responsible for Trustfeeds, said: We did what we had to do  because we were told that it was an anti-Christ, and we had to  destroy it. The NP, without a shred of evidence in terms of  policy, is saying that the country is going to disaster  because....    [Modise, interrupting] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much, and  now the next minute's opportunity is for Mr. Pik Botha.    [Botha] I would like to repeat Mr. Mbeki's appeal also. Give  us a chance to put our viewpoints, and then disagree or agree.  I do not need to rely merely on NP points of view on communism;  it's a failed system the world over. It created misery in  Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, in Bulgaria, in Albania, in the  15 republics of the former Soviet Union. It is a failed system.  It has brought misery to millions of people, economic misery,  and social misery, and misery in every sphere of life. So I need  not defend the NP policy in this respect. We say it is  inherently a bad policy, just as apartheid was one, and we are  strong enough and bold enough to say: Apartheid was wrong. We  shed it, we're thrown it off, and now we say to South Africans:  Please, let us move forward.    [Modise] Mr. Pik Botha, thank you very much. Your minute is  up. [jeers, cheers] Last opportunity, this minute to Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] Minister, you have absolutely every right to talk  about Poland and Bulgaria and this and that and the other. What  I'm saying is: I haven't heard one single thing said by the NP  to say: In terms of the ANC policy as we understand it, this  element is communist, that element is communist, the other is  communist. Nothing. All that is happening is that the NP is  going back to its old ways; the new NP is going back to its old  ways, demonizing, invoking fear in people, without a single  shred of evidence to say: This is the communist policy that the  ANC is going to implement, because it's not there. That is not  true.    [Venter] Our next question from Ferial Haffajee of SABC  Radio.    [Haffajee] On to money matters, Mr. Mbeki. This country's  debt burden is well over 114 billion rands. We pay 1 billion  rands a month in interest alone. How are we going to pay our  debts and create jobs, and build schools, and improve health  care?    [Mbeki] You are quite correct, there are enormous challenges  that face us as a country, because we inherit an economy that  has been in decline for a long time. It is an economy that made  millions of people unemployed, an economy that's made millions  of people homeless, an economy that makes children die of  hunger. Now, central and critical to what has to happen to this  economy is, we've got to ensure that new investment,  considerable investment, takes place. Part of what you've got  to do with regard to that issue is, you've got to create the  political circumstances, the peace and the stability. That's  important. You've got to create the economic policies which say  to the investors? This is a safe place to invest. You've got  to bear in mind that South Africa is in competition with the  rest of the world in terms of foreign investment or investment  generally, including domestic investment. That's a matter on  which we've got to focus -- to create the political and economic  climate for that investment to take place. That's the first  thing, and that is what we're battling now. You've got to  create the policies, and that's the policies that the ANC is  putting forward, in terms of an economic policy framework which  makes that investment possible. And then you've got to address  this issue of the millions of the people who are deprived, so  that they feel comfortable with this change, it's bringing them  something. I'm saying it's possible to do it.    [Venter] The time has caught you, Mr. Mbeki, I'm sorry. Mr.  Botha has a two-minute response.    [Botha] The fact of the matter is that South Africa, this  bad place, this bad place is producing 40 percent of the GDP of  sub-Saharan Africa consisting of 42 countries with a total  population of 500 million. The fact of the matter is that the  economy of this country is the envy of the whole of Africa. The  fact of the matter is that when General Obasanjo, a Nigerian  leader who landed here for the first time, and he flew the  helicopter over Pretoria, Witwatersrand area, when I greeted  him, he said to me: I am suffering from shock, I am suffering  from shock. I didn't know such a wonderful industrial area  existed south of the Sahara. The fact of the matter is that ANC  members who go to other parts of Africa can confirm this. They  can confirm that this country is the hope of Africa. Africa  wants us to succeed. Africa said we have achieved so much, and  the fact of the matter is the removal of apartheid alone will  not bring stability and economic growth. Only sound policies  and being in line with the industrialized economies of the world  today, and this the National Party can do, and only the National  Party can do this. That is why government delegations one after  the other say to me, unless the National Party continues to have  a decisive role and a strong position after the election, South  Africa will not attract any investment. That is a simple fact.  [applause]    [Venter] Allow Mr. Mbeki a minute's comment, please.    [Mbeki] The fact of the matter is that we have in this  country a higher infant mortality rate than Botswana has. It is  a fact of the matter. The fact of the matter is that Zimbabwe  has got more black engineers than we have here. That is a fact  of the matter. The fact of the matter is that this economy. with  all the potential that it has, has produced, I was saying, at  least 5 million unemployed people [laughter]. I wouldn't  consider that a success. I think it is failure. It has got  potential. Despite what the National Party has done, despite  what the National Party has done. It has the things that the  minister says it does, because, in reality, this economy is much  larger than any of these other economies.    [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. Mr. Botha, could you wrap  that up?    [Botha] I would just like to give the facts as they exist:  adult literacy rate for sub-Saharan Africa 45 percent, South  Africa 76 percent; life expectancy at birth -- sub-Saharan  African 52 years, South Africa 63 years; infant mortality  rate--sub-Saharan Africa 107, South Africa 56. The fact is that  we have not made 5 million unemployed. Across the world, you  have world tides of recession, etc. The fact of the matter is  we have 2 million citizens from our neighboring countries that  have flocked to this country for jobs, for training, for  education, for a better life. If we have to send back those 2  million, we would virtually have no unemployment problem. The  fact of the matter is the world and Africa is waiting for this  country to produce a success story. The world opinion today is  that the National Party and President de Klerk is essential if  South Africa is to survive. They are essential to play a  decisively important role in the next election and that is why  the people, particularly the black people, must vote for  President de Klerk. That will ensure for them a better (?life).  [jeers]    [Modise] Thank you again, and right now the opportunity to  ask the next question goes to Mr. Leslie Mashokwe of NEWSLINE,  and the question to Mr. Botha.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Botha, you narrated the occurrence of  violence  in this country and you were stating categorically that the  National Party was not involved in that. The question is: Which  government is in place? Is it the National Party government  whose police generals are now implicated in third force  activities by the Goldstone Commission. Who is in charge of the  security process in South Africa. It would appear that whilst  you are busy wooing votes from black people you forget that they  are important and they need to be protected, seemingly you would  want dead bodies to vote for you. That is how your political  foes regards your views with regards to this.    [Botha] I'm very glad you put this question because I think  it is a question uppermost in the minds of many of our people,  particularly our black brothers. The fact of the matter  is....[laughter] No, but this is a serious matter, and if you  are really seriously concerned, you will heed Mr. Mbeki's appeal  and mine. The commission found and said it would like to stress  that the persons named in this report have not been found guilty  of the allegations made against them. Not me saying it, Judge  Goldstone. The evidence, much of it strong remains prima facie  until proven by a normal judicial process, but then commission  went on to say this: The commission earnestly appeals to all  South Africans to recognize and appreciate that as serious as  the alleged misconduct by some members of the SAP may be, there  are over 100,000 members of the police force, without the  courage and honesty of Majors van Vuuren and du Plessis,  Brigadier Schoeman and Colonel Piet Botha -- not all the Botha's  are that bad [laughter] -- the commission would have been unable  to discover the evidence pointing to the network of criminal  activity. In other words, what I am saying is: there is only  one police force. The majority are not white policemen. We are  not going to have two police forces. And I am saying here this  evening, I appeal, like the judge, let us not, because of a  report implicating and not yet proving, not yet proving in the  words of the judge, condemning the whole police force. They are  there to protect all of us, and this is what the judge said and  I want to emphasize that here this evening -- we have been  demoralizing the police by doing this sort of general accusation  and condemnation of the South African Police. [applause]    [Modise] Thank you, Mr. Botha, and now two minutes response  to Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] The problem is implied in the question. The problem  is that government has not done what it is supposed to do. The  government today was supposed to issue an instruction that the  police would set up roadblocks so that nobody comes in the  Johannesburg city center carrying weapons. That was not done.  [jeers] People occupy stadia in order to block meetings from  taking place. The government does not say: Please go and  remove those people so that we can have a climate of free  political activity. It doesn't happen. Yes, indeed, yes,  indeed, we are quite certain, very many police, people -- men  and women -- very many members of the South African Defense  Force are very conscious of their duties and very committed to  ensuring that this change take place, but what happens, day in  and day out is that the government does not discharge its  responsibilities to protect this process of a peaceful  transition to a democratic South Africa. It doesn't give the  proper direction. It doesn't give the necessary instructions.  It does not support this honest Botha in the police. [laughter]  And that's the failure. And there's a real, real serious  problem: The third force issue that we raised for many years  was denied by government: No it doesn't exist. As a result of  this government did not move when it should have moved. Then we  would not have had this crisis. That's the problem. [applause]    [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki, and a minute to Mr. Botha.    [Botha] I am afraid I totally disagree. This is again  typical of the ANC blaming everybody else. The common  denominator in all violent activities in this country is the  ANC. It is the ANC and APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army].  It is the ANC and DP. It is the ANC and Inkatha. Always, the  common denominator is the ANC. The fact of the matter is they  have a responsibility, and I think this evening the minister  declared 10 districts in Johannesburg to be under unrest areas.  The moment he wants to do that, the ANC is against it. The  police does need certain powers, but we must act in terms now of  the TEC legislation. Every time the police needs additional  powers it is denied them. Why are these powers denied? It is  because the ANC sees some sinister motive in some of these  additional powers. And you may well reach the stage where we  may have to give far more powers to the police, but then it must  be done in terms of the TEC.    [Venter] Mr. Botha, thank you very much. Your minute is up.  And this time, an opportunity to Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] Part of the problem with this discussion is the  minister is avoiding the specifics. What I am saying, having  discussed this matter yesterday with the government about what  was likely to happen in Johannesburg today and having agreed  that roadblocks would be put and people searched so that they  could come and demonstrate without weapons -- why was it not  done? Having discussed all matters of things for government to  say: There must be free political activity. People must not  occupy stadia with guns. They must be stopped. Why is it not  done? I am saying that any number of specific instances where  there has been failure of government -- as a result of which  people have died, and that is reality.    [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. Well, a final question then  from Freek Robinson of Agenda to Mr. Mbeki.    [Robinson] Mr. Mbeki, my first question: I have tried to  come  down to the underlying reasons for the violence and it is clear  to all of us basically that this political framework in which we  operate, including the basis for the elections and the basis of  the government in the next two years after the election, it is  something that is contested by other people. There are many  fears among the smaller parties, in particular about the  constitution and what might happen after the elections. The  fear is that you might win the election convincingly, even with  a two-thirds majority, and that you might scrap the interim  constitution completely. Can you give me a clear indication  tonight what exactly is it that you would like to change in that  constitution, delete, or add to it?    [Mbeki] The first thing that I need to say, Freek, is that  the ANC, with regard to these constitutional matters that you  raised, the ANC is bound by two documents which were agreed in  the multiparty negotiations. One of them is the Declaration of  Intent that was agreed right at the beginning of this multiparty  process. We are bound by that document. Secondly, there are  constitutional principles which are contained in the interim  constitution. The ANC is bound by those principles. What do  they do? That first document and the second one, they spell out  a united, democratic, nonracial, nonfascist South Africa,  entrenched human rights for everybody, regular elections, a  multiparty political system, an independent judiciary, all of  these questions. That is what they spell out, all of these  provisions. That is what the ANC bound to. Now, the interim  constitution that we have is a product of the process of  negotiations. It does not reflect, necessarily, ANC views, but  I am saying that the ANC would be bound to those basic  principles. It would also be bound to the notion that we need  to take the country, not just ANC supporters and ANC members,  that is to draft a constitution, it must be based on acceptance  by the majority of the people in the country, so that, even if  the ANC got a two-thirds majority it would want to proceed in a  manner that takes national consensus. Clearly, there are many  things in the constitution that need to be looked at. There  have been many debates about many issues. There is an  outstanding debate....    [Venter, interrupting] Thanks, Mr. Mbeki. I am sorry, Mr.  Botha now has a two-minute reply to it.    [Botha] I am aware of the fears, the concerns, particularly  the smaller parties and of certain communities, and not  necessarily white communities, also black communities of this  country. They say to us openly at times: We were ANC. We know  them. But fact of the matter is we believe it is a good  constitution, and all constitutions the world over, it is not  the end of constitutional development. As far as I am  concerned, it is beginning of the new era. That is what 27  April means and I have the firm belief that the international  community, this new world order, with its new conditions, will  simply not allow the future South African Government, and we are  going to be part of that government, not because of favoritism  but that is the agreement between us and the [laughter] -- no  but it's a fact -- we are going to be part of it and a strong  part of it because a vast number of black people are of the  conviction, yes, they would like to vote for the ANC, I say this  openly, but they also say: But then the National Party must be  part. An overwhelming majority of black South Africans want a  government of national unity in this country and this is  important, but the constitution, basically, is a good  constitution. It is a reasonable constitution. It does  recognize a federal system and it does make it possible for all  the provinces to retain a large measure of autonomy and to be  federal states and to preclude the interference of the central  government in those matters which have been allocated to the  provinces. This is how we must start. There is no other way.  We must now go into the elections, test our relative support  and start the new South Africa so that we can get investments on  condition that the National Party is still part of the  government.    [Venter] Sorry, to cut you off Mr. Botha. Mr. Mbeki, you  have a one-minute reply.    [Mbeki] As far as the small parties are concerned, we have  throughout this process made sure that they were party to these  decisions. The whole multiparty process has involved them. If  you look at, for instance, what is now called the ANC election  list you'll see many small parties there and part of the reason  they are there is so that we can ensure that they are  represented in Parliament. If they stood on their own they  would not win, but precisely to make sure that their voice is  heard we put them on our own list. So I am saying the ANC --  Mr. Pik Botha is correct, the National Party will be a minority  party. [laughter] But we are saying that never mind that it is a  minority party, it ought to be part of this new government  because it is important that they make a contribution on the  construction of this new South Africa.    [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. Mr. Botha, you have one  minute to close the issue.    [Botha] I sincerely believe that the best thing that can  happen to South Africa is that there should be no majority party  after the elections, that all of us must not only be -- if I may  put it this way -- be forced by the constitution to form a  government of national unity. But it must always be the choice  of the majority of South Africans that there should not be one  strong dominating political party, and that is why I say again:  There is only one way to achieve that in the elections and that  is to vote for the National Party and to ensure that this  country will not be dominated. But I do not share those fears.  As I said before, the new world order will not allow the future  South African Government, in my opinion, to do as it likes.  What is the danger is that irresponsible elements within the  ANC might exercise too strong an influence in the ANC.    [Venter] Mr. Botha, thank you very much. That closes off the  question section of this debate. Thank you. [applause]    [Modise] Well, obviously, very enthusiastic members of the  political parties who are here tonight. Right now, we are  coming to the end of the program. We are giving the  opportunity, a three-minute opportunity to Mr. Thabo Mbeki to  make a statement on various issues that he feels need to be  known.    [Mbeki] Well, I really need to say this that, as I was  saying  at the beginning, the country is faced with a great opportunity  and a great challenge. We understand the heats that gets  developed around election campaigns, but we believe that it is  the common responsibility of everybody, who in the country  consider themselves a leader of any significant section of the  population of our country, to approach these matters in a  responsible manner. We do indeed believe that we need to  develop a national consensus around a number of basic issues.  One of those issues has to be that it is a right of every South  African to vote, to elect a government of their choice.  Therefore, it cannot be permitted that there is somebody out  there who considers themselves part of a leader of some people  who wants to block that process. I think the country needs to  unite to say nobody should be blocked from exercising that  democratic right to decide what government they want. That is  an important thing. The question of violence. The question of  violence is important. We need all of us, I am saying again, to  act together to resolve this matter so that the ANC has the  responsibility to say to its own members: This is not allowed.  Any other party that is involved needs to do the same thing,  but also the government.    The government needs to approach this matter to resolve the  issue and not tie it to party political advantage, to say it is  always the ANC and the IFP that are fighting if they meet and so  on. Why are the police allowed to watch as people are killing  themselves, simply because this matter is defined as party  political. There is an intervention by government that has to  be made. I am saying that is a common national responsibility,  wherever the violence comes from, whether from the ANC people or  whoever, that we must all of us act very firmly and decisively  to address this issue. I think, finally, I do not know what my  time is like, I think it is fundamentally wrong, fundamentally  wrong to say of an organization, like the ANC, that it's a  demon. It is the same ANC that has stood for nonracialism, for  democracy, and all of these things which must bring the majority  of the people of this country into the settlement, to turn round  and say they are a demon, because what you are doing, you are  creating a situation where we will not be able to resolve the  problems of this country. If you take that attitude toward the  ANC, you will then get that demon. I think it is  irresponsible...    [Venter, interrupting] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much. Mr.  Botha a similar three minutes. Thank you.    [Botha] It is quite clear to me that South Africans have a  stark choice to make on 27 April, a stark choice between those  parties, and particularly the ANC that finds itself in alliance  with the wrong party, an ANC that cannot discipline its own  followers -- cannot control them during mass actions, an ANC who  allows individuals to attack the industrialized nations of the  world, to attack the industrialized economies of the world, and  to say derogatory things about the IMF and the World Bank  because in the new world order that is coming the ANC would have  no choice -- and Mr. Mbeki quite rightly, earlier on, about  specifics -- the whole issue of the mineral rights that must be  restored to the state of the people -- I wonder whether the ANC  realizes what that has done to the economy of this country and  to investment of this country. I want to warn the ANC: A  government cannot run a mine. Stay out of it, but in the end I  am encouraged by the news that there might soon be a meeting  between President de Klerk, Mr. Mandela, the king of the Zulus,  and Dr. Buthelezi, and that I see that in the spirit in which  Mr. Mbeki offered -- with that I agree. We are all South  Africans. We only have one South Africa. Let us come to peace  with ourselves and let us pray that these four leaders will find  a way to reduce the tension that has been created in this  country and let us pray for that and hope and hold thumbs that  that meeting will be successful. We all need it. We have only  one country and we are going to share it and history will  condemn all of us if we do not share this responsibly. There, I  agree with my friend and colleague, Mr. Mbeki.    [Venter] Thanks to Mr. Pik Botha there. Before we leave the  debate, we are going to ask each of the candidates for a quick  impression of the discussions we have just had, starting with  Mr. Mbeki.    [Mbeki] Well, Lester I think we should say congratulations  to  the SABC for affording this kind of opportunity. I don't think  there is sufficient time given for real debate. I hope that it  would be possible to organize so that we do indeed have real  debate, so that I talk to my friend Pik Botha there, so, instead  of promoting the National Party, actually debates issues.    [Venter] Thank you very much, Mr. Mbeki. Can we come back to  Mr. Botha, please?    [Botha] I am glad this could take place in that we could  openly canvass our views, but perhaps, I don't know, perhaps we  should do it in a more relaxed atmosphere. I do not want to  reduce the enthusiasm of the audience, but I think we tend to  lose some of the value of arguments on both sides if the two  speakers cannot really be heard. It is not a complaint. And  then lastly, those who are supporters of the National Party  please drive carefully home. Those who are not, who am I to  tell you how to drive.    [Venter] Thank you very much for participating, Mr. Mbeki  and  Mr. Botha.    [Modise] And before we say good night the leaders of the two  parties, the National Party and the African National Congress,  Mr. F.W. De Klerk and Mr. Nelson Mandela will meet in a debate  similar to this one on 14 April.    [Venter] Don't miss that. Good night.     "

0,FT934-7973 ,"FT934-7973 _AN-DKWCOAGWFT 931117   FT  17 NOV 93 / Moi under fire over tribal violence      By LESLIE CRAWFORD      NAIROBI   AFRICA WATCH, the human rights group, yesterday warned that ethnic conflict in Kenya could degenerate into civil war unless President Daniel arap Moi's government took immediate steps to end the violence, Leslie Crawford writes from Nairobi. In a report on Kenya*, Africa Watch accuses the government of instigating tribal clashes in which 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes since the advent of the multi-party system in 1991. 'There is clear evidence that the government was involved in provoking this ethnic violence for political purposes and has taken no adequate steps to prevent it from spiralling out of control,' the report says. 'The conflict has been deliberately manipulated and instigated by President Moi and his inner circle and has undermined attempts to create an atmosphere conducive to political pluralism in Kenya.' 'The culture of violence that is taking root has made real the alarming possibility of civil war in Kenya,' the report says. The majority of the victims of the ethnic clashes are peasant farmers of the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are distrusted by President Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority tribes. The report comes at an embarrassing time for Kenya, which is due to meet donors next week to discuss the restoration of financial aid. Although President Moi recently announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) programme to resettle displaced victims, co-sponsored by the UN Development Programme, Africa Watch urges Kenya's donors to continue withholding aid until the government takes effective steps to curb the violence. 'These steps should include, at a minimum, the full and public investigation of allegations of the involvement of government officials in the violence, and the bringing of charges where there is evidence of wrongdoing,' it says. *Divide and Rule: state-sponsored ethnic violence in Kenya, published by Africa Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10017-6104, tel: 1 212 972 8400.

Mr.  de Klerk said he was open to negotiations to reach agreement for  implementation after the elections.    Mr. de Klerk said he was disappointed with the Freedom  Alliance's actions regarding the amendments proposed by the  government to break the constitutional deadlock. He described  the alliances' reaction as inadequate, as the government's  proposals address the core of the problems. Mr. de Klerk said  he rejected the alliance's efforts to play down the latest  amendments.     "

As a result, the United States was  compelled to further its involvement in the Korean peninsula and  China, Russia, and Japan became strongly concerned due to  further complication of the nuclear matters.    From this viewpoint, the situation in the Korean peninsula  can be described as a grandiose diplomatic war between the South  and North and the Big Four to build a new order of stability in  the peninsula with the nuclear problem as their keyword.    The United States is steadily making preparations for when  sanctions may be imposed with the cooperation of Japan and the  ROK with a proposition of ""nuclear nonproliferation."" But the  positive fact that must not be overlooked is that none of the  parties, South and North Korea, the United States, China,  Russia, or Japan, want sanctions imposed. It is their true  intention to evade the situation that goes against building a  new order.    According to diplomatic sources, the present position of the  United States, the ROK, and Japan that they would ""impose  sanctions if necessary"" is a policy to apply pressure on the  DPRK to become more flexible and it is thought to be a  considerably long time before actual sanctions would take place.  How are South and North Korea and the four other nations going  to deal with the dangerous factor of nuclear problems and of  building a new stability?

Within the coming five years the Federal  Ministry of Research will provide about DM100 million for  speeding up utilization of the results of gene research. Paul  Krueger, Federal Minister of Research, announces that the  emphasis in the new research program, ""Methods of Decoding and  Utilizing Biological Building Charts,"" is on development of  therapies against diseases.    This program is designed, above all, to stimulate the use of  exceptionally- high-capacity computers and automated techniques  in analytical procedures for decoding genes as carriers which  carry heredity information and thus the important life's  important building blocks. Genome research should help make it  increasingly possible to put medicine, the pharmaceutic  industry, and agriculture on a new scientific basis. An example  of successful genetically engineered production of drugs is the  ""Factor 8"" against hemophilia, which until now had to be  isolated from human blood.    According to expert estimates, over 4000 diseases at least  can be traced to defects in biological building charts.  Ernst-Ludwig Winnaker, director of the Genetics Center in  Munich, reports that German researchers had played a substantial  role in identifying the genetic causes of various diseases such  as muscular ones and chorea, also heart and blood circulation  diseases, and intestinal cancer.    Krueger points out that the U.S., Japanese, British, and  French industries are already heavily engaged in this  prospective field. This, in the opinion of specialists, requires  that the licensing procedure be shortened. Looking at the soon  to be amended Genetic Engineering Law, Axel Kleemann of the  Pharmaceutic Works in Dresden has pointed out that it is not  sufficient to correct the law but also the new rules must be  better implemented.

A report from Harare said this was the first increase in  salaries of the president and his ministers since 1992, when all  increments were suspended due to a severe drought that left half  the country's population of 10 million dependent on imported  food. Mr. Mugabe got the largest increase of 64 percent,  pushing his annual salary to 17,560 U.S. dollars, plus housing  and other allowances of 6,829 dollars a year. An average  Zimbabwean worker is paid about 900 dollars a year. Mr. Mugabe  also does not pay income tax. Mr. Mugabe's two vice-presidents  received 60 percent increases and sharply increased housing and  general allowances.    Ministers received a 30-percent increase in salaries, plus  allowances which rose by nearly 90 percent, while the salaries  of Members of Parliament were raised by nearly 50 percent.     "

One particular offering that Japanese officials have been preparing for their premier to bring - an aid and trade package worth as much as Dollars 1.3bn for South Africa's new democratic government - may assume added significance as a signal of Japan's desire to be a good world citizen in spite of the country's internal political upheavals. This will focus on investment projects linked to the reconstruction and development programme set out by the all-race Pretoria government in sectors such as telecommunications, medical and educational facilities. It will pave the way for Japanese companies to reinvest in South Africa at a time when their funds will be welcomed as an indicator of confidence. Last week an official Japanese mission flew to Johannesburg to seek out aid targets. The Tokyo foreign ministry yesterday declined to confirm the figures, but if the package is on the lines of that planned by the previous government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, it could comprise some Dollars 300m in official development assistance, up to Dollars 500m in Eximbank loans and a further Dollars 500m in trade and investment insurance cover over the next two years. The Japanese corporate sector rapidly reined back when the ministry of international trade and industry had to confess at the height of the sanctions era in the late 1980s that Japan had suddenly emerged as white-run South Africa's leading trading partner - ahead of countries such as Germany which had previously headed the rankings. In the same way, private enterprise may now follow the Tokyo government's lead in rebuilding ties with the country under President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress-led government of national unity. Part of the new aid will anyway be tied to trade with Japanese companies. Japan is currently South Africa's fourth largest trading partner as the high value of the yen has continued to push Japanese multinationals towards production abroad, but there have so far been few signs that Japanese companies are ready to invest heavily in South Africa. Licensing agreements largely maintained a Japanese presence in South Africa through the sanctions era and in some cases for many years before. The question now is whether Japanese companies, which until now have been content to provide parts and brand names to local manufacturing units in which they have no equity stake, are willing to contemplate closer operational or shareholding links. No big rush looks likely. One prime example is Toyota South Africa, the country's biggest car maker, a family-controlled company quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in which Toyota of Japan has no direct holding. It obtained franchise rights to use the Toyota name as far back as 1961 and has imported components ever since - currently representing some 35 per cent by value of vehicles produced. In the same way, Mazda vehicles are produced by Samcor, controlled by Anglo-American, the country's leading conglomerate. The automotive sector is overcrowded and Mr Peter Arthur, a partner at Webber Wentzel, a Johannesburg law firm which has recently acted for several multinationals investing in the country, says that 'we are not seeing new motor manufacturers coming in'. Toyota of Japan said yesterday it had no plans to take a stake in Toyota South Africa which 'is and will remain a completely independent local company'. But in Johannesburg recently Mr Brand Pretorius, managing director of the local operation, said it was 'essential for our company to become part of the global Toyota network'. What a South African manufacturing base can offer, as never before, is a bridgehead into the African market as a whole, and to others beyond. As Japanese companies seek out lower-cost manufacturing sites to escape the high yen, they are also able further to refine their markets and target the developing world, where reliable brands carry a similar cachet but pricing needs to be keener and the product can be more basic. South Africa's high tariff regime will be eroded only gradually as a result of the phased accord the outgoing government struck with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Partly because of a lack of previous capital investment under sanctions, a lag in relative productivity also serves as a disincentive to inward investment. Japanese investments so far have centred on exploiting the country's mineral wealth. In May Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading houses, became the first Japanese company to invest in South Africa since Mr Mandela's election when it bought a modest 1 per cent stake in Associate Manganese Mines. Last year the rival Mitsubishi Corporation advanced a Dollars 28m loan to Western Platinum for mining development and Nippon Denko, an offshoot of Nippon Steel, linked with the local NST Ferrochrome to produce high-carbon alloys for the Japanese market. Beyond the mining sector, Marubeni Corporation established a joint telecoms venture with the British-linked Plessey Tellumat. But in all, just 30 Japanese companies have offices in South Africa compared with 130 US groups. And most show no immediate desire to expand. As a Sumitomo official in Tokyo puts it, 'South Africa is a very distant, very unfamiliar country, not just for us but for most Japanese companies. We remain very cautious about major commitments.'

The U.S. Government has suggested that financial services,  glass, intellectual property, lumber, and antitrust policy and  deregulation be added to the list of priority areas for  negotiations.    Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging  framework, are government procurement of telecommunications and  medical equipment, insurance, and autos and auto parts.    The sources said the Japanese Government will basically  accept the U.S. proposal, except for lumber.    The proposal was made during vice ministerial-level talks in  Washington which led to the reopening of the framework  negotiations.    The trade framework talks were agreed last July as a means  of  reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus with the U.S., but hit a  snag in February this year due to a discord over a U.S. demand  for ""objective criteria"" to gauge the openness of the Japanese  market.    The two countries agreed to reopen the talks Tuesday.    Of the five categories, which were all included in the  original framework, negotiations over deregulation concern  Japanese regulations over distribution.    The U.S. had suggested by February more than 40 items of  changes in Japanese policies on deregulation and antitrust law.    For financial services, Japan has been asked to deregulate  management of pension and pension funds.    The U.S. also wants Japan to make efforts to increase the  share of foreign products in the Japanese sheet glass market.    Japan also has been pressed to harmonize its patents  protection system with the U.S. patent system to prevent copying  by Japanese firms of U.S.-made computer software.     "

In the first speech by a secretary of state exclusively devoted to Africa policy since the end of the cold war, Mr Warren Christopher said the US-led effort, in which it expected co-operation from others in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, would begin once a transitional executive council has been put in place and a firm date for elections set. Before that, Mr Christopher went on: 'We have urged the World Bank and the parties in South Africa to begin planning now the projects that will lead to economic growth.' He hoped US businesses would be in the vanguard of investment in South Africa. He had special praise for both Mr Nelson Mandela and President F W de Klerk for the 'monumental achievement' of making free and fair elections possible. 'That election will echo around the African continent and across the world as a roaring triumph of human rights,' he said. Mr Christopher placed his commitment to assist the South African economy firmly in the context of the promotion of democracy throughout the continent. 'That is why President Clinton chose to invite the first president of a democratic Namibia, Sam Nujoma, as the first African head of state to be recognised at his White House.' Elsewhere in his speech, he bluntly referred to President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as an example of 'corrupt dictators' but he singled out no other African autocrat, preferring instead to praise unnamed 'courageous democrats' from Senegal to Benin and Madagascar to Mali, and to warn that 'the US will take human rights into account as we determine how to allocate our scarce resources for foreign assistance'. The Christopher speech, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Africa-America Institute, was to have been the stage for announcing US recognition of the former Marxist government of Angola. That, however, was pre-empted by Mr Clinton earlier last week.  ANC leader Nelson Mandela ended a two-day visit to Natal province yesterday, urging an end to conflict between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, Reuter reports. At least 8,000 people have been killed in clashes between the groups in Natal since 1986. Mr Mandela's plea came a day after at least 13 people were killed in clashes between ANC supporters, Inkatha hostel dwellers and police in Thokoza township, east of Johannesburg. The ANC and Inkatha both demanded a judicial inquest into the killings. Mr Mandela also said the date for the first all-race elections would be announced before the end of this month. The 26 parties to multi-party talks have already agreed the poll will take place no later than April next year and have been debating a precise date. ANC activists devised a plan to rescue Mr Mandela from Robben Island prison in 1981 in a basket dangling from a helicopter, but the attempt was called off by ANC leaders in exile because it was too risky, Reuter reports. Mr Mandela was freed in February 1990 after 27 years' detention.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     USZ  United States of America.

0," FR940503-1-00070   FR940503-1-00012        For foreign refiners, EPA considered whether it should also require that all foreign refiners establish individual baselines before they could import either conventional or simple model reformulated gasoline into the U.S. However, as discussed later, EPA had considerable doubt about the ability of baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately predict the quality of that portion of a foreign refiner's production sent to the U.S. in 1990. EPA believed many foreign refiners would therefore not be able to use these models, and mandating use of an individual baseline might therefore lead to a ban on importation of gasoline from those foreign refiners not able to develop such baselines.    6     In addition, EPA had serious questions whether it could adequately verify the accuracy of individual baselines for foreign refiners under such a scenario. The current Final Rule resolves these concerns by not allowing foreign refiners to establish individual baselines, and regulating the introduction of gasoline into the U.S. through the importer. Importers must establish an individual baseline in the manner described above.               6     EPA considered the option of banning foreign supplies of gasoline that were not produced under a verifiably accurate individual baseline. This option appeared to redress the issue of the loss of a ``netting out'' effect due to the presumed loss of ``cleaner'' than statutory baseline foreign gasoline. However, EPA believes that many foreign refiners do not possess adequate data to establish an individual baseline. It has been agreed that the consequence of banning foreign supplies of gasoline, both to the nation's energy security and to competitive pricing, would be unfair.            The air quality impact of allowing foreign refiners a choice in what baseline to use, such as would result from the petition process proposed today, depends in large part on which foreign refiners ultimately would have the ability, and would choose, to produce reformulated gasoline for importation into the U.S., and on the individual baselines of those foreign refiners who would make this choice. If a significant number of foreign refiners sent gasoline to the U.S. in 1990 that was cleaner than the statutory baseline, those refiners would not be expected to choose to establish an individual baseline but would instead default to the statutory baseline. Refiners who sent gasoline to the U.S. in 1990 that was dirtier than the statutory baseline might well decide to petition for an individual baseline, assuming they could satisfy all of the conditions for establishing an individual baseline. In such a case, this might result in certain foreign refiners being allowed to degrade the emissions performance of their gasoline down from its actual 1990 quality to the statutory baseline. Under this approach other foreign refiners might be allowed to establish accurate and verifiable individual baselines that are dirtier than the statutory baseline, and thereby continue to produce at this quality.     In comparison, the current regulatory provisions provide foreign refiners with no choice. As described above, foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline may degrade the quality of their gasoline down to the statutory baseline, while foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was dirtier than the statutory baseline are required to reformulate to meet the stricter statutory baseline.     It is important to note that EPA does not have any clear evidence as to the actual average quality of gasoline imported into the U.S. in 1990. EPA does not know, for example, whether a significant amount of such gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline. While it would be reasonable to assume that at least some imported gasoline was cleaner and some was dirtier than the statutory baseline, EPA is not in a position to quantify this in any reliable manner. As such, it is not clear whether or how much providing foreign refiners with an option in establishing an individual baseline would actually skew the air quality impacts of these programs in a negative direction.   As mentioned above, a second major issue EPA has considered involves the technical limits of Methods 1, 2 or 3 in predicting the qualities of that portion of a foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline production that was sent to the U.S.    7     Foreign refiners likely did not send the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Foreign refiners may not have exported the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Domestic refiners, on the other hand, are assumed to have distributed (and to continue to distribute) the majority of their gasoline within the U.S. In the absence of actual 1990 data, domestic refiners may calculate individual baselines using models developed by EPA that depend, in part, on the fact that the majority of the modelled gasoline is distributed in the U.S. However, foreign refiners typically did not distribute the majority of their 1990 gasoline within the U.S., rendering the models inappropriate for those refiners.    8                   7     These technical limits have important implications for the first issue discussed above. For example, if EPA required that foreign refiners establish individual baselines, without providing any choice on defaulting to the statutory baseline, then many foreign refiners might not be able to develop such baselines and EPA would confront a situation involving whether or not it should ban the importation of gasoline from such foreign refiners.                8     EPA believes it is possible that in certain limited situations a foreign refiner may be able to establish a baseline of U.S.-market gasoline quality and quantity. For example, a foreign refiner potentially could establish that in 1990 its refinery produced only a limited number of gasoline blending components, and therefore could be capable of producing only a predictable and limited number of gasoline types from these blending components. In such a case, it is possible that a baseline could be established based on the ``cleanest'' of the gasoline types, without actually showing that this was the gasoline supplied to the U.S. market. Under this approach, the foreign refiner's baseline would be the most rigorous baseline possible given the refinery configuration.                 "," FR940503-1-00070   FR940503-1-00012        For foreign refiners, EPA considered whether it should also require that all foreign refiners establish individual baselines before they could import either conventional or simple model reformulated gasoline into the U.S. However, as discussed later, EPA had considerable doubt about the ability of baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately predict the quality of that portion of a foreign refiner's production sent to the U.S. in 1990. EPA believed many foreign refiners would therefore not be able to use these models, and mandating use of an individual baseline might therefore lead to a ban on importation of gasoline from those foreign refiners not able to develop such baselines.    6     In addition, EPA had serious questions whether it could adequately verify the accuracy of individual baselines for foreign refiners under such a scenario. The current Final Rule resolves these concerns by not allowing foreign refiners to establish individual baselines, and regulating the introduction of gasoline into the U.S. through the importer. Importers must establish an individual baseline in the manner described above.               6     EPA considered the option of banning foreign supplies of gasoline that were not produced under a verifiably accurate individual baseline. This option appeared to redress the issue of the loss of a ``netting out'' effect due to the presumed loss of ``cleaner'' than statutory baseline foreign gasoline. However, EPA believes that many foreign refiners do not possess adequate data to establish an individual baseline. It has been agreed that the consequence of banning foreign supplies of gasoline, both to the nation's energy security and to competitive pricing, would be unfair.            The air quality impact of allowing foreign refiners a choice in what baseline to use, such as would result from the petition process proposed today, depends in large part on which foreign refiners ultimately would have the ability, and would choose, to produce reformulated gasoline for importation into the U.S., and on the individual baselines of those foreign refiners who would make this choice. If a significant number of foreign refiners sent gasoline to the U.S. in 1990 that was cleaner than the statutory baseline, those refiners would not be expected to choose to establish an individual baseline but would instead default to the statutory baseline. Refiners who sent gasoline to the U.S. in 1990 that was dirtier than the statutory baseline might well decide to petition for an individual baseline, assuming they could satisfy all of the conditions for establishing an individual baseline. In such a case, this might result in certain foreign refiners being allowed to degrade the emissions performance of their gasoline down from its actual 1990 quality to the statutory baseline. Under this approach other foreign refiners might be allowed to establish accurate and verifiable individual baselines that are dirtier than the statutory baseline, and thereby continue to produce at this quality.     In comparison, the current regulatory provisions provide foreign refiners with no choice. As described above, foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline may degrade the quality of their gasoline down to the statutory baseline, while foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was dirtier than the statutory baseline are required to reformulate to meet the stricter statutory baseline.     It is important to note that EPA does not have any clear evidence as to the actual average quality of gasoline imported into the U.S. in 1990. EPA does not know, for example, whether a significant amount of such gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline. While it would be reasonable to assume that at least some imported gasoline was cleaner and some was dirtier than the statutory baseline, EPA is not in a position to quantify this in any reliable manner. As such, it is not clear whether or how much providing foreign refiners with an option in establishing an individual baseline would actually skew the air quality impacts of these programs in a negative direction.   As mentioned above, a second major issue EPA has considered involves the technical limits of Methods 1, 2 or 3 in predicting the qualities of that portion of a foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline production that was sent to the U.S.    7     Foreign refiners likely did not send the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990.

The news conference devoted to the signing of a package of  bilateral agreements on space cooperation between Russia and the  United States by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and  U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.    The documents confirm Russia's participation in the project  to build an international orbiting station Alpha which is  expected to go into service in the beginning of the next  century. The project also involves the European Space Agency,  Japan and Canada. The 20-year project will provide with jobs  about 60,000 to 70,000 people and will cost 400 million U.S.  dollars.    This is the largest and most impressive project ever, Goldin  said. Additionally, Russia's participation will help reduce the  time needed to bring the first module into orbit by two years,  he added.    Yuriy Koptev, director-general of the Russian Space Agency,  told ITAR-TASS that the project will also allow Russian  enterprises to test the most advanced technologies and raise  international cooperation in space research to a new height.  Speaking about the content of the project, Koptev said that two  mission control centres will be engaged to monitor the station  flight, one in Houston, Texas, U.S., and the other one in the  city of Kaliningrad outside Moscow. Russian specialists will be  working in the United States while their American colleagues  will come to Russia.    Koptev also said that a contract has been signed to conduct  joint work under the project between 1994-1997. He said an  agreement will be signed next week to determine all basic  characteristics of technical means to be used within the project  framework.     "

0,FT921-4091 ,"FT921-4091 _AN-CCKB6AEEFT 920311   FT  11 MAR 92 / South African business swings behind a 'yes' vote      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICANS are wild about cricket, and ecstatic about their team's recent triumphs in the World Cup. But instead of hailing victory, yesterday's South African newspapers carried an advert picturing an overgrown cricket field with broken wickets and a torn ball. The message: a 'no' vote in next week's referendum will mean that South Africa will again be shut out of international sport. 'Without reform, South Africa hasn't got a sporting chance.' The full-page advert was funded, not by the ruling National party, but by South African business which is spending R3.4m (Pounds 680,000) to campaign for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on political reform next Tuesday. Some two thirds of the 'yes' camp's total advertising budget is coming from businessmen who fear that their chance of returning to world markets will be sabotaged, yet again, by politics. The political liberalisation of the past two years has already made a huge difference to the lives of most white businessmen. They have been welcomed abroad, where before they were shunned; they have glimpsed a light at the end of the 40-year tunnel of apartheid isolation. Now they are terrified that a vote in favour of reintroducing apartheid will provoke unprecedented international retribution. 'A 'no' vote would be a guarantee for disaster,' says Mr P F Retief, chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, one of the largest mining houses. He has written to white employees to urge a 'yes' vote. 'If we cannot sell our production because of re-imposed sanctions, both your job and my job will be threatened. If money flees the country, interest rates will be raised even higher and the recession will deepen. Unemployment will rise further with all its consequences ..like the crime and violence we are already experiencing and this will certainly worsen,' he argues in his letter. Mr Peter Mackenzie, director of the Private Sector Referendum Fund, insists the campaign is 'non party-political'. It was launched by one of the country's largest media groups, Times Media, and has had contributions from across the white bus-iness spectrum, not to mention offers of help from black business as well. Residual suspicion of white South Africa has hampered the fund's international campaign - the Toronto Globe and Mail refused to print an advert urging expatriate South Africans in Canada to vote 'yes'. The fund also bought billboards at the World Cup cricket grounds - matches are widely televised in South Africa - and distributed pro-reform T-shirts to fans. But the billboards were withdrawn when a rival group tried to purchase advertising for the 'no' camp. Mr Mackenzie says the campaign's adverts are about to become 'more dramatic and blunt'. The toughest advert so far had an ironic twist to it, though: it showed an operating table littered with used gauze and broken needles, and the message 'without reform, South Africa won't get better'. For many whites, those are the images associated with health care in independent African countries. Many believe they can avoid such a fate by reaffirming apartheid - not by voting 'yes' for reform.

0,FT921-10161 ,"FT921-10161 _AN-CBGA3ADZFT 920207   FT  07 FEB 92 / World Bank builds bridges to S Africa / A look at Pretoria's bid for international financial respectability      By PATTI WALDMEIR   AFTER A quarter of a century's estrangement, South Africa and the World Bank are well on the way to reconciliation. Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank president, is to visit South Africa next week, his first trip to Africa since he took up the job last September. For months, World Bank officials have pursued informal contacts with the various political parties and groups in South Africa. Several teams have been to research an economy which has been virtually unknown to the Bank since lending was suspended for political reasons in 1967. Now, relations seem set to assume a higher profile. Immediate access to Bank funding is not in prospect, however. The Bank is expected to resume lending only when a multi-party interim government is in place. Even then, there will be room for disputes within the Bank's board over what constitutes an interim government. Would a multi-racial executive with only limited powers (one option) qualify for renewed access, or will the board demand more fundamental change? In practice, it seems likely that the board will follow the advice of the African National Congress on the issue. Once formal relations are restored, debate will begin in earnest over whether South Africa should qualify for heavily subsidised loans from the International Development Association (the Bank's soft loan agency which lends to the world's poorest countries), or only for the mildly concessional loans available to middle-income countries. Income per capita in South Africa, at Dollars 2,520 a year in 1990, far exceeds the limit of Dollars 740 normally imposed on IDA recipients. However the grossly unequal distribution of income between whites and blacks might mean that South Africa could be treated as a special case for soft loans. But with the IDA's funding already under serious pressure from claimants worldwide, officials in Pretoria seem resigned to doing without heavily subsidised finance. The size of any World Bank programme for South Africa would thus be determined by demand from Pretoria: how much would a new government wish to borrow, given that the terms are only mildly concessional? South Africa could benefit indirectly from IDA finance by participating in regional projects aimed at low income countries such as neighbouring Mozambique. South Africa's electricity utility, Eskom, is keen to develop a regional electricity grid and various energy projects involving South African companies are under discussion. But the recipient government in such cases would be Mozambique, not South Africa. Government officials say no project plans have yet been drawn up for South Africa itself, nor have amounts been discussed. But World Bank lending is likely to focus on education and urban development, the two areas already researched by Bank officials. With 7m people living in informal settlements countrywide - including millions in squatter shacks - urban development will be a high priority for the new government. Education, too, is in crisis, with black schools desperately overcrowded, facilities poor and teachers poorly qualified. Already, the Bank is ready to provide informal technical assistance to black South Africans, with plans afoot to train those who might be officials of a future government through the Bank's Economic Development Institute. The ANC, for its part, remains deeply suspicious of international financial institutions such as the Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with some officials adopting the rhetoric of the 1960s to condemn them as neo-imperialist organisations. But ANC officials have met previous World Bank teams, and two of the movement's senior leaders are to see Mr Preston during his visit. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), another World Bank finance affiliate, is likely to be active in the South African private sector. Once lending resumes, the IFC is expected to focus its efforts on helping non-white entrepreneurs, selling management consultancy services and setting up an 'enterprise fund' aimed at small businesses, as it has done elsewhere in Africa. Eventually, the IFC could become involved in project finance in areas such as mining and chemicals.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

They also said they oppose all acts and efforts that may  lead  to the division and dismemberment of Iraq.    The statement, meanwhile, also called upon the Iraqi  Government to lift the economic blockade and remove all  restrictions imposed upon the northern part of the country.    The participants said that the future political structure of  Iraq must be determined by the ""entire people of Iraq""  peacefully and democratically.    During the meeting, France, Britain and the United States  voiced their full support for Turkey's right of self-defense  against the violence of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party  (PKK), which has been launching attacks on public and military  targets of Turkey from their bases in Northern Iraq.    They said the territory of Iraq should not be a safe-haven  for the ""terrorists.""    Forty-eight warplanes from the U.S., Britain and France,  backed by support and transport aircraft, have been carrying out  daily patrols over northern Iraq since the Gulf war ended in  late February 1991.    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Turkish Deputy  Foreign Minister Ozdem Sanberk said turkey explained in detail  the heavy economic losses it continues to face due to the 1991  Gulf war and the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.    France, Britain and the U.S. promised to consult further for  ways and means of alleviating the heavy economic burden on  Turkey, which is trying to resume its border trade with Iraq.     "

'African economies have been typified by low skill levels, inferior infrastructure, wasteful public expenditure and ineffective institutions,' the report says. As a result, the ODA has moved the balance of British aid to Africa towards supporting economic reform programmes 'designed to improve the policy and institutional environment,' the report says. In an separate assessment of more than 200 completed projects from 1966 to 1989, the ODA also reveals that 45 per cent of the projects were either failures, or only partially successful. Evaluation reports 'highlighted the difficulty of succeeding at the project level if the policies of the developing country at sector and national level are unsatisfactory.' The ODA identifies a stark contrast with Asia, where significant problems are confronted in just 10 per cent of projects. When the value rather than the number of the problematical projects is measured, the problem is even worse. In Africa, which accounted for projects worth Pounds 324m assessed in 1989-90 and 1990-91, overruns and other 'major' problems affected projects worth about Pounds 140m - or about 42 per cent. In contrast, Asia attracted funding worth Pounds 100m, but ran into complications in just 10 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT942-12077 ,"FT942-12077 _AN-EECCXAA7FT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Next chapter unclear after fairy-tale start      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   South Africa has emerged triumphant from the most perilous stage of a revolution without precedent, and its citizens seem bemused by their achievement. After more than three hundred years of supremacy, the white minority last week finally, irrevocably and peacefully surrendered power at the ballot box to the country's black majority. The full details of this astonishing - some say miraculous - event are not yet known, for the election commission is still grappling with mountains of ballot papers. And one major obstacle which could jeopardise the prospects of a stable South Africa may yet emerge: the outcome of voting in KwaZulu/Natal, stronghold of the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Nor, at this stage, is it clear what may be the next step of the white right, whose extremists could yet destabilise South Africa with an assassin's bullet. But, as an exuberant president in the waiting, Mr Nelson Mandela celebrated the ANC's achievement at last night's victory party, taking satisfaction in a fairy-tale start to the new South Africa. And, as he pressed ahead with the critical process of reconciliation, South Africa's remarkable political metamorphosis continued. In the television studios and televised press conferences, on radio and on newspaper front-pages, one leader began assuming the mantle of power, and the other, incumbent President FW de Klerk, began shedding it. Before its eyes, South Africa watched a process unfold which has neither precedent nor parallel in Africa, and perhaps the world. Mr Mandela, never less than a monumental personality, seemed to gain further stature as the results trickled in; almost perceptibly, the aura that comes with office seemed to desert Mr de Klerk. Nothing so became the two men, and the country in their charge, than this transfer of power, which is due to to be made formal at next week's inauguration in Pretoria. 'For the first time I envy South Africans, for the first time I wish I could call myself South African,' said one hard-bitten observer of many years standing last week. He had been moved almost to tears as he watched black and white embrace at a moving ceremony that took place at midnight on Tuesday. Seldom, if ever, can the advent of democracy have been the instrument of catharthis so profound, so liberating, for rulers and ruled alike, as South Africa's unforgettable and moving experience last week. Millions suffered under apartheid. But apartheid's victims extended beyond its borders. Hundreds of thousands died in Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the front-line states in the proxy battles to defend white rule. But last week, for a precious few days, the pain of the past seems to have been eased, even thrust briefly out of mind. A truce, undeclared and unspoken, in the political fighting that has cost more than 14,000 lives over the past 10 years was broken but not spoilt by the bombs of the extreme right. In the 24 hours that ended yesterday morning, police reported that there had not been a single death from political violence. Joyous as the election was for blacks, it also became liberating for whites. As they cast their votes, many spoke of having the sense of casting off the burden of apartheid, whether or not they had supported the policy. Many were taken aback by the simple - though unprecedented  - experience of going to the polling booths, black, coloured and white, as equals, to chose a government that for the first time will reflect the will of the majority. The orange, white and blue flag of the old South Africa was lowered at centres across the land, and the new one raised while choirs sang the region's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of the official anthems of post-apartheid South Africa: Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika (God bless Africa). For black South Africans in particular it was a proud moment, but for many Afrikaners it must have been a poignant, painful one. As that flag entered the history books, the other official anthem carried across the night air, sung in Afrikaans, and no doubt giving comfort to those fearful of what the future holds: Die Stem von Suid-Afrika (At thy call we shall not falter, firm and steadfast we shall stand. At thy will to live or perish, O South Africa, dear land). Over the past week at least, most white South Africans overcame their apprehensions. And whatever may happen in the future, for a few days, South Africa has basked in the glow of pride asserted, and pride recovered.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr. Mandela had raised the question of  state intervention in Bophuthatswana with him.    President de Klerk said he had told Mr. Mandela that his  security and other advisers were keeping him fully briefed on  the situation in the homeland and that any intervention would  depend on whether the lives and property of South Africans were  in danger.

Vu Khoan was quoted as telling Kakizawa that Vietnam is  making preparations to join the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN).    He did not specify any other Asia-Pacific groupings Vietnam  is interested in joining, but Hanoi has expressed willingness to  participate in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC)  and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the  future, according to the officials.

Vietnam's relations with China are also improving, although  some problems remain, and Hanoi wants to solve those problems  through negotiations, Vu Khoan was quoted as saying.

Their wait to enter the polling booths was lightened by cheers and chanting as anti-apartheid luminaries arrived, and by a dose of spring sunshine which would not have been felt amiss in the Cape. The line, one of dozens in cities around the world yesterday, comprised visitors to London and expatriates. The all-race poll was the final step in eradicating that bleak and previously numerous third category: no one needed any longer to call themselves exiles. Although the embassy was only one of seven polling stations in the UK, nearly 8,000 voters were thought to have passed through its doors alone. One of their number was Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who pronounced the election 'a miracle - I truly believe it has been miraculous.' Afterwards, in an embassy library with walls bearing the coats of arms of colonists Dutch and British, and shelves of bound records of the white parliament since union in 1910, the 80-year-old archbishop said he would 'never ever forgive the evil of apartheid'. While branding as 'traitors' those whites who opposed change, he said a new administration, led by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, for which he had voted, 'must be a government of all South Africans.' The first South African to cast a vote yesterday, in Wellington, New Zealand, was Ms Nomaza Paintin, a niece of Mr Mandela. South Africans form one of the largest immigrant groups in New Zealand. There was an upsurge of last-minute interest among the South African community in Australia, which at some 60,000 ranks alongside that of the UK. Local newspapers there and in other countries had run advertisements on behalf of the Independent Electoral Commission publicising the poll. The 700 or so South Africans in Hong Kong turned out in such force that the consulate ran out of ballot papers. Among those who managed to vote was Ms Elizabeth Dikgale, a domestic helper who is the only Zulu resident in the colony. 'South Africa is a golden country, and now we can get back to golden times,' she said. The 20,000 or so Jewish South Africans who have emigrated to Israel find themselves caught between two peace processes, each of which has taken a heavy toll in violence. But as one in the long queue to vote at Tel Aviv Show Grounds put it: 'If the whites and blacks in South Africa can get it together, we should be able to do it here too.' Pockets of South Africans elsewhere in Africa were also able to vote, even though full diplomatic relations with much of the continent do not yet exist. The polling station for Kenya was a sports club in the outskirts of Nairobi where Mrs Nomtha Nkolombe, a 62-year-old physiotherapist who left Cape Town 30 years ago, said: 'It is an opportunity both my parents missed.' In New York, two polling stations were set up in tents on a lawn outside the United Nations building. One white voter maintained: 'Every South African I know will be voting today. This is one hell of a vote.' That much is indisputable. It was taking two to three hours in the Trafalgar Square queue yesterday to get to vote. Some, however, had been waiting all their lives.

Angry calls for intervention from Tory MPs are likely to dismay ministers, who only a few weeks ago were privately expressing relief that Rover's sale to BMW had not caused a political row. Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East), said: 'Honda has been treated shamefully. A minister should now make a public statement saying the government regrets the way the sale of Rover to BMW has been handled to alleviate the problem.' Another senior backbencher said the Department of Trade and Industry 'should start batting for Britain' by encouraging the Japanese to guarantee a long-term working relationship with Rover. However, Downing Street dismissed calls for intervention arguing that it was not a matter for the prime minister. It was made clear that Mr John Major hopes that co-operation will continue between Honda and Rover, but does not share the 'apocalyptic vision' of those who fear a speedy end to the relationship. However, Mr Simon Coombs, (Swindon) warned that a decision by Honda to sever all its links with Rover could prove very damaging. Although Honda stressed that the 2,000 jobs at its plant in Swindon would not be affected by its decision to sell its 20 per cent Rover stake, Mr Coombs said an end to joint contracts would affect many of his constituents reliant on Honda. He has already asked Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to find out why there was no British company interested in buying the country's last car volume manufacturer. There is deep unease among backbenchers that Honda's decision to sell its stake in Rover could herald the end of the relationship between the two companies. There is also concern that it could harm Britain's chances of continuing to receive the biggest share of Japanese inward investment in Europe. The UK accounts for 40 per cent of all Japanese European investment, according to government figures. 'We now know that Honda are deeply distressed' said Sir Teddy. 'If its not to have an affect on Japanese inward investment, the government must make a statement'. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry spokesman, called on ministers to live up to their promise that Rover and its workforce would not suffer from the BMW takeover. 'The danger for Rover is that customers will lose confidence and the workforce will lose morale if the uncertainty is not ended swiftly,' he said.   Companies:-  Honda Motor.     Rover Group.

The 334-page report, compiled by World Bank staff in Beijing  and Washington, said the loss of MFN trading status will have  consequences for the U.S. and China ranging ""from the dramatic  to the disastrous.""    The report said China's exports to the U.S. could be reduced  by between 42 and 96 percent, depending on how readily Chinese  exports can be substituted by others. ""American consumers will  be penalized,"" it said.    In 1992, the U.S. imported almost 27 billion dollars worth  of  goods from China, making the U.S. China's single largest trading  partner, the study said.    China's top exports to the U.S. include yarn, cotton  fabrics,  telecommunications equipment, travel goods, handbags, footwear,  watches, clocks, toys, sporting goods and clothing.    ""In actuality, the impact of MFN loss is likely to be closer  to the lower bound, but even that is a substantial dislocation  of trade,"" the bank's senior economist for China Country  Department, Rajiv Lall, said.    The report said time is right for China to significantly  liberalize its trade with such steps as reducing tariffs,  replacing import quotas and licenses with simpler taxes, and  removing remaining export control.    The U.S. first granted provisional MFN status to China in  1973. Domestic legislation in the U.S. requires the review of  China's MFN status on a yearly basis. The next such review is  expected in June.    The report said that ""complete MFN loss would lead to severe  dislocation of China's exports to the U.S.,"" at least halving,  and possibly wiping out, China's export of clothing to the U.S.     "

Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, December 1992 FOR THOSE who seek culprits to blame for Africa's deepening economic crisis, there are many candidates: the lingering legacy of the colonial era, the harsh dictates of World Bank structural adjustment programmes, the miserly aid and restrictive trade policies of developed country governments and the kleptocratic tendencies of Africa's own governing elite. So-called 'Afro-pessimists' and their gloomy appraisals make an easier target for those who are reluctant to confront the true dimensions of Africa's crisis. Yet the facts tell their own story. After a dozen years of structural adjustment and more than Dollars 170bn in net development assistance, the sub-Saharan economy is still falling behind. Incomes per head fell by an average 1.1 per cent a year between 1982 and 1992 compared to an average rise of 0.8 per cent a year in all developing countries and 6.4 per cent in the east Asia developing countries. The outlook is far from encouraging, as the accompanying articles demonstrate throughout this survey. Institutional and infrastructural decline is accelerating, the number of countries facing political disintegration is growing and the Aids crisis is deepening. The aid keeps flowing, although sub-Saharan Africa cannot be sure that its share of global aid - up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970 - will continue to rise. But Africa is increasingly cut off from the rest of the world economy - there is little evidence to suggest that either returning flight capital or foreign investment can fill the gap between Africa's capital needs and its ability to generate domestic savings. The combination of half-hearted policy reform, some debt relief, and substantial aid is expected to continue to slow the pace, rather than reverse the direction, of this relative and absolute decline. The World Bank expects African real incomes per head to rise by 0.6 per cent a year over the next decade compared to 2.9 per cent for all developing countries and 5.9 per cent in east Asia. Still, as the World Bank rightly says, the gloom can be overdone. Across the continent, human development indicators have improved over the past two decades. Infant mortality has fallen from 137 per 1,000 live births in 1973 to 107 in 1991, while life expectancy has risen from 45 years to 51 years over the same period. Progress on these social measures of quality of life was made in the 1980s despite adverse shifts in Africa's terms of trade, volatile commodity prices, persisting protectionism in OECD countries, and the doubling over 10 years in the the share of Africa's export earnings which go to service debts. Moreover, the World Bank can correctly claim that the nature of the obstacles to economic progress in Africa is now better understood. Ten years ago, African governments defended to the death fixed exchange rates, administered prices, state ownership of industry, subsidies to parastatals, cheap food for urban workers and negative real interest rates while the private sector was regarded with suspicion. Now most governments accept, at least in principle, that establishing macro-economic stability through structural adjustment policies - cutting budget deficits, slowing inflation and monetary growth, establishing a competitive exchange rate and eliminating obstacles to exports - is necessary if their economies are to achieve self-sustaining economic growth. The World Bank can point to signs of success in the handful of countries which has taken the structural adjustment advice to heart - most notably Ghana but also Uganda, Burkina Faso and until recently, Malawi - as evidence that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for progress. Since Ghana's adjustment programme began, its gross domestic product has grown by an average of 4.9 per cent a year, over twice the sub-Saharan average of 2.1 per cent. Equally powerfully, the Bank can point to the deepening recessions in the member countries of the French African Community (CFA) zone to demonstrate that governments cannot pick and mix items from the adjustment agenda. Between 1986 and 1991, cumulative losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average of 0.2 per cent a year. GDP in the other 16 African countries which the Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an average 4.5 per cent a year over the same period, compared to a fall of 0.2 per cent annually in the first half of the decade. WHY DO the economies of sub-Saharan Africa continue to perform so poorly? There are two broad explanations. First, most African governments have not been willing to pay more than lip-service to the need for structural adjustment. Second, the experience of those countries which have tried to keep to the spirit, as well as the letter, of World Bank programmes suggests that structural adjustment is far from sufficient to deliver sustainable economic growth. In country after country the political commitment to economic reform has not been maintained. Of 26 adjusting countries, in 1990-91 only one  - Ghana - was judged by the World Bank research department to have an adequate macro-economic policy stance. In another 14 the stance was found to be fair, while in the remaining 11 it was rated either poor or very poor. One reason that adjustment is hard to sustain is that it takes many years to deliver results, much longer than the World Bank and the IMF were originally prepared to admit. But the deeper problem is that economic reform invariably runs counter to the interests of the urban elites who dominate government in Africa. Many African rulers are politically dependent on the patronage and corruption which regulations and secrecy conceal and which reforms are designed to root out. Kenya and Nigeria are prime examples of countries whose governments, in spite of the glaring need for adjustment, have never been able to maintain the reform momentum for long - too many powerful Nigerians benefit from the rewards that a distorted foreign exchange market deliver to those with a banking licence. Ghana, by contrast, has sustained adjustment, in part because its military government consistently aligned its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite which probably stands to lose more from adjustment in the early stages. The rural vote secured the election of Flight Lt Jerry Rawlings as president last December. The donors have, rightly, come under fire for their willingness to conceal what they know of the activities of African governments. For all its talk of 'good governance', the World Bank has never been willing to require that its client governments observe minimum levels of transparency, accountability and access to information, or apply these tests to its own dealings with African governments. The Bank often finds itself standing between unsuccessful governments and their electorates and withholding vital information on the state of the economy, and presenting overly optimistic progress reports that do no service to the reform cause. In Nigeria, the World Bank remains willing to conceal the extent to which the government siphons off an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day for its own off-budget purposes. In Zimbabwe, Bank officials recently submitted wildly optimistic export and growth numbers to their executive board to support a loan application. But the shortcomings of African governments, and the unwillingness of Bank officials to disclose unpalatable facts, are only part of the story. The absence of political instability and corruption, and the adoption of the full adjustment agenda is not, it seems, enough to deliver a significant growth take-off. In a handful of cases, there has been an impressive supply-side response. The Mauritian miracle is the most convincing, but the response of farmers and textile manufacturers in Nigeria, of clothing exporters in Zimbabwe and tourist operators in Kenya and Tanzania, all reflect only partial success. One reason is that the non-farm private sector is too small to exploit the new opportunities. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990 compared to 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in rapidly growing Thailand. Across Africa, the private sector is dominated by a handful of multinationals and hundreds of small-scale enterprises. Those medium-sized companies which do exist are primarily service-orientated and often dependent on the regulations and tariff walls that adjustment policies dismantle. Meanwhile, global companies have been slow to return. The post-1970 deterioration in commodity prices, the increasing need for skilled rather than merely plentiful and cheap labour, and the increased emphasis on short lead times and quality over cost, all make it harder for Africa to sell itself as a location for foreign direct investment. Even successful adjusters have not shed the reputation of being high-risk, low-return locations. Africa does not have the social and physical infrastructure requirements that multinationals increasingly demand. Standards of literacy lag behind those of the east Asian developing economies, while the public infrastructure, education and health systems have deteriorated across the continent. Even when governments are getting macroeconomic policies right, implementation on the ground - in the central bank, at the tax office, at the customs desk - is proving much more difficult. The reason acknowledged in a recent speech by the Bank's vice-president for Africa, Mr Kim Jaycox, is the region's deteriorating institutional capacity. The Bank group lends Dollars 4bn a year to sub-Saharan Africa but has Dollars 14bn waiting to be dispersed. The World Bank now concedes that some of its performance yardsticks - a reduction in the number of public servants on the payroll - are not meaningful indicators of policy reform. Laying off road-workers makes little impact on the wage bill, has no impact at all on administrative efficiency and invariably means increased road maintenance charges later. Reducing the role of the state has left a vacuum - filled in many instances by the donors and non-governmental organisations. In reality, the shift of control in Africa is not from the state to the private sector or to the market but to the donors. Aid dependence has become aid addiction. Mr Jaycox argues that by substituting expatriate management for domestic skills, donors are 'systematically destroying capacity that does exist'. This is much worse than it sounds given the long lead time necessary to rebuild that capacity. The result is a disturbing contradiction between the desire for private sector and market-oriented development and the intrusive role the agencies frequently play in project decision-making. An alarmingly high proportion of the region's investment decisions are made by aid workers rather than the private sector. AFRICA can move from crisis to recovery. Given a healthier global environment, a more robust OECD growth performance, adoption of the Uruguay Round proposals, firmer commodity prices, fewer droughts and an end to war and civil unrest, an acceleration in the sub-Saharan growth towards 5 per cent a year, from 2 per cent over the past decade, is within reach. Whether the majority of African countries can achieve even this modest growth rate will depend on the willingness of African governments to pursue the right policies, and on the incentives that the developed country donors can offer to persuade governments to put long-term development before political short-termism. The failures of the 1980s suggest that the west, in seeking ways to speed, rather than impede, development, must make a much clearer and public distinction between those governments which truly embrace reform and those which merely pay lip-service. That means offering greater rewards to those countries - such as Ghana, Uganda and Zambia - which are demonstrating a sustained commitment to reform, while taking a tougher stance towards those countries - such as Kenya and Nigeria - which continue to evade responsibility for their failures. Lessons must be learned from Somalia: humanitarian intervention without a political and economic framework for recovery is, at best, short-term relief and, at worst, compounds the disaster. Trade, aid and debt relief are the best ways to encourage success. Ghana's ability to sustain reform over the past decade is due, in large part, to the fact that annual gross aid flows, averaging 8 per cent of GDP, were available almost from the moment that reform began. But it is absurd that Ghana should, at the same time, be paying a third of its annual export earnings in debt service to bilateral and multilateral donors. The Ghanaian government will not request debt relief, even though it clearly qualifies for debt reduction, for fear that these aid flows will dry up. But the donors should be offering, to Ghana, and other successful adjusters, much more generous packages of aid and debt relief. The international aid community must also think hard about the ways their activities help and hinder development in successful adjusters. The slow pace of indigenous capacity-building means that the need for external institutional support will remain for decades. There is a strong case for more burden-sharing between the donors and agencies, starting with a greater and more formalised role for non-government organisations (NGOs), working with local communities in areas such as primary health and education which are so important if sustainable growth is to be achieved. But the World Bank and the donors need, radically, to re-assess their approach to the numerous African governments who merely flirt with economic reform. The 1980s evidence suggests that trying to force adjustment measures on unwilling and corrupt regimes is counter-productive. First, the World Bank resident representative and visiting firemen tend to become the regime's apologist, increasingly willing to answer local critics and justify and defend ill-designed adjustment policies on the government's behalf. Then the Bank and the IMF become useful scapegoats when flawed and partially implemented policies do not deliver results, a tactic that President Moi of Kenya and ex-Presidents Kaunda of Zambia and Nyerere of Tanzania have all exploited. To avoid this trap, the Bank must insist that reform programmes are home-grown rather than imposed from outside, something which Ghana's achievements show is difficult but possible. The donors must, meanwhile, be prepared to put political reform at the top of the agenda. What is needed is not necessarily a change in government but rather a change in the style of government towards more open and accountable policy formulation and debate. Enforcing good governance requirements is much more demanding, and arguably far more important, than requiring multi-party elections as a pre-condition for aid. Sometimes elections help: without the defeat of Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections, Zambia would probably not have become the country with one of the best macro-economic records in the region. But Ghana's successful transition to civilian rule occurred, in part, because the military government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10-year period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result. But there is nothing democratic or economically progressive about multi-party elections unless minimum standards of good governance are already achieved. Last year's elections did not persuade President arap Moi of Kenya to put past patronage policies aside and embrace accountability and transparency. Nigeria's disastrous and flawed transition to civilian rule shows how multi-party elections can become an excuse for not taking tough economic decisions. Africa's debt burden further complicates the strategy, as the Nigerian experience again illustrates. Without debt relief, Africa's most populous country has little hope of progress, a point that World Bank officials make with great force. But the Paris Club creditors remain unwilling to offer further relief to a government which consistently misuses the resources it does control. Across Africa, the carrot of debt relief has not been enough to persuade half-hearted adjusters to accelerate reform - the World Bank is right to argue that a substantial write-off of Africa's remaining debts, on more generous terms than are currently envisaged, and taking account of differing debt structures, is now inevitable and should occur across the board. But debt relief should be combined with a public statement from the Bank and the donors that, for Africa, the rules of the aid game have changed. The Bank, and the donors, should refuse to engage in policy-based lending with any government which does not meet minimum standards of transparency and public access to information, including the Bank's own reports. They must be much tougher about policing and enforcing the conditions upon which future lending is based, including much more rigorous and rapid internal auditing of Bank and IMF lending. If governments are not willing to embrace the full structural adjustment agenda and good governance requirements, then the donors should only finance humanitarian projects. The World Bank, and the donor community, must speak out about the true state of Africa. Telling things as they are means being more realistic about what adjustment programmes can achieve. It means acknowledging that deregulation and liberalisation are only a beginning, that five-year programmes are implausibly short and that it will take many years of investment in human and physical infrastructure before the region's institutional base is rehabilitated. Afro-realism means resisting the temptation to declare victory in Ghana or Uganda or to make excuses for the shortcomings of governments in Nigeria and Kenya. For those countries which take the structural adjustment medicine, recovery will be long and hard. For those that do not, the chances of progress are slim and the future looks bleak.  -------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH  --------------------------------------------------------------                        1965-89    1982-92    1992-02  -------------------------------------------------------------- GDP All LDCs                 4.7        2.7        4.7  East Asia               7.2        8.0        7.3  Latin America           4.3        1.9        3.9  Sub-Saharan Africa      3.2        2.0        3.7 GDP per head All LDCs                 2.5        0.8        2.9  East Asia               5.2        6.4        5.9  Latin America           1.8       -0.2        2.1  Sub-Saharan Africa      0.4       -1.1        0.6  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank, Global Economic Prospects 1991 and 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Then Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was very mad at you for  this.    [Beilin] Well, yes, but he has changed his mind since.  Also, there were sanctions against South Africa, and Israel was  not too enthusiastic about taking steps against South Africa.  Eventually, in March 1987 we joined the international club that  imposed the sanctions, and I was very happy with this. I  believe this is one of the reasons that today we are able to  hold a dialogue, as we do, with Nelson Mandela, who was then  still in prison, and with the ANC.    [Rosen] Do you believe that over the past two or three years  we corrected the mistakes made over the past decades?    [Beilin] I believe so because up to 1987, Israel was, in  fact, the only country to openly admit that it disregarded the  sanctions the United Nations imposed on South Africa in 1977.  This created a very negative sentiment against Israel among the  black South Africans. They seriously supported the  Palestinians, hence, their unbalanced attitude toward the PLO  all these years. It was very difficult for us to make the  change, and I cannot say that today they are completely balanced  and that we will continue our passionate love affair with South  Africa. The new regime will certainly be different from the  previous, very pro-Israel, white regime.    [Rosen] We had very good defense relations. Was this  eliminated?    [Beilin] In 1987 we decided not to renew defense contracts.  That meant that existing contracts which still were in effect  were followed through to the date set for their termination. No  new contracts were signed. Therefore, the defense relations  between us have completely decayed.    [Rosen] Are there other areas of cooperation which will  continue? Are there contacts now with Mandela's men on this?    [Beilin] Primarily, there is trade between the two  countries. We import coal and other raw materials, and we export  there. We naturally have very close ties with the Jewish  community there. Also, there are contacts, established about a  year ago or so, with the ANC, which is a very broad coalition,  and with Mandela. He was due to visit Israel some time ago, and  he postponed it and will probably visit here in the future.  Hence, certainly we have the beginning of a very interesting  dialogue, which carries many opportunities, with the new South  African leadership.    [Rosen] Is there a possibility of an Israeli-South African  cooperation regarding black Africa in general?    [Beilin] We have asked ourselves this very question, though  I doubt it is possible. There is a big question: What kind of  country will South African become? So far, it has been a  Western country with a black population that could not even  vote. Today, it will be very different. Will it become another  Third World country with the symptoms of such countries,  including the big disappointment with past African leaders; or  will it be a very different country, which uses the enormous  wealth at its disposal? There is a chance the latter will be the  case, but I find it hard to believe it will have the time or the  ability to even consider cooperating with a country such as  Israel in other Third World countries or black Africa. We will  continue our efforts in Africa. We are in the midst of a very  intensive campaign of economic cooperation with African  countries. If the new South African regime would be willing to  cooperate with us, we would certainly welcome this. I, however,  doubt this is a realistic option at this time. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT931-13355 ,"FT931-13355 _AN-DAXAVAEYFT 930123   FT  23 JAN 93 / Muddling towards democracy: Truth of the Matter - Patti Waldmeir on the problems that face South Africa and Russia      By PATTI WALDMEIR   OF ALL the nations struggling toward democracy, few seem to have less natural aptitude for the task than Russia and South Africa. Neither is politically tolerant by nature: throughout history, both have proved themselves excellent autocrats, corrupt and terrible tyrants. But now Moscow and Pretoria, bitterest enemies for decades, have become strange comrades in battle: falteringly, they fight the tide of culture and history to pursue a liberal democratic goal which seems to recede as often as it draws nearer. Neither is likely to follow a straight path to democracy - if indeed, they ever get there. But both are committed to ruling by consent and not coercion; and a return to either totalitarianism or apartheid is out of the question. Both must therefore search for a more or less democratic form of government which can hold anarchy at bay while protecting the minimum of civil liberties. So far the move to democracy has fostered chaos, crime and violence in both countries. Many already yearn for a strong man to restore order. In South Africa, a prominent mixed race politician complains (only half in jest) 'I miss apartheid'; and most Russians would probably understand this nostalgia for authoritarian certainty. But in the longer term, a betting man would probably conclude that Russia will stay the course to full democracy - however circuitous - and that South Africa will not. Both face formidable obstacles to democratisation, chief among them problems of ethnicity and economic hardship. But South Africa has a further overwhelming disadvantage: the rigid correlation between wealth and race decreed by apartheid. For democracy is scarcely the obvious solution for a country where the majority is poor, black and impatient and the minority white, rich and powerful: democracy invites the individual to use his vote to obtain a fairer share of wealth; but any government which indulges the urge to redistribute wealth will alienate white skills and capital, and jeopardise economic growth. Either way, the incumbent government would suffer at the ballot box - and would probably soon decide to dispense with democratic elections. As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out more than 150 years ago: 'When the people rule, they must be rendered happy or they will overturn the state.' But in South Africa, the 'state' would not give up without a fight; a new government may well be tempted to impose its will - in the national interest, of course - rather than hand over to the opposition. Not surprisingly, most South Africans reject this scenario: indeed, they find cheer in the midst of political upheaval by counting their considerable blessings in comparison with Russia. South African democrats will inherit intact the one most necessary condition for democracy: a market economy. That economy may have been damaged by 40 years of 'Afrikaner socialism', which used state capital to set up nationalised industries dominated by the 'white tribe of Africa'. But repairing its flaws is a small task compared with that facing Russia's economic reformers. From nothing, they must create financial markets, draw up a detailed body of company law and construct all the institutional supports necessary to capitalism. South Africa inherits these things from the apartheid state; and before the African National Congress decides to tamper with this inheritance, it should reflect on the ways in which capitalism underpins the democratic system which the ANC professes as its goal. In developed democracies, the private sector functions as an important check on the power of governmental authority; and the market economy holds out the best hope of a prosperity which is essential to bolster democracy from below. Paradoxically, South Africans will also inherit from apartheid - a most undemocratic ideology - the infrastructure of a thriving political democracy which Russia struggles so painfully to build. South Africa has political parties, independent courts, lobby groups and all the paraphernalia of parliamentary democracy, which can surely be adapted for a multi-racial future. But in Russia the Communist Party, which invaded every aspect of personal and public life, has deeply discredited the very notion of 'party'; indeed, there are few coherent party alternatives to President Boris Yeltsin, himself something of a one-man band. Progress towards the establishment of an independent judiciary in Russia is perhaps more advanced: the new Constitutional Court represents a milestone on the path to democracy. But Russia has no tradition of challenging state power through the courts - certainly not under communism, when challenging party decisions was effectively forbidden - and it lacks the institutional depth (the courts, the judges, the independent lawyers) present in South Africa. Even in the worst days of apartheid abuse, South Africa's courts managed to preserve much of their independence. But democracy requires more than political parties, elections and courts: a vigorous civil society (everything from trades unions to churches, women's groups to chambers of commerce) is necessary to frustrate the would-be tyrant. Such civil infrastructure is well developed in both black and white South Africa - and almost non-existent in Russia. Organised business and labour in South Africa could counter-balance government power; civic associations in black townships could prove a further check on central government; and with three-quarters of the population actively religious, the churches will remain a major political force. What is more, South Africa will inherit a state machine which actually works; in Russia, where party and state were practically indivisible, the collapse of the one has destroyed the other. No new South African government is likely to face the crisis of executive power which currently assails Moscow. So that is the triple challenge facing Russia: to create a modern state, a modern market economy and democratic political institutions, and to do so simultaneously under conditions of great economic hardship. But however daunting the immediate crisis, Russia will probably muddle through in the end to democracy and prosperity. And South Africa, whatever its early advantages, may not. Western democracies will continue to provide moral support to Russian democrats (however unreliable their financial backing), while South Africa will rapidly be left to itself on the remote tip of a forgotten continent. And over time, the gross inequalities of South African society could prove too much for a fledgling democracy. Both face problems of ethnicity and economic deprivation which threaten democracy; but in South Africa, crucially, they are linked. While Russians struggle (more or less) equally to survive, race determines the degree of hardship experienced by each South African. As long as that is so palpably true, it is hard to see how democracy can take root. But even if South Africa - perhaps Russia too - reverts temporarily to authoritarian rule, there can be no returning to the specific abominations of the past. Totalitarian communism and apartheid are ruled out forever. The future can scarcely be worse.

President arap Moi expressed welcome to Qian Qichen, saying  that Qian's visit will further promote development of the  friendly relations and cooperation between Kenya [words  indistinct].    Qian Qichen conveyed greetings to President arap Moi from  Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. He said the  Chinese president is expecting President arap Moi's visit to  China.    During the meeting both sides expressed satisfaction over  the  smooth development of relations between the two countries in  recent years. Qian appreciated the important role played by  President arap Moi and the Kenyan Government in promoting  Sino-Kenyan relations, maintaining regional peace and stability  and in promoting development in the region.    Qian said that there are potentialities for cooperation  between China and Kenya though conditions in the two countries  are not all same. He said that China is willing to make joint  efforts to constantly strengthen and develop friendship and  cooperation between China and Kenya.    Arap Moi said that the friendship between the Kenyan and  Chinese peoples traces back to ancient times, adding that their  relations at present are good and the economic cooperation  between them is making new progresses. He said that the two  countries can cooperate in world affairs as they have similar  views on developments in Africa and the rest of the world. He  hoped the cooperation in various fields between the two  countries would be further strengthened.    Arap Moi briefed Qian on the regional situation, the  developments in Somalia and Kenya's efforts in mediating the  conflicts in Somalia and maintaining regional peace.    Qian said that Africa is facing new difficulties and  challenge.

Soon after he arrived, Mr.  Roussin went to meet the country's authorities, particularly  President Ange-Felix Patasse, who granted him a very lengthy  audience late this morning. At the end of the audience, the  French minister expressed satisfaction with the resumption of  school activities and work in the public sector. He also  reiterated his country's stand towards Africa by stating that  France is not abandoning Africa. He redefined the orientation  of French aid, and referred to the 30-billion French franc  package allocated to banks in the franc zone. Here is Mr.  Roussin responding to questions from the press.    [Begin recording] [Roussin] Whenever France makes  commitments it honors them. When Africa makes certain decisions  France remains loyal to it. When it is said here and there that  France is ditching Africa, France is abandoning its friends, and  that a new page has been turned -- that is all baseless. You  are not abandoning your friends when you give 30 billion francs  to help them go through a delicate transition for the  relaunching of real growth and development. That is not true.  So, indeed, not only have we taken considerable measures --  during a difficult period for us -- to support this courageous  decision from the African countries -- and it will be seen  within a few months that all of us within the franc zone made a  good decision -- but even the backup measures have to be  negotiated between the various parties.    We have also put strong pressure on international  institutions so that everybody, taking into account the efforts  made by Africa, in turn, comes to Africa's aid. On 22 February,  I will be going to Brussels to see EC chief Jacques Delors and,  there too, champion Africa's cause and explain the efforts that  have been made, so that Europe can also participate in assisting  Africa. You talked about the backup measures [words indistinct]  minister with whom we met this morning, well, France will make  additional efforts. You know, in addition, we have constituted  a special fund to help -- in countries where this will be  necessary -- the most underprivileged people during this  transition period following the devaluation decision, until the  point arrives where economies start picking up again under the  new conditions.    [Unidentified correspondent] You talked about 30 billion  francs, how will these funds be distributed among the various  countries?    [Roussin] These 30 billion francs represent general aid from  France. In effect, it constitutes the cancellation of Africa's  debt. Africa owed France 25 billion francs, and we are  canceling that debt. There is 5 billion in project assistance  -- France wants to keep this rate up in cooperation efforts,  efforts made by the government and which are accepted by the  National Assembly and the Senate -- which is continuing. In  addition, we have this special social assistance fund. [passage  omitted] Therefore, France does not intend to ditch Africa.  France without Africa would not be the same. We are bound, we  are united. The success of these current operations will be the  success of Africa, it will be that of the Central African  Republic, and also that of France. We are closely bound within  the franc zone family and nobody can [words indistinct].  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage indistinct]    [Roussin] I know that on 15 February an agreement was signed  between the appropriate minister and the head of mission. I  myself have signed other agreements that [words indistinct] were  very considerable and that apparently have been disbursed. The  French Cooperation Fund has been given very specific directives.  The Cooperation Mission has been given very specific  directives. The IMF has committed itself. The World Bank has  committed itself -- the first disbursements of the World Bank  for some countries are already under way -- and we have never  joined hands as much as now in order to manage a problem of such  dimensions.

0,FT924-12014 ,"FT924-12014 _AN-CJWBWAAIFT 921022   FT  22 OCT 92 / South Africans rule out early return to single currency: Why the financial rand is here to stay      By PHILIP GAWITH   THE gyrations in the financial rand, which earlier this month slipped to a six-year low and a discount of over 40 per cent against the commercial rand, are clear evidence South Africa will not be making an early return to a single currency. Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, underlined the point yesterday when he saidthe large discount 'proves again that we still need the financial rand to protect the foreign reserves and make a relatively stable commercial rand possible.' He went on to stress that, although the bank had announced in March that it would be intervening in the financial rand market, this was not a commitment to stabilise the currency. The intervention, he said, was mainly aimed at draining excess liquidity from the money markets caused by large increases in foreign reserves. Stabilisation, achieved during April and May when the financial rand discount fluctuated between the narrow margins of 15 to 18 per cent, was a beneficial adjunct of intervention, not its aim. 'We just cannot commit ourselves as the Reserve Bank to support this exchange rate at all times,' Dr Stals said. At least two conditions would have to be met for the bank to be in a position to stabilise the financial rand: 'much higher' foreign reserves than the current level of R11.5bn, and a 'more stable political situation where the financial rand exchange rate will be determined more by economic considerations than by political considerations.' The financial rand has strengthened somewhat since its precipitous fall on October 5, which saw it close at R4.83 to the dollar, a discount of 41 per cent to the commercial rand. At one stage that day, the financial rand traded at R5.11, having last past R5.10 in October 1986. Yesterday, it closed at R4.36 to the dollar, a discount of 33 per cent to the commercial rand, which closed at R2.92 to the dollar. Analysts ascribe the widening of the financial rand discount to two main factors: continued negative political sentiment, and a perception that South African companies are increasingly being allowed to invest abroad. There have recently been a number of foreign acquisitions by South African companies, mainly financial institutions, and these are conducted through the financial rand. Dr Stals says that the recent volatility is partially attributable to worldwide nervousness in foreign exchange markets. He downplays the importance of South African companies investing offshore, saying: 'The initiatives were taken more by the foreign investors who wanted to sell than by South African investors who wanted to buy foreign exchange.' The financial rand was introduced in 1985 as a means of protecting the balance of payments. It is a barometer of foreign investor sentiment: when the rand is in demand, the discount to the commercial rand narrows, and vice versa. Until this year, there had been a steady narrowing of the discount, which fell from 53 per cent at the end of 1986 to a low of 7 per cent in November 1991. Since then, events like the Boipatong massacre and the breakdown of constitutional talks have caused the discount to widen. The sharp weakening in the currency over the past two weeks is a mixed blessing for foreign investors, who are thought to hold as much as 45 per cent of the South African government bond market. One the one hand, it makes returns more lucrative. Syfrets, a Cape-based investment institution, says that its Income Fund was yielding a return of more than 20 per cent for non-residents compared to the 14.1 per cent return on gilts available to local residents. On the other, a weak financial rand can make the repatriation of funds a costly and difficult process. Indeed, while the Reserve Bank can take comfort from the protection afforded to foreign reserves by the financial rand, it will be acutely conscious that this stability was not achieved without a price. Foreign investors for one, many of whom have suffered large losses on the financial rand, have not been slow in making their displeasure felt. Speaking at a financial conference in Johannesburg yesterday, Dr Stals told his audience of the letters that he had received from these investors, variously describing the country as a 'banana republic' and unfit to invest in with such a volatile currency. For a country anxious to attract foreign investment, those words will have found their mark. Insofar as it can, the bank will certainly be striving to avoid a repetition of the recent volatility.

The press bureau of the presidential office announced that  Mitterrand made the suggestion in a telephone conversation with  U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Earlier this month, Mitterrand had respectively wrote to  Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, executive president of  the European Union, Greek Prime Minister Andreas George  Papandreou and UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    In the letters, Mitterrand asked the four sides to  coordinate  their positions and urge the warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to resume peace talks immediately in a bid to  seek a political solution to the crisis.    On April 18, Mitterrand also had telephone talks with German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. French official sources said Kohl  agreed to such a quadripartite emergency meeting while Yeltsin  also gave his consent in a telephone conversation with Kohl.    In a related development, a spokesman of the French Foreign  Ministry said today that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had  telephone talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  Tuesday afternoon and reiterated the following French position  on an end to the Bosnia conflict:    -- Adoption of a UN resolution on an immediate cease-fire  in,  the withdrawal of the Serb troops from and the deployment of UN  peacekeepers in Gorazde.    -- Effective measures to protect the security zones  designated by the United Nations in Bosnia-Hercegovina.    -- A united position among Russia, Western Europe, the  United  States and the United Nations for pressing the warring parties  in Bosnia-Herzegovina to resume peace talks.

The documents --  transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force  officer and from the government's classified submissions to the  International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) -- show that much  vital information has been kept from the public. They also show  that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to parliament on 23  March 1993 that the government had built then destroyed just six  crude nuclear devices fell far short of the whole truth.    The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in  the 1970's and 1980's was grotesquely at odds with the disarray  and venality among the government officials involved in the  project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force  Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in  Capetown makes clear.    Classified documents from the trial obtained by Africa  Confidential trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with  Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to  make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of  Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had  promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South  Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear  programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but  said that Blaauw ad threatened to make public details about the  nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it. By  the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred substantial  debts and had his assets sequestrated following his resignation  from ministerial office and parliament on 15 November 1983 after  some highly critical press reports.    In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on  charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and  possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power  reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he  is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining  concessions through the civil courts.    Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in  World  War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine,  the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement  from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of  Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel.    It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the  mining  portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the  tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's  work on the nuclear programme with Israel.    In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that  Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet  meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a  mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found  to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk  to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme  and sources close to the highest levels of government have told  Africa Confidential that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry  as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980's, De Klerk was  said to be unable ""to come to terms philosophically"" with the  securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose  primary target would be African civilians.    However, De Klerk's apparent ""road to Damascus"" on the  nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full  admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme.  This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns  senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time  when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the  loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear  uncertain.    Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is  significant:  Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons  creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information  submitted to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency],  which monitors compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations, the government admitted  that its weapons programme had involved lithium-6 separation, a  means of producing tritium. So sensitive is this information  that senior African National Congress (ANC) officials, some of  whom will be holding ministerial office after the April  elections, have been refused access to it.    According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by  Africa Confidential, the programme had also progressed by the  early 1980's to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of  producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have  been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the  basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work  on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986,  according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy  Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy  coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons  programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the  following year.    In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that ""at  no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another  country."" Apart from United States intelligence reports  attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration,  additional information would have been available to De Klerk,  during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that  tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated  technology, one which South Africa had not mastered.    At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the  supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600  tonnes of ""yellowcake"" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake  exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by  William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem.

They write that the sensitive arrangements  were jointly overseen by South Africa's then intelligence  agency, the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli  intelligence division Lish Ka le-Kishrei (Lakam) which  specialised in nuclear and technological procurement and came to  public attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard  spy scandal in the USA in 1985.    Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South  Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had  emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make  high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men  arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for  Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war.    Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in  Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and  Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial  documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one  ""Benjamine"" of Lakam (almost certainly Benjamin Blumberg, chief  of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would  sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for  nuclear weapons or power reactors.    Through his service in South African military liaison during  the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert  activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between  white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and  South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a  confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the  security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told  the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's  request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from  John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a  comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts.    According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South  African officials, including director of Lakam Benjamin Blumberg  and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled  as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium --  2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity  was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks.    Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake  deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster  reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was  known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made  for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in  preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw  said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied  him to Israel.    Botha was a hit with the Israelis. ""Look after Fanie Botha,""  Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court  that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the  yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager  for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more  cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time.    Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie  Botha  from a US$1 million ""gift"" he had received from Israel. The  objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to  keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting  personal debt.    Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van  Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed  all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw  provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were  channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the  source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks  from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw.  Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to  Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of  mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the  West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which  precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty  to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was  sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before  Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining  leases because those areas had already been promised to others.    As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo-  American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the  presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry  Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983)  was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist  Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh,  the editor of the Sunday Times, as a result of which no  information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published  in that newspaper [sentence as published].    However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with  Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told  Africa Confidential on 2 February 1994 that although he had no  control over what was published in the English press in South  Africa he had ""said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had  told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his  conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he  intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's  affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding  Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated  by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh  undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's  financial position."" According to Oppenheimer, nothing was  published about Botha at that time for fear of libel.    The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie  Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the  applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5.  Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson  about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie  Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw  in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw ""advised  De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the  Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging  applications for rights to prospect for diamonds."" De Beers  subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the  forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he  met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions  for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1  highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining  rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the  Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: ""No payment was asked for or  made by De Beers to any person in connection with these  applications.""    The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial  Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and  sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers:  Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together  in a joint venture.    In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by  legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha,  who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had  begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents,  Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during  the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978  information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the  succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones  and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister  Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A.  P. Treurnicht.    Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that  Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party  MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in  the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in  Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made  its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a  harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court  entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw  testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by  senior officials in the government. The document passed through  the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for  what purpose.    When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha  called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and  meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he  had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman  that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw.    Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced  that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979.  It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document  concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because  he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the  Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the  reactor.

In Asia and Latin America the fertility rate has nearly halved from 5.9 to about 3 children per woman in that period, although Africa (including northern African states) has showed a smaller decline from 6.6 to 5.8. Even in developed countries, rates have fallen from 2.8 to 1.7 over that period. These patterns have forced demographers to modify the old assumption of a link between low birth rates and economic wealth in favour of a more complex picture. Some countries, such as Bangladesh, have achieved steep falls in fertility rates despite relative lack of economic growth. Others, notably Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, continue to have large average family sizes despite relatively high levels of economic prosperity. The UNFPA draws a close connection between low fertility rates and the availability of contraception, even where gross domestic product per head has not risen greatly. It attributes roughly half of the fall in worldwide fertility rates to improved distribution of contraceptives. The other half, it says, is due simply to the determination of parents to have fewer children, even when contraception is not available. Even the poorest families, UNFPA officials say, work out that they can spend more on each child if they have fewer children. Demographers have long agreed that improving women's education plays an important part in reducing family sizes. But the UN report suggests that newer pressures are also providing powerful motivation. When workers move to towns from the countryside they tend to delay having children and to have fewer. Anecdotal evidence from west African countries also suggests that looming land shortages are curbing the size of rural families. These new factors may be helping to push down fertility rates even in Africa and central America, the regions which have persistently had the highest rates, Mr Alex Marshall of UNFPA suggests. Since the first half of the 1980s, Tanzania has seen fertility rates drop from 6.7 to 5.9 children per woman, Namibia from 5.8 to 5.3 and South Africa from 4.8 to 4.1.   Countries:-  XOZ  Asia.

The Food Agency says there is no need to worry about the  pace  of shipments of foreign rice, but traders say the agency is too  optimistic.    ""It might be difficult to secure necessary amounts of U.S.  and Chinese rice next month, so domestic and Thai rice will be  used to make up for them,"" one rice trader said.    The agency has said it plans to import 70 percent of total  rice consumption for table use for the March-June period -- 20  percent each from Thailand, China and the U.S., and 10 percent  from Australia.    Japan's monthly rice consumption for table use is some  500,000 tons, meaning that the agency has to import 350,000 tons  of rice a month.    But Japan has imported only 200,000 tons so far for March  supply, making it necessary to import 150,000 tons by the end of  this month as it usually takes at least a month to place rice  for sale on shelves after importation.    ""The pace of rice imports (from China and the U.S.) has been  picking up since the second half of February, so there is no  concern,"" a Food Agency official said.    But rice traders said both the U.S. and China face problems  exporting rice smoothly.    ""A ship must often wait a long time at a (Chinese) port for  rice to be loaded, in part because they have no experience in  exporting and importing rice,"" said an official at one rice  importer.    As for Californian rice, traders pointed to time-consuming  sanitary inspections at U.S. ports.    ""It will be necessary to raise the portion of domestic and  long- grain Thai rice which has been imported smoothly,"" said an  official at Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market research agency.     "

Andre Jordan spoke to South Africa's [RSA]  ambassador Maseru, Gerhard Visser, and asked him whether it  would be correct to describe yesterday's events as a coup  attempt.    [Begin recording] [Visser] It is difficult for me to say so,  I have also heard that the prime minister said that it could  have been a coup. It phased out last night with the release of  the four ministers, but the fact that the deputy prime minister  was killed, it's difficult to place it in the category of a  coup, because there was no follow-through. But as I've already  mentioned, and also that it is the policy of the South African  Government, as well as the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  that South Africa will not recognize any other government in  Lesotho, but the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] which was  democratically elected in April 1993.    [Jordan] Do you think a statement from our Department of  Foreign Affairs yesterday reiterating that position could have  had any effect in dampening what might have been a developing  coup?    [Visser] This is not the first time that we've made this  statement, Foreign Minister Botha visited Lesotho on the 15th of  January this year, where he made it very clear on television, on  radio, and in public that South Africa will not support any  military coup in Lesotho, or for that matter, any group or  persons who try to overthrow the BCP government by violent  means. It will not be recognized by South Africa, and will  receive no support whatsoever from the outside world.    [Jordan] Is there any indication of just what faction or who  in the army might have been behind yesterday's events?    [Visser] No, all I can tell you is that it is the RLDF, the  Royal Lesotho Defense Force, the soldiers were from the  Makoanyane Barracks, as far as I could gather, and that the four  ministers who were detained were also detained at the Makoanyane  Barracks.    [Jordan] The soldiers at the other barracks on the opposite  side of town, are they likely to take any action. Are they  loyal to the government. Do we see an army split into two  factions, pro and anti-government?    [Visser] That's also a tough question for me to ask as a  diplomat. Yes, I would think the army was split into two  factions in the February and March problems, but it seems to me,  as far as I could gather, and news is difficult to come by in  Maseru, that this time it was the Makoanyane Barracks, and not  the headquarters people that apprehended and detained the  ministers. But I would not say there are two factions in the  RLDF at the moment.    [Jordan] But you say we're not looking at the likelihood of  clashes as happened earlier in the year?    [Visser] It's very difficult to say. I hope not, let me put  it like that, I hope not. I think it's time for the soldiers now  to accept the present government, to discuss their problems with  the present government, and to look at the future of Lesotho per  se. You know these actions by soldiers or individuals or groups  cause tremendous harm to the economy of Lesotho and also to  tourism, etcetera, etcetera. The fact that Foreign Minister  Botha has already told South Africans not to travel to Lesotho  will have an adverse effect on the economy and tourism.    [Jordan] And yet the situation today looks quite normal?    [Visser] It's always been, it's always been very difficult  to  describe to people who have never been to Maseru how it looks  here. I mean even at the heights of the shooting of the 23d of  January this year, well, the soldiers were shooting at each  other on the surrounding hills, the man in the street just went,  more or less, on with his daily life.

General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with extravagant praise during his visit, the first by a white South African leader to Nigeria. At a state banquet on Thursday night, he declared that Mr de Klerk deserved a place among the most famous black South African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric. These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian given the open hostility which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades. But Gen Babangida went beyond mere rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation. Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in South Africa, likely within months. Reconciliation with South Africa is likely to prove the largest foreign affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a civilian government at the year end. Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis which they hope will give the continent new clout in international relations. There were frequent protestations of African brotherhood from both sides, with each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two regional superpowers. The leaders of South Africa's three largest business organisations accompanied Mr de Klerk to Nigeria, where they met Nigerian business leaders to discuss renewing trade ties. They said clandestine trade with Nigeria had carried on throughout the sanctions period but could be much increased, perhaps to more than R200m (Pounds 40.2m) a year. Nigerian crude oil is not suitable for South African refineries, but Nigerian manufacturers are keen to import South African steel and industrial chemicals.  The Financial Times   London Page 32  "

Yet a two-day White House conference addressed by President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, not to mention secretary of state Warren Christopher and national security adviser Anthony Lake, has accomplished the remarkable feat of irritating even Africa's most devoted advocates. Several experts who had been told they would be asked did not receive invitations, and most members of the congressional black caucus stayed away, partly in protest at the administration's policy towards Haiti, and partly because they felt they had been asked as an afterthought. The conference, due to be addressed late yesterday by Mr Clinton, was billed by the White House as an attempt to refocus attention on issues such as sustainable development, responses to internal conflicts, support for democracy and human rights, and enhancing bilateral trade and investment ties. But the idea of an occasional gathering of the great and the good has drawn criticism as being no substitute for continuous attention to the continent's problems. 'It is the typical Clinton method: you get 150 of the brightest minds you can find into the same room, and come up with the lowest common denominator,' sniffed one Washington diplomat. And while Mr Mandela, in a videotaped message, called on the US to become 'the leading partner in the most novel and challenging project since the Marshall Plan', Mr Lake warned the US's willingness to get involved was constrained by lack of budget resources and by the US public's doubts about overseas intervention. Although Mr Lake acknowledged that genocide had taken place in Rwanda - a question on which the State Department has equivocated, to the outrage of human rights groups - he offered little prospect of future US action. With the end of the cold war and South Africa's transition to democracy, as well as the unhappy experience of humanitarian intervention in Somalia, the US has been pulling back from Africa. The Central Intelligence Agency, for example, plans to close 15 stations in Africa, which it says existed not to gather information about Africa but to monitor and recruit eastern bloc officials.

0,FT923-1918 ,"FT923-1918 _AN-CIUDDAA2FT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (5): More emphasis on market forces - A look at the results of economic reform in Latin American countries / The March of Western values      By STEPHEN FIDLER   THE disintegration of the Soviet bloc has brought predictable claims of a victory for the western style of democratic government and economic management. But even before the discrediting of communism transformed the map of the world, shifts towards more democratic systems of government and more market-friendly economic systems were already under way in many developing countries. For pragmatic rather than ideological reasons, many governments had already come to the conclusion that in a capital-scarce world, the market should have a more important role in allocating resources than they had conceded hitherto. There have been two main aspects to this change: the first has involved attaining equilibrium in government finances; the second a series of reforms to the structure of economies to make them more responsive to market forces. In Latin America, for example, the onset of the debt crisis 10 years ago laid bare the economic mismanagement of military governments across the region and paved the way for their replacement by elected successors. But, also as a result of the crisis, governments found it impossible to raise capital. Because their ability to sell debt was severely limited, any attempt to stimulate the economy directly by increasing government spending in excess of revenues has had one result: inflation. Thus reforms were considered necessary to redirect the role of government, raising revenues by restructuring tax systems and cutting expenditures by slimming down bloated bureaucracies and privatising state industries. Privatisation has had an important role in structural reform, too, as part of a set of changes to allow for greater play of market forces. It has been accompanied by a removal of quotas, tariffs and other obstacles to foreign trade and reforms to improve the attraction of investment, domestic and foreign. Yet there is no doubt that governments have been reinforced in their decision to throw out the state-dominated, inward-looking model of economic development by the changes in eastern Europe. Graphic television pictures of life in the former socialist countries have changed the point of view of many voters. 'We used to think there were two ways we could develop our economy. Now we realise that in the east, they live as badly as we do,' said Mr Jaime Duran, a political analyst in Ecuador, where a government pledging economic reforms has just assumed power. This 'unipolar' world has exciting potential, particularly in the prospects offered of a reduction in defence expenditures in developed and developing countries. It has also meant in theory that governments in industrialised countries can alter the basis of their relations with developing countries; that aid can be used to bolster democracy and weaken tyranny, instead of shoring up corrupt regimes whose only claim for support was opposition to Moscow. However, there is also disquiet in the developing world. Donor governments have felt less reticent about imposing new, less ostensibly economic, conditions on aid. The freedom of the US and its allies to intervene in areas of the world in pursuit of domestic policy aims - such as combating drug traffickers or securing oil supplies - is much enlarged. Furthermore, without strong ideological competition, there is the danger of drift in international policy-making, of purposelessness and petty squabbles among the rich countries, epitomised by the inability to reach a conclusion to the Uruguay round of free trade talks. Many policy-makers in developing countries are thus worried that their unilateral decisions to open their economies to the outside world will be greeted by growing protectionism in the industrialised world. Internally, economic reform has been no panacea for governments. While in some countries - such as Mexico and Argentina - it has so far proved popular and helped incumbent governments, in others, there has been a tension between economic reform and the survival of democracy. In Venezuela, for example, the government's reform programme, in spite of its relatively modest scale, has been the focus of public demonstrations since a failed army coup attempt last February. In Peru - a lesson for those who believe left-wing revolutionaries have lost their potential to influence events - a group of brutal Maoists threaten the state. Indeed, the most successful economic reform movements in Latin America - Chile's of the 1980s and Mexico's - have been pushed forward by two of the continent's least democratic regimes. Even in countries where reform has so far proved successful, there are risks. Argentina's future development, for example, depends crucially on stimulating its low levels of investment. And if the investment arrives in Argentina, it is unlikely to arrive in all the countries that are simultaneously opening their economies in the hope of stimulating investment. Amid such competition, aid practitioners are despondent about the ability of much of Africa to attract meaningful amounts of private capital. Without that, and with increased competition for western aid from eastern Europe, the prospects for much of that continent appear dim. Furthermore, even if it arrives, foreign investment may be perceived as exploitative, providing potential problems for incumbent governments. There are other areas where the market does not provide a complete answer or where government will continue to have to play a significant role. In most developing countries, raising capital for large project investments or for small businesses is problematic, and in most there is a pressing need for infrastructure investments. There is also a requirement for government investment in sectors such as education: low wages are no longer, if they ever were, a sufficient incentive for foreign investment, and an educated workforce is an important draw for potential investors. As a decade of austerity, the 1980s saw mounting social pressures in many developing economies. Another important development is the emergence of another value system which has met with unmatched success over the past 20 years: that of Asia. While the models offered by Japan and its Asian neighbours differ in detail, they all place government at the centre of the development process. Japan is growing in importance as a giver of aid and a provider of finance to the multilateral institutions; Korea and Taiwan, once recipients of aid, are themselves becoming donors. Meanwhile, the relative weight of the US economy and the importance of the US as an aid donor continues to decline. The disintegration of the Soviet bloc may in some countries be accompanied by the simultaneous strengthening of democracy and the market economy. In others, there will be tension or conflict between the two. In any event, the hypothesis that the world is on the verge of an uncontested victory for 'western' values must be considered distinctly far-fetched.  The Financial Times   London Page VI  "

In a strongly-worded attack on the World Bank's latest report on the region, Oxfam said that bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to 'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty'. The charity, which is heavily involved in Africa, declared that adjustment programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets. 'Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures' had 'exposed potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from imports' Oxfam said in its statement. The British charity accused the bank of 'complacency' in the face of what it called Africa's 'deepening development crisis'. The charity also attacked the bank's classification in its report of Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as 'bordering on outright deception'. Zimbabwe's adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991, says Oxfam: 'Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or export growth'.

The stigma of doing business with South Africa will at last have been removed. Yet this signal, for which investors have waited years, risks being being undermined by a damaging dispute between the government and the ANC over cellular telephone licences. The issue has become so serious that Mr Mandela and President F W de Klerk this month held a meeting purely on this subject. The cabinet was yesterday preparing to authorise the issue of the two licences which on Tuesday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, warned would be reviewed and possibly revoked by a new government. Vodafone of the UK has a 35 per cent stake in Vodacom, one consortium expected to win a licence. The public utility Telkom has a 50 per cent stake and Rembrandt 15 per cent. The other consortium likely to be successful includes Cable  Wireless. The two winners will run competing services. Although the ANC says it is not opposed to cellular telephone networks, it has raised numerous objections to the way in which the government is issuing the licences. The ANC maintains the government is proceeding with 'unilateral restructuring' of the economy, that is trying to privatise the telecommunications network, and that the technology chosen is too expensive and unsuitable for South Africa. Within the government and the business community these reasons are widely dismissed as a fig-leaf for objections that are purely political  - that government money should no longer be spent without the ANC's agreement. There is also a more insidious suspicion that the ANC is trying to delay the issue of the licences in order to allow various US and Scandinavian companies to participate when sanctions in those countries are lifted. There have even been unsubstantiated suggestions that the ANC expects financial contributions from successful bidders. On the ideological level, the ANC believes cellular phones should be run by the state - and subsidised if need be - while the government sees them as a means of introducing competition into the telecommunications sector. It also sees a cellular network as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most South Africans access to a telephone. The message to foreign investors will be clear and unpalatable: the ANC remains an organisation that favours state over market, and South Africa remains a country where political interference can be expected in business decisions. If the government presses ahead with awarding licences, there must be some doubt as to whether those chosen will proceed while the security of their investment remains in doubt. Each licence is expected to involve the investment of about R1bn (Pounds 193m), with an estimated R700m of this coming from abroad. In South Africa telephone penetration (fixed phones per 100 people) is only 9.6 (about 2.4 in the black community; ten times that among whites). This compares to only 1.5 for the rest of Africa but to an average of about 50 for developed countries. The tender documents stressed that a criterion which would 'weigh heavily' was the extent to which the applicant was prepared to provide telephone services to the underdeveloped part of the community, almost certainly at subsidised tariffs.

Nick Driver, of the US news agency UPI, and Matthew Forney,  a  correspondent with Newsweek magazine, were stopped by six  uniformed police at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday as they left the  home of the wife of dissident Liu Nianchun, 46, in the west of  the capital.    Police said their car had collided with a telegraph pole  when  they parked their vehicle, bringing down telephone lines. The  journalists did not deny this. But then about 30 police took  turns interrogating them separately about their connection with  the dissident and their conversation with his wife.    Before the Americans' release early Saturday at about 2 a.m.  (1800 GMT Friday), police made them sign a document in which  they agreed not to report what occurred during the course of the  night.    The incident took place as US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher was on an official visit to Beijing for talks on  human rights. It also coincided with a crackdown by police  against dissidents and activists which began at the start of the  month.    According to a Human Rights Watch/Asia report Friday, Liu,  who was jailed for three years in the 1980s, was one of those  briefly detained and ""may be in imminent danger of arrest.""  Liu, a longtime pro-democracy activist, called at the start of  the week for the formation of an independent trade union, The  League for the Protection of Working People.    The union's charter focuses on some of the negative  consequences of rapid economic growth and calls, among other  things, for the restoration of the right to strike and for the  legalisation of independent workers' and peasant labour unions.    Liu is also a signatory of the Peace Charter issued by  several dissidents in October 1993.     "

The owners of Firestone East Africa (1969), the only tyre manufacturer in Kenya, are offering 20 per cent of the company's shares for sale in the biggest initial public offering in Kenya to date. If the offer for sale is fully subscribed, it will raise Ks1.4bn (Dollars 27.9m) for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc of the US and Sameer Investments of Kenya, which own 19 per cent and 81 per cent of the local tyre manufacturer respectively. The offer has been priced at 10 times 1993 earnings, which is comparable with other manufacturing companies listed on the NSE. The Kenyan stock market is still officially closed to foreign participation regulations but Firestone East Africa obtained a special exemption due to the size of the share offer. 'We believe the government is using Firestone as a test case to assess the interest and the impact of overseas investors in our stock market,' said Mr Issa Timamy, group company secretary at Sameer Investments. With at least two local banks planning flotations before the end of the year, Mr Timamy believes the central bank will gradually relax the rules of foreign participation. The restrictions on foreign portfolio investment are virtually the last foreign exchange controls to remain following a year of steady deregulation. The Kenya shilling is fully convertible for all current account transactions. Exporters can retain proceeds in foreign currency and multinationals can remit profits and dividends. Nevertheless, the central bank is proceeding cautiously. Only 8m shares  - one-fifth of the offer - will be available to overseas bidders, who must be institutional investors. Underlying central bank concern is possible disruption caused by large flows of foreign funds on a small, illiquid stock market. Daily turnover on the NSE rarely exceeds Ks21m and the NSE index, although volatile, is up by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year. Nairobi stock brokers believe Firestone's issue will be of interest to overseas investors wishing to obtain a toe-hold in one of Africa's emerging markets.

In addition to over 70 million U.S. dollars for the  Chengtangzhuang heating and power plant from Ka Shing-li, a  well-known Hong Kong tycoon, on the last day in 1993, there have  been many projects established in the last month:    On January 3, Malaysia's Gold Lion group signed a contract  with the city, with an investment of 4.5 billion yuan in such  fields as auto manufacturing and housing renovation.    On January 5, a conglomerate from the Republic of Korea held  a discussion with the local government on the feasibility of a  chemical project worth 400 million U.S. dollars.    On January 10, Innovation International (H.K.) Ltd. decided  to inject one billion yuan into a housing project, with another  250 million yuan on a heating and power plant.    On January 18, Hong Kong's Kuop Group signed an agreement  with the city's Hexi (the west bank of the Haihe River) area to  build a commercial mansion. It also plans to build projects in  the Tianjin development zone.    On January 20, Taiwan investors poured 600 million U.S.  dollars into the Gangwan Industrial Park.    Meanwhile, over 60 inspection teams from countries such as  the U.S., Germany, Italy, Japan and Singapore lined up to enter  the city.    Average investment for each project stands at over two  million U.S. dollars, double the investment scale last year.

Favorable GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture    Once we ""recover our GATT seat,"" Chinese agriculture will  first acquire the proper profit and development opportunities,  mainly in the following areas:    1. It will contribute to the export of Chinese farm  products and their manufactured goods. As China is a large  agricultural developing country, farm products and their  maunfactured goods have always occupied a crucial position in  our export trade. Meanwhile, most Chinese farm products still  have a clear price advantage in export trade, with most of our  domestic farm product prices now being generally lower than  their international market prices. If we export these farm  products to the international market, they will be highly  competitive. So China must and can sharply expand its export  trade in farm products and their manufactured goods. Once we  ""recover our GATT seat,"" we will win many preferential terms,  such as tariff concessions, and reduction and elimination of  nontariff measures and barriers, including quantitative  restrictions. It is of particular importance that as a  developing country, China will also enjoy according to pertinent  GATT provisions its differentiated and more favorable treatment  toward developing countries. That is, that quantitative  restrictions by developed countries on export trade with  developing ones should be more flexible, and that developed  countries should fulfill their promised committment to  developing ones to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other  barriers. The acquisition of these favorable terms will be bound  to stimulate sharp growth in the export trade of Chinese farm  products and their maunfactured goods. In addition, the  conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral GATT  negotiations will bring a sharp liberalization of farm product  trade on a worldwide scale. This will obviously be even more  favorable to farm product foreign trade.    2. It will help China to utilize foreign investment,  introduce technology, and upgrade our traditional agriculture.  GATT trade accomodation limits are now expanding from tariffs  and nontariff measures on traditional goods trade to new fields,  such as service trade, intellectual property rights, and  trade-related investment measures. The conclusion of trade  agreements in these new fields will bring definite growth  opportunities to Chinese agriculture. In the 1990s, China's  agricultural development is in an exceptionally crucial period,  during which farm product growth will need much funding and  technical support. But due to China's current stage of  industrialization, we are experiencing related domestic funding  and technology shortages. Once we ""recover our GATT seat,""  China will be able to exploit our signatory status, based on the  unconditional MFN principle and the special terms for developing  countries, to win technical, economic, and financial aid from  GATT members and international financial institutions for the  development of Chinese agriculture. Economically developed  countries and certain international business and trade  organizations are now all paying more attention to the  improvement of agricultural development conditions in developing  countries to resolve their subsistence-climate issues. In these  areas, they are all willing to provide aid, such as funding and  technology. Obviously, as a developing country and a GATT  member, we will have the full opportunity to completely utilize  such aid to build our domestic agricultural infrastructure and  improve our agricultural production conditions, in order to  reinforce our agricultural development stamina.    3. It will be favorable to China's use of developed-country  management and agricultural-development experience. China is  now in a reform period, in which our overall economy is  preparing for the transition to a socialist market economy.  Meanwhile, this period is also one in which Chinese  industrialization is making the transition from an initial stage  to an intermediate one. Faced with this reform and development  climate, we still lack experience in agricultural management and  development. But once we ""recover our GATT seat,"" China can  learn and understand from GATT members, particularly  economically developed countries, their agricultural development  principles, policies, and measures in the intermediate  industrialization period on market economy terms, drawing on  their experience to reform and forumulate China's agricultural  development policy, to promote domestic agricultural development.    4. ""GATT recovery"" will be beneficial to Chinese imports of  farm products, particularly grain. China is a country with a  relative shortage of agricultural resources, where economic  development and rapid population growth have always made  farm-product supply and demand relations very tight. To balance  these supply and demand relations, China has been a net  grain-importing country since the 1960s. Looking to the  future, as our population enters its third childbearing peak and  our economy grows quickly, our society is likely to have to  steadily increase its exports of farm products, especially  grain. According to GATT principles on concessional tariffs,  free trade, and reciprocity, China will certainly win many  concessional terms in importing such farm products from GATT  members.    II. Negative GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture    Once China acquires GATT standing, our enjoyment of the  various GATT rights will win certain favorable terms for our  agricultural development. But meanwhile, as China will have to  assume corresponding committments, such as lowering our tariffs,  reducing or eliminating nontariff barriers and measures, and  opening domestic markets, this will likely have certain negative  impacts on Chinese agricultural development, mostly in the  following areas:    1. Once China lowers tariffs and eliminates or adjusts  certain trade-restriction measures, certain low-cost and  high-quantity farm products with relative quality advantages  from other GATT countries will be bound to gain access to  Chinese markets, to compete sharply with Chinese farm products.  This will be a definite shock to certain Chinese farm  products. The most-impacted will be ones, such as food-use  vegetable oils, nonfood-use vegetable oils, rubber, lumber,  sugar, tobacco, soybeans, milk products, and tropical fruits.  In this case, domestic production of high-priced but  relatively low-quality farm products will probably be confronted  with the danger of shrinkage. And the sag in production of  these products will directly impact peasant job and income  growth.    2. Once we ""recover our GATT status,"" GATT members will  certainly demand that China open its farm product markets wider,  which will mean weakening our many import-protection measures  for farm products in ways, such as lowering tariff rates, and  reducing all tariffs and nontariff barriers and measures that  have a negative impact on farm product trade. This is likely to  have certain negative impacts on China's future agricultural  development. Since China has a huge population, a severe  shortage of agricultural resources, and an exceptionally weak  agricultural foundation, requiring domestic agriculture to  produce enough to meet most industrialization needs under these  conditions will obviously require much agricultural support, by  taking the route of protection of agriculture. Even if we  adjust our urban-rural relations and stabilize our rural social  environment, China is sill likely to have to take the route in  the future of protecting our agricultural development, which  will certainly clash with GATT principles. Based on the  regulations drafted in the previous seven rounds of GATT  negotiations, the negative impact on Chinese agriculture from  GATT reentry would seem to be not too obvious, or to be only  local. This is because we could make use of pertinent GATT  provisions to request exemption from GATT obligations, to  protect our staple farm product production and trade. But as  the Uruguay round of negotiations has been concluded, making  farm product trade more liberal, all measures that impact market  access and export competition will fall under stronger and more  effective GATT regulations and disciplines. In which case,  faced with trade liberalization and open farm product markets,  with Chinese agriculture unable to be protected more strongly,  the steady rise in production costs will very quickly dissolve  our competitive price advantage. Then subject to overseas farm  product pressure, our domestic agriculture will certainly be  faced with a stiff challenge. The first to be affected by this  challenge, and the area that will be most deeply impacted, will  be Chinese grain production. Since reform and opening, China's  domestic staple food production costs have generally risen at a  rate of more than 10 percent a year. This rise in grain  production cost has clearly brought our grain prices closer to  international grain-market prices. In the future, as farm  product marketization intensifies and production costs continue  to rise, our domestic grain prices will very quickly exceed  international market prices. At which time, with open markets  and less protection, large amounts of international grain are  likely to flood the Chinese market, which will certainly pose a  severe threat to Chinese grain production.    3. GATT reentry will affect our domestic farm product supply  and demand balance, sharpening the shortages of certain farm  products. As stated above, while most domestic farm product  prices are still generally lower than international market  prices, ""GATT reentry,"" winning us many preferential treatments,  will mean that China's farm product exports with competitive  price advantages will certainly grow sharply. But while this  growth will bring China a huge foreign exchange income, it is  also likely to quickly reduce domestic supplies of similar  products to create shortages. This is because limited by a  severe shortage of agricultural natural resources, farm product  growth is also limited, while rapid domestic economic  development and population growth will make farm product demand  ever sharper. Under these conditions, large-scale exports of  certain farm products will be bound to reduce domestic farm  product supplies, and even cause shortages.    4. In the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations, a series of  farm product trade liberalization measures were set forth, one  of the most important being the lowering of farm product  production and export subsidies by preset deadlines. While  differences exist on the extent of subsidy reduction by the  Keynes group composed of 14 countries, such as the U.S.,  Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and Canada, with the EC, GATT  members unamiously agree that subsidy reduction is imperative.  Once production and exports subsidies are lowered, the direct  impact on farm products will be higher prices. Concerned  international economists have specially studied this, holding  that the corresponding liberalization of grain trade among  industrially developed countries alone will likely bring an  average increase in world farm product prices of 22 percent.  This will include price increases of 37 percent for wheat, 26  percent for feed, 21 percent for beef and mutton, 12 percent for  pork, poultry, and eggs, 26 percent for dairy products, and 37  percent for sugar. Undoubtedly, higher farm product prices will  benefit net farm product exporting countries, enabling them to  export less farm products in exchange for more foreign exchange  income. But conversely, it will be adverse to net farm product  importing countries, as they will only acquire less farm product  imports for more foreign exchange. Since China is generally a  net farm product exporting country, reducing the various  subsidies will benefit us. But as China is a net grain  importing country, higher grain market prices will certainly  increase our foreign exchange spending on imported grain, which  will be adverse to maintaining a domestic balance between grain  supply and demand.       III. Development Policies That Chinese Agriculture Should  Choose    1. From now on, China should conduct active adjustments and  reforms in areas, such as macroeconomic organization and farm  management system, in full preparation for a positive acceptance  of all GATT impacts on agriculture. I hold that the greatest  current issues for Chinese agriculture and farm-related  industries are decentralized macroeconomic control, system  disorder, and a lack of organizational coordination mechanisms.  In such a state, China not only cannot make very good use of  the favorable terms brought to agriculture by the GATT, but also  will find it very hard to cope with the adverse impacts that it  will have on our agricultural development. So it is suggested  that China could start by organizing a policy, advisory, and  coordination agency integrating production and trade of farm  products and their manufactured goods, which agency would set  and coordinate policy related to production and trade of farm  products and their manufactured goods, providing agriculture  with policy advice and macroeconomic control in areas, such as  utilizing foreign investment, introducing technology, and  importing and exporting products.    2. We need to draw up as quickly as possible good  farm-related development policies and plans, to pave the way for  our taking full and good advantage of the favorable  opportunities brought to Chinese agricultural development by our  ""GATT reentry."" For instance, once China ""regains our GATT  seat,"" as to its export advantages for certain Chinese farm  products and their manufactured goods, we should draw up  corresponding development plans, and adopt certain incentive and  support policies. In the areas of using foreign investment,  introducing technology, and importing farm products, we could  make certain advance plans, to keep from missing opportunities  and creating unnecessary losses.    3. As to the possible negative impacts of the GATT on our  agriculture, we should also take corresponding countermeasures,  which I hold to be as follows: A. As a developing country,  China should make full use of pertinent GATT provisions, to  provide suitable protection for our production and trade of  staple farm products, by strengthening state support for  agriculture, investing the necessary funding and technology, and  actively cultivating our agricultural development capability.  B. While observing GATT provisions, and within GATT-allowed  limits, we should give our agriculture the proper support. We  need to take certain active legal, economic, and technical steps  to encourage and support farm operators in consciously reducing  material consumption, conserving labor, and raising product  quality, to ultimately improve our farm product competitive  capability. In addition, to lower agricultural production  costs and improve our product competitive advantages, China also  needs to begin to achieve land economy of scale and raise labor  productivity, by applying certain effective principles and  policies to shift our surplus agricultural workforce to other  industries. China could suitably deregulate urban job markets  and speed up nonfarm production and development, to absorb the  large amount of surplus labor that is stuck in the farm sector.  This would eliminate the waste and surplus in our agricultural  workforce, expand the operating scale of our farm workers, and  raise their labor productivity. C. Due to land-resource  limitations, China's agriculture will be able to neither produce  all of the farm products needed for our economic development, or  meet all other economic development needs as to farm product  volume. So it is recommended that starting now, China should  choose farm products with domestic production advantages and  strong links to the national economy, for priority support and  development. We should correspondingly phase out those farm  products with no domestic production advantages and weak links  to the national economy, appropriately conceding the domestic  markets for these products.    4. We need to take the initiative to lower certain farm  product import tariffs, and reduce certain nontariff measures.  Except for a few staple products, such as grain, China's current  tariff rates on most farm products and their manufactured goods  are 50-70 percent, and in some cases even as high as 150-180  percent, which is obviously too high. Once we regain our GATT  status, we will have to lower our tariff rates on certain farm  products and their manufactured goods. What method should we use  to lower tariffs that would have the minimum impact on China's  agriculture and its product trade? I hold that the more ideal  method would be to first lower tariffs on those farm products  that are less tied to our national economy. Moreover, we could  consider lowering these product tariffs more sharply.  Conversely, as to those farm products that are more tied to  our national economy, we should strictly control  tariff-adjustment times and degrees. Only in this way can we  reduce to the minimum the negative impact on our agriculture of  lower tariffs. In addition, based on GATT demands, China is  also going to have to reduce certain nontariff measures against  farm product imports. In this area, we can act in accordance  with the links between farm products and our national economy,  by taking the initiative to eliminate certain administrative  measures, such as product licenses and import examination and  approval, and by streamlining technology health-criteria  examination and customs entry formalities.

STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Softly and reverently the choir began to sing, and a knowing look flashed  across the face of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.    Sitting in the pulpit of Holman United Methodist Church on West Adams Boulevard  on Sunday, Tutu closed his eyes meditatively, and joined the choir in singing  ""Oh Freedom,"" an African-American spiritual heard often during the civil rights  movement of the 1960s:     ""And before I'd be a slave     I'd be buried in my grave     And go home to my Lord and be free.""     Tutu noted the links between the civil rights movement and the liberation  struggle in South Africa.    ""We thank you for the inspiration that we have received from your own civil  rights movement,"" he told the overflow crowd of more than 900 at the 11 a.m.  services. ""Thank you for Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you for those who were  his mentors such as James Lawson.""    Once an aide to King, Lawson, the church's pastor, was a key figure in the  civil rights movement. He is also Tutu's friend.    The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate had come to the church as part of a  10-day speaking and fund-raising tour in Southern California. While Tutu spoke  of the need to end apartheid, his message was also punctuated with his  characteristic humor.    ""When the missionaries came to our neck of the woods, we had the land and they  had the Bible,"" he said, describing the arrival of colonialism to the African  continent. ""They said, 'Let us pray,' and we foolishly closed our eyes. And  when we opened our eyes, we had the Bible and they had the land.""    The ebullient Tutu couldn't help laughing along with the congregation.    Despite his anecdote on colonialism, Tutu paid tribute to those who came to  Africa to build clinics and hospitals and to minister. The Bible, he said,  turned out to be an important tool for the oppressed people of South Africa.    ""If you wanted to oppress people, the last thing you should have made available  is the Bible because it is the most subversive -- the most revolutionary -- for  those who you would wish to be docile,"" he said.    ""You don't need a Marxist communist manifesto,"" he said. ""Nothing is more  radical (than the Bible). So we say thank you for bringing the Bible. We are  taking it seriously.""

STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Softly and reverently the choir began to sing, and a knowing look flashed  across the face of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.    Sitting in the pulpit of Holman United Methodist Church on West Adams Boulevard  on Sunday, Tutu closed his eyes meditatively, and joined the choir in singing  ""Oh Freedom,"" an African-American spiritual heard often during the civil rights  movement of the 1960s:     ""And before I'd be a slave     I'd be buried in my grave     And go home to my Lord and be free.""     Tutu noted the links between the civil rights movement and the liberation  struggle in South Africa.    ""We thank you for the inspiration that we have received from your own civil  rights movement,"" he told the overflow crowd of more than 900 at the 11 a.m.  services. ""Thank you for Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you for those who were  his mentors such as James Lawson.""    Once an aide to King, Lawson, the church's pastor, was a key figure in the  civil rights movement. He is also Tutu's friend.    The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate had come to the church as part of a  10-day speaking and fund-raising tour in Southern California. While Tutu spoke  of the need to end apartheid, his message was also punctuated with his  characteristic humor.    ""When the missionaries came to our neck of the woods, we had the land and they  had the Bible,"" he said, describing the arrival of colonialism to the African  continent. ""They said, 'Let us pray,' and we foolishly closed our eyes. And  when we opened our eyes, we had the Bible and they had the land.""    The ebullient Tutu couldn't help laughing along with the congregation.    Despite his anecdote on colonialism, Tutu paid tribute to those who came to  Africa to build clinics and hospitals and to minister. The Bible, he said,  turned out to be an important tool for the oppressed people of South Africa.    ""If you wanted to oppress people, the last thing you should have made available  is the Bible because it is the most subversive -- the most revolutionary -- for  those who you would wish to be docile,"" he said.    ""You don't need a Marxist communist manifesto,"" he said. ""Nothing is more  radical (than the Bible). So we say thank you for bringing the Bible. We are  taking it seriously.""    Tutu likened black South Africans to people set free from bondage by God.    ""We are seeing our promised land in sight now,"" he said. ""We are seeing the  possibility of a new South Africa.""    He stretched out his arms, asking: ""When God is for us . . . "" -- here the  congregation joined in, reciting the Scripture with him -- ""who can be against  us?""

The officials are considering banning cash remittances,  grounding North Korea-bound sea vessels and aircraft, conducting  export checks at Niigata on the Sea of Japan and refusing to  issue reentry permits to travelers going to the isolated  socialist state, government sources said.    North Korea denies that it is trying to build an atomic bomb  but continues to deny international inspectors access to its  more suspicious facilities. On Monday, the UN nuclear monitor  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged Pyongyang to  comply with its safeguard measures and referred the issue to the  UN Security Council, which could impose sanctions.    Analysts have suggested that the sanctions would have little  effect on the already impoverished nation, which receives  backing from China and an estimated 60 billion yen annually from  pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan.    Attempts to halt the money flow are likely to be thwarted by  a confusing array of routes the money takes through banks, in  cash, in trade transactions and through third nations on its  journey from Japan to North Korea. Some is sent to relatives of  Korean residents living in Japan but the U.S. insists the money  is being used to fund the alleged arms program.    If sanctions are imposed, the government intends to do what  it can within the limits of the law but worries about  remittances making their way to Pyongyang through third nations,  informed sources said.    Government sources suggested the Security Council will  likely  seek a way for the inspectors to complete the inspections in  North Korea and is not immediately discussing a resolution on  sanctions.    The sources said Japan intends to keep close contacts with  the U.S., China and South Korea in an attempt to reach a  peaceful resolution to the nuclear problem through dialogue.     "
0,FT932-12217 ,"FT932-12217 _AN-DD2CUAEEFT 930429   FT  29 APR 93 / Leading Article: Diagnosing Africa's ills   WHEN OXFAM, one of Britain's leading aid agencies, warns that Africa's economic crisis has put the continent on a knife edge, the world should take note. From Ethiopia in the mid-1980s to Somalia in the 1990s, Oxfam and other non-government organisations have sounded alarm bells that have aroused public opinion and jolted western governments out of complacency or indifference. This time, says Oxfam, the continent, not just a country, is in jeopardy. If its fledgling democracies are to survive and fragile peace agreements are to hold, sub-Saharan Africa needs more help. Much of its external debt should be written off; aid flows must be increased; and structural adjustment programmes reformed, Oxfam argues in its recovery plan for the region. Oxfam's proposals would be enhanced by a more detached and comprehensive examination of the causes of Africa's crisis. It puts most of the blame on external villains: the IMF and the World Bank; the banks that lent money to Africa in the 1970s; western governments which spend too much on defence and too little on aid; industrialised nations which defend protectionist trade regimes. A markedly more cautious and inhibited approach characterises Oxfam's analysis of Africa's shortcomings, past and present. Zaire's Mobutu and Malawi's Banda are roundly and rightly condemned; but there is no appraisal, for example, of ex-president Julius Nyerere's disastrous pursuit of African socialism in Tanzania. Harmful omissions The report is right to note that the slump in world commodity prices has cost Africa dearly. But it overlooks the fact that domestic policy failures caused Africa's share of the market to fall. Western defence budgets may be too high; but Africa's own military spending is still excessive. These omissions undermine Oxfam's assertion that the structural adjustment policies urged on Africa by the World Bank and the IMF have not halted the continent's decline. Its analysis suggests that this 'failure' is almost entirely the fault of the doctor and has little to do with the behaviour of the patient. Yet in Nigeria and Kenya, World Bank-supported reforms have been undermined by vested interests and endemic corruption. Oxfam barely touches on Africa's compelling need to attract foreign investment. The rate of return on foreign investment dropped from around 30 per cent in the 1960s to 2.5 per cent in the 1980s. Today, Africa's share of global foreign direct investment is 0.6 per cent. Alarming symptoms Whatever the dispute about the cure, however, the symptoms of the disease are alarming. The external debt crisis is getting worse not better, while rescheduling has done little more than prolong the agony. Africa's debt was Dollars 56bn in 1980, 29 per cent of GNP. Twelve years later, further enervated by war and drought, it owes Dollars 180bn, over 100 per cent of annual gross national product. The IMF and the Bank are hard-pressed to find an African country where structural adjustment has led to a sustained recovery that has not been supported by continuing aid. Recovery is made all the more difficult by trade hurdles. The average tariff on cocoa beans, an important African export, is only 2.6 per cent, on chocolate nearly 12. Such tariff escalation reinforces Africa's dependence on primary commodities by discouraging investment in local processing. However serious the constraints imposed by an unfavourable external environment, there can be no excuse for the way that Oxfam underplays domestic shortcomings. This may have something to do with the fact that it has to live with the governments it criticises. But the report's inhibited treatment of Africa's faults suggests some members of Oxfam are still fighting under the banner of a discredited ideology, reluctant to surrender a vision that harks back to the heyday of African socialism. Oxfam weakens its own case. Its warning that Africa is in peril is timely. But to the extent that its assessment of structural adjustment is inadequate, the alternatives it proposes lose credibility. If Oxfam allows erring African governments to avoid shouldering their share of the blame for the continent's crisis, it does a disservice to Africa's citizens.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

This new high-tech  product, the subject of competitive research and  commercialization in the U.S., Japan, Germany, and other  advanced nations, has several advantages over Ni/Cd batteries,  including higher capacity, avoidance of Cd pollution, and  larger-current charging and discharging. The 863AA Ni/MH  battery developed by the authors has the following key  performance indicators: nominal capacity exceeds 1000 mAh, 5-A  discharge-to-0.8-V average capacity exceeds 950mAh (95 percent  of rated capacity), low-temperature (-18ëC) 0.2-A  discharge-to-1.0-V average capacity is 835 mAh (83 percent of  rated capacity), seven-day self-discharge is 15 percent, 28-day  self-discharge is 29 percent, and lifetime is over 500 cycles  (based on 1.75-h 400-mA charge, 1.25-h 400-mA discharge test).  These parameters meet international standards, and  low-temperature performance is state of the art. The authors  have completed batch trial-production, and have constructed an  intermediate-testing base with a single-shift annual output of  500,000 units [for details, see JPRS-CEN-93-006, 23 Jun 93, p  23].

0,FT934-7737 ,"FT934-7737 _AN-DKRC7AGRFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (13): A quantum leap - Johannesburg Stock Exchange      By PHILIP GAWITH   BACK in 1986 when sanctions began in earnest, the US sold and Europe bought. Now, at least as far as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is concerned, the positions are reversed. Europe is cautious, the US euphoric. Down on Diagonal Street, home of the JSE, brokers groan pleasurably at the stampede of US investors knocking on their door - a veritable Wall Street who's who. Of course, the US presence on the JSE has already been highly visible in 1993, being largely responsible for driving the bull markets in bonds and gold shares. But since ANC president Nelson Mandela called for the lifting of economic sanctions in September, interest has soared. Once limited to speculators, hedge funds and specialists, especially on the gold board, the heavy artillery is massing just over the brow. It will be some time yet before the debris of US state and municipal sanctions is finally cleared, and fund managers who are responsible to trustees will keep a watchful eye on political developments before making any significant decisions. The view on Diagonal Street, however, is that it is now a question of when, rather than if, funds flow. A broker comments: 'If you aggregate the figures we've heard, there'll be a lot of sheep trying to get through a very narrow gate.' One Hong Kong fund manager visitingJohannesburg said he was convinced investors would drive the price/earnings ratio of the JSE from 15 to 25, as they have with other emerging markets. As JSE-watchers point out, it is hardly a typical emerging market - more than 100 years old and with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 145bn (at the financial rand exchange rate of R4.30/Dollars 1), it is one of the 10 largest in the world. There are about 80 stocks with a market capitalisation of more than Dollars 200m, the cut-off point often used by international fund managers to identify stocks they are prepared to hold. Hence the preference among analysts for describing the JSE as a 're-emerging' market. Two caveats need to be entered about the bull scenario for the JSE. First, if the main international stock markets crack, the Dow Jones industrial index in particular, then the JSE is sure to follow. Second, South Africa must achieve a relatively stable political transition. Assuming these hurdles are cleared, then the case for the JSE is easily developed. US investors and fund managers are looking to invest an increasing portion of their assets outside the US to improve returns. Given the JSE accounts for about 0.9 per cent of total world stock market capitalisation, and most US fund managers hold little if any SA stock, it is reasonable to assume a flow of funds. Until recently, virtually no US analysts followed South African stocks. As they start to cover them, so funds are likely to follow. A recent study of 47 global emerging market funds (mostly UK and US) by the UK group Micropal shows that as at June 30, 1993, only 0.07 per cent of their Dollars 8bn assets were invested in South Africa. This process will gather impetus when Morgan Stanley develops a South Africa index for inclusion in its world index, and should the International Finance Corporation grant the JSE emerging market status. (SA stocks qualify because domestic per capita income is below the Dollars 7,910 cut-off). The case for the JSE is considerably hardened by fairly reliable talk of six to seven South (or southern) Africa country funds being established. Alliance Capital Management Corporation, one of the largest investment management funds in the US with about Dollars 110bn of funds under management, and backed by Merrill Lynch, has already lodged a prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch The Southern Africa Fund - a closed end investment company. These funds could easily raise Dollars 500m. Dollars 500m The chief concern about any large inflow of funds is whether the JSE, with its notoriously poor tradeability, can manage them. Latest JSE figures show annualised liquidity at about 7 per cent, but in recent years this has been closer to 4 per cent. Figures from Johannesburg brokers Ivor Jones, Roy  Co show the most liquid domestic industrial stock, SA Breweries, has a monthly turnover of only Dollars 12m. The most liquid stock, by a long margin, is De Beers, with a monthly turnover of about Dollars 57m. The main cause of the low liquidity is exchange control. South Africa's large institutional cash flows - about R40bn per annum, of which at least a quarter will make its way into equities - are forced to chase a small pool of domestic quality scrip. Understandably, the good stock they get they are inclined to hold. If strong buying pressures do materialise, then the upward trend of prices will help loosen stock. The yield-driven, short-term focus of some of the speculative funds already in the JSE will make it more volatile, and also boost liquidity. South African bonds will also attract attention. Real yields on long bonds of around 8 per cent for foreign investors compare favourably with the returns available in industrial countries. South Africa is a good risk not to default, the market is well organised and liquid, with more than Dollars 1bn daily trading volume common, the bonds offer prospective capital gains from the fall in inflation, and there is the possibility of currency gains from the appreciation of the financial rand. Investments on the JSE are done through the volatile financial rand, whose movements are capable of wiping out gains in the underlying investments. For investors coming into the bond market in particular, where volumes are quite large, they have to buy the currency before the bond. As one broker commented: 'The currency leg is the narrow gate, not the bond.' Political stability will help stabilise this market, but investors should treat it with caution.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICA: COMPARABLE EQUITY MARKETS*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                  Market             Turnover                             cap                (% of                  (USDollars bn)              mkt cap                                              traded)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong                   231                   23 South Africa                189                    4 Australia                   153                   19 Brazil                      144                   11 Mexico                      130                   15 Taiwan                      121                  155 Korea                       119                   91 Malaysia                    111                   36 Thailand                     62                   39 Singapore                    60                   38 Chile                        34                    3 Argentina                    27                   19 New Zealand                  18                   11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Markets ranked by market capitalisation, 1993 data Source: SG Warburg Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN TRADING ON THE JSE EQUITIES MARKET (Rm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993* Purchases      2,970    8,498   10,471    6,644    4,808    8,606 Sales          2,909    5,116    5,999    2,544    4,801    6,636 Net purchases     61    3,382    4,472    4,100        7    1,970  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Up to October 31 Source: Johannesburg Stock Exchange  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

A panel for The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and  field, may also decide the length of the suspensions for all the individuals  who participated. The length has yet to be specified.    Among the athletes requested to attend today's hearing are Carol Cady, the U.S.  record-holder in the discus; John Powell, bronze medalist in the discus at the  1976 and 1984 Olympics; Ruth Wysocki, a 1984 Olympian at 800 and 1,500 meters,  and James Robinson, the 1979 Pan American Games champion at 800 meters. The  case of Skip Robinson, track coach at Pasadena City College, also will be  heard.    In addition, two athletes who were suspended at the first hearing, in Chicago  Nov. 18, will have their cases heard today. Neither long jumper Tyrus Jefferson  nor pole vaulter Tom Hintnaus was able to attend the Chicago hearing.    Eleven athletes and coaches have been suspended indefinitely for participating  in the tour, which went to three South African cities last October. Track and  field athletes are prohibited from competing in South Africa because the  country is not a member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the  sport's world governing body. South Africa was suspended from the organization  in 1976 because of its official policy of racial separation.    According to Rich Nichols, a panel member, the case of Ted Banks, track coach  at Riverside City College, may also be heard. Banks' case was deferred from a  Dec. 15 hearing in Covina after a legal disagreement about TAC's jurisdiction  over a college coach.    Four athletes from Riverside competed on the tour, and Banks is under fire from  student groups at the school for his role as a tour organizer.    The fallout continues for Banks. This week, a prominent African athlete, under  pressure from his government, withdrew from Riverside City College. Julius  Kariuki of Kenya, the Olympic gold medalist in the steeplechase at Seoul, was  reportedly told that because of Banks' participation in the South African tour,  Kariuki could no longer compete for the school. Kariuki set several national  junior college records at Riverside last season.    Nichols said that if time permitted, the panel would set forth the specific  penalties for each participant. The sanctions are expected to vary according to  the extent of the individual's participation and his knowledge of the  ramifications of going to South Africa.

MALNUTRITION IS WIDESPREAD AND PLEDGES OF AID HAVE FALLEN OFF SHARPLY.      By IAN MacKENZIE, REUTERS      MAPUTO, Mozambique      Peace is proving an elusive commodity in Mozambique, where a population of 15  million is teetering on the edge of famine.    ""Every issue you discuss always comes back to the same point -- the need for  peace,"" said a senior European diplomat.    Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk's efforts to end his country's racial separation  policy of apartheid are also backing the Renamo guerrillas fighting the  Mozambique government.    ""The people trying to stop the internal revolution in South Africa are the same  people destabilizing Mozambique,"" the European diplomat said. ""If you believe  the revolution in South Africa is irreversible, you must believe peace will  come back to Mozambique. War doesn't make sense anymore.""    The head of the U.N. development program in Mozambique, Peter Simkin, warned  that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the  population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic.    More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the United  Nations estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years  beginning with 1980.    ""Mozambique is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area  of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or  early next year and we have no resources to fall back on,"" Simkin said in an  interview. ""We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive  relief campaign.""    Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the  Persian Gulf crisis, reconstruction demands for Eastern Europe and ""donor  weariness.""    Government and church leaders in Mozambique were optimistic in early September  that a peace agreement with Renamo was possible after two rounds of talks in  Rome. President Joaquim Chissano, who has promised the country's first-ever  multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked  about peace by Christmas.    But Renamo's refusal to attend a third round of talks in September has deadened  optimism, with Chissano throwing the blame squarely on the rebels.    Diplomats note the ruling Frelimo Party in Maputo has basically preempted all  Renamo demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market  economy, political pluralism and a free press.    ""You know if you have an open multi-party system, Renamo has no hope of gaining  power,"" one diplomat said.    The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of Zimbabwe troops from  Mozambique and an end to attacks on Renamo base areas as a prerequisite for  further talks.    Diplomats estimate Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops in Mozambique, primarily to  protect the so-called Beira corridor rail link from Zimbabwe to the Indian  Ocean port of Beira.    "" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all Zimbabwe  troops,"" President Chissano told journalists at the United Nations in New York  recently. ""All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops  should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow  if possible.""    Renamo, the Mozambique Resistance Movement, originally was set up by the white  minority government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia as a destabilizing  force after Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in June, 1975.    Diplomats in southern Africa said the Rhodesians recruited Renamo guerrillas  from among black members of Portugal's former colonial forces. They were used  primarily against black nationalists operating out of Mozambique against  Rhodesia.    When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe with independence in 1980, the former white  security forces handed Renamo over to South Africa, which continued to use it  against Maputo.    Pretoria and Maputo signed the Nkomati Accord of nonaggression and  good-neighborliness in 1984 and the South African government subsequently cut  all official links with Renamo.    Chissano himself has said he trusted Pretoria's good faith.    Diplomats also believe South Africa severed ties with Renamo, cutting it off  from weapons and communications supplies.    But they said it appears right-wing groups in South Africa, including  Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in Mozambique,  continued to support the rebels.    They believe other support came from groups within Portugal -- Renamo's  official headquarters are in Lisbon -- and also Britain, West Germany and the  United States.

Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov also confirmed that Ukraine  had already removed 17 of the 46 modern SS-24 missiles it  possesses from their silos and had disconnected their nuclear  warheads. Each has 10 warheads.    Shmarov, the government's point man on nuclear disarmament,  told AFP the United States had proposed that Ukraine receive  free fuel for its nuclear power stations for the next five years  as compensation for giving up the 176 strategic missiles it  possesses.    ""This is a big step by all sides towards reaching a  compromise,"" Shmarov said.    He stated that the United States had also proposed that  Ukraine's estimated two billion-dollar debt to Russia for energy  supplies be erased to compensate for the smaller tactical  nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukrainian territory by May 1992.    Shmarov said Russia had agreed to the scheme. Russian  officials declined to comment.    He said that within 10 days another three SS-24s will have  been deactivated as a ""goodwill gesture"" by Ukraine.    Shmarov stated that Kiev may consider the deactivated SS-24s  as among the missiles it agreed to get rid of under its  qualified ratification of the 1991 START treaty.    ""We retain the view that the missiles representing the  biggest ecological danger must be destroyed first,"" Shmarov  said, referring to 130 older SS-19 long-range missiles.    Ukraine signed agreements last year in which it pledged to  respect the START treaty, accede to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and get rid of all the nuclear weapons  on its soil.    The Ukrainian parliament however ratified START earlier this  year with the stipulation that it only applied to 42 percent of  the 176 strategic nuclear missiles from the former Soviet  arsenal based in the country.

0,FT932-14415 ,"FT932-14415 _AN-DDSCSADTFT 930419   FT  19 APR 93 / Conspiracy fears mounton eve of Hani funeral: 15 are shot dead as tension rises in South Africa      By PATTI WALDMEIR   FIFTEEN people, including three children, were killed and 12 wounded in shootings in a black township near Johannesburg last night, as tension in South Africa rose on the eve of today's funeral of the assassinated activist Mr Chris Hani. Tens of thousands of grieving blacks yesterday paid their last respects to Mr Hani, whose body lay in state near Soweto. His funeral, one of the largest political events ever in South Africa, comes as evidence is emerging that his death may have been part of a right-wing conspiracy to destabilise democracy talks. In last night's shootings, black gunmen opened fire on people in the township of Sebokeng. Police said the shootings started when the men killed two people and stole their car, which was later found burnt out. A motive for the attacks was not known. The shootings heightened the atmosphere of emotion and turmoil as South Africa prepared for Mr Hani's funeral, to be held in the mainly white, working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot by a white assassin on April 10. Boksburg residents have been barricading their homes and putting up razor wire for fear of clashes between black mourners and local whites. A crowd of 30,000 gathered to honour Mr Hani as his body lay in an open casket at a soccer stadium outside Soweto. They sang songs in praise of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National Congress military wing. ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who once commanded Umkhonto in exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in military fatigues and surrounded by flowers. Police meanwhile interrogated a prominent right-wing white, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect in Mr Hani's assassination. Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council, part of the government's executive branch. He regularly made news headlines for racist comments, including an incident in 1989 when he commented 'what a pity' on hearing that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the runway at Johannesburg airport. His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy extending beyond the lunatic white fringe to the top of the right-wing establishment. The other suspect, Mr Janusz Walus, is a member of the ultra-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Political analysts say involvement of the Conservative party, which polled 800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, would be far more worrying than that of the AWB, a militarist organisation which has vowed to carry out a 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr Derby-Lewis, police held a second right-wing supporter, who shot two black protesters on Saturday. The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right. The resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the ruling National party, and the ultra-right has lost its image of inactivity.

Last summer's meeting between then-President Pieter W. Botha and Nelson  Mandela, imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, was a signal of  the South African government's recognition that the country's future cannot be  settled unless there is dialogue with credible opposition leaders. Internal and  external pressures, among which sanctions are only one element, have helped  persuade South African leaders that the well-being of the white minority cannot  be sustained without a negotiated political settlement that results in  political equality for all South Africans.    Claiming a mandate for change after last fall's elections, President Frederik  W. de Klerk has taken a number of encouraging steps to get this process under  way. He has permitted peaceful anti-apartheid demonstrations and rallies, freed  leading political prisoners, announced plans to discard the Separate Amenities  Act, scaled down the state security apparatus and met with credible black  leaders, including Mandela. It is premature to predict whether these steps will  lead to a continuing dialogue, but they constitute tangible evidence that  things are changing, and they offer reason for hope.    The United States has long regarded dialogue among all South Africans as the  most important first step in the process of change. Moves that would further  enhance prospects for dialogue include: an end to violence on all sides; the  release of all political prisoners, including Mandela; the lifting of the state  of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity and freedom of  association for the black opposition, and the unbanning of all political  organizations, including the African National Congress.    U.S. policy toward South Africa is guided by five basic principles:     -- Unequivocal opposition to apartheid;     -- Commitment to building a post-apartheid democratic South Africa through  assistance to black South Africans;     -- Active U.S. diplomacy to resolve conflicts and support economic development  throughout southern Africa;     -- Cooperation with our allies and other concerned nations in a multilateral  approach to South Africa;     -- Maintenance of a bipartisan consensus with Congress on our general approach  to the region.    For its part, the anti-apartheid movement must look beyond the rhetoric of the  past to find creative ways of responding to the unexpected opportunities that  may now be arising. Anti-apartheid activists should work to achieve consensus  among diverse and often hostile opposition elements, and to formulate  constructive principles for the negotiating process that may be emerging. There  are signs that such an effort, with the support of the international community,  is already beginning.    The ANC has indicated that it is taking the possibility of dialogue seriously.  Its expressed preference for the path of negotiated and peaceful settlement was  endorsed in 1989 by the Organization of African Unity. The consensus  declaration adopted at the conclusion of the United Nations special session on  apartheid Dec. 14 not only urged the people of South Africa to join together to  negotiate an end to apartheid; it also postulated fundamental principles that  could constitute the basis for an internationally acceptable solution in South  Africa.

Castro made the remark as he boarded an airplane in Accra,  the capital of Ghana, after a 12-hour stopover en route to  Pretoria, where the first black president in South African  history will take office on 10 May.    ""I am very pleased to have stopped over in Ghana and to have  met with the Ghanaian people,"" said the Cuban leader, whom  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings welcomed last night at  Katoka Airport.    Concerning his meeting with Rawlings, a longtime friend,  Castro said he was very pleased, although the meeting was very  brief, because Rawlings was also traveling to South Africa.    Castro's trip to South Africa is an important, historic  event. Mandela was in jail just five years ago for trying to  eliminate the system of apartheid and when Cuban troops were  fighting in southern Angola against the South African Army.     "

In an emotional ceremony held just after dawn at the Ohlange High School in the black township of Inanda outside Durban, Mr Mandela repeated the eloquent words with which he addressed the court which in 1964 sentenced him to what were to be 27 years in prison: 'I have fought very firmly throughout my life against white domination and I have fought very firmly against black domination . . . I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all South Africans are equal and where all South Africans work together to bring about security, peace and democracy.' The stately Mr Mandela, dressed in a simple beige shirt buttoned tight at the neck and casual trousers, flashed his radiant smile for the cameras as he held his ballot poised above the polling box for several seconds before dropping it in with the cry, 'Going, going, gone.' Nonetheless, the grey-haired African National Congress leader appeared visibly strained by the three-month election campaign. Surrounded by at least 20 security guards, he looked tired and drained, and every bit his age. 'This is for all South Africans an unforgettable occasion. It is the realisation of the hopes and dreams we have cherished over the decades: the dream of a South Africa that represents all South Africans. It is the beginning of a new era,' he said afterwards. Speaking outside in the school yard, Mr Mandela repeated the message he stressed incessantly in the final days of campaigning. 'We are very concerned about minorities, especially about the white minority,' he said, adding in a radio interview only seconds after his vote: 'We would like the white community to realise that we cannot build this country without them. We are appealing to them to regard themselves as an essential part of the transition' to democracy. It was a good start towards the goal of a non-racial nation. There is a hard road ahead.

Mr Nelson Mandela, glowing with the energy that comes from victory, led the joyous high-stepping celebration of black South Africa's emancipation from apartheid. It began in the ballroom of a Johannesburg city hotel bedecked with bunting and balloons in the black, green and gold of the African National Congress. By mid-evening it had spread through the exuberant black townships. 'Free at last, free at last, thank God free at last,' declared South Africa's next president, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King. The famous phrase rang across South Africa and around the world as the 75-year-old Mr Mandela reached the final, triumphal summit of a journey that began when he was a young advocate, and has taken him via Robben Island's cells to leadership of his country. Mr Mandela's declaration of victory included graceful acceptance of departing President F. W. de Klerk's declaration of defeat but had a steely undertone of single-minded dedication to his goal. 'I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of love for all of you,' he said. 'Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I will be back at our desks, rolling up our sleeves to begin tackling the problems our country faces . . . let's get South Africa working. This means creating jobs, building houses, providing education and bringing peace and security for all.' Behind Mr Mandela the ranks of the ANC choir broke into song, the packed audience joined in and the dancing began. Mr Mandela's elbows sawed the air. The former boxer, moving like a cross between Mohammed Ali and Michael Jackson, led the dancing of a night to remember. From the stage came the resonant baritone of ex-president Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, whose country paid such a high price for its role as ANC headquarters and who was an honoured guest. On the dance floor the audience contained almost as many whites, coloureds and Indians as blacks. Groups in the hall began the toyi-toyi, the universal dance of black South Africa - knees raised high, a sort of dancing on the spot, once performed at the barricades of Soweto and black townships around the land but last night an exuberant celebration of the new South Africa.

0,FT941-11128 ,"FT941-11128 _AN-EBFAAAD9FT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Shelling out on growth - Partners faced with losing Pounds 1m find their fortune in the garden      By DAVID SPARK   When Derek Spice and Jane Hanckel moved to Afton Manor on the Isle of Wight in 1988, they needed to make money. They were in the process of losing more than Pounds 1m - Pounds 200,000 on their former home in Virginia Water, Pounds 500,000 at Lloyd's where Spice was a Name, and Pounds 500,000 in shares in a motor-accessories company from which he resigned when it went public in 1986. It went into liquidation in 1991. At Afton Manor they offered bed and breakfast, opened a camp site and imported a lorryload of cocoa shell as a mulch for their own and other gardens. B  B meant breakfasts at 7am, and campers kept turning up at any time, including weekends. This experience focused their minds: 'We decided that the business with the least aggro and most potential was cocoa shell,' said Hanckel. They called the shell Sunshine of Africa and it has proved a winner: it was made a 'best buy' in a Which? survey which compared it with garden mulches based on tree bark, and it was used last February in a BBC gardening programme. The partners expect to sell more than Pounds 1m-worth in their current year. The shells used are stripped from cocoa beans during the cocoa-making process. When applied to the garden, they preserve moisture in the soil and, when they break down, supply plant nutrients. Cocoa makers normally sell the shell ground up for cattle food but gardens need it to be as undamaged as possible. Unbroken shell takes up four times the volume and so needs more lorries to move it - and it can require cocoa factories to amend their manufacturing processes to avoid damage. Spice and Hanckel financed the business themselves by selling their Porsche and some life assurance policies. A picture of the Porsche hangs nostalgically in their office. The pair moved to the Isle of Wight because they liked the sense of community: 'People were here because they wanted to be here. We had been living near the M25 where, not surprisingly, we had the feeling people were just going round in circles,' said Spice. He had always used cocoa shell on his own garden, following the advice of his father, a former managing director of Gill and Duffus, commodity traders. After leaving Gill and Duffus, Spice's father had set up WG Spice and Co, a cocoa processor at Hook in Hampshire, and Spice worked there for a while. And so Spice initially went to Hook for cocoa shell supplies. In February 1989 he and Hanckel advertised their produce, offering a minimum of two 140-litre bags at Pounds 5 a bag and the Isle of Wight proved an ideal test market. Gardeners used it and then their neighbours wanted it too. Soon, Ventnor Botanic Gardens and the horticultural department at the island's college became customers. In a year, the partners sold 1,500 bags, five lorryloads. Articulated lorries visited Afton Manor and unloaded the shell on the tennis court where the gardener and two helpers shovelled it into sacks. The next step was to sell Sunshine of Africa through garden centres. They designed their own waterproof bags and a display stand, which helped Spice to persuade four garden centres to order 150 bags on his first day of selling. They soon had deals with garden centres in all the main urban areas and by March 1992 were advertising Sunshine of Africa nationally. One difficulty was to match sales to the supply of cocoa shell: garden centres like to place orders in September and take delivery and make payment the following spring. The company now takes out bank loans, secured against business assets, to help bridge this gap. Spice and Hanckel lost an important supplier when the WG Spice plant at Hook ceased production. A replacement supply was found when Nestle, the food and drink group, agreed to sell the shell from a new processing unit at York. The company expects to sell Pounds 1.6m-worth of cocoa shell in the year to July, against Pounds 650,000 in the last year, and aims for a net profit of between 10 and 12 per cent. Shell prices have risen but the volume of business makes up for smaller margins. The price in a garden centre is currently Pounds 9.99 to Pounds 12.50 for a 120-litre bag. It is also sold in three smaller sizes. Other companies now supply shell for British gardens but Spice and Hanckel were prepared for this, which is why they have sold Sunshine of Africa as a brand, not cocoa shell as a commodity. With 90 per cent of the market, they also expect interest from the bigger companies whose mulches were beaten into second place in the Which? survey. Their next plan is to offer licences and know-how to other countries: quite a big step for a product that was test-marketed in the gardens of the Isle of Wight.

In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial  Times, Mr de Klerk stressed the importance of economic growth to  meet the needs of what he called ""a lost generation"" of South  Africans.    But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to  undermine the status of the Afrikaans language, saying it would  drive many of his National Party supporters into the arms of the  far right.    A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of  strain after a gruelling election campaign made clear that he  looked forward to contesting the presidency in the next  election.    The National Party, he said, had won support from about l  million black voters in addition to over 3 million votes from  whites, coloureds and Indians. He was determined to help  make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela work, he  said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a  share of success when contesting the next election. The party  accepted the need to tackle housing backlogs and improve health  and educational facilities for black South Africa -- any  difference with the ANC was ""not about the needs of the people,  but how you fund the programme.""    This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly  through export promotion and encouraging foreign investment.    He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development  Programme  drawn up by the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a  single party, but of the government of national unity. ""But we  must be assured that we will not give way on the need for fiscal  discipline"", he said.    How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for  the coalition government and the need for a watchdog opposition  role? ""I am on a learning curve on this,"" replied Mr de Klerk.  But from discussions with leaders of coalition governments in  Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two options. ""You can  either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you can do  your homework initially... and agree in detail what joint  policy will be, and then test everything that happens against  this (agreement)"" -- and this was the approach he had adopted.    He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over  the  composition of the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr  Derek Keys as finance minister as one of the critical  portfolios, in addition to agriculture, constitutional affairs,  as well as his own role as executive vice president.    Asked whether the government of national unity could become  ""more or less permanent"", Mr de Klerk replied: ""Not necessarily  in this form.""    ""Power sharing"", he went on, ""should be a feature of the  final constitution (to be drawn up by the country's National  Assembly)"" arguing, as he has done frequently in the past, that  a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote should not get 100 per  cent of the power.    But he stressed that ""there are other ways of achieving it  than though an enforced coalition. One would be to give to the  regions more powers, though not necessarily more functions,"" he  said.    ""For certain types of important decisions the president  might  not be able to take them on his own, he must call in the  premiers of the nine provinces"". Alternatively, Mr de Klerk  suggested, ""the senate could more effectively represent minority  interests, to control the power of the party with the majority.""    But he underlined the fact that ""it is not about vetoes --  it  is about effectively preventing the misuse of power to the  detriment of language, religion, certain black minority groups"".    ""I don't think we should have enforced coalitions,"" Mr de  Klerk went on, ""but when (the current system) falls away, we  need to broaden the package of how to share power in other ways,  through local government for example.""    ""We have got to balance the situation between the fears of  minorities and the democratic need to have real power which  comes with being a majority (party).""    ""An enforced coalition"", he continued, ""will not wash, it  won't work either. But I predict we are going to have  coalitions any way.""    Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de  Klerk urged the international community ""not to remove us from  their agenda. They need us, they need to address the problems  of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play -- but only if we are  successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa) to the  full.""    ""We need sustained dynamic economic growth,"" said Mr de  Klerk. ""We will be focusing on exports and developing the new  markets that have become available to us, we have to get our  productivity up, and develop the potential of tourism, with lots  of jobs.""    Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however when he  responded to questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was  ""very dangerous"" he warned, to undermine the language, pointing  as an example to the dropping of announcements in Afrikaans on  board South African Airways.    ""It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the  force  that they are today...if you want me to lose their support, rub  them up the wrong way about the language. You will drive back  into the arms of the far right.""    Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last  minute decision of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the  Inkatha Freedom Party, to take part in the election.    ""Realism took over,"" he said. ""If Chief Buthelezi didn't  come  aboard we might have faced a very serious security situation"".  All parties, including Chief Buthelezi, realised this.    Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press  that  he had struck a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation,  giving extra land to the former Kwazulu homeland within Natal.  ""At no time was I involved in any discussion on that issue that  was election related""    Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk  said  it was ""at tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential""  but it ""can be managed in an orderly way."" The government has  ""already identified vast tracts of land"" which could be made  available to people dispossessed during the apartheid era.    But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South  Africa could play a major role in Rwanda. First the country's  security forces had successfully to conclude the integration of  regular units and members of the ANC armed wing. South Africa  also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he said,  notably the war in Angola.    Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel  Laureate lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a  large middle class placed South Africa ""qualitatively and  quantitively in quite a different league from any other African  society,"" he told the audience. ""We will be able to break the  cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that  many of our African neighbours share our success.""     "

Mandela signed the proclamation in Umtata on Tuesday night  which gives a further period of temporary immunity from  prosecution for politically motivated ""crimes"".    The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette  Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice  requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until  May 17 1995.    Returned exiles who re-entered South Africa and whose names  appeared in three government notices published in May 1993 and  February and March 1994 will be covered in the proclamation.    The previous indemnity period, authorised by former State  President FW de Klerk, expired on Tuesday.    Its objective was to allow exiles who admitted to ""political  crimes"" committed before October 8 1990 to return to South  Africa to engage in constitutional negotiations.    First promulgated in 1990, the Act became the Further  Indemnity Act after it was amended in 1992.    However, the new dispensation will not cover those who have  committed criminal acts, whether political or not, since May  1993.     "

At the start of the Fifth German Business  Asia-Pacific Conference, the minister approved ""political  support"" from the Federal Government. Speaking on behalf of  over 200 participants, Siemens chief Heinrich von Pierer called  for a ""change of direction"" in how German companies think about  foreign countries and favored an ""innovation partnership"" with  Asian economies.    Rexrodt considers ""company presence in the form of direct  investment, cooperation agreements, and the exchange of  technology and know-how"" essential for Germany to meet the  challenge of the Asian Pacific region of rapid economic growth.  The Federal Government also wants to provide more support for  German industry's foreign interests. Rexrodt rejected public  export and investment subsidies, but promised ""political  support"" from Bonn. ""Business can expect politicians to seek to  achieve equal opportunities, that they will help to remove  political restrictions on entry to markets.""    In response to complaints from some conference participants  that the Federal Government was doing relatively little for  German business abroad, Rexrodt said: ""We can only succeed in  obtaining what we want if companies name specific obstacles.""  As far as Rexrodt is concerned, equal competitive opportunities  particularly apply to finance. The minister announced that  Hermes instruments would be reformed to meet new challenges  before parliament's summer recess.    Rexrodt rejected state-subsidized ""soft loans,"" which  governments use to assist companies in obtaining large contracts  for the development of regional infrastructure. ""We will not  open the floodgates."" On the other hand, the minister considers  the protection of German foreign investment, including capital  guarantees, to belong to the ""core of foreign economic policy.""  ""Advertising Germany"" through fairs and technology shows is also  in the state's interest and should be developed in the same way  as foreign trade chambers' information and advisory networks.  Medium-sized businesses should be the main beneficiary and be  encouraged to view Asia as more than just a market for sales  crises, but should nail their colors to the mast there  permanently.    Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak,  who  welcomed the German managers who had gathered in Bangkok, also  pointed to this dilemma in company strategy. He criticized  ""declining interest"" in investment in his country and the  one-sided concentration on selling finished products. Siemens  President Heinrich von Pierer called for a ""change of direction""  in this sense. As the chairman of German business's Asia  Pacific commission, von Pierer complained that the region  accounted for 10 percent of German exports, but only 3 to 4  percent of German investment. Whereas Japan has invested 58  billion German marks [DM] in the southeast Asian ASEAN  countries, Germany has only invested DM2 billion in this boom  region with a growth rate of between 7 and 10 percent.

Franco, who is 62, sent Mandela a 62-line message stating  that his victory revitalizes freedom, and represents a sign of  hope for humankind and a historic deed for South Africa that  will have repercussions over the entire African continent.    Franco told Mandela: ""The long epic battle Your Excellency  and the African National Congress have fought against racial  discrimination has been closely followed from this side of the  Atlantic Ocean, with a profound spirit of solidarity.""    Franco pointed out that the new political panorama will make  it possible to promote bilateral relations and cooperation, the  potential of which he considers to be unexplored.    In a note sent to current South African President Frederick  de Klerk, Franco praised his stature as a statesman, which made  possible the transition process culminating in the installation  in South Africa of a multiracial democracy.

By MICHAEL HOLMAN   RHODESIANS NEVER DIE by Peter Godwon and Ian Hancock Oxford Pounds 35, 400 pages SMALL WARS, SMALL MERCIES by Jeremy Harding Viking Pounds 18, 442 pages HIGH NOON IN SOUTHERN AFRICAby Chester Crocker W W Norton Dollars 24.95, 384 pages 'Rhodesian born, Rhodesian bred, strong in arm, thick in head'. This disparaging ditty appears in Rhodesians Never Die, a fascinating and learned analysis of the tribe to which I belong, albeit as a renegade member. Strong of arm, certainly. At one stage Rhodesia had enough cricketers in English county sides to have made up a decent Test XI. Not so thick in head. Those who have made their intellectual mark abroad include the former editor of The Economist, a senior member of the British government, and a host of businessmen, writers and academics. Not bad for Surbiton in Africa. Nevertheless the ditty could well serve, broadly speaking, as the conclusion to a demolition of the myths and delusions which sustained white Rhodesia in the 1970s. Also revealed is the skullduggery and rivalry in the ranks of the security forces during the last days of white rule. The remarkable transition to peace and independence in 1980 was closer to disaster than most people realised. Much of the tribe is now scattered around the world, a harmless post-colonial diaspora. A contact magazine offers nostalgia, army memorabilia, and the news that Jock and Hazel, ex-Fort Victoria, offer a bed and beer to 'Rhodies' passing through Vancouver. Yet for nearly 15 years Jock and Hazel and their like defied the world. Never more than 275,000 of them, and outnumbered 15 to 1 by blacks, they were eventually ground down by sanctions and a guerrilla war. Over 20,000 people died - 468 white and 7,790 black civilians, 1,361 members of the security forces (just under half of them white) and 10,450 guerrillas. By comparison South Africa is getting off lightly. Apartheid's death toll over the past decade is under 10,000. On a deaths-to-population ratio, South Africa would have to endure 120,000 fatalities before reaching a settlement. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 brought out the best and the worst of white Rhodesia, caught up in the myth of a frontier society of pioneer stock which defended Christian values. Most were not Rhodesian-born; the majority were immigrants, as Godwin and Hancock point out. But they kept Morris Minors on the road, and Viscounts in the air, longer than anyone thought possible. They broke sanctions with ingenuity, and either manufactured what they formerly imported, or managed without. The dark side is that white Rhodesia tortured its enemies, executed jailed guerrillas in secret and lacked the decency to tell next-of-kin, and compulsorily regrouped thousands of peasant families in 'protected villages' which became urban slums. All this was known. Other truly terrible deeds have since been revealed. Ken Flower, Smith's intelligence chief, recruited a black church minister to supply poisoned clothing to youngsters who thought they were joining the guerrillas. Hundreds died a horrible death; Flower had the minister assassinated to avoid exposure, but recounts the tale in his autobiography. As Donal Lamont, the deported Catholic bishop observed, white Rhodesians became moral pygmies, and Godwin and Hancock put them under the microscope. It was Flower and his colleagues who helped cultivate civil war in neighbouring Mozambique, one of the African battlefields so vividly and intimately covered by Jeremy Harding in Small Wars, Small Mercies. Rhodesia helped arm and train Renamo, retaliation for Mozambique's support for guerrillas. Harding picks up the story from later on, when Flower's work had been taken over by South Africa. Mozambique became part of the front-line in the battle against apartheid, as did Angola, also on Harding's itinerary. If one takes their death tolls into account, the cost of ending white rule in Southern Africa is measured in the hundreds of thousands. His account is not a catalogue of despair, however. Whether in Eritrea or southern Africa he finds an extraordinary resilience, 'people contriving to live beyond the wars, or in spite of them.' Harding draws on his own expertise, but one of the merits of his book is that he lets Africans do most of the talking. Small wars, millions dead: who cares? For a while Washington did. Patient, skilful diplomacy by Chester Crocker, the US assistant secretary of state for Africa for much of the 1980s, extricated South Africa and Cuba from their entanglement in south-western Africa. With the vital help of Moscow, the process secured independence for Namibia and also paved the way to what should have been a lasting peace in Angola. Crocker moved on in 1988 and began writing what is an engrossing and invaluable handbook on diplomacy in southern Africa. The tragedy is that the book came too late to instruct his successors under President Bush. The lessons it contains have been ignored. Washington bears as much of the blame for the disaster in Angola today as the hapless United Nations monitors.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     USZ  United States of America.

Following a decline in GDP of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter and a rise of only 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, the latest figures mean that the final growth rate for 1994 is likely to be about 2 per cent, only slightly up on last year's 1.1 per cent. The announcement is a blow for the government, which earlier in the year had been forecasting growth of 3-4 per cent for 1994. However labour unrest and political uncertainty surrounding the country's April elections appear to have dented growth in the first half of the year. The news, which came as the administration presented the latest version of its centrepiece economic plan, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), to parliament, may also make it difficult for the administration to meet its revenue targets for the year. The White Paper on the RDP is predicated on a 3 per cent annual growth rate for South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0,FT934-8916 ,"FT934-8916 _AN-DKLCNAGNFT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Out of the continent of need - An African is to head the UN's food agency      By JOHN MADELEY   FOOD deficit countries in Africa can expect a higher priority following the election of Mr Jacques Diouf, a 55-year-old Senegalese diplomat, as the next director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Chosen on Monday by FAO's 168-member countries, Mr Diouf takes over at the start of 1994 for a six-year term. But he is taking a 'wait and see' attitude to reforms in the UN's largest and probably most bloated agency. With a mandate to help increase food output, and an annual budget of about Dollars 7m a year, the FAO employs 6,200 people, about half of them at its Rome headquarters. The candidate who ran Mr Diouf a close second in this week's election, Mr Geoff Miller of Australia, wanted to get many of the Rome staff out into the field. Mr Diouf appears to have no such plans. 'I don't want at this stage to say what I will cut and what I will not cut; this would be completely irresponsible,' he said after his election. His first action would be 'to make sure I have all the facts - facts concerning the operations, programme, management, financial aspects, scientific quality and governance. Once I have all these elements, then I will be able to know what I should do and if reforms are needed.' FAO's management under its present director general, Mr Edouard Saouma, has come under strong criticism for an alleged dictatorial style and this has led some countries to withhold their contributions in the last few years. Mr Diouf will be the first African to hold the post and believes that the significance of his election is that the continent with the 'greatest need for a solution to the agricultural problem is Africa'. Over the last 10 years, worldwide food production has increased by 24 per cent and population by 20 per cent, he pointed out, while 'in Africa production per capita went down by 5 per cent. We have to correct that.' With degrees in tropical economy and agricultural economics, Mr Diouf is a former executive-secretary of the West Africa Rice Development Association which is trying to increase rice output in the region. FAO has to face challenges of food production, equity and justice, he says. 'We have 780m who do not have adequate access to food, 190m below the age of five who have protein deficiency, and we expect by the year 2000 to have a 90m tonne cereal deficit in Africa and Asia. We have to get the organisational, financial and human resources to face those challenges.' He discounted the idea that land set aside for farming in North America and Europe should be used to grow food for the third world. 'My main concern will be to ensure that food deficit countries manage to produce enough for their own security - that is the priority.' Solutions to food problems do exist, he stressed: 'There are grounds for hope and many countries are successful; if we can take the example of successful countries we can move forward.' Promising to eradicate any corruption he found within the FAO, Mr Diouf said the 'most important thing about this organisation is its credibility'. Its funds come from member nations, he said, who want to be assured that they are well used. FAO's new chief is likely to be given a honeymoon period by western countries that contribute most of its funds. The United States plans to clear off Dollars 80m of arrears to the FAO by the end of 1995. The daunting task facing Mr Diouf is to improve the efficiency of a cumbersome organisation to enable it to make a more substantial contribution to overcoming food shortages.

Xu Hongyuan, an official with the centre's economic  forecasting department, predicted that investment in fixed  assets this year might hit 1,500 billion yuan ($172.4 billion),  up nearly 27 percent from a year ago. Last year, capital  spending grew by 50.6 percent from 1992.    Xu believes the higher level is needed because the current  market demand is very much related to fixed assets investment,  which is also a major factor in maintaining high economic growth  in the future, as the government has envisaged.    After a careful study of economic developments and in light  of growing confidence that inflation will be kept at bay,  economists now believe that demand should be spurred a little  bit more than what was targeted at the beginning of this year.    The centre, an arm of the State Planning Commission,  believes  this could be done through larger fixed assets investment.    By doing so, Xu said, the gross national product (GNP) could  expand by 11 percent this year, 2 percentage points higher than  what was envisaged at the start of 1994.    The latest statistics show that while inflation and fixed  assets investment are moderating, personal savings and official  revenues are growing rapidly.    The year-on-year increase in fixed assets investment was  36.2  per cent in March, down 34.5 percentage points from a year  earlier.    The yearly growth in capital spending is expected to subside  to about 32 per cent by June, down 29 percentage points from a  year earlier.    Individual savings in the country's banks are currently  186.2  billion yuan ($21.4 billion) higher than last year.    In addition, the government had already withdrawn 3 billion  yuan ($345 million) in currency during the first quarter of this  year.    The growing savings and the government's active money  withdrawal have helped curtail inflation, which slipped 1.4  percentage points from March to April. Xu said he believed that  despite the rising prices of some agricultural products, the  current market demand is generally weakening compared with the  growing supply of goods, which may dampen factory production as  well as economic performance.    He also explained that the inflationary pressures that have  cast a pall over the economy are mainly side-effects of the  price and tax reforms of last year, and should gradually fade in  the months to come.    As a result, the State Information Centre believes that the  growth in fixed assets investment is reaching an acceptable  level because consumer spending relies on the stimulus of fixed  assets investment.    But, he added that the government should keep a watchful eye  on the growth in fixed assets investment, which customarily  peaks in the fourth quarter.     "

Five  Frenchmen and a Beninese were injured in the Togolese capital  last night when a grenade thrown into a restaurant in the Be  district exploded. The six victims are not in danger of death  and the Togolese police have declined at this stage of their  inquiry to speculate on the reasons behind the attack. The  targeted restaurant belongs to a Frenchman and is known to be  mostly patronized by Europeans.    Politically, problems are piling up in the country. Edem  Kodjo, the prime minister appointed by General Eyadema and who  is still finding it difficult to convince his opposition allies  to join him, hinted yesterday that he may resign if his allies  continue to refuse to take part in the government he plans to  form. From Lome, Olabire da Cruz reports for Africa No.1:    [Begin da Cruz recording] The negotiations begun a week ago  between the two parties of the Togolese parliamentary majority  have actually been disrupted following Mr. Agboyibor's Action  Committee for Renewal [CAR]'s restatement of its decision not to  participate in any government to be formed by Mr. Kodjo, a  decision reiterated in a communique issued by the CAR yesterday  evening. The communique stated that at the 3 May meeting  between delegations of the two majority parties, the Togolese  Union for Democracy [UTD] made it clear that if the CAR  maintains its decision, the alternative would be for Mr. Kodjo  to resign. UTD officials do not deny that such a decision is  possible should the CAR drive its ally to the wall, but they add  that they have never maintained that that is the only stand to  adopt. They further explain that the question is whether the  CAR has gauged the consequences of its action and is prepared to  assume responsibility for them.    So, as I said earlier, the CAR has reiterated its decision  to  stay out of Mr. Kodjo's government. Is Mr. Kodjo prepared for a  coalition or an alliance with the former single ruling party,  the Rally of the Togolese People? The UTD executive's answer is  no. In this case, the only way out for Mr. Kodjo -- assuming he  does not resign -- would be to form a government based on the  civil society or on possible deserters from the erstwhile ally,  a situation already experienced by the former prime minister in  forming his last two governments.    In another development, five Frenchmen and a Beninese were  injured last night following the explosion of a grenade thrown  into a restaurant where they happened to be at about 2100. It  is not yet known who committed the act, or their reasons for  their doing so. The injured persons are not in danger of death.  [end recording]     "

Doubts remain over the latest Russian offer to open up the banking sector, and how to deal with export of Russian nuclear fuels. But ministers hope to have an agreement ready to sign at the European summit in Corfu next month. Ministers will also discuss latest diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Bosnia, and are expected to approve a Ecu32m (Dollars 36m) plan for the EU to take over the administration of the Bosnian town of Mostar. Separately, the Council will consider a European Commission proposal to send Ecu100m of food aid to Ukraine, as part of a broader strategy to Russia's neighbour. Dominican poll: Election day in the Dominican Republic sees President Joaqun Balaguer, 87, seeking his seventh term at the head of the Caribbean nation. But it will be a close-run thing since he is trailing in the polls to Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party. The last time Mr Balaguer won, in May 1990, his main opponent charged him with fraud. Ecofin: European Union finance and economy ministers, meeting in Brussels, will review the economies of member states and discuss the Commission's white paper on growth, competitiveness and jobs. Financial assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics is also on the agenda, and the ministers will turn their attention to the Union's anti-fraud strategy. Japan's taxpayers: A list of the 100 highest taxpayers in Japan is to be released. The tax list, prepared by the national tax office, is a mixture of honest and less honest millionaires. It is also an interesting economic indicator. Last year, for example, the survey showed a decline to 125,000 people paying more than Y10m in tax, down from 175,000 in the previous survey. Top of last year's taxpayer league was Hiromasa Ezoe, former president of Recruit, the employment agency, on trial over the 1988-1989 Recruit shares for favours scandal. He paid Y3.96bn in tax in 1992. Platinum survey: Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, publishes its highly regarded annual survey of the world platinum market. It is likely to make depressing reading for the producers by suggesting the market remains in surplus and that, unless there is market-disturbing news from either of the two biggest producers - South Africa and Russia - prices will remain relatively low. Holidays: Israel (Shavuot), Saudi Arabia (Eid al-Adha), Venezuela. TUESDAY 17 US rates likely to rise Many economists expect the US Federal Reserve to announce another rise in short-term interest rates following today's meeting of the policy-making open market committee. A quarter- or half-point increase in the federal funds rate to 4 per cent or 4.25 per cent is widely seen as necessary to bolster the dollar and slow the pace of domestic growth. If the Fed wants to send a strong signal it will also 'ring the gong' - raise the discount rate, at which it lends to banks. So far the discount rate has stayed unchanged at 3 per cent despite three increases to 3.75 per cent in the Fed funds rate. Malawi goes to the polls: Presidential and parliamentary elections will give voters a choice of candidates for the first time since 1964. The multi-party elections follow last year's referendum in which Malawians rejected President Hastings Kamuzu Banda's one-party state. Mr Banda (above), who has ruled since independence, is standing for re-election despite his advancing years. Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, will report its fourth consecutive year of losses. Forecasters agree the loss will be about Pounds 2.5bn, compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1990 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989. The market, which reports its results three years in arrears, will soften the blow on Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market, by stripping out the so-called 'double count'. This occurs when claims produce losses for the syndicate underwriting an original policy, as well as for those underwriting errors and omissions, stop-loss or estate protection insurance. Names will also be allowed to borrow against part of the profits expected for the current year. Trading conditions at Lloyd's have improved over the past two years, with steep rises in insurance rates in some sectors. Bulgaria's largest trade union bloc has called a general strike to push for higher wages for state sector employees. Prices have risen sharply this year because of the introduction of VAT and the sharp devaluation of the Lev. The strike will keep up pressure on the government of Lyuben Berov, a non-partisan economist, which is facing its sixth vote of no confidence since taking office in December 1992.

WEDNESDAY 18 Derivatives report appears The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress, publishes a study of financial derivatives, such as options and interest rate swaps. The study was prompted by a nightmare scenario of a collapsing world financial system, as overexposed institutions were forced to default on their obligations. The report is expected to propose increased regulation of the multi-billion dollar business, both of those issuing and trading these financial instruments and the companies that use them. The industry, and some policy makers, are against hasty legislation, arguing that existing procedures are working well. Israel is due to complete its military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip, placing 850,000 Palestinians under PLO control. Bulgaria's debt: Deutsche Bank and 300 other London Club banks have until today to indicate their terms to the banking committee handling the rescheduling of Bulgaria's USDollars 9.3bn foreign commercial debt. The two sides, which agreed to reduce the debt by about 50 per cent last November, have set a June 30 deadline for completion of the rescheduling deal. Bulgaria, which unilaterally defaulted on its foreign debt in 1990, is the last of central Europe's former communist states to reschedule its foreign commercial debt. UK economy: April's retail price index will be scrutinised for any sign that inflation may be gathering pace, after the Bank of England's warning last week about inflationary pressures. The market expects the figures to show monthly inflation to have risen to 1.3 per cent, up from 0.3 per cent the previous month, largely as a result of rising council tax bills and the introduction of VAT on fuel. Saleroom: This week both Sotheby's and Christie's sell expensive jewels and works of art in Geneva. The auctions reach a climax this evening with Sotheby's sale of 125 items of jewellery from the collection of the late Helene Beaumont, who, with her American husband Louis, helped make the Cote d'Azur the magnet of the smart set in inter-war Europe. The Jonker No. 2 diamond of more than 40 carats, cut by jeweller Harry Winston from the rough 726 carat Jonker diamond, and set in a ring, should make the top price of more than Dollars 2m.

THURSDAY 19 Lome under review Ministers from the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group meet in Swaziland to review the Lome Convention, which expires at the end of the decade. There is tacit agreement on both sides that, with the deregulation of international trade and changes in the patterns of private investment flows and official aid, the trade and aid treaty, in its present form, will be the last of its kind. ACP officials admit that it will not be easy for many of their economies to disengage from Lome, with its guaranteed markets for commodity exports and development finance. The EU, on its side, wants to move away from a system based on old colonial ties to a more rational foundation for its trade arrangements. UK economy: Retail sales figures for April are expected to show that the rate of consumer spending has slowed slightly, following recent downbeat evidence from big retailers and the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey. Month on month, sales are expected to show no growth, after a 0.8 per cent rise in March. But with some economists predicting there could even be a fall of 0.5 per cent in retail spending, the result seems set to provoke further debate about how far April's tax rises have dented consumer confidence. Rao meets Clinton: PV Narasimha Rao (left), the Indian prime minister who is this week on a six-day visit to the US, is due to meet President Clinton today.

Frisson of interest: The UK Building Societies Association begins its annual conference in Birmingham, central England. The recent Pounds 1.8bn bid by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham and Gloucester building society, the announcement of a merger between two societies in the north-east of England, and the statements by several banks that they are interested in buying societies should all serve to enliven the atmosphere.

The ICJ's ruling is of  course satisfactory to Chadian President Idriss Deby:    [Begin recording] [Deby] The most important thing for us,  under the circumstances, is that the law has been applied and  also that this problem, which lasted too long and cost so many  human lives, has been resolved peacefully.

On 15 May, THE  SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson  Mandela, who has just been elected president, will ""resign from  the post of president of South Africa within two years,"" and  that this would ""cause a power struggle within the African  National Congress."" The next morning, the BBC broadcast a  so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together  various pieces to claim that ""China has 10 million prisoners in  labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation."" When these rumors  came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully  by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign  Ministry.    On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report,  Mandela issued a statement which said ""that the article is  totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create  instability in the first democratically elected government."" On  17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to  point out that the allegations by the BBC were ""sheer  fabrications.""    It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies  one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander  South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark  side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see  advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under  British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast  off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon  a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable  development of the country; China, implementing the policy of  reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social  stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the  historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some  people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but  they have no alternative, and although they have tried something  which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis  trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful  means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors  in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the  countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to  interfere in their internal affairs.    The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are  ""objective and just"" in their reporting. But facts prove that  they say something in one way and do something another way, and  even play a disgraceful role in fabricating rumors to mislead  people. Regarding this, I do not know what kind of explanation  they have to offer to the British public and international  public opinion circles.     "

Mr Piet Welgemoed, South Africa's transport minister, will today announce the approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals, yesterday. The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the companies but both will be run on a commercial basis. The government should be able to phase out its subsidies, said Price Waterhouse. The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles about 12m passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport. Eight other airports will also be affected, including those at Cape Town and Durban. South Africa is an increasingly popular destination for air traffic: over the past year, 25 airlines which had not previously offered flights to the country applied for access rights. Legislation will have to be passed before the proposal can proceed. 'This could happen by the spring of next year,' said Mr John Wright, who is head of regulation and competition services at Price Waterhouse. A regulation committee will be established by the South African government for the two companies, but will not have authority to intervene in the everyday running of their affairs. Airports and air services are currently run as part of a government department. Mr Wright said that the move was not a prelude to any privatisation. The proposals to run them on a more commercial basis have been drawn up since June 1991.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "

BUT HOW DIFFERENTLY THE  ADMINISTRATION TREATS THEM.      By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson writes a syndicated column from  Washington.      As the value of oil increases, the value of blood may be devalued. Why else  would the Bush Administration refuse to talk with Saddam Hussein with American  lives at risk, and insist on talking with South Africa's President F. W. de  Klerk while apartheid continues to reap its grisly harvest of African lives?    Why embrace De Klerk? Apartheid's racial repression of the majority for decades  has taken a far greater toll than Hussein's attacks on the Kurdish minority in  Iraq. De Klerk's presidency is no more democratic -- and certainly far less  representative -- than Hussein's dictatorship. South Africa's terror against  its several neighbors is no less aggression than Iraq's aggression against  Kuwait.    President Bush announced that reforms in South Africa were ""irreversible."" But  why give out the grade before the exam has been taken? Nelson Mandela is out of  jail, but he is not free. The pillars of apartheid still stand -- the laws that  exclude blacks from voting, those that enforce segregation and racial  exploitation, those that give the police emergency powers for brutal  repression.

BUT HOW DIFFERENTLY THE  ADMINISTRATION TREATS THEM.      By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson writes a syndicated column from  Washington.      As the value of oil increases, the value of blood may be devalued. Why else  would the Bush Administration refuse to talk with Saddam Hussein with American  lives at risk, and insist on talking with South Africa's President F. W. de  Klerk while apartheid continues to reap its grisly harvest of African lives?    Why embrace De Klerk? Apartheid's racial repression of the majority for decades  has taken a far greater toll than Hussein's attacks on the Kurdish minority in  Iraq. De Klerk's presidency is no more democratic -- and certainly far less  representative -- than Hussein's dictatorship. South Africa's terror against  its several neighbors is no less aggression than Iraq's aggression against  Kuwait.    President Bush announced that reforms in South Africa were ""irreversible."" But  why give out the grade before the exam has been taken? Nelson Mandela is out of  jail, but he is not free. The pillars of apartheid still stand -- the laws that  exclude blacks from voting, those that enforce segregation and racial  exploitation, those that give the police emergency powers for brutal  repression.

0,FT943-13713 ,"FT943-13713 _AN-EGRD8AFQFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (35): Net benefit may prove marginal  -Foreign aid      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Few international aid causes are more popular than South Africa's appeal for assistance in redressing the legacy of apartheid. Raising funds, however, may prove to be easier than putting them to efficient use, and if aid is seen as a substitute for investment the net benefit may prove marginal. If pledges are taken at their face value, South Africa can expect up to R10bn over the next five years, from a variety of bilateral and multilateral donors. Leading the field is Japan, which earlier this month unveiled what it called its largest aid package to a single country - Dollars 1.3bn over two years. Mr Katsumi Sezaki, Japan's ambassador to South Africa, said that almost all the aid was untied, bar a Dollars 100m export-import credit facility aimed at promoting trade between the two countries. But a further Dollars 400m worth of export-import bank loans were untied, he said. Of the balance, Dollars 250m would be in the form of soft loans - seven years' grace and a 25-year repayment period at 3 per cent interest. A further Dollars 500m in the package represented the amount of private investment and commercial credits the Japanese government was prepared to guarantee. Next on the list is the US which has offered R2bn over three years, while a host of other bilateral donors have chipped in including Australia (R700m over three years), the European Union is offering over R400m; the UK will provide R560m over three years. Meanwhile the African Development Bank says it can release between R720m and R1,200m of project-linked finance over five years. Past experience in Africa has shown that aid has mixed results and even allowing for South Africa's considerable pool of skills, handling resources on this scale will not be easy. The amount on offer, however, may not be as much as it seems. As is so often the case, assessing what may be termed the 'real money' - that is assistance that is readily available and which can be rapidly disbursed - is not straightforward. Although trade cover and investment guarantees can be put to good use, including them in the category of 'aid' can give a misleading impression of what is available for conventional aid projects - health, housing, education, and so on. Development packages almost invariably include aid tied to purchases from the donor country, which can prove expensive. A recent study by a British development charity calculated that the resulting lack of competition can add anything from 10 to 15 per cent to the price of the items ordered from the donor country. Another way of boosting bilateral aid figures in press releases is to include the contributions made by western governments to multilateral lending institutions, United Nations agencies, or money that would be channeled through European Union aid schemes. A further device used by some donors is to include estimates of the benefits for South African exporters from introducing favourable tariff changes made in the wake of President Mandela's inauguration. Given the competition between donors as to who will appear the most generous  -which in turn may influence the South African government when it comes to allocating contracts for state-backed or funded projects - the donors themselves are often reluctant to make clear the precise benefits and terms of their offers. In short, the arithmetic of aid is complex and South Africa, unused to being a recipient, may sometimes be too inclined to take promises at face value. Significantly, the World Bank, potentially South Africa's largest multilateral donor, is reluctant to put a figure to planned lending, although some officials have suggested a figure of about Dollars 1bn a year in the initial phase. Mr Isaac Sam, the Bank's resident representative in South Africa, says that foreign aid is 'rather crucial' in South Africa's development. What is more, fund raising 'has to be done fairly rapidly' in order to take advantage of the goodwill South Africa presently enjoys. But Mr Sam cautions that aid alone cannot deliver the economic growth that the country needs. While the Bank plans to provide substantial aid, foreign and domestic investment are the keys to post-apartheid growth: 'The real resources for South Africa are in the international capital market, not donors', says Mr Sam.

This was announced at a  Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberley today. Speaking after the  meeting, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi said the Alliance had agreed that General Viljoen  should resign so that he could lead his Freedom Front in the  election. General Viljoen said that he was prepared to join the  Freedom Alliance as the leader of the Freedom Front. Meanwhile,  the former Conservative Party leader in Natal, Mr. Carl Werth,  has confirmed that eight of the region's 11 executive members  have agreed to stand as candidates for the Freedom Front. He  said that they had taken the decision at a recent meeting.  Leaders of the Freedom Alliance meeting expressed strong  disapproval of the deposing of Dr. Lucas Mangope as president of  Bophuthatswana. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Dr. Mangope had  been betrayed and stabbed in the back. He said there was a need  for the alliance to review its position following the weekend's  events.    A Conservative Party spokesman said the events in  Bophuthatswana had been planned by the ANC [African National  Congress] through the Transitional Executive Council, to deprive  the state of its independence.

This followed a request by the Freedom Alliance that  the deadline should be postponed to give it the opportunity to  examine a set of proposals devised by the ANC [African National  Congress].    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after  talks between the government, the ANC and the Freedom Alliance  that the government had made a proposal regarding the future of  the Zulu king and Natal/KwaZulu. A constitutional principle  providing for traditional leadership is to be discussed with the  Zulu king this weekend. However, new problems arose regarding a  volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners.    Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said that the  proposals submitted to the alliance were considered to have vast  implications, and that urgent consultations with alliance  leaders were imperative. Discussions were to have begun last  night after the trilateral meeting. Mr. Cronje said the fact  that the state president would be prevented from promulgating  the election date today gave the alliance additional time to  look for an acceptable solution. He said that changes to the  constitution would not have been easy after the promulgation of  the election date.     "
