By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER      Like many women, Anne Berkovitz had decided against taking hormones after  menopause. But she often wondered whether she'd made the right decision. Among  her friends, the topic was always a source of debate.    ""You hear one person's doctor say you must take it and another person's doctor  says you shouldn't take it if you can get by without it,"" says Berkovitz, 64,  of Westwood. ""I was feeling OK not taking hormones. But I had sort of wondered  about it.""    Hormone replacement therapy is a drug treatment commonly prescribed to women  after menopause to replace natural hormones the body has stopped manufacturing.  The therapy is popular because it diminishes some uncomfortable side effects of  menopause, such as hot flashes, and can reduce a woman's risk of osteoporosis  and, possibly, heart disease.    But the treatment has drawbacks, including a possible increased risk of breast  cancer.    The disparity led Berkovitz to enroll as a participant in one of the largest  clinical studies on hormone replacement therapy, and the first drug trial to  study its effects on heart disease. The study will begin soon at UCLA and six  other research institutions. UCLA researchers hope to enroll another 75 women.    The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) study should help  define the dosage and combination of hormones that best reduce the risk of  heart disease in women, the leading cause of death in women as well as men,  says Dr. Howard Judd, executive director of the division of reproductive  endocrinology at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai medical centers. PEPI is sponsored by  the National Institutes of Health.    ""Estrogen is such a powerful chemical; it impacts on so many systems in the  body,"" says Judd, who is directing UCLA's part of the study. ""Our hope is that  we'll be able to say, based on cardiovascular-disease risk factors, 'this is  the best way to take hormones.' ""    While men and women share some risk factors for heart disease, such as a  high-fat diet or family history, female hormones produced by the body  apparently help protect women against heart disease before age 50 -- when men  are at their peak risk.    But after menopause, when hormone production ceases, the rate of heart disease  in women quickly climbs and eventually equals the rate in men.    ""There is a lot of evidence now accumulating that estrogen plays a role in  heart disease. How it does that is not clear,"" Judd says. ""We would suggest  that an agent that may reduce the incidence of heart disease by 50%, maybe 60%,  in more than half the population is worth studying. This is a very important  question that needs to be answered. And I believe it will be.""    Estrogen appears to lower the bad cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins) in the  body and raise the good cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins) to reduce the  chance of heart disease. But those possible benefits, while exciting, further  complicate a therapy that is already enormously complex and the source of much  consternation among postmenopausal women and their physicians.    Estrogen and progesterone are hormones produced by the ovaries; they regulate  the menstrual cycle and fertility. At menopause, about age 45 to 50, the  ovaries stop producing the hormones.    While the absence of a menstrual period is a welcomed event for many women,  menopause can trigger uncomfortable symptoms such as hot flashes and thinning  of the vaginal and urinary tissues. The drop in hormones also causes bone  thinning and increases a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition  in which bones easily break or fracture.    Hormone replacement therapy resolves many of these problems. And, with the  addition of possible cardiovascular benefits, it's easy to see why hormone  therapy -- which usually consists of a mixture of estrogen and a  progesterone-like chemical called progestin -- is prescribed for 5 to 9 million  women.    But, despite its popularity, the debate over hormone replacement continues.    ""There are combinations of reasons and advantages for using estrogen,"" says Dr.  Ezra Davidson, president of the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Drew Medical School.  ""In many instances, physicians are totaling those combined advantages and  advising women of the benefits. But there is insufficient data about the  risks.""    Besides minor side effects, such as menstrual bleeding, estrogen replacement is  known to promote the growth of uterine tissue, called the endometrium, which  can lead to cancer.    Studies show that adding progestin to the regimen removes the risk of  endometrial cancer, so physicians usually prescribe progestin for part of the  month. But progestin therapy opens the door to a whole new set of complex side  effects, says Barbara Hulka, an epidemiologist at the University of North  Carolina and chairwoman of a government advisory committee on women's health  issues.    For example, progestin appears to erase the cardiovascular protection of  estrogen. And some studies show progestin increases a woman's risk of breast  cancer.    ""The quandary is basically the issue of taking estrogen alone versus estrogen  plus progestin,"" Hulka says. ""Estrogen alone does cause a growth of the  endometrial lining and does cause endometrial cancer in a significant number of  women. That's why it's been recommended to add progestin for half the month.""    Fears that estrogen-progestin therapy will increase the risk of breast cancer  were elevated last summer when a Swedish study revealed that women who took a  combination of estrogen and progestin for more than six years were more than  four times as likely as other women to develop breast cancer.    Other studies have not shown as great a risk, and the significance of the  Swedish study is debated, Judd says.    ""That data shows more risk than U.S. data,"" Judd says. ""Whether or not that  will be substantiated or not, I don't know. Many of us felt like (the Swedish)  data were over-interpreted.""    But the study did underscore the need for a better understanding of the risks  and benefits of hormone therapy.    Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration approved new warnings  regarding breast cancer risk on the labels of estrogen therapy drugs.    And, in a more controversial move, an FDA advisory panel concluded in July that  estrogen taken alone (without progestin) helps prevent heart disease in women  who have had hysterectomies. Because women who have had their uteruses removed  do not run the risk of endometrial cancer, the committee deemed that estrogen  alone would be beneficial in this group, says Davidson, who was a member of the  panel.    ""The committee made a prudent judgment based on the information on benefits,  with the understanding that (the information) was limited about the long-term  risks,"" says Davidson, who added that some committee members had reservations  about making any recommendations on estrogen therapy and heart disease.    The recommendation by the committee -- which might persuade the FDA to allow a  change in the labeling of estrogen to include protection against heart disease  for women who have had hysterectomies -- was criticized by some physicians and  consumer health groups.    The National Women's Health Network said in a statement that studies have not  been done to verify that the potential protective effects of estrogen  replacement therapy outweigh the risks.    ""It is alarming to think that millions of women may be given this drug before  either its dangers or benefits are understood,"" says Davi Birnbaum, a  representative of the Washington-based women's health organization.    The panel's recommendation, which is only for women who have had  hysterectomies, leaves postmenopausal women who have not had hysterectomies in  limbo, says Dr. Diana Petitti of the University of California, San Francisco.    ""The data on estrogen use alone in postmenopausal women are fairly consistent  in showing a lower risk of coronary heart disease,"" she says. ""But most women  are not put on estrogen alone. And the data to show whether or not the  combination of estrogen and progestin also decrease the risk of coronary heart  disease is essentially non-existent.""    The FDA advisory panel based its recommendations on a series of small  observational studies, called epidemiological studies, not the expensive,  clinical trials that are usually more conclusive, Judd says.    ""I think (the advisory panel recommendation) is premature because it's based  exclusively on epidemiological studies,"" he says. ""You've got to do drug  trials. For something this important that impacts on every woman in the  country, we've got to spend money.""    The PEPI study was designed to fill this void, Judd says. In the study, 840  women will be randomly assigned to one of five drug regimens: a placebo;  estrogen alone; the standard combination of estrogen and progestin widely  prescribed in the United States; estrogen and a smaller, daily dose of  progestin, and, estrogen with a new formulation of progestin created in Europe.    Women will be followed for three years while their risk factors for heart  disease, such as high blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are measured.    The study also will incorporate measurements of bone density to learn more  about the prevention of osteoporosis. The PEPI study will not attempt to  resolve the issue of breast cancer risks.    The results of the study are expected in 1994.    ""It remains a question of what do you do in the interim between now and the  time when we'll have an answer,"" Petitti says. ""Do you want to take the risk of  taking the drug and being wrong? Or do your take the risk of not taking the  drug and being wrong? I consider it to be an incredibly hard choice.""    With so many questions remaining, physicians need to review each woman's  circumstances and fears before prescribing hormone replacement therapy, says  Petitti.    ""I think the clinicians who are trying to handle their patients on an  individual basis are doing the best job,"" she says. ""Someone terrified of  breast cancer may not want to take the potential risk of breast cancer. But  someone has a mother or aunt who had a osteoporotic bone fracture may say 'I  don't want that to happen to me and I don't care as much about the risk of  breast cancer.' ""    Experts caution that it will take a long-term study, perhaps several decades,  looking at causes of death among women to resolve whether hormone replacement  therapy actually prolongs life or merely swaps one risk for another.    ""I think the PEPI study will be useful,"" Petitti says. ""But the bottom line  will not be addressed by the PEPI study. The bottom line is, will it save our  lives? I don't think any single study will answer that question.""      Candidates Are Still Needed for UCLA Intervention Study    Individuals interested in volunteering for the Postmenopausal  Estrogen/Progestin Interventions study must be healthy women, age 45-64, who  have had a natural or surgical menopause and are willing to take hormones.    The participants will receive periodic free medical examinations over a  three-year period.    For more information, call the UCLA Medical Center, Division of Reproductive  Endocrinology, (213) 825-9502.      WOMEN AND HEART ATTACKS    While heart disease in men often occurs in their 20s and 30s, heart disease in  women soars after age 50. Medical experts believe this might be due, in part,  to the loss of natural estrogen hormone during menopause.

The program could have ""a significant impact on the health care of millions of  women,"" Dr. Robert Langer, director of the UCSD study, said. About 250,000  women die each year of heart disease, which Langer said is the leading cause of  death in women older than 50.    The three-year Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial, funded by  the National Institutes of Health, will involve about 840 postmenopausal women  ages 45 to 64.    In addition to UCSD, trials will be conducted at UCLA, Stanford University,  Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the University of Texas, the University  of Iowa and George Washington University in Washington.    Each of the seven participating clinics will enroll about 120 participants,  according to Dr. Bradley Wells, a professor at the Bowman Gray School of  Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., which will  coordinate the study results.    The trial will use television commercials featuring cast members of the NBC  sitcom ""Golden Girls"" to attract participants, according to Dr. Elizabeth  Barrett-Connor, a UCSD professor who served as chairwoman of the committee that  designed the study.    The study is expected to address ""many unanswered questions"" about  estrogen-replacement therapies that many postmenopausal women regularly  receive, Barrett-Connor said Friday. Although researchers suspect that some  replacement hormones reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease, studies  also have indicated that ""therapy carries risks as well as benefits,""  Barrett-Connor said.    Menopause occurs when menstrual periods end and the ovaries stop producing  estrogen and progesterone, hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle and  fertility.    About 85% of postmenopausal women experience symptoms related to hormonal  changes. Many women suffer hot flashes, a condition that, although  uncomfortable, is generally not considered to be life-threatening.    But, for a significant number of women, the hormonal changes cause serious  medical conditions, including thinning of vaginal and bladder tissues and  osteoporosis, the thinning of bones.    While both men and women suffer from osteoporosis, the condition is accelerated  by menopause. Menopause also increases the risk of heart attack among women in  their mid-60s.    Consequently, as many as 30% of women experiencing menopause are believed to be  receiving some sort of hormone-replacement therapy.    Women who participate in the trial will receive a placebo or one of four  different replacement hormones that are believed to reduce the risk of heart  disease. The trial also will study suspected links between those replacement  hormones and a wide range of medical conditions, including osteoporosis,  diabetes and breast cancer.    The study will ""test the effects of various hormone combinations on cholesterol  and other blood factors and will help us define the best hormone combination  for postmenopausal women,"" Langer said.    During the three-year trial, participants will receive free medical  examinations, including mammograms, Pap tests, periodic blood-pressure tests,  electrocardiograms and cholesterol and blood sugar measurements. UCSD  researchers also will use a special machine to measure bone density.    UCSD is seeking healthy volunteers from the ages of 45 to 64 who underwent a  natural or surgical menopause within the past 10 years. In addition to taking  hormones, participants will undergo 14 checkups at the university's Clinical  Research Center in La Jolla during the three-year period.    Early results from the clinical trials will not be available until at least  1994, Wells said. The first participants ""will be enrolled around Dec. 1, and  recruitment will continue for at least a year after that,"" Wells said.

In addition to taking  hormones, participants will undergo 14 checkups at the university's Clinical  Research Center in La Jolla during the three-year period.    Early results from the clinical trials will not be available until at least  1994, Wells said. The first participants ""will be enrolled around Dec. 1, and  recruitment will continue for at least a year after that,"" Wells said. ""The  last participants won't be enrolled until the end of January 1991.""    Women interested in taking part in the study are asked to contact the Clinical  Research Laboratory at 619-534-7150.

NEIL SOLOMON      Question: I've heard that if a baby is given formula that has had iron added to  it, the baby will have more problems than if the formula did not have added  iron. Is this true?    Answer: There is a commonly held belief that iron-fortified formulas are  responsible for digestive disorders in infants, and cause them to be fussy;  however, this was not substantiated in a study of 42 infants.    In the study, the infants received either an iron-fortified formula or one that  did not contain added iron. The investigators found that the reactions of the  infants were similar regardless of which formula they received.    Q: I have been getting hot flashes, but I'm not surprised because I'm at the  age where this is to be expected. In talking with other women my age, I find  that those who have the same problem are taking estrogen. Is that what everyone  takes, or are there any other ways to treat this condition?    A: Estrogen is not the only treatment for the hot flashes associated with  menopause, but it is the treatment against which all others are measured. Other  suggested treatments include antidepressant medication and tranquilizers, but  the effectiveness of these other measures has not been compared with placebo  therapy.    Oral estrogen is prescribed most often, but an estrogen skin patch and other  routes of administration are also possible. One beneficial by-product of  estrogen therapy is improved sleep. Hot flashes often awaken postmenopausal  women; once the symptom is eliminated, sleep becomes more normal.    Q: Sometimes the medication that a doctor prescribes for an illness seems to be  worse than the illness. Since I've been on medication, my mouth feels so dry  that I can hardly talk. Is there anything that can be done about this?    A: If you experience dry mouth as the result of medication, try drinking lots  of water and chewing sugarless gum. Brushing the teeth should also prove  helpful. In addition, any unusual side effects you may experience should be  brought to the attention of your physician. It's possible that a change in  dosage may eliminate the problem, or some other medication may be substituted  for the one you're taking.    Q: My brother has been placed on antidepressant medication. Isn't it possible  that he will become addicted to it?    A: Antidepressant medication is not habit-forming; however, monitoring is still  essential to assure that the patient is getting the right dose.

Among women who have been postmenopausal five years or less, calcium  supplements appear ineffective in preventing a very rapid phase of bone loss,  said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, chief of the calcium and bone metabolism  laboratory at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts  University in Boston.    But after about five years, calcium supplements appear to kick in, preventing  further bone deterioration.    ""That's where the good news is. If you are out of that rapid dip period, and if  you have a low dietary intake, then increasing your calcium to the recommended  dietary allowances has a very substantial benefit,"" she said.    Past research on the effectiveness of calcium supplements has yielded mixed  results because most studies have failed to distinguish between women who are  recently postmenopausal and those who are well beyond menopause, Dawson-Hughes  said.    As a result, calcium is widely held as important in preventing bone loss, but  medical experts have not agreed on the need for supplements.    ""You have to look at subsets of the postmenopausal population,"" Dawson-Hughes  said. ""We had enough people here that we could partition them into subsets and  thereby develop more of an idea of what was going on.""    The study is clear on two other points. Women who already achieve high calcium  intake through their diets do not need supplements. And supplements of calcium  citrate malate, a form patented by Procter & Gamble and found in Citrus  Hill Plus Calcium orange and grapefruit juices, appeared to be better absorbed  than calcium carbonate, the more popular form found in over-the-counter  products such as Tums, Dawson-Hughes said.    The study examined 301 healthy, postmenopausal women ages 40 to 70 for two  years. Half of the women had a usual dietary calcium intake of less than 400  milligrams a day -- about two servings of calcium-rich food. Women with dietary  calcium intakes of 400 to 650 milligrams a day made up the second group.    The Recommended Daily Allowance for adults ages 25 and older is 800 milligrams  a day, about four servings of a calcium-rich food.    American women, however, rarely achieve the RDA for calcium through diet alone,  Dawson-Hughes said.    Calcium is found in milk, yogurt, cheese, canned salmon and sardines, and dark  green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collard greens and kale.    Each group was randomly divided into three subgroups: those who received 500  milligrams of calcium carbonate, those who received 500 milligrams of calcium  citrate malate and those who received a placebo. Bone measurements were taken  in the neck, spine and forearm.    The results showed that women who had undergone menopause five or fewer years  earlier had significant bone loss that was unaffected by supplements in any  form.    At menopause, the female hormone estrogen, which helps protect against bone  loss, begins to decline rapidly.    ""Among recently postmenopausal women, we found that the calcium supplementation  didn't seem to matter,"" Dawson-Hughes said.    ""The bone seems to be under such strong influence of the body's dropping  estrogen level.""    But after about five years, the supplements appeared to prevent further bone  loss in women deficient in calcium.    ""The study is encouraging because it suggests that calcium can help prevent  bone loss, which has been disputed by some researchers,"" said Bonnie Liebman, a  nutritionist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington.    ""I don't think women who have recently undergone menopause should say, 'I'm not  going to worry about calcium for five years.' ""    But Liebman said the study's findings that calcium citrate malate was more  effective than calcium carbonate deserves follow-up study because the former is  generally more costly and available only in Citrus Hill Plus Calcium fruit  juices.    The study does not reveal whether calcium carbonate would be more effective in  higher doses or if taken with food, Liebman said (the subjects took the  supplements without food).    The study found women with lower dietary calcium intake who consumed calcium  citrate malate had no significant bone loss.    Women who received calcium carbonate maintained bone density in the hip and  forearm but lost bone in the spine.    The women on the placebo lost 2% to 3% of bone density at the hip, forearm and  spine over two years. Among women with higher dietary calcium intake, there  were no differences among subjects taking either form of calcium supplement or  the placebo.    ""This fits with the idea that (supplementation) benefits those who are  deficient,"" Dawson-Hughes said. ""But more and more and more is not better and  better and better.    ""Women in America, in this age range, have an intake of 475 milligrams a day.  That's very little -- just over half the RDA -- of what they need,""  Dawson-Hughes said.

The findings, announced Tuesday in Sweden and to be published Thursday in the  New England Journal of Medicine, found that women who took a combination of  estrogen and progestin for more than six years were 4.4 times more likely than  others to develop cancer of the breast.    The study ""could change the way we think about post-menopausal hormone  replacement,"" Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of UC San Diego wrote in an  editorial accompanying the study. Yet she and others said the findings are too  preliminary to recommend a change in practice.    A significant percentage of all menopausal and post-menopausal women -- some  experts estimate one-third to one-half -- receive estrogen replacement therapy.  Production of natural estrogen hormones in the ovaries slows down during and  after menopause.    The hormone therapy is used in the short run to minimize symptoms of menopause,  such as hot flashes, sweating and other physical changes. In the long run,  physicians use it to prevent the bone-thinning, or osteoporosis, that afflicts  many older women.      Combined Therapy    In the United States, most of those women also receive progestin, a synthetic  form of the female hormone progesterone. Progestin is used to counteract an  unintended side effect of estrogen therapy discovered in the 1970s -- its  tendency to increase a woman's risk of uterine cancer.    ""This article hits at the heart of our philosophy that patients should be on  estrogen and progestin,"" said Dr. Jonathan S. Berek, director of gynecologic  oncology at UCLA School of Medicine. ""This questions the assumption that it is  entirely safe, at least from the standpoint of the breast.""    The researchers studied 23,244 Swedish women age 35 or older who received  various types of estrogen therapy. They then compared their rate of new cases  of breast cancer to that of women in the same region who did not receive  estrogen replacement.    The women on estrogen were on average 10% more likely to come down with breast  cancer during the six-year study, the researchers found. The longer the women  received estrogen, the greater their risk: women who were on estrogen nine  years or more were 70% more likely to come down with breast cancer.    One particularly potent form of estrogen, called estradiol, which is not used  widely the United States, was associated with a nearly 200% increase in risk.  Other types of estrogens appeared to result in no increased risk of breast  cancer.      Popular Treatment    Experts said Tuesday that the study's most provocative finding was the fourfold  increase in risk of breast cancer among women on combined estrogen and  progestin therapy, the approach that has grown increasingly popular in the  United States in the past 10 years and is the therapy of choice for women who  have not had a hysterectomy.    ""This paper says (the addition of progestin) may actually increase the amount  of breast cancer you get from estrogen alone,"" said Dr. Brian E. Henderson, a  cancer specialist at USC. ""You don't want that effect. But it's a worry we've  had.""    Experts stressed that the Swedish findings must be confirmed in further studies  before any change in medical practice can be recommended. They said any  suspected drawbacks of the combination therapy must be weighed against its  proven benefits.    For example, estrogen therapy is believed by some to reduce a woman's risk of  heart disease and stroke, in addition to its other benefits. Some also noted  that progestin is being prescribed in lower and lower doses, perhaps reducing  any risk.    ""To a woman on estrogen replacement therapy, the message we all want her to get  is 'Don't change what you're doing,' "" said Henderson. "" 'You're doing the  right thing. We're just trying to understand better how to maximize the benefit  to you.' ""      Risks and Benefits    Barrett-Connor said the study ""might draw attention to how little we really  know about the best possible combinations or single drugs that would have the  best risk-benefit ratio. We really don't have that information yet and we're  scrambling to get it.""    Dr. S. B. Gusberg, a past president of the American Cancer Society, said it may  prove necessary to make estrogen therapy a short-term, rather than a long-term  therapy. Studies suggest there is no added risk in taking the hormones up to  five years, he said.    ""You can take the combination for relatively short periods . . . up to four or  five years,"" said Gusberg, an emeritus professor of gynecology at Mt. Sinai  School of Medicine in New York.

Yet I'm positive that, some years ago, estrogen was considered to increase the  risk of breast cancer.

Answer: There is some evidence that, at one time, women who were treated with  estrogen did have a higher incidence of breast cancer than is true of women  being treated with estrogen today.

NEIL SOLOMON: ESTROGEN AND CANCER      By NEIL SOLOMON      Question: Everything I read these days seems to indicate that women can take  estrogen without increasing their risk of breast cancer.    Yet I'm positive that, some years ago, estrogen was considered to increase the  risk of breast cancer. Am I wrong about what I think I remember, or has the  thinking changed in the past several years?    Answer: There is some evidence that, at one time, women who were treated with  estrogen did have a higher incidence of breast cancer than is true of women  being treated with estrogen today. The reason seems to be that higher doses of  the hormone were prescribed in the 1940s than is the case today.      Column    "

With the help of a color computer monitor and a machine called a dual photon  absorptiometer, Gail Dalsky, an exercise physiologist, can tell women things  about themselves they probably never knew, or even thought about.    The machine measures bone density, yielding important information that can  determine whether a person is at risk of developing osteoporosis, a potentially  disabling disease that primarily strikes women after menopause.    Osteoporosis is caused by the loss of bone density resulting from the sharp  decline of estrogen production after menopause, which usually occurs between  age 45 and 55. Bones are weakened and become susceptible to fracture.    Dalsky and Dr. Jo-Anne Smith, director of the Osteoporosis Center at the  University of Connecticut Medical Center in Farmington, are conducting a study  on the effects of calcium, estrogen and exercise on bone density and are  looking for evidence that osteoporosis can be prevented. The study is being  conducted on women who had their final menstrual period more than three months  earlier, but less than five years ago.    ""We know that estrogen stops bone loss. And we know that in certain  populations, exercise will help to a small extent,"" said Dalsky, who has a  doctorate in exercise physiology from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.  ""What hasn't been done, especially in the early post-menopausal woman or in any  study, is to use both treatments.""    While it is recommended that women get the recommended amount of calcium in  their diet, taking calcium supplements alone will not prevent osteoporosis.  When calcium supplements are combined with estrogen supplements, they seem to  make the estrogen more effective in strengthening bone, Dalsky said.    An unrelated study of osteoporosis by Yale University researchers shows that  women taking the hormone Calcitonin by nasal spray are maintaining bone mass.    The women in the University of Connecticut study will be placed in four groups.  One group will receive calcium only, another will receive calcium and will  exercise, another will take estrogen and calcium and the fourth will get a  combination of calcium, estrogen and exercise, Dalsky said. The researchers  hope to have 120 volunteers.    ""We hope that by combining exercise with the estrogen, a woman who is low in  bone mass upon entry into the study can maintain her bone mass, and that with  the combination of exercise and estrogen, we can reduce her risk of fracture by  making her bones stronger. That's the goal,"" Dalsky said.    The gradual loss of bone is painless until a fall or bump causes a fracture.  Nearly 250,000 hip fractures occur each year that are related to osteoporosis,  according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. These fractures can leave a  person permanently disabled.    The disease is also responsible for the ""dowager's hump"" that some elderly  women have, which is the result of numerous small fractures of the vertebrae.  Since bone is lost as a result of the aging process, men can also develop the  disease, but for them it does not usually occur until they reach their late 70s  or 80s.    Bone density is measured using the dual photon absorptiometer. The patient lies  flat on her back while a mechanical arm moves along her body, pausing at  certain points. A camera emits a small amount of radiation, the same amount of  background radiation that occurs naturally in this area.    A computer printout shows the distinct outline of a hip bone socket known as  the proximal femur, and another shows the lower vertebrae that intersect with  the pelvis. These areas are of particular interest to the researchers.    ""Because of the type of bone that is predominantly in the spine, it is more  susceptible to the loss of estrogen,"" Dalsky said. ""Often we will see decreases  in the spine before we see decreases in another body part.""    Even though it is normal to lose some bone mass with age, she said, ""in  athletes and people who exercise, we've found they tend to have a higher bone  density at the hip than they do at the spine. In people who don't exercise, the  density in each is about the same.    ""For instance, my bone density at the spine is 96-97% (normal), and at the hip  it's about 10% above normal because I exercise,"" she said, adding that  weight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging, stair-climbing and  weight-training have been shown to have beneficial effects on increasing bone  mass.    Dalsky said bones respond to exercise the same way that muscles do. ""If a  muscle isn't exercised, it atrophies. If it is exercised, it gets stronger and  so does bone. It becomes stronger by adding more mineral to the bone,"" Dalsky  said.    ""Our study is interested in not only keeping good bone in the spine, but also  in the hip, because hip fracture is what causes a lot of disability in people.  About 50% of people who suffer hip fractures do not resume a normal life. They  are wheelchair-bound or unable to live alone, so we are interested in building  bone, both at the spine and the hip,"" Dalsky said.    There are other factors that are believed to make a person susceptible to  osteoporosis, according to the osteoporosis foundation: Women who are thin and  small-framed are at greater risk than heavier women. Women who experience early  menopause may be more likely to develop osteoporosis than other women. Asian  and Caucasian women are more prone to developing the disease than black women,  although it is not known why. Calcium deficiency in childhood and early  adulthood can also increase the risk. Heredity also plays a role.    Angenette Rienow, 49, a financial secretary who lives in Farmington, Conn., is  a volunteer in the University of Connecticut study, which began this past  summer.    ""I've never had any health problems whatsoever, and the little I know about  osteoporosis is that slender people are more affected, and I've been slender  all my life,"" she said.    So far, she has had her bone density examined and her cholesterol checked. She  has undergone stress tests on a treadmill to determine her level of fitness and  kept a diary of her eating habits, and she is taking calcium supplements. In  the next few weeks, she will be assigned to a test group.    ""I just thought this would be a good opportunity to find out my physical  condition, as well as hopefully prevent (disease) from occurring,"" Rienow said.    She is not particularly worried about developing the disease, and she has never  known anyone who has it. ""But I don't exercise at all. I hear all the things  about the importance of exercising, and I am just not self-disciplined enough  to do it. I'm hoping that I get in the exercise group because I really want to  exercise. I'm a very committed person so if I get in the exercise group, I will  be there three or four times a week to exercise.""    Smith said regular exercise for younger women will help keep bones strong, but  she stressed that overdoing it can have serious ramifications.    ""We've all heard about women who exercise so strenuously that their menstrual  periods stop for some time. And that's dangerous because they lose the  protection of estrogen and they become susceptible to fracture much earlier in  life,"" she said.    The study may ultimately show that women who use a moderate exercise program up  to and beyond the age of menopause can offset bone loss.    The women in the study will have a program of brisk walking and climbing stairs  three times a week in a supervised setting, Smith says. ""We have a feeling that  will be enough to maintain bone mass, something that is definitely doable for  women in that age range,"" she said.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     FDA is announcing the availability of the 1992 revised informal labeling guidance texts for professional and patient labeling for estrogen drug products. The 1992 revisions reflect updated scientific information, particularly pertaining to the relationship between estrogen replacement therapy and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Although, the agency has distributed copies of the 1992 labeling guidance on a case-by-case basis, it is announcing its availability now to ensure more widespread distribution.      Under 21 CFR 314.70(c), a holder of an approved application for a new drug is required to submit a supplemental application to obtain approval for the following changes, among others, in the text of professional or patient labeling: to add or strengthen contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions, or to add or strengthen dosage and administration instructions to increase the safe use of the product. Manufacturers and other persons can refer to the labeling guidance texts for assistance in preparing supplemental applications to meet the labeling requirements of 21 CFR 310.515 for estrogen drug products and 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, and 201.100 for professional labeling of prescription drug products. In the     Federal Register     of May 4, 1990 (55 FR 18761), the agency announced the revocation of guideline texts of professional and patient labeling for estrogen drug products. The agency determined that the time period to finalize and announce revised guidelines prevented the agency from providing the most current medical information to manufacturers and others. Therefore, in place of guidelines, the agency announced that it would provide assistance in meeting labeling requirements in the form of informal labeling guidance texts.   Labeling guidance texts are informal documents. They do not bind or otherwise obligate the agency or a person referring to them and are not formal agency opinions. The agency does not require manufacturers printing professional and patient package inserts to follow the labeling guidance texts. Manufacturers and others are free to use an alternative or modified approach, although they are encouraged to consult with the Division of Metabolism and Endocrine Drug Products (address above) before drafting alternative labeling so that any differences can be resolved prior to the submission of a supplemental application, if such an application is required under 21 CFR 314.70.   Interested persons may submit written comments concerning the informal labeling guidance texts to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.            Dated: June 21, 1994.        Michael R.

Under 21 CFR 314.70(c), a holder of an approved application for a new drug is required to submit a supplemental application to obtain approval for the following changes, among others, in the text of professional or patient labeling: to add or strengthen contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions, or to add or strengthen dosage and administration instructions to increase the safe use of the product. Manufacturers and other persons can refer to the labeling guidance texts for assistance in preparing supplemental applications to meet the labeling requirements of 21 CFR 310.515 for estrogen drug products and 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, and 201.100 for professional labeling of prescription drug products. In the     Federal Register     of May 4, 1990 (55 FR 18761), the agency announced the revocation of guideline texts of professional and patient labeling for estrogen drug products. The agency determined that the time period to finalize and announce revised guidelines prevented the agency from providing the most current medical information to manufacturers and others. Therefore, in place of guidelines, the agency announced that it would provide assistance in meeting labeling requirements in the form of informal labeling guidance texts.   Labeling guidance texts are informal documents. They do not bind or otherwise obligate the agency or a person referring to them and are not formal agency opinions. The agency does not require manufacturers printing professional and patient package inserts to follow the labeling guidance texts. Manufacturers and others are free to use an alternative or modified approach, although they are encouraged to consult with the Division of Metabolism and Endocrine Drug Products (address above) before drafting alternative labeling so that any differences can be resolved prior to the submission of a supplemental application, if such an application is required under 21 CFR 314.70.   Interested persons may submit written comments concerning the informal labeling guidance texts to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.            Dated: June 21, 1994.        Michael R.

0," LA033089-0013   37201    March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition      Food; Part 8; Page 2; Column 1      2609 words      NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RESEARCHERS ASSAIL LACK OF CALCIUM IN WOMEN'S DIETS      By TONI TIPTON      The scientific community, including the National Research Council (NRC) and  U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, has a bone to pick with women who regularly  fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium or  who do so by swallowing calcium tablets in lieu of low-fat foods. There is  concern that the importance of continuously replenishing the body's supply of  the mineral through dietary sources has been under-evaluated and overshadowed  by the fear of fat in the diet.    A report released earlier this month by the NRC stressed the need for young and  adolescent women to increase their intake of dietary calcium. The Surgeon  General's Report on Nutrition and Health, published last year, also addressed  this topic.    ""Calcium is an essential nutrient,"" the NRC report stated. ""It is necessary for  adequate growth and skeletal development. Certain segments of the population,  especially women and adolescents, need to make careful food choices to obtain  adequate calcium from the food supply. The committee recommends that  consumption of low- and nonfat dairy products and dark green vegetables, which  are rich sources of calcium, can assist in maintaining calcium intake at  approximately the RDA levels.""    Furthermore, the report continues, ""the potential benefits of calcium intake  above the RDAs to prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well-documented  and do not justify the use of calcium supplements.""      Intake Drops    Figures taken from the USDA's nationwide food consumption survey found that in  1985 women between the ages of 19 and 34 managed to achieve only about 80% of  the RDA of calcium from food sources. Calcium intake for women in the 35- to  50-year-old age range, dropped to as low as 68% of the RDA -- which is itself  under scrutiny for being too low.    And since 1984, when a National Institutes of Health panel concluded that  post-menopausal women needed twice the RDA of calcium and pre-menopausal women  needed 1 1/2 times the RDA, supplement sales have ""skyrocketed,"" USDA reports.    To improve consumer intake of dietary calcium, researchers have launched a  triple attack. They are re-emphasizing the importance of building bone during  the formative years, noting that older women consuming less than half the  calcium needed over a prolonged period can suffer a loss of nearly 5% of spinal  bone per year. They are stressing that the female hormone estrogen has a  significant role in bone loss. And they are citing the negative effects of  meeting the recommended goal through supplementation.      Best Insurance    Research data indicates that taking extra calcium after menopause probably  doesn't slow bone loss and building additional bone during youth -- when the  soft tissue inside the bones is in a continuous state of development -- is the  best insurance against osteoporosis later in life.    This was underscored most recently when studies of high calcium intake in older  rats were completed. The research was directed by Dr. James C. Smith, head of  the Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Laboratory at Beltsville, Md., part of the  government's Agricultural Research Service.    ""I think there's a body of evidence that the best way is to build up the bones  before menopause,"" Smith said in an interview, adding, ""but I haven't worked  with women.""    His investigation was conducted at the Beltsville lab by University of Maryland  graduate students under the direction of Joseph H. Soares, nutrition professor.    It is scientific fact that the body's ability to absorb calcium is variable  with age. During typical periods of growth, intestinal absorption of calcium  increases, with infants and children absorbing up to 60% of the calcium they  ingest. Pregnant women use about 50% and other adults only retain about 30%.  Calcium available from supplements is often even less, depending upon the  binders used in the product, which can hold onto the calcium and prevent the  body from using it. The ability of an individual's stomach acid to dissolve the  supplements also is associated with malabsorption.    And there are other factors: bone loss accelerates naturally after age 35 and  becomes more and more difficult to retard with age; after menopause a steady  decline of estrogen -- an important component in bone mineralization -- is  observed, and the process of bone development appears to slow down as an animal  ages, making the bones solid, more brittle and thus less efficient at storing  calcium.    (Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.  But it is used for various bodily functions. These include: regulating cell and  nerve functions, maintaining normal blood pressure, muscle contraction  capabilities including maintaining heartbeat, clotting of blood and preserving  the material that holds cells together.)    ""The high calcium intake did not affect bone dynamics in the aged female rats  but increased bone formation in the young rats,"" said Rashmi Sinha, the  nutritionist who conducted the study. ""Just taking a lot of calcium later in  life, without replacing the female hormones, is not going to increase bone  formation as it does earlier in life.""      Risk of Cancer    But estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk for  endometrial cancer and requires ongoing medical follow-up, according to Dr.  Bess Dawson Hughes, director of the Calcium and Bone Research Laboratory at the  USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. She is  currently conducting a five-year study of 360 post-menopausal women to  determine the benefit of taking calcium, how much is necessary to minimize bone  loss and the potential hazards associated with calcium supplementation.  Preliminary results indicate that with extremely low intakes of calcium --  below the current U.S. intake level of 600 milligrams -- there is some benefit,  even without estrogen replacement therapy.    ""The study suggests that postmenopausal women most likely to benefit from  increased calcium are those who consume less than 400 milligrams a day, the  equivalent of 1 1/3 glasses of milk,"" she said.    ""If our research shows calcium can retard bone loss in some women regardless of  estrogen, that's good news, because estrogen replacement therapy isn't for  everybody.""    Osteoporosis is the gradual loss of bone mineral from the skeleton, occuring in  millions of American women (and some men), and it ""goes on for many, many  years,"" she said. It starts as early as age 20 and continues at a rate of 1% a  year in women throughout their lives. The rate in men is about .25% per year.    This deterioration typically starts out in the spine, and manifests itself as a  compression fracture. It is a very common disorder, according to Dawson Hughes,  who estimated that one out of every four white women over the age of 60 will be  afflicted with the ailment. There are a number of factors that increase risk.    Since women have less bone to start with and tend to lose it at a greater rate  from their spines, being a female is the primary factor, said Dawson Hughes.  Being either Asian or Caucasian is another. Family history has a role, as does  a lifetime of low calcium intake. Early menopause, low body weight, sedentary  life style, bearing no children, alcohol abuse, high sodium intake, cigarette  smoking, high caffeine intake, high protein intake and high phosphorus intake  are others.    One conclusion that can be drawn is that younger women, who typically are  deficient in calcium as well as iron, should adjust their diets to include at  least three servings of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods per day,  instead of relying on supplements.    According to the National Dairy Board, a serving size is: 1 cup milk, 8 ounces  yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces natural cheese or 2 ounces processed cheese.    Drinking nonfat or low-fat milk is the most efficient way to accomplish this.  One (8-ounce) serving of fluid nonfat milk provides about 90 calories, less  than a gram of fat and 300 milligrams of calcium. The same size serving of 1%  low-fat milk offers 102 calories, 3 grams fat and 300 milligrams calcium.  One-cup of whole milk provides the most calories and fat for its calcium  benefit -- 150 calories, 8 grams fat and 291 grams calcium -- while 2% low fat  has just slightly less calories and fat: 121 and 5 grams fat for its 297 grams  calcium.      Meeting Dairy Requirement    If drinking milk is not an option, here are some dairy and non-dairy foods  which in combination can help meet the daily requirement: 1 ounce of low-fat  cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella adds 200 milligrams calcium; 1 cup low-fat  cottage cheese offers about 140 milligrams calcium, 1 cup low-fat fruit-added  yogurt, 345; 3 ounces canned salmon with bones, 180, and 3 ounces sardines, 300  milligrams.    Dark leafy vegetables, in general, are rich in calcium, but some, such as kale,  broccoli and beet greens, are the best absorbed. Other types, such as spinach  and turnip greens, contain a naturally occuring calcium binder, which tends to  hold on to the calcium.    Some processed foods, because of fortification or a calcium-salt additive used  in the manufacturing process, are also good sources of dietary calcium. These  include tofu (bean curd), canned tomatoes, stone-ground or self-rising flour  and blackstrap molasses.    In addition to increasing low-fat sources of calcium in the diet, women are  encouraged to develop a regular routine of exercise. This helps maintain bone  mass and stimulates new bone formation. Although Dawson Hughes admits that the  exact role of exercise in the maintenance of bone mass remains a little  unclear, it appears that it is ""very, very important.""    She said it apparently increased bone density in a studied population  representing a cross section of women of all ages -- particularly those who  previously were extremely sedentary.    In another study, women who exercised for one hour, three times a week  increased their bone mineral content by 1% over a one-year period. Those, who  did not decreased their bone mineral content by the same amount.    ""If you took the balance on a daily basis,"" she explained, ""the exercisers were  gaining 42 milligrams of calcium for their bodies. You have about 100,000  milligrams in your body, so that doesn't sound like much. But every day, day  in, day out, that adds up . . . . It's a very effective means of impact on your  bones.""

NEIL SOLOMON      Question: I am confused about the value of exercise in preventing bone loss for  women in their 20s and 30s. I must have read a thousand times that exercise can  help prevent bone loss. But I met a young woman who is in her late 20s who is a  marathoner, and she says that she's been told by her doctor that her bones are  getting thinner, and that she should consider cutting back on the amount of  running she does. How can exercise be both good and bad in relation to bone  loss?    Answer: In general, exercise is beneficial in helping prevent osteoporosis  (bone loss). However, young women who engage in very strenuous exercise  sometimes stop having their menstrual periods, and their estrogen levels are  low. These women may have a low bone density, which is probably associated with  their lower estrogen levels. Nevertheless, they generally have a higher bone  density than women who don't exercise and who don't have their periods.

Dipropylene glycol is a component of antifreeze, air fresheners/sanitizers and is used as a stabilizer in cosmetics, as a component in polyester, alkyd resins, plastics, as a plasticizer and as a solvent. It is a relatively high production volume chemical with nearly 100 million pounds used in the United States annually. It was found to be of low to moderate toxicity in NTP 13-week studies.

Arsenic trioxide is a byproduct of copper or lead smelting operations and is used in pesticides, in the manufacture of glass, pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals. Arsenic and arsenic compounds have been classified as human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, but the demonstration of the carcinogenicity of arsenic trioxide and other arsenical compounds in rodents has been difficult. Arsenic is a common water contaminant and there is need for information on biomarkers of exposure for low dose risk estimations. For these reasons the program has selected arsenic trioxide for study as part of an initiative to examine human carcinogens which have not adequately been evaluated in rodent studies. Specific study designs are under development.     Chemical 21. Tamoxifen (CAS No. 10540291)/conjugated estrogens study plans are being formulated.     Studies on tamoxifen and conjugated estrogens will be designed to address several issues. Conjugated estrogens are listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as human carcinogens causing endometrial cancer, however these chemicals have never been adequately studied in animals. These chemicals find wide use in human medicine and in skin care preparations. Estrogens are prescribed for prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and are used as oral contraceptives. Tamoxifen is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist known to be effective in the treatment and prevention of estrogen sensitive breast cancer. Tamoxifen also causes endometrial cancer in humans.

NEIL SOLOMON      Question: Suppose that for one reason or another a man does not have sexual  relations for a long time. What happens to the semen? Can going without sexual  relations affect his health?    Answer: A lack of sexual relations over an extended period of time does not  necessarily affect a man's physical or emotional health. After a while, there  is a reduction in the amount of semen produced and, eventually, the sperm die.    Q: Suppose a woman who is in the menopause has been told that she is not  supposed to use estrogen, but she still gets symptoms of the menopause. What is  she supposed to do? Is there anything she can take or is she just supposed to  suffer?    A: If your question refers to a particular person and is not of a general  nature, I would strongly urge the woman to see a physician. Of course there are  treatments that can be used if estrogen use is contraindicated as, for example,  in the case of breast cancer.    If a woman experiences hot flushes, for example, there is medication that would  alleviate the condition. If the problem is vaginal dryness, lubrication may  prove helpful. And even in the treatment of osteoporosis, for which estrogen  replacement is the treatment of choice, other therapies are available.    Women with menopausal symptoms should not suffer in silence. The first step is  to see a physician.    Q: Is there any treatment for a child who walks in his sleep, or is it just a  matter of letting him outgrow it?    A: Treatment for sleepwalking must be pursued on a number of levels. For  example, from the standpoint of safety, it would simply be common sense to make  certain that there are no sharp objects and no glass in the child's room. If a  sleepwalking episode does occur, the parent or other caretaker should not  awaken the child but should calmly lead him or her back to the room and into  bed.    External factors, such as excessive fatigue or sleep deprivation, can trigger a  sleepwalking episode; therefore, these aggravating factors should be  eliminated.    More formal treatment approaches, such as psychoanalysis, have not been  uniformly successful. Some authorities recommend traditional psychotherapy only  for adults who sleepwalk and who have a definite psychiatric disorder.

But a new  study finds they're at lower risk for developing breast cancer than their  ""apple-shaped"" sisters, who carry more weight in their abdomen than in their  thighs and buttocks.    In fact, an overweight, pear-shaped woman can be at lower risk of breast cancer  than a leaner, apple-shaped woman, according to Florida researchers, who  published their study in the current Annals of Internal Medicine. They compared  216 breast-cancer patients with 432 control patients, classifying them as  apple-shaped or pear-shaped by computing their waist-to-hip ratio.    (Waist-hip ratios are computed by dividing waist measurement by hip  measurement. Waist-hip ratios of .77 to .80 are classified as mildly  apple-shaped; ratios higher than .80 are termed very apple-shaped. Ratios from  .73 to .76 are termed mildly pear-shaped; those below .73 are very  pear-shaped.)    Women with mildly apple-shaped figures are three times as likely to develop  breast cancer, said Dr. David V. Schapira, a University of South Florida  associate professor of medicine and the study's principal investigator. The  risk is about equal to having a sister or mother with breast cancer, he said.  Women described as ""very apple-shaped"" have a six-fold greater risk.    In contrast, women who are mildly pear-shaped or very pear-shaped have a low  risk of getting breast cancer, Schapira said.    ""Everybody believes diet and (being) fat has something to do with breast  cancer,"" said Dr. Gary H. Lyman, professor of internal medicine at the  University of South Florida and another researcher on the study. ""This research  takes the study of risks a step further. It's not just excess weight or total  body fat that increases breast cancer risk. It's where that body fat is  distributed,"" said Lyman, who noted that the data needs to be confirmed by  other studies.    The Florida study isn't the first to consider the impact of body fat  distribution on health. Recently, other researchers reported that people with  beer bellies have lower levels of the so-called ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) than  those with trimmer tummies.    The Florida scientists don't know for sure why apple-shaped women seem to be at  greater risk of breast cancer, but suspect a hormonal link. ""Apple-shaped women  have higher levels of circulating estrogens. We don't know exactly why,""  Schapira said. ""But those higher estrogen levels are believed to increase  breast cancer risk,"" he said.    The good news? Apple-shaped women who lose weight seem to redistribute the  weight in a more desirable way, said Lyman, who is studying that possibility  further. When an apple-shaped woman loses weight and becomes more pear-shaped,  the abdominal fat cells -- which are bigger and more metabolically active than  fat cells in the buttocks and thighs -- shrink proportionately more than those  on the thighs or buttocks, Schapira said, thus perhaps reducing the circulating  estrogen levels.    The recommendations based on the study? ""Mildly apple-shaped women should pay  more attention to guidelines about breast cancer prevention, such as  mammography,"" Schapira said. ""Physicians should pay more attention to these  women in terms of counseling and encouraging them to follow prevention  guidelines and a sound diet.""    But a local cancer prevention expert disagrees. Dr. William Hindle, director of  the Breast Diagnostic Center at Los Angeles County/USC Women's Hospital, said  the study should not alter patient management a whit. Every woman -- and  especially those over 40 -- needs to be concerned about breast cancer risk, he  said. ""There's a long list of risks associated with breast cancer,"" said  Hindle.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     One facet of oral contraceptive technology which has received little attention over the last three decades is the development of new orally active estrogens with attractive pharmacologic profiles. These would include hormones with fewer side effects than those associated with the currently available estrogens, ethynylestradiol and its 3-methyl ether (mestranol), notably nausea, vomiting, alterations in liver function, and histopathology and clotting disorders. Some clinicians have suggested that the presence of the 17-ethynyl moiety, which protects the steroid from rapid metabolism by the liver (so-called ``first-pass'' effect) and thus confers oral activity, is also responsible for many of the side effects observed with these drugs.       In an effort to develop nonethynylated estrogens, NICHD has synthesized several estradiol nitrate esters which exhibit potent estrogenic activity in rats and rhesus monkeys following both oral, subcutaneous, and percutaneous administration. Using an increase in the uterine weight of immature rats (rat uterotropic test) as an endpoint, two of these esters were more than five times as potent as ethynylestradiol following oral administration. They also induce estrogen withdrawal bleeding in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys following both oral and percutaneous administration. They are very potent postcoital agents following oral administration to rats on days 04 of gestation.   The superiority of these esters to ethynylestradiol or its methyl ether as the estrogenic component of oral contraceptive tablets will depend upon clinical and histopathological findings from toxicity studies in animals and/or clinical observations in Phase I and II human studies. The estradiol nitrate esters also have considerable potential clinical utility as replacement estrogens in menopausal women. The most widely used therapeutic regimens involve oral administration of ethynylestradiol, estradiol or conjugated estrogens (principally estrone sulfate) either continuously or cyclically, with or without addition of a progestin, much of which depends on the presence or absence of the uterus.   Compounds of this series have been studied for estrogenic potency following oral, subcutaneous and topical administration and pharmacokinetic data are available on several analogs utilizing radioimmunoassays developed by the Government.

0,FT924-979 ,"FT924-979 _AN-CLUB4ABIFT 921221   FT  21 DEC 92 / Management: Go to work on some calcium - Health check      By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON   What do such diverse things as teeth, bones, oyster shells, chalk, limestone, marble and pearls have in common? Calcium. This mineral is essential in maintaining bone density, nerve transmission, heart beat regulation, muscle contraction and blood clotting. Moreover, researchers are finding increasingly important roles for calcium, notably with regard to heart disease. More than 95 per cent of the body's calcium is in the bones. One's need for calcium increases steadily through adolesence. Between the ages of 20 and 40, calcium increases bone density and thickness. Osteoporosis, or 'porous bones', is a gradual loss of structural minerals (decalcification) which begins in adulthood and progresses with age. If you are worried about osteoporosis, consider these measures: Take regular exercise. A 20-30 minute walk three times a week will help to keep your bones strong and healthy. Don't smoke. Have only moderate alcohol and coffee consumption. If you are a woman, discuss estrogen hormonal replacement with your doctor. Increase daily calcium intake. Calcium-rich foods include low-fat skimmed milk, yoghurt, cheeses, leafy greens, canned salmon, sardines with bones, kale, broccoli and tofu. Avoid aluminium-containing antacids. Avoid eating excessive protein. If you feel that you are unable to get enough calcium, either because of insufficient intake or excessive loss - through drinking of alcohol and coffee - you could consider calcium supplements. However, as extra calcium intake can be associated with kidney stones, check with your doctor before beginning such a regime. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

Would you please print the address for the Hemlock Society again, so I can  contact them?    Answer: The decision you contemplate is an intensely personal one. Needless to  say, no one should take such an irrevocable step without careful consultation  with a physician, clergyman or family member.    Pain can be managed successfully at home or in the hospital with a number of  effective analgesics. We also suggest you contact your local hospice  organization.

A three-judge panel of the 2nd District Court of Appeal issued its finding in  the case of Kathleen Brownfield, who was a 21-year-old Loyola Marymount  University student in June, 1985, when she was raped and taken to Daniel  Freeman Marina Hospital.    Represented by attorney Gloria Allred, Brownfield sued the Catholic hospital  for allegedly refusing to give her or tell her about the estrogen prophylaxis  pill Ovral.

A three-judge panel of the 2nd District Court of Appeal issued its finding in  the case of Kathleen Brownfield, who was a 21-year-old Loyola Marymount  University student in June, 1985, when she was raped and taken to Daniel  Freeman Marina Hospital.

Up to 12,000 brain surgery patients who are at risk of dying  from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may never be traced, the  Department of Health said yesterday.    Details of the threat to thousands more patients emerged as  hundreds of callers jammed an emergency helpline set up after  the health department announced that a hormone treatment for  infertility might put some patients at risk.    Women complained that they could not get through to the  helpline despite an increase in the number of operators  answering calls from 12 to 65. ""I am not hysterical about this  but I want to establish what is going on,"" said a company  director who called THE TIMES. ""I have been on the phone all  morning and I cannot get through. I think the way this is being  handled is appalling.""    Doctors estimate that 300 women who took human pituitary  gonadotrophin over a 30-year period up to 1985 may be at risk,  but more than 100,000 women have taken other forms of the  hormone and have been jamming the lines. People who received  growth hormone obtained from human pituitary glands as children  are also at risk.    The department confirmed last night that brain surgery  patients operated on between 1971 and 1991 who had a form of  preserved human tissue grafted into their brains were also at  risk from CJD, the human form of ""mad cow"" disease.    Three patients in the UK have died from the condition after  brain grafts and there have been five other deaths worldwide.  The preserved tissue, obtained from the brains of cadavers and  marketed as Lyodura, was withdrawn in 1991. The health  department had given a warning about its risks four years  earlier.    Lyodura is a preserved form of the membrane covering the  brain used to replace the patient's own membrane when it is  damaged in surgery. It was obtained from the brains of cadavers  and freeze-dried to preserve it. Scientists assumed that this  process would destroy the CJD virus but when the first case of  the disease linked with the material emerged in the US in 1987,  the manufacturing process was tightened.    A second warning was issued by the health department in 1989  after a second patient died of the disease in New Zealand. The  British cases occurred in 1990 and 1991.    ""We have acted at each stage as the evidence has hardened,""  a  health department spokesman said. Six hundred people a year had  received the grafts over 20 years, but the chances of further  cases emerging were ""likely to be small,"" he said.    However, the department said later that the disease could  take up to ten years to develop following infection through a  brain graft. There is a 30-year incubation period following  infection through pituitary hormone.    The spokesman said it would be extremely difficult to  identify the brain surgery patients at risk. ""Many who had  surgery wouldn't know whether they were treated with Lyodura.  Millions of records would have to be checked, some of which may  have been destroyed,"" he said.    Professor Ian Cooke, who is heading the counselling  co-ordinating centre at Sheffield's Jessop Hospital for Women,  said there were records for half the 300 believed to be at risk,  but some data were up to 25 years old.    Only six women who had contacted the helpline had been  definitely identified as having received human pituitary  gonadotrophin out of the thousands who had called. Many had been  treated with human menopausal gonadotrophin, a product obtained  from the urine of postmenopausal women, which carries no risk.    TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1993     "

Is it safe to drink prune juice every day to stay regular? Can a  person become addicted to it?    Answer. People have asked about addiction to lots of things -- sleeping pills,  nose drops, coffee and sedatives -- but this is the first time anyone has ever  asked about prune juice. Although we counsel against overuse of laxatives, we  can't imagine anyone getting into trouble with prunes.    The ""funny"" fruit is high in vitamins A and B-6, potassium, magnesium and  fiber. You may not need to drink prune juice more than once or twice a week to  stay regular, but there is no evidence that a daily dose of prunes is harmful.  That's not true of many laxatives, herbal or otherwise.    Q. I read about Wellbutrin in a medical newsletter two years ago. They said it  is supposed to enhance sexual desire. But my doctor says he has never heard of  it.    I know doctors sometimes prescribe estrogen for women with low libido, but I  had cancer several years ago and can't take any form of estrogen.    Please tell me if Wellbutrin is available and how well it works. I believe it  could be a great help for a woman like me.    A. Wellbutrin (bupropion) is a new antidepressant that works differently from  conventional medications. It is less likely to cause drowsiness, mental  confusion and constipation. Instead of weight gain, Wellbutrin may actually  lead to weight loss.    One unique ""side effect"" that has been reported with Wellbutrin is an increase  in sexual interest. This reaction needs further study, however, and the company  denies that the drug is an aphrodisiac.    Because the drug does have the potential to cause adverse reactions, including  nausea, headache, tremor, insomnia, jitteriness and occasionally seizures, it  should not be used casually.    Q. I would like to use a motion-sickness drug such as Antivert or Dramamine on  trips. The label states, however, ""Avoid use in case of enlarged prostate.""    I don't see the connection. What would Dramamine do to a man with prostate  enlargement?    A. Such medications can cause difficult or painful urination. You and other men  with enlarged prostates are especially susceptible. In the worst case, you  could find your bladder full but be unable to empty it, a urinary emergency  that sometimes requires catheterization.

A number of articles in the medical literature have addressed the role of calcium intake in the prevention of disorders including osteoporosis and other bone diseases, colon cancer, and high blood pressure (hypertension) including preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Results of one recent study indicated that high calcium intake can decrease the risk of kidney stones_a somewhat surprising conclusion since high dietary calcium intake had been strongly suspected to increase the risk of kidney stones.     Osteoporosis affects more than 25 million people in the United States and is the major underlying cause of bone fractures in postmenopausal women and the elderly. Two important factors that influence whether osteoporosis occurs are the peak bone density (or bone mass) attained in early life (by about age 30) and the rate at which bones is lost in later life. Calcium intake is thought to help build denser, stronger bones in early life and to slow the rate of bone loss with age.     Results from several studies reported in the recent medical literature suggest that increased calcium intake is beneficial for bone health in people in different age groups, from children to the very elderly. The results of this research and studies on other diseases indicate that the optimal level of calcium intake may be greater than the amount consumed by a majority of the American people. This conference will discuss and thoroughly evaluate the information available on calcium intake and disease prevention.     Optimal calcium intake may vary according to the disease being considered, and may also vary according to a person's age, sex, and ethnicity. Optimal calcium intake may be achieved by diet, calcium supplements, or calcium-fortified foods, or by various combinations of these. In addition, various cofactors play a role in achieving optimal calcium intake. These include both factors such as vitamin D, which is needed for optimal calcium absorption, and factors that can negatively influence calcium availability, such as certain medications or foods. The purpose of this NIH consensus conference is to evaluate the available data on optimal calcium intake and health status. Conference participants will include specialists in many different fields, including osteoporosis and bone health, oncology, hypertension, human nutrition, and food fortification and labeling, as well as representatives from the public.     After 11/2 days of presentations and audience discussion, an independent, non-Federal consensus panel will weigh the scientific evidence and write a draft statement in response to the following key questions:     What is the optimal amount of calcium intake?     What are the important cofactors for achieving optimal calcium intake?     What are the risk factors associated with different levels of calcium intake?     What are the best ways to attain optimal calcium intake?     What public health strategies are available and needed to implement optimal calcium intake?     What are the recommendations for future research on calcium?     On the final day of the meeting, the consensus panel chairman will read the draft statement to the conference audience and invite comments and questions.

By CHARLES S. TAYLOR, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      ATLANTA      You are looking at your legs one day and notice the beginnings of unsightly  varicose or spider veins. ""Well,"" you might say, ""I may have to have surgery on  those one of these days.""    But Dr. Terrance Walsh says that is not necessarily the case. All you may need  to do is get a few virtually painless injections to make those lumpy veins  disappear.    Symptoms include aching, swelling, a sense of heaviness, itching and leg  restlessness. Complications range from leg cramps to severe disability.    Walsh said varicose veins are caused by malfunctioning valves which allow blood  to be pulled down into a vein and accumulate. Large veins swell and have a  bluish hue while smaller ones become thread-like purple lines called spider  veins.    ""A lot of people don't know that there is any alternative other than surgery,""  said Walsh, head of the Atlanta office of the Vein Clinics of America.    The method Walsh and related clinics use is called refined compression  sclerotherapy. It uses the drug Sotradecol and special compression bandages to  treat diseases of the veins.    During the procedure, the drug is injected into a varicose vein. The walls of  the vein become irritated and fuse to each other, sealing the leaking blood  valve. Special compression bandages used in the three- to seven-day treatment  speed the fusion.    The clinics claim a success rate of nearly 100% for all patients, including  those who have had previous vein surgery. Treatment is performed on an  outpatient basis.    Walsh said his clinic charges between $1,000 to $2,500 per leg for the  treatment, which is about one-fourth of the cost of traditional surgery to  treat varicose and spider veins.    There are a variety of other techniques available for treating vein disorders  without surgery. They include laser beams, electrocautery and saline  sclerotherapy, in which saline solution is injected into veins.    Dr. Jerry King, an independent Chicago vascular surgeon, said the use of  refined compression sclerotherapy ""is a very acceptable way"" of treating veins  as an alternative to surgery.    There are cases, he said, when refined compression sclerotherapy should not be  used, such as when veins are ulcerating.    Researchers say varicose veins are largely hereditary but other factors can  exacerbate them, such as obesity or standing for long periods of time,  increased estrogen levels brought on by pregnancy, menstruation or taking birth  control pills.    Prevention strategies include proper nutrition and exercise, avoidance of  long-term standing, keeping legs elevated and wearing support stockings,  experts say.

By GERRI KOBREN, THE BALTIMORE SUN      Doctors aren't writing grocery lists on prescription blanks, and no one is  advising: ""Take two cabbages and call me in the morning."" But a major effort is  now under way in the United States -- with tantalizing early results -- to  determine whether if certain foods can protect us from cancer.    Already a variety of fruits and vegetables and hundreds of chemicals in them  have been identified as possible shields against various kinds of cancer:    Vitamins A, C and E.    Beta carotene, the coloring agent in carrots, and other carotenoids.    Sulfur compounds.    Selenium and calcium.    Flavonoids, indoles, coumarins and a lot of other multisyllabic chemicals found  in plants.    ""I liken this to where we were with cigarettes and lung cancer 20 years ago. We  didn't know for sure, but there was a lot of circumstantial evidence,"" says Dr.  Sherman Gorbach, cancer researcher and professor of community health and  medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.    ""The preponderance of evidence, in cancer, favors a change in diet,"" he says.  In Japan, for instance, where the breast cancer rate is low, women eat twice  the fiber we do and have only 22% or 23% of their calories in fat.    ""If you are really serious about preventing breast cancer,"" Gorbach advises,  ""you have to reduce fats below 25% of calories and increase your fiber.""    He says that the fiber should come from soybeans and rye, which have components  that block the cancer-causing effect of estrogen on breast cells; from  crucifers such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli, which most experts believe  may have protective qualities; and from fruits and vegetables high in  beta-carotene and Vitamin C.    ""We don't know which ones are best, so we recommend mixed fiber sources,"" he  says.    Even so, he is more definite than many others.    At the National Cancer Institute's Diet and Cancer branch, the attitude is also  wait-and-see. There, Herbert Pierson, Ph.D., heads a study of the  cancer-fighting ability of garlic, citrus, licorice root, flaxseed and  ""umbelliferous"" vegetables such as carrots, parsnips and parsley -- so-called  because they have umbrella-shaped flowers.    His project aims ultimately at collaboration with food manufacturers in the  development of ""designer foods,"" processed foods enhanced with protective  chemicals.    For the present, however, Pierson is cautious:    ""The epidemiological data suggest that adding fruits, vegetables, grains and  spices to the diet has a beneficial effect,"" he says. ""But most investigators  don't want to commit themselves until the hard scientific data are all in  place.""    There is reason for the wariness. So far, the evidence comes from population  studies, like the fat-and-fiber data from Japan, or the study of garlic  consumption in China that shows less stomach cancer in places where people eat  a lot of garlic.    Whether that information really establishes cause and effect and whether it can  be applied in the United States -- where food habits, lifestyle, environmental  conditions and ethnic make-up are different -- is still unknown.    Animal studies are similarly inconclusive. The effect of massive doses of  suspected anti-carcinogens in short-lived mice may be entirely different from  the effect of smaller doses in long-lived humans.    Some of the pathways by which the presumed anti-cancer foodstuffs work have,  however, been decoded. It's believed that one group of protective factors,  known as anti-oxidants, clears away potentially harmful waste products. Others  prevent carcinogens from attaching to particular kinds of cells. And still  others make the body produce extra quantities of powerful enzymes that  deactivate certain carcinogens.    But it is possible that those extra enzymes could also increase the effect of  other carcinogens. Even the much-touted crucifers -- vegetables like cabbage,  cauliflower, broccoli and bok choy -- could, therefore, have a downside,  because they contain factors with the enzyme-boosting effect.    Moreover, major dietary changes, aimed at cancer prevention, could affect other  areas of health and nutrition.    A high-fiber diet, for example, is widely recommended because its indigestible  bulk is thought to sweep wastes out fast enough to prevent carcinogenic  contamination of the colon. Fiber also might sweep away some natural estrogenic  compounds believed to be associated with initiation or spread of breast cancer,  Gorbach says.    But fiber in the gut also tangles with dietary minerals, preventing absorption  of necessary nutrients.    And while low-fat is desirable, no-fat is dangerous; the body needs some for  normal function. Besides, fat is the dietary source of vitamins A and E, both  of which are in the protective category because of their anti-oxidant activity.    Nevertheless, the data supporting the probability of food-borne cancer fighters  has been mounting for decades, and has encouraged increasingly sophisticated  research.    At the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Dr. Gary Gordon, assistant professor  of oncology, and Dr. Paul Talalay, professor of molecular pharmacology, have  been measuring the ability of compounds derived from broccoli to increase  enzymes that detoxify carcinogens.    ""Multiple factors from crucifers do it,"" Talalay says. And what he's found is  that they do it better when the broccoli is fresher. ""It does lose its charm  when it's been around for a while,"" he says.    The broccoli in the supermarket bin might, therefore, not be fresh enough to  provide those good factors. The broccoli in the bag in the freezer might, or  might not, have been frozen fast enough either. ""We've had no decent way of  assessing the anti-cancer properties"" of commercially available broccoli,  Talalay says.    Nor can he tell us yet whether to eat it raw or cooked, steamed or microwaved,  with stems or without. ""What's relevant for the housewife?"" he asks. ""I can't  tell you.""    At the Institute for Hormone Research in New York City, Dr. Jon J. Michnovicz  and H. Leon Bradlow, Ph.D., have focused on just one particular factor from  crucifers -- a chemical known as indole-3-carbinol, or IC.    ""We know it prevents mammary tumors in mice,"" Michnovicz says.    Although populations that consume a lot of crucifers have fewer cases of breast  cancer, no one knows for sure whether IC is as protective in mankind as it is  in mice.    Michnovicz and Bradlow have brought us one step closer to the answer by giving  IC to people, and in both men and women, they have found a dramatic increase in  production of an enzyme that deactivates a form of estrogen associated with  breast cancer.    But there's a possible kicker in this.    Michnovicz says that if you give animals a whopping dose of certain other  carcinogens, and then give IC, they may be more susceptible to tumor formation.    Suzanne Hendrick, Ph.D., of the University of Iowa and a principal investigator  in an NCI animal study of possible anti-carcinogenic nutrients, focuses on the  crucifer connection in another way. She's measuring the activity of crucifers  high in indoles vs. the crucifers high in a group of anti-oxidant compounds  known as ""dithiolathiones.""    But that will not tell the whole story either. Crucifers also contain Vitamin  C, another known anti-oxidant. Vitamin C is one of the reasons NCI is  interested in citrus, which also contains such possible anti-carcinogens as  flavonoids, limonoids and coumarins.    Broccoli and kale, in the crucifer group, are also especially high in an  anti-oxidant known as beta carotene. Best known for its pigmenting effect in  orange-colored foods such as carrots, beta carotene's effectiveness in  population and animal studies has brought it to the point of NCI-sponsored  trials in human beings.    ""The fact is that when you are eating a food, you're eating all the components  in it,"" Hendrick says. And that has implications both good and bad.    ""The stage we're in now is the more we learn, the more complicated it gets. We  don't want to push people to eat something that 10 years down the line causes  more problems than it cures.""      Wire    "," LA080290-0231   256203    August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition      Food; Part H; Page 42; Column 1      1336 words      WAR ON CANCER BEING WAGED ON DIETARY FRONT;    HEALTH: RESEARCHERS ARE NOW LOOKING AT FOODS THAT MIGHT DESTROY CARCINOGENS OR  AT LEAST PROTECT THE BODY FROM THEM.      By GERRI KOBREN, THE BALTIMORE SUN      Doctors aren't writing grocery lists on prescription blanks, and no one is  advising: ""Take two cabbages and call me in the morning."" But a major effort is  now under way in the United States -- with tantalizing early results -- to  determine whether if certain foods can protect us from cancer.    Already a variety of fruits and vegetables and hundreds of chemicals in them  have been identified as possible shields against various kinds of cancer:    Vitamins A, C and E.    Beta carotene, the coloring agent in carrots, and other carotenoids.    Sulfur compounds.    Selenium and calcium.    Flavonoids, indoles, coumarins and a lot of other multisyllabic chemicals found  in plants.    ""I liken this to where we were with cigarettes and lung cancer 20 years ago. We  didn't know for sure, but there was a lot of circumstantial evidence,"" says Dr.  Sherman Gorbach, cancer researcher and professor of community health and  medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.    ""The preponderance of evidence, in cancer, favors a change in diet,"" he says.  In Japan, for instance, where the breast cancer rate is low, women eat twice  the fiber we do and have only 22% or 23% of their calories in fat.    ""If you are really serious about preventing breast cancer,"" Gorbach advises,  ""you have to reduce fats below 25% of calories and increase your fiber.""    He says that the fiber should come from soybeans and rye, which have components  that block the cancer-causing effect of estrogen on breast cells; from  crucifers such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli, which most experts believe  may have protective qualities; and from fruits and vegetables high in  beta-carotene and Vitamin C.    ""We don't know which ones are best, so we recommend mixed fiber sources,"" he  says.    Even so, he is more definite than many others.    At the National Cancer Institute's Diet and Cancer branch, the attitude is also  wait-and-see. There, Herbert Pierson, Ph.D., heads a study of the  cancer-fighting ability of garlic, citrus, licorice root, flaxseed and  ""umbelliferous"" vegetables such as carrots, parsnips and parsley -- so-called  because they have umbrella-shaped flowers.    His project aims ultimately at collaboration with food manufacturers in the  development of ""designer foods,"" processed foods enhanced with protective  chemicals.    For the present, however, Pierson is cautious:    ""The epidemiological data suggest that adding fruits, vegetables, grains and  spices to the diet has a beneficial effect,"" he says. ""But most investigators  don't want to commit themselves until the hard scientific data are all in  place.""    There is reason for the wariness. So far, the evidence comes from population  studies, like the fat-and-fiber data from Japan, or the study of garlic  consumption in China that shows less stomach cancer in places where people eat  a lot of garlic.    Whether that information really establishes cause and effect and whether it can  be applied in the United States -- where food habits, lifestyle, environmental  conditions and ethnic make-up are different -- is still unknown.    Animal studies are similarly inconclusive. The effect of massive doses of  suspected anti-carcinogens in short-lived mice may be entirely different from  the effect of smaller doses in long-lived humans.    Some of the pathways by which the presumed anti-cancer foodstuffs work have,  however, been decoded. It's believed that one group of protective factors,  known as anti-oxidants, clears away potentially harmful waste products. Others  prevent carcinogens from attaching to particular kinds of cells. And still  others make the body produce extra quantities of powerful enzymes that  deactivate certain carcinogens.    But it is possible that those extra enzymes could also increase the effect of  other carcinogens. Even the much-touted crucifers -- vegetables like cabbage,  cauliflower, broccoli and bok choy -- could, therefore, have a downside,  because they contain factors with the enzyme-boosting effect.    Moreover, major dietary changes, aimed at cancer prevention, could affect other  areas of health and nutrition.    A high-fiber diet, for example, is widely recommended because its indigestible  bulk is thought to sweep wastes out fast enough to prevent carcinogenic  contamination of the colon. Fiber also might sweep away some natural estrogenic  compounds believed to be associated with initiation or spread of breast cancer,  Gorbach says.    But fiber in the gut also tangles with dietary minerals, preventing absorption  of necessary nutrients.    And while low-fat is desirable, no-fat is dangerous; the body needs some for  normal function. Besides, fat is the dietary source of vitamins A and E, both  of which are in the protective category because of their anti-oxidant activity.    Nevertheless, the data supporting the probability of food-borne cancer fighters  has been mounting for decades, and has encouraged increasingly sophisticated  research.    At the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Dr. Gary Gordon, assistant professor  of oncology, and Dr. Paul Talalay, professor of molecular pharmacology, have  been measuring the ability of compounds derived from broccoli to increase  enzymes that detoxify carcinogens.    ""Multiple factors from crucifers do it,"" Talalay says. And what he's found is  that they do it better when the broccoli is fresher. ""It does lose its charm  when it's been around for a while,"" he says.    The broccoli in the supermarket bin might, therefore, not be fresh enough to  provide those good factors. The broccoli in the bag in the freezer might, or  might not, have been frozen fast enough either. ""We've had no decent way of  assessing the anti-cancer properties"" of commercially available broccoli,  Talalay says.    Nor can he tell us yet whether to eat it raw or cooked, steamed or microwaved,  with stems or without. ""What's relevant for the housewife?"" he asks. ""I can't  tell you.""

0," LA062690-0083   238913    June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition      View; Part E; Page 1; Column 2; View Desk      1547 words      PERSONAL HEALTH: LINKS BETWEEN CANCER, DIETARY FAT INCREASE      By SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Americans need only look at the Chinese, Japanese and Southern Italians to see  we eat far too much fat, say authors of several recent studies pointing to the  strong connection between dietary fat and particular types of cancers.    Dietary fat, fondly found in such goodies as ice cream and avocados, is a  well-known contributor to heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Now  evidence is accumulating that it contributes mightily to some cancers,  particularly breast and colorectal cancer, and, possibly, prostate, pancreatic  and ovarian cancer.    While physicians know dietary fat increases deposits in blood vessels that  cause heart disease, much less is known about how fat contributes to cancer.    But the mystery hasn't held back health experts from strong recommendations  that Americans reduce dietary fat -- perhaps even below current recommendation  of 30% of total daily calories.    ""The fat story is real,"" says Clifford Welsch, a pharmacology and toxicology  professor at Michigan State University. ""There is overwhelming evidence in  experimental animals that the amount and type of dietary fat markedly affects  this (cancer) process.""    But strong evidence also exists outside the laboratory, health experts note.  And it's the comparison of diets in other countries that convinces many health  experts that Americans eat far too much fat.    * A new study cites high-fat diets and lack of exercise for higher rates of  colorectal cancer in Chinese-Americans compared with Chinese living in China.    * A study in Italy shows two-fold increases in breast cancer rates in Northern  Italy, where diets are much higher in fat, compared with Southern Italy.    * Studies show that Japanese women, who consume less fat, have lower breast  cancer rates and better breast-cancer survival rates.    ""Maybe it comes back to what we ate a million years ago when, probably, we only  ate 10% of our calories in fat and ate 50 to 80 grams of fiber a day and when  we exercised a lot,"" says Dr. Ernst L. Wynder, president of the American Health  Foundation, a private research group.    The foundation estimates that half of all cancers in women and a third of all  cancers in men are related to dietary fat.    ""I believe the major cause of disease is excessive exposure"" to fat, Wynder  says. ""When it comes to fat, I believe our system was not developed to handle  100 grams of fat a day.""    Most Americans consume about 40% of their daily calories from fat. Health  experts generally agree that fat should be limited to 30% of total daily  calories. The health foundation, however, has taken a more extreme view,  suggesting that fat should make up 25% or less of the daily diet.    The emerging studies are important in part because the cancers that appear to  be influenced by dietary fat are major problems in the United States.    Other than common skin cancers, the incidence of colorectal cancer ranks second  only to lung cancer in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates  that 155,000 new cases will be reported this year. Breast cancer affects about  one in every 10 women.    ""I think people are well aware of the role of dietary fat and heart disease,  but the data haven't been as strong with dietary fat and cancer,"" says Stanford  epidemiologist Alice Whittemore, co-author of a five-year study of Chinese  populations. ""I think that's changing, though. The data are beginning to come  in quite conclusively, on large bowel cancers, that fat is an important factor.  I think this is an important public-health message.""    A rate of colorectal cancer four to five times higher among Chinese-Americans  than among Chinese living in China can be strongly linked to a diet high in  saturated fats and a sedentary lifestyle, Whittemore's group at Stanford and  researchers at the University of Southern California reported in a study  published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.    Exercise is thought to help reduce incidence of cancer by speeding by the  movement of food through the intestinal tract.    ""The two factors -- high saturated-fat diet and lack of exercise -- are working  together to be harmful,"" Whittemore says. ""I believe that this is a message  everyone needs to hear, not just the Chinese.""    Studies comparing the rate of breast cancer in other countries are equally  compelling, Wynder says.    Besides the comparison of breast cancer rates in Italy, other studies show that  Japanese women, who consume less fat, have lower rates of breast cancer.    The link between dietary fat and breast cancer is strong enough that  researchers now are studying whether breast cancer patients might have better  survival rates if they adopt lower-fat diets.    Wynder says studies have shown that Japanese women who do develop breast cancer  have much better survival rates.    A leading theory about breast-cancer development holds that increases in the  hormone estrogen contributes to cancer. Dietary fat raises estrogen levels.  Hormones are thought to play a role in other cancers as well.    ""A new approach to cancer treatment is 'Can you treat cancer with a low-fat  diet?' "" Wynder says. ""In my opinion, dietary fat not only plays a role in the  promotion of breast cancer but also in terms of metastasis.""    A study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is under way at seven  institutions to explore whether post-menopausal women who have been treated for  breast cancer have better survival rates when they consume a diet of less than  20% fat.    ""This is certainly a worthwhile trial,"" Wynder says. ""And one thing you can say  about nutrition: It's not toxic. It's not costly at all. And almost anyone can  do it. The women who are on the trial are complying with the diet very well. My  own hunch is it will not only work for cancer in the breast but also work for  other hormone-related cancers, particularly cancer of the prostrate and  possibly ovary and endometrian. It certainly doesn't relate to all cancers.""    Preliminary results from 20 patients in the study show a 60% drop in a  particular type of estrogen.    Wynder, one of the strongest advocates for nutritional changes to reduce cancer  rates, says it was tough convincing his peers that such a study was of value:  ""When it comes to nutrition to treat breast cancer, people says it's hokey.  I've had a difficult time convincing my colleagues that nutrition could be part  of treatment.""    But others caution that it's too soon to implicate diet as a major factor in  the development of some cancers. One of the most comprehensive recent studies  on diet and breast cancer in nurses, for example, showed no relationship. The  study has been criticized, however, because the nurses were consuming diets of  32% to 44% fat, thought by some experts to be too high to make a difference in  breast cancer rates.    Others suggest that while diets may help prevent cancer, many factors  contribute to cancer development and survival rates.    ""I think there is a difference in the way an individual responds,"" says Paul  Newberne of the Mallory Institute of Pathology in Boston. ""Overall, I think  nutrition is going to help us prevent cancer . . . rather than cure it. And I  don't think we should try to oversell something to the public that we can't  really deliver.""    Experts agree they must learn more about what is in fat that could contribute  to cancer. Some researchers suggest saturated fat is the culprit; others say  calories in fat are responsible.    ""There is a whole array of ideas as to how fat might enhance (cancer)  processes, but we don't know definitively which of these are the most  important,"" says Michigan State's Welsch. ""I feel that the major impact from  dietary fat happens to be the calories derived from fat.""    Studies have shown that those with colorectal cancer generally consume more  calories than healthy people.    But the Stanford-USC study was among the first to strongly implicate saturated  fat as a contributor to colorectal cancer. Because of variations in Chinese  diets, researchers were able to link saturated fat to higher rates of  colorectal cancer.    ""This is the strongest association we've seen that unequivocally pulled out  saturated fat as the culprit,"" Whittemore says. Other studies soon to be  released will support the relationship, she said.    Whittemore also suggests that the new evidence might lead health officials to  recommend further reductions in dietary fat, under 30% of total calories.    ""We found that those with the lowest risk among the Chinese had only consumed  about 10 grams of saturated fat per day, about 100 calories,"" Whittemore says.  ""It could well be that we should cut down even more.""      REDUCING DIETARY FAT    * Choose lean meat, fish, poultry and dry beans and peas as protein sources.    * Use skim or low-fat milk and milk products.    * Moderate use of egg yolks and organ meats.    * Limit intake of fats and oils, especially those high in saturated fat, such  as butter, cream, lard, heavily hydrogenated fats (some margarines),  shortenings and foods containing palm and coconut oils.    * Trim fat off meats.    * Broil, bake or boil rather than fry.    * Moderate use of foods that contain fat, such as breaded and deep-fried foods.    * Read labels carefully to determine both amount and type of fat present in  foods.

Dietary fat, fondly found in such goodies as ice cream and avocados, is a  well-known contributor to heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Now  evidence is accumulating that it contributes mightily to some cancers,  particularly breast and colorectal cancer, and, possibly, prostate, pancreatic  and ovarian cancer.    While physicians know dietary fat increases deposits in blood vessels that  cause heart disease, much less is known about how fat contributes to cancer.    But the mystery hasn't held back health experts from strong recommendations  that Americans reduce dietary fat -- perhaps even below current recommendation  of 30% of total daily calories.    ""The fat story is real,"" says Clifford Welsch, a pharmacology and toxicology  professor at Michigan State University. ""There is overwhelming evidence in  experimental animals that the amount and type of dietary fat markedly affects  this (cancer) process.""    But strong evidence also exists outside the laboratory, health experts note.  And it's the comparison of diets in other countries that convinces many health  experts that Americans eat far too much fat.    * A new study cites high-fat diets and lack of exercise for higher rates of  colorectal cancer in Chinese-Americans compared with Chinese living in China.    * A study in Italy shows two-fold increases in breast cancer rates in Northern  Italy, where diets are much higher in fat, compared with Southern Italy.    * Studies show that Japanese women, who consume less fat, have lower breast  cancer rates and better breast-cancer survival rates.    ""Maybe it comes back to what we ate a million years ago when, probably, we only  ate 10% of our calories in fat and ate 50 to 80 grams of fiber a day and when  we exercised a lot,"" says Dr. Ernst L. Wynder, president of the American Health  Foundation, a private research group.    The foundation estimates that half of all cancers in women and a third of all  cancers in men are related to dietary fat.    ""I believe the major cause of disease is excessive exposure"" to fat, Wynder  says. ""When it comes to fat, I believe our system was not developed to handle  100 grams of fat a day.""    Most Americans consume about 40% of their daily calories from fat. Health  experts generally agree that fat should be limited to 30% of total daily  calories. The health foundation, however, has taken a more extreme view,  suggesting that fat should make up 25% or less of the daily diet.    The emerging studies are important in part because the cancers that appear to  be influenced by dietary fat are major problems in the United States.    Other than common skin cancers, the incidence of colorectal cancer ranks second  only to lung cancer in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates  that 155,000 new cases will be reported this year. Breast cancer affects about  one in every 10 women.    ""I think people are well aware of the role of dietary fat and heart disease,  but the data haven't been as strong with dietary fat and cancer,"" says Stanford  epidemiologist Alice Whittemore, co-author of a five-year study of Chinese  populations. ""I think that's changing, though. The data are beginning to come  in quite conclusively, on large bowel cancers, that fat is an important factor.  I think this is an important public-health message.""    A rate of colorectal cancer four to five times higher among Chinese-Americans  than among Chinese living in China can be strongly linked to a diet high in  saturated fats and a sedentary lifestyle, Whittemore's group at Stanford and  researchers at the University of Southern California reported in a study  published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.    Exercise is thought to help reduce incidence of cancer by speeding by the  movement of food through the intestinal tract.    ""The two factors -- high saturated-fat diet and lack of exercise -- are working  together to be harmful,"" Whittemore says. ""I believe that this is a message  everyone needs to hear, not just the Chinese.""    Studies comparing the rate of breast cancer in other countries are equally  compelling, Wynder says.    Besides the comparison of breast cancer rates in Italy, other studies show that  Japanese women, who consume less fat, have lower rates of breast cancer.    The link between dietary fat and breast cancer is strong enough that  researchers now are studying whether breast cancer patients might have better  survival rates if they adopt lower-fat diets.    Wynder says studies have shown that Japanese women who do develop breast cancer  have much better survival rates.    A leading theory about breast-cancer development holds that increases in the  hormone estrogen contributes to cancer. Dietary fat raises estrogen levels.  Hormones are thought to play a role in other cancers as well.    ""A new approach to cancer treatment is 'Can you treat cancer with a low-fat  diet?' "" Wynder says. ""In my opinion, dietary fat not only plays a role in the  promotion of breast cancer but also in terms of metastasis.""    A study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is under way at seven  institutions to explore whether post-menopausal women who have been treated for  breast cancer have better survival rates when they consume a diet of less than  20% fat.

THE PROJECT WOULD INVOLVE 20,000  WOMEN.      By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MOSCOW      American and Soviet cancer specialists signed an agreement here Thursday for a  10-year, $100-million study of 20,000 women in the two countries to determine  whether a hormonal treatment can prevent breast cancer.    Dr. Phillip D. Bretz, director of the Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage,  Calif., said that women thought to be most likely to develop breast cancer  would be given tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug, and then be closely monitored  by breast cancer specialists to see whether the drug could be used in  preventive treatment.    ""Tamoxifen appears to be both the most promising and safest of all the drugs we  know about for the prevention of breast cancer,"" Bretz said. ""In the United  States, the Soviet Union and in many industrialized countries, breast cancer is  the most prevalent cancer among women.""    Tamoxifen, which is manufactured by the British firm Imperial Chemical  Industries and sold under the brand name Nolvadex, has been used with  considerable success for 11 years in the post-surgical treatment of breast  cancer patients to prevent a recurrence, Bretz said.    The proposed study is the first undertaken on such a scale jointly in the  United States and the Soviet Union. The patients, about 10,000 each from the  Soviet Union and the United States, will primarily be the daughters, sisters or  mothers of women who have had breast cancer and thus are regarded as the most  likely to develop cancer themselves.    The treatment involves taking two tablets a day. The researchers said that  tamoxifen has minimal negative side effects and often reduces cholesterol and  eases cardiovascular problems.    Tamoxifen works by blocking so-called estrogen receptors -- areas on the  surface of cells to which the hormone binds to exert its effects. In that way,  it blocks the effects of estrogen, which plays a role in the development and  progression of breast cancer.    Soviet women who were exposed to large amounts of radiation after the nuclear  accident at Chernobyl in April, 1986, will also be included in the study, with  the hope of preventing the development of breast cancer among them, according  to Dr. David Zaridze, deputy director of the All-Union Cancer Research  Institute in Moscow.    A new blood test, developed by Dr. Adeline Hackett of the Aeron Corp. of  Oakland, Calif., and researchers at UC Berkeley is being used in the Ukrainian  capital of Kiev, where many of the Chernobyl victims are treated, to measure  the amount of radiation absorbed by each woman.    ""We know that radiation is carcinogenic for humans, but we do not know how  carcinogenic -- that is, how much radiation is likely to increase the risk of  various cancers and leukemias,"" Zaridze said. ""In Hiroshima and Nagasaki (on  which atomic bombs were dropped in World War II), there was an increase in all  cancers and leukemias, but only about 300 cases of solid tumors and the same  number of leukemias were directly attributed to radiation. We need to know more  about how radiation causes tumors, and with this blood test we believe we can.""    Another blood test, also developed by Hackett, will be used to assess the level  of tamoxifen in each woman's body and her response to the drug.    The tamoxifen study must still be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration, which will hold an open hearing in Washington next month on the  proposed scope and method of the research, but the U.S. researchers expressed  confidence that the project would be approved and fully under way by the end of  the year.    Bretz said he expects the study's $100-million cost to be financed primarily  with grants from the U.S. and Soviet governments and by pharmaceutical  companies.    The project will be coordinated in the United States by Bretz and Dr. Philip B.  Dreisbach of the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage and in the Soviet  Union by Zaridze at the national Cancer Research Center and carried out in  various cities in each country.    ""This drug has already proven to work in sustaining the post-operative  remission in women who have had breast cancer and in preventing the spread of  cancer to the other breast,"" Dreisbach said. ""The time has come to determine  whether it can prevent breast cancer.""    In cases where breast cancer does develop among Soviet women, the project will  also include the use of early laser surgery rather than radical surgery,  radiation or chemotherapy, Bretz said.

By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MOSCOW      American and Soviet cancer specialists signed an agreement here Thursday for a  10-year, $100-million study of 20,000 women in the two countries to determine  whether a hormonal treatment can prevent breast cancer.    Dr. Phillip D.

Our correspondent  reports:    [Begin recording] [Akif Mecitoglu] Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev left for an official visit to Great Britain today  at the invitation of the British Prime Minister John Major.  Agreements on political, economic, and cultural cooperation  will be signed between the two countries.    [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed President, the signing  of a number of economic cooperation agreements between  Azerbaijan and Great Britain is envisaged. You will also be  meeting with British businessmen and state officials. What  effect will such ties have on the development of Azerbaijan's  economy?    [Aliyev] The Azerbaijani president's visit to Great Britain  is aimed at establishing and developing ties between Azerbaijan  and Great Britain. This is because, since the attainment of  independence, Azerbaijan has not yet been able to forge  interstate ties with a great world power such as Great Britain  to the degree needed. The British ambassador arrived here only  a few months ago, and Azerbaijan's ambassador left for Great  Britain only in recent days. Thus, diplomatic ties are just  being established. As a young independent state, Azerbaijan is  in dire need of broad interstate ties, first and foremost  political and economic ties. The economic ties in themselves  cover a broad spectrum, ranging from trade to close ties between  the various British and Azerbaijani business circles to  scientific and cultural ties.    As you know, Britain is one of the major world powers, is  one  of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and is  one of the seven most developed countries. Both in the past and  at present Britain has been strongly influencing international  politics and economics. Therefore, the creation of close ties  between Azerbaijan and Great Britain is first of all exceedingly  important for the national interest of the Azerbaijani Republic.  We are also aware that Britain itself is highly interested in  Azerbaijan. It wants to establish economic ties with  Azerbaijan. Historically, Britain's interest in the Caucasus  and Azerbaijan is obvious. In this present stage at the end of  the 20th century, Britain wants to establish economic ties with  Azerbaijan on a new foundation. We have already accomplished  some work in this direction. That is, we have done preparatory  work. We have to resolve all these matters there.    As you know, my visit to Britain is of an official nature.  This is an official state visit that is taking place at the  invitation of British Prime Minister John Major. Some days ago  I received a letter from Mr. John Major in which he says that he  is looking forward for our meeting and is hopeful that this  meeting will produce fruitful results for Britain and Azerbaijan.    Therefore, I attribute great importance to this visit and  hope that the British leaders are also giving it great  importance. Our program there is now clear: There will be  talks with Prime Minister John Major and we will sign a number  of agreements with both the prime minister and other officials.  We will have meetings at the British Parliament and at other  state departments. Undoubtedly, all these are important matters  aimed at strengthening our young and independent Azerbaijan's  foreign policy and its international position. And I am going  to Britain to resolve these problems.    [Unidentified correspondent] We wish you success.    [Aliyev] Thank you.

By the end of World War II, the struggle of Asian  and African peoples for national independence was spreading like  a storm, and Britain was compelled to withdraw from its former  colonies. However, in the course of its withdrawal, Britain  took great care to use various inglorious means and tricks; it  sowed discord between different races, religious sects, tribes,  and other political forces to spark contradictions and  conflicts, thus implementing ""divide and rule""; or forced the  implementation of mergers in the form of a ""federal state,""  namely, ""merge and rule""; or went all out to prop up a  pro-British government. In a nutshell, it attempted to continue  to maintain British vested interests and maximise political  influence.    ""Divide and rule"" was one of Britain's usual notorious  methods, and India served as the most typical example. In 1943,  Britain set forth a policy of ""divide and rule,"" and advocated  the division of India into three governing regions, namely,  separating India into a Hindu region, a Muslim region, and a  region of various princely states and feudatories. Lord Louis  Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India, dished up his  ""divide and rule"" plan in June 1946, which partitioned India  into three--two dominions, India and Pakistan, and various  princely states and feudatories. At the same time, it was  stipulated that the princely states and feudatories had the  right to decide on their own to join any of the two dominions,  with the aim of using the princes of the Indian princely states  and feudatories as a force to counter the Indian nationalist  movement; and second, it sowed discord in relations between  Muslims and the Hindus, and this eventually led to the partition  of India and Pakistan. Indian and Pakistani historians  indicated this by hitting the nail on the head, saying that the  aim of the partition of India and Pakistan plotted meticulously  by Britain was to make these two countries weak and make things  difficult for them to stand on their own feet. Of course,  history did not develop in the way the British colonialists  hoped for. On the Palestine issue, Britain first encouraged the  Arabs of the Ottoman Empire to resist Turkish rule; later, they  hoisted the banner of supporting the Zionist movement, roping in  the Jews to elbow out the Arabs at one point, then taking  advantage of the Arabs to oppose the Jews at another. In  Cyprus, to split the anti-British struggle of the local people,  Britain encouraged Turkish Cypriots to confront the EOKA, the  anti-British Greek Cypriot organization. Later, Britain led  Greece and Turkey into Cyprus' internal conflict; consequently,  the sovereignty of this island state fell apart. Furthermore,  this resulted in complicated contradictions and conflicts  between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus, and between Turkish Cypriots  and Greek Cypriots, while turning the Cyprus issue into an  international hot spot.    Sometimes, Britain pushed the strategy of ""merge and rule""  in  some regions through forcing together ""federations"" by force. A  typical example was the ""Central African Federation,"" which  Britain patched up. In 1953, the British Government merged  British Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and formed  a so-called ""Federation of Central Africa."" This was out of  British political and economic considerations. Economically,  Northern Rhodesia abounded in copper, Southern Rhodesia had  skilled Caucasian technicians, and Nyasaland possessed a huge  cheap labor force. Welding those three factors into an economic  federation was conducive to Britain's maintenance of its  economic interests in this region. Politically, the Caucasian  immigrants in Southern Rhodesia were powerful and controlled the  local government; with the organization of the ""federation,"" the  influence of the Caucasians of Southern Rhodesia would extend to  all of British Central Africa, thus suppressing newly rising  black nationalism in Africa. Nevertheless, the ""Central African  Federation"" went bankrupt in 1963 because of the strong  opposition of its black African inhabitants.    In addition, another important policy target of Britain in  the course of its withdrawal from its colonies was to prop up  pro-British forces, and it transferred power to pro-British  governments. National independence and liberation movements with  a strong momentum broke out in British colonies in south, and  Southeast Asia in the early post-war years. India at that time  was like ""a loaded ship on fire in the ocean."" Britain was  compelled to make the decision to withdraw quickly from India,  while transferring political power into the so-called ""hands of  Indian who have a sense of responsibility"" to prevent  catastrophe for Britain. It was precisely in this way that  Britain realized a ""peaceful transfer of political power"" in  India, while a whole range of organizations of old colonial rule  were retained, while India and Pakistan remained members of the  British Commonwealth of Nations, and British private capital in  India was left intact. In the early post-war years, the Burmese  People's Movement vigorously developed. To avoid being  thoroughly driven out from Burma, Britain rapidly transferred  political power to ""moderates,"" who were acceptable to Britain.  British economic interests and military bases in Burma basically  remained intact. Britain's method in Malaysia was almost  undisguised. The Malaysian people had already emancipated the  country during the war of resistance against Japan. When the  British Army returned to Malaysia, it started to restore the  colonial order in Malaysia. Later, Britain announced a state of  emergency in Malaysia, and Britain eventually transferred  political power in the mid-1950's, when the situation had  basically stabilized.    The various tricks Britain resorted to in the course of its  withdrawal from its colonies left the former colonial countries  endless hidden dangers after independence. This found  conspicuous expression in long-term turbulence in the political  situations of these countries in the wake of their independence,  and endless conflicts between neighboring countries or within  countries, whereas socioeconomic development was impeded and  restricted. In ""divide and rule,"" Britain implemented  artificial partitions or mergers of territory in former  colonies, thus creating numerous complicated nationality and  border issues for the independent countries later on. In August  1947, Britain hastily withdrew from India two months after the  Mountbatten plan was presented, which resulted in slaughter  between the religious sects and an escalation of turmoil.  Statistics show that 500,000 people died directly or indirectly  in the turmoil, and 5 million people fled from their homes.  Based on the Mountbatten plan, Pakistan was founded in two  separate areas in the east and the west, some 1,600 km away from  each other; the inconvenience in transportation resulted in  extremely great difficulties in economic development. The  rivalry between India and Pakistan over Kashmir resulted in  several armed conflicts, and the issue remains unresolved as of  today. Britain's implementation of ""divide and rule"" in  Palestine left a large number of Palestinian refugees homeless.  The long-running confrontation between the Arabs and Israel and  the four Middle East wars that broke out one after the other all  find their roots in British ""divide and rule."" Likewise, the  civil war and divisions between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek  Cypriots after Cyprus' independence, and the conflict between  Greece and Turkey are all inseparable from the evil consequences  of what Britain did during its rule in Cyprus.    The British colonialists created divisions in Nigeria by  utilizing contradictions between various tribes to instigate  regional separatism and jeopardize Nigeria's national solidarity  and unification, while sowing the seeds for long-term internal  disturbances after Nigeria's independence. In the late 1960's,  the Nigerian Civil War that centered around the independence of  Biafra cost 1 million lives, and economic and social development  was seriously damaged. Britain bears unshirkable responsibility  for all of this.     "

In particular, the two countries  forged special ties during and after World War II, thus making  Britain an ""exception"" to its European partners, which simply  called it the Atlantic faction (as opposed to the European  faction). Since the end of the Cold War, Anglo-American  relations have undergone profound changes along with the changes  in the macroscopic climate. Some people hold that the special  ties between Britain and the United States will ""inevitably  disappear,"" and others even say that the so-called special ties  between the two countries do not exist any longer. Some Western  media said: Ever since Clinton assumed power, the special ties  between Britain and the United States have deteriorated to a  ""worrying extent."" This is because the Conservatives did not  support Clinton in the U.S. election. Therefore, how should the  changes in Anglo-American relations in the post-Cold War period  be assessed, and what are the reasons for these changes?    State Interests At the Roots    Generally speaking, personal friendships between leaders of  different countries certainly have importance in relations  between the countries concerned. People always equated the  special ties between Britain and the United States with close  wartime cooperation between Churchill and Roosevelt, the  partnership between Macmillan and Eisenhower and Kennedy, and  the close personal relationship between Mrs. Thatcher and  Reagan. Hence, when Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher stepped down and a  generation of people influenced by World War II left the  political arena with Bush, people were very naturally inclined  to think that the special ties between Britain and the United  States ""were scaling down."" They also predicted that the  special ties ""would inevitably disappear."" Some British  newspapers played up the event in late 1992 when Major failed to  meet Clinton, then president-elect, during his visit to  Washington, saying that Clinton had deliberately given the cold  shoulder to Major. Similarly, Downing Street officials wanted  Major to receive an invitation to visit the White House on the  eve of the NATO summit, which was held in Brussels earlier this  year. During the Reagan and Bush presidencies, such a visit was  merely routine for the leaders of the two countries to consult  with each other before making decisions on major issues.  However, the United States did not show due respect, and the  White House did not send any invitation to Major. It was  alleged that Major had professed that he could never build close  ties with Clinton.    However, state and national interests are, in the final  analysis, the basis for deciding state relations. Personal  relationships between leaders ultimately hinge on state and  national interests. It is true that a series of conflicts and  frictions have arisen between Britain and the United States  since the advent of the Clinton presidency. In his election  campaign, Clinton proposed dispatching a peace envoy to Northern  Ireland and reconsidering the membership composition of the  Security Council. Britain was very unhappy and doubtful about  this, holding that the former amounted to interference in  Britain's internal affairs and the latter was intended to expand  the permanent membership of the Security Council (with the  accession of Germany and Japan to the council), which would  weaken and undermine its power status (permanent membership of  the Security Council being one of the important symbols which  props up the status of Great Britain). On intervening in the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the two countries also  disagreed and argued with each other. Britain was against a  U.S. proposal for NATO's direct intervention in an ethnic  conflict, worrying that this move would endanger the lives of  British soldiers performing humanitarian duties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the United States did not possess  such misgivings as there were no U.S. troops there.    During the Cold War years, it was common for Britain and the  United States to have conflicts and policy differences on some  concrete issues. However, under the then prerequisite of  jointly dealing with the Soviet ""threat,"" the two countries  usually consulted with each other and made appropriate  concessions and compromises to settle conflicts. In general,  Britain avoided openly criticizing U.S. policy, whereas the  United States paid heed to Britain's views and took Britain's  demands and interests into consideration. However, with the end  of the Cold War, the two countries lost their common enemy and  the historical conditions and foundation on which their special  relationship relied. Hence, their conflicts have become  outstanding and the system of consultation has weakened. The  role of Anglo-American relations in the diplomacy of the two  countries is faced with a problem of reorientation. The U.S.  ambassador to Britain frankly admitted that ""because of the  changes in Europe and in the world, U.S.-British relations must  obviously change,"" but the question lies in ""whether or not the  United States and Britain still have similar interests. In this  regard, I am not sure.""    Have No Alternative But To Face Reality    In recent years, Anglo-American relations have become cooler  and cooler, which is inseparable from the fact that Britain's  international status and influence has declined since the end of  the Cold War. In a certain sense, Britain was a beneficiary of  the Cold War. As one of the major victor countries in World War  II and the second power of the capitalist world during the  initial post-war stage, Britain played an important role, along  with the United States, in the process of forming and developing  the post-war political and economic order. Later, Britain  gradually declined and became a second-class, moderately  developed country. However, it enjoyed certain prerogatives and  superiority in defense in the West and in high-level global  diplomacy under the Cold War situation, particularly due to its  long-standing status as the closest ally of the United States.  Therefore, it could play a larger role and exert greater  influence than its strength allowed and played a certain  mediating role in U.S.-Soviet dialogue, in East-West relations,  and in relations between Europe and the United States. With the  end of the Cold War, Britain's position has been weakened.  Today, a country's international status is directly affected by  its economic strength, and thus, Britain is weak. At present,  Britain's population accounts for 1 percent of the world  population, its GDP accounts for 4 percent, and its volume of  trade accounts for 5 percent. Britain's economic strength ranks  fourth in Europe (after Germany, France, and Italy). In  addition, as NATO becomes less important as a military  organization, Britain's military strength and political  superiority due to its contribution to NATO's defense is  gradually becoming less valuable. In short, at present, the  importance of Britain to U.S. diplomatic and global strategy is  obviously weakening.    A sharp contrast with Britain is Germany. After shaking off  various restrictions and fetters imposed on it under the Cold  War system, Germany has appeared in the international arena as a  leading or dominant power and has superseded Britain as the  United States' key partner for cooperation. In particular, the  drastic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's  disintegration have given Germany much room for maneuver. Now,  the United States treats Britain coldly and sets the focus of  its Europe policy in striving for Germany's support and  cooperation, saying that its relations with Germany is a kind of  leading partnership.    The fact that Anglo-American relations have weakened is also  closely related to the eastward shift of the U.S. diplomatic  focus. As pointed out by certain western scholars, the United  States, in a certain sense, was also a loser in the Cold War.  The Cold War caused a heavy burden to the United States and led  to a relative decline in its power. At present, the United  States is perplexed by domestic economic problems, and it is  gradually shifting its attention and international interests  from Europe to America as well as to the East Asia and Pacific  regions, where rapid economic development is in sight. The  United States has drastically reduced and will continue to cut  its forces stationed in Europe, and its influence in Europe has  already shrunk and will continue to shrink. Meanwhile, the fact  that Britain and the United States are becoming estranged from  each other also reflects the Clinton administration's declining  interest in and attention to Western Europe.    Mutual Support Still Counts    As a European country with a moderate level of strength,  Britain is focussing its key national interests and policies on  Europe. It is irreversibly involved in the process of European  integration. However, the former Great Britain is not willing to  confine its role and influence to Europe. The ruling clique in  Britain will not easily give up its special relationship with  the United States and still wants to rely on residual close ties  with the latter to continue to ""punch above its weight"" in the  world (a remark made by Douglas Hurd). In fact, special  Anglo-American ties and British's membership of the EC may not  necessarily be incompatible with each other. Close  Anglo-American historical and cultural ties enable it to better  understand the U.S. way of thinking and exert influence on the  United States more easily. On the other hand, Britain is also a  member of the EC and its pragmatic tradition, balanced thinking,  and broad field of vision from a global viewpoint can contribute  to the formation of a united and sound ""European choice,"" thus  playing a certain unique role in coordinating European-American  relations.    It seems that even after the Cold War, the United States  still needs Britain, its faithful ally. Although the United  States won the Cold War, its relative strength has been much  weakened. In order to ensure its leading position in the new  post-Cold War global order, Washington needs the support and  help of its allies. With the disappearance of the Soviet  threat, internal conflicts between Western countries are  becoming outstanding. Some original U.S. allies have, to a  different extent and in different respects, become open or  potential enemies. Under these circumstances, Britain's support  and help seems to be more valuable and important. In the post  Cold War process of readjusting its European policy and its  relations with Europe, the United States obviously needs  Britain's support. Whether the question is about  European-American economic and trade relations or about NATO's  reorganization and restructuring, Britain's position and  attitude is close to that of the United States. When the United  States utilizes the United Nations and other multilateral  organizations to forcibly implement its own concepts of human  rights and values in the name of keeping international peace and  maintaining the new world order, Britain often plays the role of  the most faithful U.S. ally.    However, this writer should point out that as far as the  readjustment of British foreign policy is concerned, close  Anglo- American ties do not only have positive significance and  effects. If such ties are handled well, Britain can definitely  have greater weight and influence in the international arena,  but if they are not handled properly, other European countries  may treat such ties as a ""Trojan horse"" of the United States,  which will become a constraint on Britain's further integration  into Europe.

He  said that the Chinese Government had long prepared against the  possible disruptive and undermining actions by the British Hong  Kong authorities and had adopted corresponding countermeasures.    The official said: Britain unilaterally violated the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and flagrantly denied the  existence of agreements between the two governments. This fully  showed that Britain was not willing to return Hong Kong to China  and was still attempting to continue its colonial rule by  playing the political card, the economic card, and the  international card during the remaining three years. The  British Hong Kong authorities are fostering a batch of  pro-British people who oppose everything China advocates and  does, trying to make them Britain's future proxies in Hong Kong,  through whom Britain may continue to influence the future  special administrative region [SAR] government to resist  implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy and to  create political disputes. This is the crucial point of the  issue.    He added: When doing this, the British Hong Kong Government  made a totally wrong assessment of the situation. China's  determination to recover Hong Kong is firm. China will never  barter away its principles. We will rely on the vast number of  Hong Kong compatriots who love the motherland and love Hong Kong  and unite all forces that can be united, including foreigners  who want to seek development in Hong Kong, to jointly maintain  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The Chinese Government  will continue to adopt policies to maintain Hong Kong's  stability.    The sources also said that an authoritative person in  Beijing  law circles recently said that China may consider changing the  time and method of recovering Hong Kong if the following  situations occur:    First, Britain plans to change Hong Kong into an  international political city and a center of international  political disputes.    Second, Britain introduces other foreign forces to meddle in  Hong Kong's affairs, thus turning Hong Kong's affairs into  international affairs.    Third, Britain fosters a pro-Britain and anti-China  political  force to create trouble in Hong Kong and helps it enter the  local power structure.    Fourth, Britain encourages the pro-Britain and anti-China  political forces to disrupt order and create political incidents  in Hong Kong.    Fifth, Britain supports collaboration between the  pro-Britain  and anti-China force in Hong Kong and the international  anticommunist forces in creating political incidents in Hong  Kong.    Sixth, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities stir up  political turmoil in the late transitional period to oppose the  Chinese Government, oppose the Basic Law, and oppose the end of  colonial rule.    Seventh, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities  deliberately create financial and monetary disorder in Hong Kong    Eighth, in the late transitional period, if the Hong Kong  Government is paralyzed, while riots occur and the situation  goes out of control.    Ninth, if Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities  collude with Taiwan in turning Hong Kong into a self-governing  political entity or a semi-independent entity.     "

He expressed regret over the statement  and was not bullish about the development of current  Sino-British relations.    In an interview with this reporter, Ma Yuzhen made a  thorough  analysis of the development of Sino-British relations and the  disputes caused by the Hong Kong issue in recent years.    First, he refuted four points in the statement Patten made  when he returned to Britain last week to attend a hearing of the  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee.    1. Patten accused China of just making a concession in the  Hong Kong political structure talks over lowering the voting  age. This was at variance with the facts. In fact, China made  major concessions in two other matters: Agreeing to let  district boards and the Urban Council practice the single seat,  single vote system and agreeing to abolish the appointed seats  in the Urban Council and district boards before 1997 so as to  reach an agreement.    ""When he spoke at the hearing, Patten distorted China's  position in the 17 rounds of talks and ignored the facts. It is  unfair to try to overwhelm the other side by distorting its  position and viewpoint. If even the most rudimentary rules of  political negotiations are not followed, is there any  credibility to speak of?""    Patten Misleads Britain and the Hong Kong People    2. Patten stated on many occasions that he did not believe  that China would dare overturn the three-tier council structure  that he was pursuing just out of consideration of the pressure  of world opinion. If he does think that, it means he is  dreaming. Otherwise, fully aware that China will keep its  promises, he still continues to pursue the three-violation  uncooperative policy. This way of doing things is utterly  irresponsible toward the Hong Kong people and Sino-British  relations. In terms of political and legal principles, China  can and must disband the three-tier councils in 1997. Patten's  remark was designed to mislead Britain and the Hong Kong people.    Ma Yuzhen also refuted Patten's analogy of installing panes  of glass for the Hong Kong people. He said: ""The Hong Kong  people have lived in this house without any panes of glass for  more than 100 years. Now, when the British authorities are  about to leave, they say they will install panes of glass, and  in so saying they do not consult the host and residents. This  way of doing things is ridiculous. It is an expression of phony  benevolence. ""    Regarding the pressure of world opinion which Patten  stressed, analyzing it, Ambassador Ma Yuzhen said: Of the 180  or so countries in the world, most are China's friends and Third  World countries. They have experienced suppression by the  imperialists. Will they now sympathize with Britain on the Hong  Kong issue? China is improving its relations with 20 or so  developed countries one after another. Moreover, since they  have their own agendas, they will not change their policies  toward China in accordance with London's wishes.    Patten Tries in Vain To Continue Colonialist Rule    3. Patten criticized China's attitude as being  ""unreasonable."" Refuting the criticism, Ma Yuzhen said:  ""China's response to Patten is based on an analysis of past  events concerning China and Britain in the last 100 years or so  and thus is very reasonable. It is really unreasonable for the  British side to try in vain to continue its colonialist rule as  the 21st century approaches.""    4. Patten interpreted the spirit of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration as being ""fair and trustworthy elections."" Ma  Yuzhen pointed out: This is a distortion of the spirit of the  Joint Declaration. Deliberately misinterpreting and belittling  a document of great historic significance as a document  concerning elections in a narrow sense is an act far removed  from the spirit of the Joint Declaration.    ""The spirit of the Joint Declaration lies in the Chinese  resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997. Britain  must return Hong Kong to China after 1997. This is a matter of  sovereignty complete with administration. After the turnover of  sovereignty, China will pursue the one-country, two-systems  policy and conduct elections in accordance with the Basic Law.    China does not oppose either elections or democracy.  However, if this is interpreted as the spirit of the Joint  Declaration, even though public opinion is misled, those who are  familiar with the Hong Kong situation cannot be misled.""    When it came to the repeated British appeals for a  resumption of talks, Ma Yuzhen stated: Let him who tied the  bell on the tiger take it off. Unless the British side changes  its uncooperative and antagonistic Hong Kong policy and  withdraws the first-stage political structure draft which it has  submitted to the Legislative Council, the Chinese side must  otherwise accelerate its preparatory work, and, through the work  of the Preliminary Work Committee [for the Preparatory Committee  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and the  concerted efforts of the Hong Kong people, China will ensure the  smooth transition of Hong Kong.    Nevertheless, he stressed: The Preliminary Work Committee is  a working organ. It is neither an organ of political power nor  a shadow government. Hence, there is no question of replacing  the Hong Kong Government. ""In the situation in which the  British side is not cooperative and there are just three and a  half years left until 1997, the only way to guarantee a smooth  transition is for the Hong Kong people and Preliminary Work  Committee to intensify cooperation.""    Patten Plays the Same Old Trick Before Quitting the Colony    Ma Yuzhen accused Britain of playing the popular-will card  with a view to realizing the ""three violations."" This is a  replay of the small trick played by Britain every time in the  past when quitting its colonies. The Chinese Government  attaches importance to the opinions of the Hong Kong people and  this can be seen from the fact that four years and eight months  were spent soliciting the opinions of the Hong Kong people  regarding the Basic Law, but the British Government has never  valued the popular will in its rule over Hong Kong in the last  100 years or so.    Ma Yuzhen took over the job of ambassador to Britain in 1991  and has since then experienced the process of Sino-British  relations turning from good to bad. He discussed his views.    One was that China attached importance to developing  relations with Britain and regarded Britain as an important  country which carried considerable weight [you fen liang 2589  0433 6852] and maintenance of friendly relations with the latter  as being conducive to world peace. ""Although there are  differences between China and Britain, they have common  interests, such as a long-term interest in maintaining Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability. The current situation of  retrogression is something China does not want to see. China has  never done anything harmful to its relations with Britain. The  responsibility for this situation does not rest with the Chinese  side.""    Britain Undermines Sino-British Relations    The other view was that in approaching Sino-British  relations, it was necessary to review past events from a  historical point of view. ""During the 200 years from the visit  to China of a British envoy in 1847 to the coming to Hong Kong  of Patten as governor, Sino-British relations have been full of  twists and turns. Before the Opium War, it can be said that the  two countries treated each other as equals. However, from 1840  to 1949, Britain invaded China using military force five times  and China was thus in an unequal position of being invaded and  bullied.    ""In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan,  Britain recognized the state of Manchuria set up by Japan in  northeast China and closed the Yunnan-Burma Railway when China  was facing the most difficult times. It was after Japan  attacked its colonies that Britain adopted a policy of opposing  Japan. After 1949, Britain recognized China quite early on. It  was not until 1972, when British Prime Minister Edward Heath  adopted a farsighted China policy and normalized Sino-British  relations, that the two countries began to exchange ambassadors.  Relations between the two countries developed smoothly up to  1989, when, together with other Western countries, Britain  imposed comprehensive sanctions against China because of the  Beijing disturbance.""    Ma Yuzhen became ambassador to Britain in 1991, when China  and Britain resumed contacts between high-level officials. His  feelings about his work were that there were quite a few people  of foresight in British political, industrial, and commercial  circles, and they hoped to strengthen cooperation with China.  He has all along worked happily. However, it was a pity that  the formerly very good situation of cooperation between China  and Britain was undermined by the change Britain made in its  China policy in October 1992.    An Impact on Cooperation in Other Fields of Endeavor Is Hard  To Avoid    As far as the current relations between China and Britain  are  concerned, Ma Yuzhen advised the British Government, which had  landed itself in a hole, to stop digging the hole and undo what  it had done so far by quoting the former Labor Party Minister  Dennis Healey as saying: ""When you land yourself in a hole, you  must stop digging the hole.""    However, he added: The termination of Sino-British talks  does not mean that the two countries do not have any normal  diplomatic channels. The British side has violated the  agreements on the issues of political structure and the new  airport, adopted an uncooperative and antagonistic attitude, and  undermined the cooperation between China and Britain step by  step. Consequently, an impact on other aspects of Sino-British  cooperation is hard to avoid.    He anticipated that it would be hard for Sino-British  relations to take a turn for the better in the short term.  However, he was fully confident that Hong Kong had a bright  future. In 1997 Hong Kong would be able to revert to China  smoothly.    After 1997, China also will be able to implement  sovereignty,  the Basic Law, and the one-country, two-systems concept to the  letter.    ""Cast away illusions, have greater confidence, step up  preparatory work, heighten vigilance, guard against sabotage,  and rely on the motherland."" These are words of advice Chinese  Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen gave to the Hong Kong people.     "

BACKERS  PLAN TO REDESIGN IT AND SEEK APPROVAL AGAIN.      By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A federal advisory panel recommended Friday that the Food and Drug  Administration reject a proposal to undertake a ground-breaking U.S.-Soviet  study of 20,000 women to determine whether a hormonal drug can prevent breast  cancer.    The FDA's Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee agreed that a long-term study  should be conducted to determine the effect of the hormonal drug tamoxifen in  preventing breast cancer and other cancers in healthy women.    But the panel said that its members had concluded that the design of the  proposed 10-year, $100-million study of women in the United States and the  Soviet Union was flawed. The committee said that it would recommend ways to  correct the deficiencies.    ""I'm disappointed for the women of the country,"" said Phillip D. Bretz,  director of the Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage and one of the  proposed study leaders. ""I felt it was time to do it. None of these answers are  going to be resolved until this study is done.""    Although the recommendation of an FDA advisory committee is not binding, it  typically wields considerable weight in agency decision-making. The FDA must  approve the U.S. segment of the study before it can begin.    The committee said there was insufficient information on how the study would be  conducted, including recruitment of patients and handling of data. Some members  also expressed concern that the volunteers would not be at high enough risk for  breast cancer.    Bretz, however, said that the study was rejected because he did not have the  academic ties of traditional researchers. He said that he would revise his  study proposal in an effort to satisfy the committee's demands.    The proposed study, endorsed by American and Soviet cancer specialists in  March, would involve administration of tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug already  widely used in post-surgical breast cancer therapy, to women considered at high  risk for breast cancer.    It would be the first large-scale study undertaken jointly in the United States  and Soviet Union, its sponsors said. The pool of participants, about 10,000  from each country, would consist primarily of daughters, sisters or mothers of  women who have had breast cancer and who are considered at high risk of  developing the disease themselves. Half of the women would be given a medically  worthless placebo for comparison purposes.    The researchers had predicted a 25% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer  among the women who were given the drug.    The study would be coordinated by Bretz; Dr. Philip B. Dreisbach, of the  Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, and Dr. David Zaridze, deputy  director of the All-Union Cancer Research Institute in Moscow.    The study was opposed by some women's health advocacy groups, who said it is  dangerous to experiment with drugs on healthy women.    ""This is a drug that is not risk-free,"" said Cindy Pearson, program director of  the National Women's Health Network. ""It's a fine drug for a breast cancer  patient -- a woman facing the possibility of death is more than willing to take  a drug that has some risk. But to jump from a drug that's effective in a group  with a life-threatening disease to a huge trial in healthy women is crazy.""    But Dr. Wendy Schain, a psychologist with Memorial Cancer Institute in Long  Beach and a former breast cancer patient, recommended approval of the study.  ""This is the best we've got,"" she said. ""We need to get these answers. We have  no better way to get them.""    Tamoxifen causes cancer in animals and has been linked to stroke, heart disease  and endometrial cancer in women, according to the FDA. Sponsors of the proposed  study, however, maintain that tamoxifen has minimal negative side effects and  often reduces cholesterol and eases cardiovascular problems.    FDA officials said that a large study of a drug in healthy humans was ""a little  unusual,"" but not unprecedented. ""Any time you do a study on a drug for  prophylaxis (prevention), you're going to use healthy people,"" said Dr. Robert  Temple, the FDA's director of new drug evaluation.    Tamoxifen, manufactured by the British firm Imperial Chemical Industries and  sold under the brand name Nolvadex, has been used for more than a decade to  prevent the recurrence of tumors in women whose cancer had spread to the  underarm lymph nodes.    Recently, the FDA approved its use in the post-surgical treatment of early  breast cancer in women who do not have node involvement. In this country, it is  produced and marketed by ICI Pharmaceuticals of Wilmington, Del.    Tamoxifen works by blocking so-called estrogen receptors -- areas on the  surface of cells to which the hormone binds to exert its effects. In that way,  it blocks the effects of estrogen, which is believed to play a role in the  stimulation of tumor growth in breast cancer.    Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the United States  and the second leading cause of cancer death among women, after lung cancer. An  estimated 150,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year.

The Prime Minister raised the prospect of Britain opting out  of the next stages of political and economic integration just a  day after France called for like-minded member states to forge  ahead, leaving stragglers behind.    His speech at a European election rally in Ellesmere Port,  Cheshire, was a clear attempt to reassure Eurosceptic  Conservatives that Britain would never be forced to accept a  single currency or further centralisation against its will.    He insisted that it was ""old-fashioned commonsense"" that  member states should be free to do some things in their own way  and at their own speed. But he had dearly moved a long way from  his speech in March 1991 when he said: ""We want to arrive at  solutions which will enable us to move forward more united, not  less.""    Last night, amid clear signs that France and Germany are  planning a joint strategy to keep up momentum for a more  integrated union, Mr Major set out his new vision of a Europe  where countries could move between the fast and slow lanes.    He said he had never believed that Europe must invariably  act  as one on every issue and advocated what he called ""a sensible  new approach, varying when it needs to, multi-track,  multi-speed, multi-layered. It is a Conservative idea in line  with the mood of people everywhere. We should be examining how  this can work, not just fighting over the old centralised  prescription.    Mr Major's remarks brought a furious attack from his  opponents, with John Cunningham saying he had abandoned any  pretence that Britain would be a first-rate nation in Europe.  ""The Prime Minister has let the cat out of the bag,"" the shadow  Foreign Secretary said. ""He has admitted that his Government  would let Britain fall behind in Europe. He is apparently  willing to offer voluntary relegation to the second division in  Europe and he isn't even prepared to put up a fight.    ""I believe that in any two-speed Europe, Britain must be up  with those in the fast lane. Clearly, Mr Major does not.""    Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said:  ""This is a negative, defeatist message of a nasty, divided  party. This is not about a multi-track, multi-speed,  multi-layered Europe, but a second-class Britain in a two-tier  Europe. Britain will be condemned to a seat below the salt at  the top table of Europe.""    Senior Conservatives said last night that Mr Major was  making  plain his view that beyond the matters that had already been  agreed by the EU [European Union], it did not make sense for  every member state to march in the same direction at the same  speed. On some issues, Britain would clearly be in the fast  lane; on others, such as the single currency, it would reserve  its position.    Mr Major had told his invited audience: ""I do not happen to  think that it threatens Europe if member states are free to do  some things in their own way and at their own speed. It is  simply good old-fashioned commonsense.    ""If other countries want to slap more costs on their  businesses, then they are welcome to -- if they want the Social  Chapter, they can have it. But we are not having it here.""    The experience of the past two years proved that Europe  could  not be taken too far, too fast. Britain was right not to be  pushed into agreeing a single currency in place of the pound.  ""It may happen in the future -- or it may not. But in any  event, we cannot make a sensible judgment on it now, and a  future Parliament must be free to say yes or no when it has all  the facts before it.""     "

He even said that ""it is contradictory  to say that the Joint Declaration indicates that Britain will  have no moral responsibility and interest toward Hong Kong  beyond 1997."" This was the ""grounds"" Patten created when he  played the ""international card"" in Australia. Patten's remark  was in open disregard of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and  also thoroughly exposed the British colonial rulers' intention  to prolong their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong.    The Joint Declaration explicitly specifies that Britain will  return Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997. Before that, Britain  will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong. It is  self-evident that after the transfer of government in 1997, the  Hong Kong issue will be purely China's internal affair and no  foreign countries will have the right to meddle in Hong Kong's  affairs. Britain is naturally no exception. The so-called  ""moral responsibility"" has no foundation in the Joint  Declaration.    Although Patten repeatedly stressed Hong Kong's  international  status and tried to turn Hong Kong into an ""international  asset,"" this was just a trick played by the British in an  attempt to solicit the help of the international forces to  prolong the British colonial interests in Hong Kong. In fact,  before the signing of the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the  British did not allow other countries to have a hand in Hong  Kong affairs. Now, because the Hong Kong issue has been solved  and Britain will have to withdraw from Hong Kong and the Chinese  Government will resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong,  Britain finds it necessary to encourage other Western countries  to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and step up the process of  ""internationalizing"" Hong Kong politically. This fully shows  that the British side has no sincerity toward implementing the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and is still unwilling to  withdraw from the Chinese territory it forcefully seized more  than 100 years ago. Patten's emphasis on Britain's ""moral  responsibility"" to Hong Kong precisely reflects such a mentality.    The so-called ""British moral responsibility toward Hong  Kong""  after 1997 has no legal foundation at all. Patten himself also  could not utter any tenable argument to justify this. As  everyone knows, Hong Kong was occupied by old British  colonialists in a predatory way. The signing and implementation  of the Joint Declaration should help Britain terminate its  shameful history and enable China and Britain to bring their old  grudge to an end so that the two countries may thus furhter  consolidate and develop their bilateral relations on a new  basis. However, as Hong Kong will soon be returned to its  motherland, the British have talked a lot about their ""moral  responsibility"" toward Hong Kong beyond 1997. This sounds like  a burglar continuing to claim ""moral responsibility"" after the  thing he stole has been taken back by its owner. How shameless  such people are! In the past, many places in North America,  Asia, and Africa, including the United States, were subject to  colonial rule by the British Empire. Would it not be ridiculous  if Britain now continued to claim ""moral responsibility"" toward  so many countries?    If they really want to talk about some ""responsibility,""  then  Britain's ""responsibility"" exists before rather than after 1997.  That is, in the transitional period, Britain must honestly abide  by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and provide sincere  coopertion for China's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong  Kong. The British side bears unshirkable historical  ""responsibility"" for this. To put it more accurately, this is  not just ""moral responsibility"" but the British side's duty  which it must perform according to the norms of international  law and the Joint Declaration.    It is regrettable that the British side erroneously assessed  the situation, broke its own promise, and suddenly changed its  policy toward Hong Kong. In particular, Patten, on taking  office, undermined the foundation for Sino-British cooperation,  wantonly violated and trampled upon the Joint Declaration,  impeded China in reexercising sovereignty over Hong Kong, and  tried to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent  political entity so that Britain can continue to control Hong  Kong from behind the scenes and extend its colonial rule beyond  1997.    By analyzing the essence of the ""political democratization""  program pursued by Patten, the so-called ""Hong Kong freedom and  values"" he advocated were only a synonym for Hong Kong's  ""politial independence or semi-independence."" Hong Kong has  never experienced such ""independence or semi-independence"" in  the past; still less is this allowed by the Joint Declaration  and the ""one country, two systems"" policy. This is just a  sinister plan which the British side is trying to impose on the  future special administrative region through changing Hong  Kong's existing political structure. Fundamentally, it goes  against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and it  unfavorable to Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.  Therefore, it is doomed to be short-lived.     "

He said that  the publication fully shows that Britain has constantly not  abided by its diplomatic accords, and that China certainly will  respond accordingly.    Zhang Junsheng made the above statement when interviewed at  a  spring reception given by the social work department of XINHUA's  Hong Kong branch.    Zhang Junsheng said: The Sino-British negotiations on Hong  Kong's 1994-95 elections were conducted between representatives  sent by the Chinese and British governments. Now the  negotiations have broken down and Britain will publicize the  contents of the negotiations. Although we are not against their  publication, the contents of the negotiations should not be  publicized until the two countries have held diplomatic  consultations, because it was clearly stated beforehand that the  contents of the negotiations are confidential. Without holding  any diplomatic consultations, Britain has now taken a unilateral  move to compile and publicize the so- called ""white paper"" in  which it has said what it wanted to say for the purpose of  deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion.  Is it not very clear that Britain has violated diplomatic  norms? Is it not very clear that it has not abided by its  diplomatic accords?    Zhang Junsheng said: The so-called Sino-British disputes  that have continued for more than a year are caused by Britain's  failure to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, by its  own promise that the development of Hong Kong's political system  must converge with the Basic Law, and by the memorandum of  understanding and accords reached between China and Britain.  Now it has unilaterally publicized the contents of the 17  rounds of negotiations. Is it not very clear that Britain has  not abided by its diplomatic accords?    Zhang Junsheng said: ""We expected that China and Britain  could cooperate very well on the issue of Hong Kong, but now  Britain has seriously undermined the foundation of cooperation.  Under such circumstances, Britain still acts as if nothing has  happened. Is this not an act of deceiving others as well as  itself?"" Zhang Junsheng stressed time and again that Britain's  unilateral move to publicize the contents of the negotiations is  for the purpose of deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading  public opinion, and that China certainly will respond  accordingly.

It then proposed that the  Hong Kong Government set up a ""human rights commission"" and a  ""human rights supervisory institution"" and ""guarantee that Hong  Kong will continue to enjoy basic human rights after the  transfer of sovereignty."" The Foreign Affairs Committee  chairman even advocated exerting international pressure on China  on the question of human rights and asked the British Government  and the UN Human Rights Commission to ""jointly supervise  progress in Hong Kong's human rights status after 1997.""    It seems that Britain wishes to act as a ""human rights  guard""  for Hong Kong!    Honestly speaking, the fact that Britain talks about human  rights and claims to be a ""human rights guard"" before China and  before the Hong Kong people will only add one more little joke  to the world.    Racism and colonialism are the opponents of human rights.  When a place is ruled by racism and colonialism, its human  rights are trampled on. This has been proved by numerous facts  around the world. Britain has exercised colonial rule in so  many countries and regions! It has deprived so many people of  their rights and civil liberties!    Britain used gunboats to seize Hong Kong from China 150  years  ago. Even today, it still rules this place with colonialist  practices and infringes upon the rights of the Hong Kong people.    In the 1880's and during the early part of this century,  Britain carried out two armed invasions of China's Tibet,  inflicting a very great loss on the Tibetan people. Moreover,  it instigated the reactionary elements of Tibet's upper level to  rebel and massacred the patriotic people.    This is Britain's human rights record. What a sordid tale!    Back home in Britain, different races have not achieved  equality either, as some Hong Kong people have pointed out, and  not all of the International Labor Agreements are observed. On  this basis alone, there is no way that we can say that Britain  has a good human rights record.    Isn't it ridiculous that Britain today has gone so far as to  vilify China -- which does not have a single soldier in another  country and which is making remarkable achievements in the  protection and improvement of human rights at home!    Hong Kong needs human rights. Its human rights can only be  really guaranteed after Britain pulls out, after colonial rule  ends, and when the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region --  which will be ruled by the Hong Kong people and which will have  a high degree of autonomy -- is established. The Basic Law has  detailed provisions regarding the rights and freedoms to be  enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong has reverted to  the motherland. In the Chapter on the Fundamental Rights and  Duties of the Residents alone, there are 11 articles which deal  with freedoms. The scope of rights is so wide and the degree of  freedom is so large that they are rarely seen in the world.    Taking advantage of the Wei Jingsheng and Xi Yang incidents,  which judicial organs have already dealt with in accordance with  the law, however, Britain has invented the lie that ""Hong Kong's  human rights status will probably deteriorate after 1997"" and  has invented Hong Kong people's ""worries"" over the future. If  Britain uses this as a basis for setting up a ""human rights  commission"" and a ""human rights supervisory institute"" before  1997, then people have reason to believe that the motive behind  Britain's advocacy for establishing such institutions is to  protect those people -- like those already sentenced by China --  who pry into and steal state military information and economic  secrets and endanger national security and national interests  and to build a shelter for a small number of anglophile and  anti-Chinese elements who are hostile to China and who are  creating confusion in Hong Kong.    Therefore, as the ""proposal"" was advanced, leaders of the  United Democrats -- Christine Loh Kung-wai, and the like -- were  immediately overjoyed. They claimed it ""conforms to the overall  interests of the community"" and ""will enable Hong Kong people to  have more confidence in the future."" They then urged the  government to set up human rights institutions as soon as  possible and ""compile a report for the United Nations."" They  and some others advocated drawing up an information freedom  regulations bill and a human rights and equal opportunity  commission regulations bill and urged the Hong Kong Government  to step up its revision of such laws and regulations as the  Press Freedom Regulations, the Official Secrets Act, and the  Public Security Regulations so that their restrictions can be  relaxed, thus offering legal protection to some who go against  China and create confusion and make trouble in Hong Kong.    Some people from the Hong Kong community pointed out:  Britain has never done anything to improve Hong Kong's human  rights status during its colonial rule for the past one and a  half centuries. Now Britain is playing ""human rights politics""  when Hong Kong is about to revert to the motherland. They  argued that Britain is not doing this out of good intentions but  in order to set up new obstacles for Hong Kong's smooth  transition. Therefore, the Hong Kong people should be on guard  against this ploy and must never be taken in.    Everything that happens after 30 June 1997 will be China's  internal affairs, and no country can intervene. All major  issues involving and straddling 1997 should be negotiated  between China and Britain and must not be unilaterally decided  on by the British side. This is a question of principle. The  question of whether there is the need to formulate laws and set  up institutions for the protection of Hong Kong's post-1997  human rights in accordance with the Basic Law is the affair of  the future Hong Kong SAR, and the British side has no right to  intervene. If the British Hong Kong authorities want to ""act  independently"" again by setting up the so-called ""human rights  commission"" or ""human rights supervisory institution,"" the  Chinese side will surely not acknowledge them as it does not  acknowledge the political system framework. As for  international pressure, China does not fear it, and no other  country is expected to follow Britain at its instigation.     "

The ex-gratia payment ends a long-running dispute over the  clean-up of British test sites at Maralinga, Monte Bello Islands  and Emu Field in the southern Australian outback.    Australia has long argued that it was Britain's  responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it  claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines.

""It is almost impossible to conceive now that atomic weapons  were actually tested in Australia, they will leave a legacy of  contamination for many thousands of years to come.""    The indigenous Aborigine population was driven off its  traditional lands to make way for the British nuclear tests and  returned in the 1980s only to learn the area had been exposed to  high levels of toxic contamination.    ""As a result of the testing, Aboriginal people lost the use  of their traditional lands, but the compensation will allow a  clean-up and fencing where appropriate and will allow us to have  a much more mature relationship between Britain and Australia,""  Tickner said.    The Aborigines filed a formal complaint to Britain in 1991,  leading Australia to press Britain to share rehabilitation and  compensation costs of the Maralinga nuclear testing range,  abandoned by Britain in 1967.    The settlement, to be paid to Australia in installments over  the next six years, removed a ""major irritant"" to the  relationship between Australia and Britain, British Foreign  Office Minister Alastair Goodlad said in London Friday.    Australia had agreed in turn to abandon all further claims,  he said.    Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister Simon  Crean  and Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in a joint  statement from Canberra that resolution of the issue had  vindicated Australia's stance about the condition of the sites  left by Britain.

The  condition of the sites left by Britain ""was unacceptable even by  the standards that then applied.""

But Britain wants the 62 hectares of land along the airport  railway to be granted in one go, without going through the  annual Sino-British Land Commission talks.    In its latest financing package, which is still being  studied  by the Chinese side, Britain boosted the government injection to  $60 billion, cutting the debts to be borne by the future Airport  Corporation and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to $23  billion.    But the Chinese side insists Britain abides by a stipulation  in the Memorandum of Understanding that any debts above $5  billion must be agreed to by China.    A source close to the British side said the Government was  willing to increase the cash injection into the airport projects  as they were a good investment.    But Britain would stand firm on the view that the Chinese  should approve granting the 62 hectares of land along the  airport railway in one go, on top of the 50 hectares of land  disposed of annually.    ""We must be ensured that this land is available to us  without  further strings attached,"" said the source.    Regarding China's demand to set up a monitoring group to  control costs of the airport projects, the source said the  Government would not concede this point.

He has not only ripped up the rails  for convergence with the Basic law and tried to unilaterally set  up a political structure and impose it on the government of the  Special Administrative Region [SAR] beyond 1997, but also plans  to set the time bomb of a ""human rights committee,"" revise a  series of laws in Hong Kong, and broaden the room for maneuver  for international forces in an attempt to create discord,  turmoil, and confrontation after 1997.    Patten's ""three violations"" are aimed at establishing a  pro-British and anti-China political body in Hong Kong and then  imposing it on the SAR. The plan for establishing a human  rights committee is also aimed at resisting China's sovereign  power, expanding the room for political maneuver, introducing  international political forces into Hong Kong, and thus turning  Hong Kong into a ""political city."" In this way, Britain may  continue to control Hong Kong's politics in reality after it  returns Hong Kong to China nominally.    The report of the British Parliament ""proposed"" that the  Hong  Kong Government set up a ""human rights committee"" and a ""human  rights supervision organ"" before 1997 so that they might  continue to exert international pressure on China after 1997  through ""joint supervision over the development of the human  rights situation in Hong Kong after 1997"" by the British  Government and the UN Human Rights Committee.    China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  as of 1 July 1997. Britain has no right to influence anything  on China's territory and within the scope of China's internal  affairs, still less can it exercise any ""supervision"" over Hong  Kong affairs through a so-called human rights committee. In  addition to the attempt to maintain its influence in Hong Kong,  the plan to establish a ""human rights committee"" also shows that  Britain has the ambition of changing China's current system and  territory. The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee  not only meddles in Hong Kong's post-1997 affairs, but also has  a hand in Taiwan and Tibetan affairs. Britain tries to harbor  such people as Han Dongfang and allow them to use Hong Kong as a  springboard to enter the mainland for setting up liberal trade  unions and overthrowing the socialist system. Britain also  repeatedly interferes in such cases as that of Xi Yang in order  to support and protect people who use Hong Kong as a base for  buying, prying into, and stealing China's political, military,  and economic secrets and thus endangering China's security.  Britain continues to support such organizations as the  ""Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in  China,"" which is hostile to China and attempts to disrupt Hong  Kong's stability, and allows it to continue its ""yellow bird  action"" and stretch its sinister hand into the mainland.    There also exist human rights problems in Britain. People of  Asian and African origin cannot enjoy equal treatment there, and  the demand of the people in Northern Ireland for independence is  suppressed cruelly. International human rights organizations  and the United States have interfered in and criticized such  events. However, Britain has not enacted its own ""human rights  law"" or set up a ""human rights committee"" in order to meet the  needs of guaranteeing human rights in its own country. Why so?  Britain fails to give any explanation, but it has formulated a  human rights law and is planning to set up a human rights  committee in Hong Kong shortly before its withdrawal from Hong  Kong. Obviously, it harbors sinister intentions when doing this.    An ancient Chinese saying goes that ""one should not impose  anything one does not like on other people."" Britain does not  want to see other countries interfere in affairs within its own  sovereign power, does not want to see foreign forces interfere  in the Northern Ireland issue, and does not want to see any  international organizations supervise its human rights  situation. Why did it do all this against China?    Over more than 100 years of British rule in Hong Kong,  Britain declared that some provisions of the international human  rights convention which it had signed were not applicable in  Hong Kong, and Britain also opposed deleting Hong Kong from its  list of colonies. Historical facts show that Britain had no  sincerity on giving democracy and human rights to Hong Kong.  Obviously it was for sinister purposes that it began to  introduce such things only when it would soon withdraw from Hong  Kong.    Many countries in the world do not have a ""human rights  committee."" The United States, Britain, Japan, and many other  countries have not set up human rights committees. However,  such committees have been set up in Canada and Australia, two of  Britain's former colonies. The practical results there are not  commendable. Enterprise management is made a mess of; large  numbers of suits pile up year on year; large amounts of public  money are wasted; right and wrong are lumped together; even  gangsters and tax evaders can enjoy various strange ""human  rights"" and can even make a fortune by filing countercharges.  Now Britain is trying to impose on Hong Kong such a human  rights committee, which has proved unsuccessful and which may  produce many side effects. This is completely another political  trick before its withdrawal from a colony.    The Basic Law includes sufficient provisions guaranteeing  human rights. In all countries, the guarantees of human rights  of their own people can only be effected through their own  sovereign power and their own legal systems. The establishment  of a human rights committee in Hong Kong outside the framework  of the Basic Law before Britain's withdrawal will only disrupt  the administrative, judicial, and legislative operation of the  future SAR Government, and may even throw things into chaos.  Therefore, such an organization illegally set up by the  colonialists is out of line with the Basic Law and is bound to  be disbanded after 1997.    People have noted that when the British side was talking  about the improvement of relations with China, Patten again  began to play the ""human rights card."" What is his political  purpose? How far does he plan to go along the course of  worsening Sino-British relations?     "

This is the first visit to Vietnam by the British  princess, which will help promote relations between Vietnam and  Great Britain. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam gave  a banquet in honor of the British princess. The princess  sponsors many charity and humanitarian organizations in Great  Britain. She visited and conducted many humanitarian activities  in Third World countries in Africa, in the Middle East, Latin  America, and Asia. In June 1987, she was promoted to royal  princess by the Queen.    Vietnam and Britain have a long-standing relationship. The  visit to the United Kingdom in June and July last year by  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet opened up a new stage in  cooperative ties. When chairing the European Community, Great  Britain made an active contribution to promoting trade relations  between the EC and Vietnam. Now more and more British  organizations are doing business in Vietnam, including Oil Giant  BP. During Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to the United  Kingdom, Prime Minister John Major committed to grant Vietnam  development aid and financial assistance for the reintegration  of returnees program. He also considered delay in Vietnam's  debts. Great Britain also committed to help Vietnam train  pilots and open a stock market, as well as other areas proposed  by Vietnam in which Britain has much experience. Vietnam and  Britain will sign an agreement on investment encouragement and  protection and an agreement on avoidance of double taxation. A  representative office of the Commonwealth of the United Kingdom  of Great Britain [as heard] has been open in Hanoi, which was  catalyzed cooperation between the two countries.    It is hoped that the visit by British Princess Anne will  promote Vietnam-Britain relations.     "

Or, an  introverted little island, buffeted amidst its North Sea setting  by the chill waves of economlc isolatlon.    Two very different visions of Britain's future outside the  EC. Which would prove more accurate? Before the question can be  answered, a further one poses itself: How possible would it be  for Britain to leave the EC? Slipping anchor and sailing away  from standardised condoms, bans on British bangers and Jacques  Delors is not easy as it sounds. Never mind Maastricht, the  real problem is the 1972 European Communities Act. It was this  that confirmed Britain as a member of what is now the EC. To  this day, academics tear each other's beards out over what it  implies. It set out the terms under which Britain joined the  Community, however, it said nothing about how Britain could  leave.    Simple, say some. No Parliament can bind its successor. So  a future Parliament could simply repeal the 1972 Act. Not so,  answer others. As the terms under which Britain joined the EC  acknowleged the supremacy of Community law -- it supersedes that  of member states -- we cannot leave, since there is no lawful  means.    Greenland, of course, got out in 1984. But Greenland, a  former Danish colony, is rather an unusual case. Antony  Bradley, a former professor of constitutional law, sees a  potential goldmine for m'learned friends.    ""Unless withdrawal could be by agreement, Central European  institutions and member states might have claims for  compensation under international law,"" he said. However, he  adds that, were terms for withdrawal to be agreed with the rest  of the EC, Parliament could probably get away with it.    What then? Doom, disaster, and everything short of a plague  of locusts, according to Europhiles. ""Disastrous...suicide,""  said Sir David Knox, the Europhile Tory MP. ""Those who want to  leave are living in a fantasy world; 60 percent of our exports  now go to the EC. If we left, we'd have no say in setting the  rules.""    Figures, as vague as they are alarming, support this view:  2.5 million jobs are at risk, employers have warned. Last  week, Howard Davies, the Director General of the CBI  [Confederation of British Industry], reiterated that the  organisation is ""committed to making a success of Britain's  membership."" Farmers seem to agree. ""The single market  provides important opportunities for British farmers,"" said Paul  Reiderman of the National Farmers' Union.    Bunkum, say Euro-sceptics. ""The outcome would be  astonishingly positive,"" said Teddy Taylor, the outspoken  Euro-sceptic. ""Exports to the EC have risen less fast than  imports: the deficit since 1973 has been 1 billion pounds.  Then there is the saving from quitting the Common Agricultural  Policy -- 32 pounds a week per family. And what about the costs  to Britain of EC decisions, like the 350 pounds million payment  to former local and health authority workers?""    He also questions the assumption that leaving the EC would  ignite a trade war. ""You don't have to be an EC member to be  part of the single market -- look at the EFTA states like  Sweden.""    The benefits of withdrawal roll on. VAT [value-added tax]  would be slashed were our 2.3 billion pound EC contribution to  cease. The City, as an offshore financial centre, would be  largely unaffected -- and could even prosper. Since we trade  more outside the EC than any other member state save Denmark,  Euro-sceptics foresee Britain's tranformation into a vibrant  independent nation -- ""Europe's Singapore.""    It is all, perhaps, a bit too good to be true. Britain could  survive outside the EC, but it would not be plain sailing. ""The  City would hardly suffer at all,"" said Tim Congdon, of Lombard  Street Associates, ""but it is possible that trade barriers could  rise in the event of Britain departing."" Back to Paul  Reiderman: ""The voice of British agriculture is stronger as a  result of being part of a European trading block than it would  be otherwise. How much weight would we carry on our own in  GATT?""    Here is the rub. National prosperity drives the debate about  EC membership, but the reasons for preserving or junking it  touch upon even more than hard cash. They concern political  fundamentals: power, seats round the table, our place in the  world. More importantly, they ask what Britain is, and what sort  of people we are.    If Britain remains an EC member, it is not hard to forecast  the consequences. Europe's economic fortunes will continue to  decline, leading to more EC-led intervention and protectionism  here; the role of our institutions -- the Monarchy, Parliament,  the Church of England -- will increasingly be called into  question.    The alternative is shrouded in mist. Some transitional  unemployment, certainly, the transfer of civil servants from  Brussels to China, Taiwan, and South Korea, the untwinning of  British towns with their continental counterparts maybe; perhaps  a revival of national morale, at least for a while.    Whatever the outcome, it seems certain that the economic  cart  will carry on driving the political horse. And, significantly,  disillusion with the EC is spreading throughout British business.    Dr Anne Robinson, of the Institute of Directors, emphasises  that it has no view on EC withdrawal. Nonetheless, ""the  overwhelming view of our members is that the single market  hasn't delivered."" And if it can't deliver? ""Then people are  going to get very fed-up with Europe, aren't they?""     "

Meanwhile, Britain, in violating the understanding reached  between China and Britain for the confidentiality of the  contents of the Sino-British talks, published a lengthy,  10,000-word white paper, thus unilaterally disclosing the  details of talks. The next day, the Hong Kong Government  published in the gazette the second-phase political system bill.    The series of actions are by no means accidental. They are  an inevitable outcome of Britain changing its policy toward  China and clinging to the ""three violations"" stand. They amply  demonstrate that Britain alone has closed the door to  negotiations and has taken the road of all-out confrontation  with China on the question of Hong Kong's political system. All  Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong, absolutely  cannot tolerate Britain's long-premeditated actions.    As is universally known, Patten, as early as in 1992,  shortly  after he assumed the post of Hong Kong governor, assumed a  facade of benevolence and, under the banner of ""expanding  democracy,"" systematically and step by step peddled the  political system bill in an attempt to change Hong Kong's  current political system and to promote pro-British and  anti-Chinese elements in the political arena so that after 1997  Hong Kong would become an independent or semi-independent  political entity controlled by Britain but beyond the reach of  the Chinese central government. His sinister intentions are all  too clear.    For starters, in October 1992, Patten, without previous  announcements, suddenly dished up the political system bill in  his government work report, thus breaking the state of  consultations and cooperation which had existed between China  and Britain since the signing, through negotiations, of the  Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong question. As a result, open  polemics ensued for as long as six months.    Then, last April Britain was compelled to begin negotiations  with China on the question of the 1994-95 Hong Kong election  arrangements. At the negotiating table, however, Britain  constantly resorted to double-level tactics, uttering glib words  while secretly playing small tricks and trying by hook and by  crook to impede the progress of the negotiations.    Later on, when China and Britain almost reached agreement on  the question of elections for the district board and the two  municipal councils, Britain raised news issues and insisted on  including in the negotiations the method for holding the Legco  elections. It also flagrantly announced the suspension of the  negotiations on election arrangements for regional  organizations, and it unilaterally proceeded to enact laws.  Despite all these things, China still repeatedly stated that on  the precondition that Britain withdrew some of its bills from  the Legco, the door to negotiations would be wide open.  However, Britain ignored the Chinese statements and thus shut  the door to negotiations.    The aforesaid facts clearly show that both prior to and  during the negotiations, or during the three crucial stages that  led to the breakup of negotiations, Britain demonstrated no  sincerity whatsoever for cooperating with China; on the  contrary, it has gone farther and farther down the road of  confrontation.    Recently Patten took great pains to travel to Australia,  thus  more openly trying to create public support and to solicit  international support for the adoption and implementation of his  political system bill. On 19 January, upon returning from his  visit to Australia, he hurriedly submitted the partial political  system bill for adoption by the Legco. Meanwhile, Britain also  published a white paper.       Over the past year or so, the ""farces"" carried out by Chris  Patten were so closely staged one after another that it can be  seen that they were arranged meticulously and long premeditated.    Up to the present, Britain still keeps saying something like  Chris Patten's ""three violations"" constitutional reform package  is aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and  has comprehensively considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong  people. How pleasant this is to the ears. However, people have  long ago put a big question mark over Britain's confession in  light of its deeds.    Everybody knows that the Hong Kong people's maximum  interests  lie in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and in  bringing about a stable transition and smooth takeover of  political power in Hong Kong in 1997. The ""Basic Law"" has been  formulated over four or more years of deliberations and drafts,  and in the process the broad masses of the Hong Kong people were  fully consulted and their opinions were absorbed. One of its  important principles is to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability. It is stipulated in both the preamble and general  principles of the ""Basic Law"" that the socialist system and  policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong SAR and that  the existing capitalist system and way of life shall not be  changed for 50 years. Articles 45 and 68 of the ""Basic Law""  provide that Hong Kong's political system should be developed  ""in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in  accordance with the principle of a gradual and orderly  progress."" Maintaining Hong Kong's existing system and following  the principle of a ""gradual and orderly progress"" are both aimed  at ensuring Hong Kong's stable development and at bringing about  the transition, the takeover of political power, and the  establishment of a Hong Kong SAR government and a legislative  council in a state of stability in Hong Kong.    Therefore, these principles, which have been expounded in  the  ""Basic Law"" and which have identified with the broad masses of  the Hong Kong people, are truly those which are in keeping with  the fundamental interests and aspirations of the Hong Kong  people. Without consulting any Hong Kong residents, however,  Chris Patten hastily submitted a political system bill less than  three months after taking office in Hong Kong. Then, in  ignoring the call of people from various circles in Hong Kong  for settling Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements through  negotiations, he forced the bill through the Legco. How can  this express and reflect the aspirations and interests of the  Hong Kong people?    The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the  British administration of Hong Kong will terminate on 30 June  1997 and that the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. China has  reiterated that as component parts of the British political body  administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district  boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco will  definitely be terminated together with the end of the British  administration of Hong Kong. Under the condition that China and  Britain reach no agreements on the arrangements for the 1994-95  elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the  partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or  any other electoral bill possibly to be passed in the future  will be brought to an end as the British administration comes to  an end, and they cannot be extended beyond the year 1997.    If Chris Patten believes that this bill can be consolidated  in the form of the law once it is passed and that the  three-level bodies produced on the basis of this bill can be  automatically continued after 1997, this is a badly mistaken  fantasy.    The times are progressing forward, and Hong Kong's future  destiny is in the hands of the Chinese people, including the  broad masses of the Hong Kong compatriots. No matter how far  Britain confronts China over the issue of Hong Kong's political  system, it can by no means resist the wheel of history, which is  rolling forward. People on the Chinese side maintain that as  long as the Hong Kong compatriots and the inland people make  concerted efforts to properly and comprehensively implement ""one  country, two systems,"" Hong Kong will have a future of  incomparable brightness.

It was the second time in a week that Mr Hurd has voiced his approval for a more active German role on the world stage. Asked on BBC radio whether Britain would back a proposal to give Germany a permanent Security Council seat, he replied: 'Yes, indeed we would.' He added that the UK viewed German admission as a probable outcome of forthcoming debates on the UN's future structure. UK officials said London continued to link German and Japanese admission to the Council with a broader reform of the institution, in which Latin America, Africa and Asia might also demand seats. Mr Hurd told the German magazine Der Spiegel, in an interview published this week, that Britain welcomed the prospect of a more decisive role for Germany in international affairs. He said it was 'childish twaddle' to imagine that Britain might be jealous of President Bill Clinton's enthusiasm for ties with Germany.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Major and  Balladur are both struggling to maintain popularity, control and  respect at the head of right-wing parties. The success of the  Channel link will be crucial for both.    [LIBERATION] What does the Channel Tunnel represent for your  country?    [Major] It is a potent symbol of Britain's new role in  Europe. We share with France an enormous pride in the  achievement and skills of those who have designed and  constructed one of the greatest engineering projects of the  century. The tunnel links Great Britain with the Continent for  the first time in many thousands of years. It will bring us  nearer still to the French people, with whom our ties have grown  ever closer over past years.    [Balladur] The Channel Tunnel will bring our two countries  closer in many ways, not just economically. It will help  strengthen economic cohesion within the European Union. France  can expect to see an increase in tourism -- which is its primary  source of foreign currency.    [LlBERATlON] What impact is the tunnel expected to have?    [Major] It will be a direct link to the single market for  our companies who export goods, and for the millions who travel  from Britain every year.    In linking Britain to the French rail system and beyond that  to the wider European rail system, it will give our exporters  the chance to benefit from long rail runs for the first time.  It will also provide our business community with previously  unparalleled access to important capitals such as Paris and  Brussels. As for tourism, millions of Britons already travel to  the Continent every year by ferry and air. The opening of the  Channel Tunnel will provide healthy new competition. I hope,  too, that it will encourage as many French tourists to visit  Britain as British tourists visit France.    [LIBERATION] In France, the highspeed train link between  Paris and Calais is already in place. Britain must wait another  10 years. Why has it taken so long for the Conservative  government to make a decision regarding the ""British TGV [Train  A' Grande Vitesse]""?    [Major] It was never intended that a new line would be built  in Britain before the tunnel opened. The present rail lines  through Kent have been improved to take tunnel traffic and will  provide sufficient capacity until some time after the turn of  the century. But, given that capacity is unlikely to be  sufficient in the next 10 years or so, we are pressing ahead  with our plans for a new line to be ready within that timeframe.  We expect the line to reduce the London to Paris journey time  by 20-25 minutes. There are a number of factors which make the  British and French situations different. For example, French  terrain is more suitable for railways than south-east England  (being flatter), land values in Kent are higher than in northern  France -- and in France there was existing local demand for a  new rail link to serve the Lille area.    [LIBERATION] Great Britain is not as intensely committed to  the scheme as France, particularly where the rail link is  concerned. Is this a serious handicap?    [Balladur] It is not for me to judge the choices an  important partner of France chooses to make. I will simply say  that the high-speed TGV rail system in France has boosted the  railway industry, as demonstrated by the success of our  GEC-Alsthom [General Electric Company] in winning the South  Korean railway contract. We intend to build on this; that is  why the government has decided to build the Mediterranean (Lyon  to Nice) and Eastern (Paris to Strasbourg) TGV lines. TGV gave  the SNCF [French Railway Network] state railway new perspectives.    [LIBERATION] After centuries of fighting invasions as an  island, do the British fear losing sovereignty and identity with  such a tunnel?    [Major] Not at all. It is certainly true that the British  have never been accustomed to the idea of getting into a train  and arriving in another country. The sea crossing, however  short, has represented a barrier. But countries such as France,  which have always had land boundaries, are clearly sovereign and  have distinct identities. Britain is no different in that  respect.    [Balladur] The main feature of British civilisation has  undoubtedly been its extraordinary expansion throughout the  world. I cannot believe that the great British people, in order  to protect their identity, would now be cowering on the very  island from which they set sail to travel the world.    On the contrary, I am convinced that Britain has a major  role  in the building of Europe, not least in the originality of its  contribution to the overall structure.    [LIBERATION] Britain has been accused by some of its  European partners of trying to slow down enlargement of the  Union. Does the tunnel mean Britain will be more ""at the heart  of Europe?""    [Major] In fact it was Britain that was the foremost  advocate of enlargement and fought to have the states of the  European Free Trade Association brought into the Union at the  earliest date. In this we were successful.    [Balladur] Britain has made a remarkable contribution to  the strengthening of Europe in a large number of areas, for  example the setting up of the single market. The British  Government and people have, like their French counterparts, a  high opinion of their national destiny. But we all realise that  our old nations, while preserving their identity and  sovereignty, must co-operate more within the European framework.  Closer cooperation between our two countries is of particular  importance in ensuring that European opinions of the  international scene are taken into account. In fact, the  Yugoslav crisis shows that, at present, the involvement of other  European countries depends largely on a move by our two  countries which has brought our other European partners along  with it.    [LIBERATION] What about the co-operation between France and  Britain? Will it grow both on an economic and political level?    [Major] Our ties with France are already extremely close.  We are partners in the European Union, NATO, the UN Security  Council and the G7 group. We work together closely on foreign  policy, defence and many other issues. We invest enormous  amounts in each other's economies and many companies -- over  2,000 at the last count -- are co-located in one way or another  in both Britain and France.    Defence co-operation has been growing strongly in recent  years. We have more defence projects with France than with any  other partners. Our troops are used to working side by side on  exercises and in UN peacekeeping operations. Together we have  made the greatest troop contribution to peacekeeping in former  Yugoslavia.    I am sure our links in these and many other areas will  continue to grow.    [Balladur] Collaboration between France and Britain is close  and productive. It also goes back a long way. Ninety years  ago, our two countries formed the Entente Cordiale. The  vitality of this agreement is founded on basic interests that we  share, notably as nuclear powers and permanent members of the  Security Council.    Today, our troops are once again working side by side in  Bosnia. If the institutional debate has sometimes -- quite  understandably -- uncovered differing sensibilities on the part  of Britain and France, I am pleased to say that, when we are  faced with a crisis, our two countries are essentially on the  same side. That is why I have every confidence in the strength  of our future political co-operation.    As far as our economic, scientific and industrial  co-operation is concerned, this is particularly strong. Allow  me to quote the most obvious examples. Concorde, Jaguar, the  TGV trains.... Examples of successful Franco-British projects  abound.    I am convinced that the cross-fertilisation of our  economies,  as symbolised by the Channel Tunnel, will be more marked in the  years to come and I am delighted about this.    [LIBERATION] Could the Channel Tunnel be a commercial  failure?    [Major] Eurotunnel has built and will operate the tunnel  wholly as a private venture. In doing so they have backed their  own judgment about future profitability. The new choices the  tunnel offers both to the transport industry and the public will  ensure both its full use and its success.    [Balladur] The Channel Tunnel represents a large undertaking  which has broken new ground. One can never rule out the  possibility of running into difficulties in the initial stages.  However I am convinced that as soon as the French and British  people -- not forgetting all the other Europeans -- understand  the advantages of the tunnel, it will enjoy the success it  deserves.    [LIBERATION] Will you use the Channel Tunnel yourself?    [Major] I am very much looking forward to being able to use  the tunnel, both on business and privately.    [Balladur] Of course.     "

This  has been a topic of discussion among the British people  recently. Although the Britain of today cannot be compared with  that of the past, the Major government is still doing its utmost  to continue pursuing ""three-circle diplomacy,"" that is,  conducting activities within the three links of developing the  Western European Union, maintaining the special relationship  between Britain and the United States, and preserving the  British Commonwealth, as proposed by Winston Churchill and first  put into practice by Foreign Secretary Earnest Belvin. If we  say that Churchill's pursuit of ""three-circle diplomacy"" was  effected through a series of measures, we can also see that the  times and situations have changed, and the Major government  seems unable to pursue ""three-circle diplomacy"" as it wishes and  finds it difficult to go any further.    In developing its relationship with Europe, Britain seems to  be hesitating and marking time. Although Prime Minister Major  repeatedly claimed to place Britain in the ""heart of Europe,"" it  has always been regarded by the European Union as a half-hearted  member. Since the end of World War II, Britain has taken a  position toward European union which is different from most  countries on the European Continent. With regard to the goals  and orientation of building Europe, the mainstream faction of  most governments of the EC members -- including France, Germany,  and so on -- represented by Jean Monnet and Delors, has taken  the building of an integrated European economic and political  entity or a supranational European union as a basic goal, since  the early years of European unification movement until the  subsequent effort to build an integrated European community.  Britain did not favor this proposition, however, and still has  reservations on the goal of developing the EC into a union as  proposed by the Maastricht Treaty. With regard to the presence  of the United States in Europe, it maintains that the United  States should remain in Europe to balance the strength there,  but France and Germany hold that ""Europe belongs to the  Europeans."" The United States supported the suggestion that  Germany be admitted as an additional permanent member of the UN  Security Council early last year, but Britain and France have  reservations on this issue. With regard to the war flames that  are spreading in the former Yugoslav regions, Britain, France,  and Germany all have considerations of their own.    The ""special relationship between Britain and the United  States,"" which has been maintained for many years, is not so  ""special"" now. Before the gunsmoke of World War II had lifted,  former British Prime Minister Churchill proposed establishing a  ""special British-U.S. relationship"" in his speech in Fulton in  the United States, hoping to use the United States to prop up  its appearance of ""might."" During the Cold War period, the  actions of the Western alliance were generally determined by  unanimous agreement between the two countries. However, the two  special allies have harbored ill feelings toward one another for  some time recently. Prior to Christmas in 1992, President-elect  Clinton made an excuse to avoid meeting the British prime  minister who was visiting the United States at that time, which  cast a dark shadow over British-U.S. relations. In February of  the next year when Major once again visited the United States,  he failed to repair the ""special relationship,"" and differences  between the two sides became even more prominent--they stuck to  their own arguments on the issue of trade talks between Europe  and the United States, had acute differences in their views on  airdropping materials in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and engaged in a  battle of words on the issue of Northern Ireland. The United  States denounced British actions in Northern Ireland as  ""violations of human rights,"" and Britain criticized the U.S.  intention to send a peace corps to inspect North Ireland as  ""interference in its internal affairs."" It appears that  people's views on the ""special relationship"" have changed under  the situation of increasing friction and conflicts between the  two sides economically and politically, although both consider  it necessary to maintain such a ""special relationship.""    Britain has made a comprehensive effort to maintain the  increasingly weak British Commonwealth. With each member of the  Commonwealth currently going its own way, however, the decisions  made by the conference are not binding on the member countries.  When the conference of the British Commonwealth was held in  Cyprus last year, the newspapers in the host country stated that  the ""themes of the conference are irrelevant and pointless,"" and  that the British Commonwealth was ""no longer a major force in  international politics."" In Australia, an irresistible wave of  republican sentiment is surging forward, and Australian Prime  Minister Keating has repeatedly proposed that Australia should  appear in the international arena as an ""image of independence,""  should become a republic before the year 2000, and should change  its national flag, which is similar in design to the British  ensign, in due time.    There are profound root causes for the challenges that the  British ""three-circle diplomacy"" is facing.    Britain was once very glorious, but this glory has become  history. Economic statistics show that British industry has  been in an accelerated decline, and its proportion in  international manufacturing production, trade, and GNP have  fallen sharply. Over the past few years, the country has been  bogged down in a serious economic recession and so far has  lacked the strength to recover. Just as the British magazine the  ECONOMIST has stated, ""Britain's real significance has been on  the wane to a considerable extent."" Economic reality has made  people realize that ""its position of strength of the past is  gone forever.""    The radical changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,  the reunification of Germany, and the conclusion of the Cold War  have fundamentally changed the international environment which  Britain has relied upon to maneuver and carry out its foreign  policies. First, the end of the Cold War noticeably weakened the  British position and influence. Being a victorious nation in  World War II and the second largest economic power in the  capitalist world in early post-war years, and backed up by the  ""special British-U.S. relationship,"" Britain played an important  role in the formation and development of the international  political and economic order after World War II. With the lapse  of the Cold War era, however, the importance of the military  factor in the relations of the Western alliance have declined,  while that of economic factors has risen remarkably. Thus, its  political superiority -- based on its military capability and  its role in the defense of the West -- has been deteriorating  imperceptibly. Moreover, united Germany has grown to be the  number one economic power in Europe and occupies an increasingly  important position of leadership in the EC with every passing  day. As a result, in foreign affairs the United States is  leaning more toward Germany as the days go by. Second, U.S.  foreign policy specialists maintain that the ""future of the  world lies in Asia."" Asia's position in the U.S. global  strategy has risen somewhat, and the relationship between the  United States and the Western European countries, including  Britain, is facing new readjustments.    Although Britain's national strength is far from what it was  in the past, the British Government has not redefined its  position and policy goals according to the new international  pattern. Conversely, it has continued to pursue Churchill's  ""three-circle diplomacy."" This is a tough problem for British  diplomacy. Therefore, the British press maintains that Britain's  foreign policy goals are in urgent need of further  readjustment."" A senior British Government official also said a  short time ago that Britain will lose its international  influence -- which it still possesses -- unless it reevaluates  its foreign policy goals and refrains from sticking its nose in  everybody's business.

In the first nine months of last year, two-way trade  amounted  to RM [Malaysian ringgit] 6.5 billion. Although statistics for  the whole of 1993 are still not available, last year's total  trade between the two nations may well surpass the previous  year's figures.    In 1992, Malaysia's imports from Britain totalled RM4.14  billion. Its exports were RM2.55 billion.    Malaysia buys electrical equipment, power generators and  heavy industrial machinery from Britain. Malaysia on the other  hand, sells primary commodities, machinery, telecommunication  equipment, garments and apparel, accessories and sawn timber to  Britain.    Statistics show that bilateral trade between Britain and  Malaysia has been particularly strong in the past four to five  years reaching its peak in 1991 with total trade surpassing  RM4.4 million.    During the same period, British investments in Malaysia have  also increased significantly to almost RM900 million in 1990  compared to RM750 million in 1989.    Following stiff competition from other foreign investors,  particularly Japanese, Taiwanese as well as American, British  investors have taken a back seat -- resulting in a downtrend in  investments since 1991.    British investments in Malaysia dropped to below RM300  million in 1992. Nevertheless, Britain remained the largest  European investor in Malaysia.    The current trade figures between the two countries are  indeed a far cry from the days when Malaysia launched the ""Buy  British Last"" policy in October 1981.    Although officials maintained that trade to and from Britain  was not really affected during the period, there was only  marginal increase in total trade.    For instance, bilateral trade was barely above RM2 billion  in  1981, 1982 and 1983.    This was because the private sector continued to purchase  British goods as they were priced competitively amidst the  depreciating pound sterling.    The ""Buy British Last"" policy was introduced following  accumulative ""irritants"" that the country faced in its relations  with Britain and British companies.    The breaking point was when the British Government announced  a substantial increase in student fees which severely affected  more than 15,000 Malaysian students in Britain.    Other factors which had triggered the policy included the  failure of British companies to comply with the requirement of  the National Economic Policy and the landing rights for Malaysia  Airlines (MAS).    The policy called for all British contracts to be vetted  thoroughly by the Prime Minister's Department together with the  second choice non-British bidder.    Realising that the policy had caused British companies  countless lucrative government contracts, the then British  premier Margaret Thatcher personally intervened to patch things  up.     "

The embargo was imposed by the  European Community in 1982 after the IDF's [Israel Defense  Forces] invasion of Lebanon, but most EC members had long since  rescinded the ban. Britain left it in effect, insisting that the  IDF withdraw from the security zone. Although Britain has lifted  the prohibition on buying arms from Israel, she has not actually  bought any weapons because of the embargo.    Why are the British more extreme in this matter than the  other European countries? It may be that the answer to this must  be sought in the remote past, when Britain conducted policy in  Mandate Palestine by calculating the worth of relations with the  Arab states and the Arab world. It was a question not of  principle but of practical considerations. The reason given for  the recent decision to lift the embargo was the positive  developments in the peace process in the Middle East,  ""especially in light of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho."" The decision was made following an extended lobbying  visit by Rabin, Peres, Beilin, and their assistants. Beilin, who  met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, told him that  Britain's decision to maintain the embargo so long as no  progress occurred in the negotiations with Lebanon, was absurd  because such progress depends on Syria. Moreover, Israel made  clear that she has no territorial demands on Lebanon.    We glean from these events that Britain lags behind European  nations in her conservative policy. This is also fundamentally a  pro-Arab policy, to the point of imposing conditions for every  development in relations with Israel. The British seem to forget  that Israel no longer is a land under the control of the British  Government, or that Britain cannot dictate how she shall conduct  policy. The technique of imposing ""collective punishment"" on  Israel for one policy or another is pointless. Britain cannot  impose an economic embargo on another government simply because  its political considerations differ from those of His Majesty's.    The British Government has taught us another lesson at the  same time. Prime Minister John Major refused to accept the  Jewish community's invitation to take part in an evening devoted  to Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day. His secretary justified that on  the ground that Britain does not recognize and, indeed, rejects  Israel's annexation of Jerusalem. Short and sweet. This is a  community that sought to be honored by honoring the man who  serves as the prime minister and, in the end, was honored by his  disgrace. The festive dinner was held in a synagogue in  Jerusalem even without a speech by Prime Minister John Major.      "

The meaning is  quite clear: To go against China through to the end on the Hong  Kong issue.    Why has Chris Patten no scruples about declaring his stand  of  going against China through to the end? Just as he said in his  article, the reason is that what he has done since he became  governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only  by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain.  He said: ""Some criticisms have appeared in both Britain and  Hong Kong."" But he also found excuses to console himself: ""In  an open and free society, such criticisms may appear."" As a  mater of fact, if there had only been ""some"" criticisms, there  was no need for the governor to personally write such a long  article to explain himself over such trifles.    The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten  was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the  interests of the Hong Kong people. He wrote: ""Our  responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put  first."" This British Hong Kong governor is really more  concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people. For this  reason, he feels it unfair that the Hong Kong people are  criticizing and condemning him instead of saying thank you to  him. But for the Hong Kong people, of course the Hong Kong  Chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should  be treated as real Chinese people of China rather than a  conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of  Britain is to ensure a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in  accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration.    In fact, responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong  advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist  interests of the British Empire. Some people criticized what he  had done as ""jeopardizing more extensive Sino-British  relations."" To refute this criticism he said: ""Hong Kong is  the biggest and most important component part of these  relations."" What is more, ""judging from a long-term point of  view, our position in China and Asia may, to a great extent, be  decided by how we discharge our responsibility in Hong Kong in a  dignified manner.""    People cannot but ask: Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most  important part of Sino-British relations? To the Chinese  people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was  plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by  Britain against China. The Chinese people will never forget this  national humiliation. If this humiliation is not wiped out,  there can be no harmonious Sino- British relations.    However, this is obviously not what Chris Patten meant. Then  what did he mean by saying Hong Kong is the ""biggest and most  important"" part of Sino-British relations? Did he mean that the  British Empire will not resign itself to the return of its  richest colony to China, the rightful owner?    People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in  China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its  responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner? What  position does Britain want to have in China and in Asia? What  is the meaning of a ""dignified manner""? If Britain ensures a  smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, is it not a practice in a  ""dignified manner?"" Can it not help improve the image of  Britain and increase its position in China and Asia? Does  Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name  while preserving its position as the ""governor"" to show the  power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the  tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist? In this respect,  what Chris Patten meant is quite clear.    In his article, Chris Patten brutally attacked China as a  ""villain."" In fact, this is the right word for Mr. Patten  himself. He threatened that if China did not obey the  ""governor's"" arrangement, it should not expect Britain would  agree to its return to GATT.    Although Chris Patten has taken great pains to protect the  interests of the British Empire, he is not admired by some  domestic opinion. Instead, he has been criticized and  condemned. That is why he feels somewhat wronged.    Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, has been  trying  hard to preserve an actual colonial position in Hong Kong and  revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old British  Empire. Unfortunately, all this is but a day dream.    This article is actually a confession by Chris Patten, who  has been driven to the wall, to prove his loyalty to British  colonialism.     "

By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER      A relatively inexpensive and widely available drug can halve the rate of  vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis, according to a study that may  offer a new treatment option for some of the 24 million Americans who suffer  from brittle bones.    The drug, called etidronate, is used to treat Paget's disease, a bone disorder  among middle-aged and elderly people. It is not approved for use against  osteoporosis, but the manufacturer intends to apply for federal permission.    ""The important message is that here is another therapeutic option that is  probably as effective as estrogen and calcitonin and that has a low incidence  of side-effects,"" said Dr. B. Lawrence Riggs, an osteoporosis specialist at the  Mayo Clinic and Foundation.    Estrogen therapy is one of several methods of preventing bone loss in  post-menopausal women. But it is less effective against more advanced  osteoporosis, has some undesirable side effects and cannot be used by women  with a high breast-cancer risk.    Calcitonin, another hormone, is often used by women who cannot take estrogen.  But in the United States, it must be given by injection. It is also relatively  expensive -- about 10 times the annual cost of etidronate, researchers said.    The new study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found  that two years of etidronate therapy not only halved the vertebral-fracture  rate in post-menopausal women but also increased their spinal bone density by  an average of 4% or 5%.    The lessening of the fracture rate was especially striking in women who had the  weakest bones when the 429-patient study began. In their case, the  vertebral-fracture rate was reduced by two-thirds compared to women not taking  the drug.    ""The most important thing is the demonstration of a reduced rate of fractures,""  said Dr. Nelson B. Watts, the study's principal author. ""It doesn't matter to a  patient whether the bones are more dense or not; what matters to them is  whether they have a fracture and hurt.""    The study focused specifically on vertebral fractures, the most common  fractures in people with osteoporosis. Watts said the number of non-vertebral  fractures, such as hip fractures, in the women he studied was too small to show  any significant differences between women on and off the drug.    Others cautioned that the drug needs further study to explore, for example, its  long-term effects on bone strength and bone-cell activity. They also called for  studies comparing the effectiveness of etidronate to that of other osteoporosis  treatments.    ""Right now we see it as part of that arsenal (of osteoporosis drugs),"" said  Sandra C. Raymond, executive director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation.  ""We can't answer the question, is it more or less effective than anything  else?""    ""It's important to emphasize that this is still viewed as experimental  therapy,"" said Dr. Steven T. Harris of UC San Francisco, a co-author of the  study. ""It is intriguing, it's exciting, but it's experimental.""    Osteoporosis -- which can cause fractures of the spine, hip and wrist --  affects about 24 million Americans, most of them elderly women. About 5 million  of them suffer from spinal osteoporosis and run the risk of painful vertebral  fractures.    Such fractures can cause the bones to compress, resulting in a progressive loss  of height or in pain from compression of the spinal nerve. Osteoporosis is  estimated to cause 1.5 million fractures in the United States each year.    Etidronate works by interfering with so-called bone remodeling, the process by  which bones are constantly broken down and rebuilt. The drug inhibits the  metabolic activity of cells responsible for breaking down, or resorbing, bone.    Watts estimated the drug's cost, if used to treat osteoporosis, at $200 to $300  a year.    The study, conducted at seven academic medical centers nationwide, involved  women who had already had from one to four vertebral fractures. Some of the  women received etidronate while others did not; they all took calcium, a widely  used osteoporosis treatment.    The drug was administered by tablet intermittently over two years.    In the end, the women who took etidronate had a vertebral fracture rate of 29.5  per 1,000 patient years -- compared to a rate of 62.9 in the non-drug group.  The women with the lowest spinal bone density had a rate of 42.3 fractures  compared to 132.7.    The findings expand upon those of a much smaller study published two months ago  in the journal. That study, involving fewer but sicker patients, found a  similar increase in bone mass, absence of side effects and a reduction in  fractures.    ""We certainly can't claim that this cures osteoporosis,"" said Watts, associate  professor at Emory University School of Medicine. ""There may be people with  such severe disease that we can't restore them to health. But this certainly  improves their lot.""    Etidronate has been available in the United States since 1978 for treatment of  Paget's disease and a bone disorder in cancer patients. It is sold under the  brand name Didronel by its manufacturer, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals Inc.    Norwich Eaton helped fund the new study.    Susan Dietrich, a company spokeswoman, said this week that the firm intends to  apply soon to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make osteoporosis  treatment an ""approved use"" for etidronate. One researcher estimated that an  FDA decision could take at least six months.    In the meantime, the law does not prevent physicians from prescribing the drug  for so-called ""off-label"" uses such as treating osteoporosis.

On the eve of the Tory party conference and of publication of his own political memoirs, Lord Howe voiced his dismay at the 'strong, sustained and growing background of hostility' to Mr Major's pledge when he first entered Downing Street that he would keep Britain at the heart of Europe. He spoke as leading members of the Tory right - including Lord Tebbit and Mr Norman Lamont - prepared to demand at the Bournemouth conference assurances that Mr Major will reject further encroachment on British sovereignty. Mr Lamont, former chancellor, is expected to insist in an appearance on the conference fringe that Mr Major pledges that Britain will take no part in a single European currency. But Lord Howe, whose resignation over European policy precipitated Lady Thatcher's downfall in 1990, said the case for Britain retaining a central role in shaping Europe's future had become stronger. Voicing in public the views of pro-European ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, he told the magazine of the Tory Reform Group: 'The case for ensuring that Europe is not dominated by a Continental partnership from which Britain is excluded is proving itself stronger and stronger with every day that passes.' In a sideswipe at Mr Major's suggestion that the creation of a multi-speed Europe would allow Britain to opt out of more areas of integration, Lord Howe said: 'If we are a member of a European club in which we find ourselves, by our own choice, more unequal than others in most areas, then there is a danger of creating the two-speed, second-division future for Europe which we claim we don't want.' Britain could be slower-moving in areas such as social policy and monetary union but 'the central thrust of our policy has to be devoted to participation in the European Union'. In spite of confidence in the Tory hierarchy that this week it can avoid the bitter fights over Europe which dogged the last two annual conferences, it was clear last night that both sides were determined to stake out their ground. Mr Hunt, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, intends to use a speech on the fringe to stress that Britain cannot withdraw from 'the heart of Europe'. But Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, spoke for the Eurosceptic side of the cabinet table when he insisted yesterday that there was no question of Britain participating in a single currency for 'the foreseeable future'.

This was stated by the Chechen Foreign Ministry today.    The Chechen Foreign Ministry said Britain had tried to stain  the honor and dignity of the Chechen people blaming it for a  vendetta.    ""Unwilling to cause any additional troubles and problems for  the Britain [as received] and in order to avoid new provocations  and incidents unpleasant for Britain,"" Chechnya decided not to  participate in the Sytex-94 international exhibition.    The Chechen president's service told Interfax that the  statement was due to the assassination of Karin Reed in London.  Karin Reed was a relative of an Armenian terrorist  Ter-Oganesyan who had taken part in the assassination of the  Utsiyev brothers. Currently, he is serving a life-sentence in a  British prison. After the assassination of Karin Reed several  London editions suggested that this had been a vendetta on the  part of relatives of the Utsiyev brothers sent to Britain more  than a year before and killed by Armenian terrorists.    The official reason for the Utsiyevs' trip to London was to  legalize the order for printing Chechen currency units and  stamps. Scotland Yard suggested that the Utsiyevs had come to  Britain in order to buy missiles and to re-sell them to the  Azerbaijani party.    Blaming the foreign special services for attempts to  discredit Chechnya, the Chechen Foreign Minister stated that the  British special services seemed not to know well enough customs  and traditions of ""Chechens for whom the assassination of a  woman an elderly person or a child is a national disgrace.""

Britain is rightly proud of Lieutenant-General Sir Michael  Rose, the man who has led the move from resolution to strength,  from ceasefire into separation of forces. Yet John Major  yesterday answered General Rose's plea for urgent reinforcements  with a promise of no more than 60 mortar-locating experts.    This is hardly the whole-hearted commitment to the NATO  strategy of threatening force to halt the bombardment of  Sarajevo which Mr Major was enjoining on President Yeltsin,  although the Russians appeared to have reduced the tension last  night. The Prime Minister insisted that Britain was meeting its  obligations by redeploying two units from Vitez to Sarajevo.  Britain already had over 2,300 troops in Bosnia, he said; it  was now the turn of other nations to provide reinforcements to  monitor the surrender of weapons.    It is true that Britain responded quickly to the United  Nations request for troops to protect the humanitarian convoys,  and has the second largest contingent in Bosnia after the  French. But Britain has also been consistent in its opposition  to battlefield intervention and in its refusal to sanction  either air strikes or a change in the role of UN troops.    Last week Britain lost the argument in NATO, and agreed both  to the threat of force and the de facto change in the terms of  the UN mission from peace keeping to peace enforcement. Partly  to cover its embarrassment and to demonstrate a resolution  wholly lacking in its niggardly attitude to the new NATO  strategy, the Government trumpeted its refusal to contemplate  fresh contingents for Bosnia.    General Rose wants British troops in Sarajevo because they  have proved to be among the best in Bosnia. The attempt to  secure Serb and Bosnian Government guns is the most ambitious  military task yet undertaken by UNPROFOR [UN Protective Forces],  the UN forces, demanding tact, resolution and courage as  tensions and tempers rise.    Largely because of Northern Ireland, British soldiers are  more experienced than others in dealing with terrorist warlords  and suspicious civilians; consequently they have proved  themselves outstandingly capable in Central Bosnia. Commanders  have brushed aside bureaucracy and rescued civilians. They have  broken blockades on the convoy routes. They have remained  impartial and uncorrupted.    Redeployment from Vitez will leave a gap in an area as  fought  over as Sarajevo, where aid is as short and atrocities as  common. Mr Major clearly believes that this gap should be filled  by someone else -- Belgians perhaps, or non-European countries  that might prove as effective as the Jordanians have been.    This misses the point. Countries such as Jordan cannot send  more troops because the UN is incapable of paying them. Britain  can afford to wait for reimbursement. The latest opinion poll  shows that the British public is far readier to accept air  strikes than the Government appears to be.    The American refusal to respond to the UN call confirms the  confusion and double-standards that have marked out the Clinton  Administration policy on Bosnia. The Russian decision to send  troops may be helpful in persuading the Serbs to give up their  weapons -- or it may encourage their resistance.    Britain has long prided itself as ""punching above its  weight"". All-round capability and a highly professional army  mean that the country remains a formidable military power, one  that has used this strength to reinforce Western values and UN  resolutions. Mr Major's refusal to respond to a call for more  troops just when their presence is most critical is yet another  demonstration of half-heartedness over the NATO decision. It is  a fudge that satisfies no one, least of all General Rose.     "

During these hearings, many men of insight --  including Cradock -- called for a ""stance that Britain must  abide by the Joint Declaration,"" and they criticized changes in  Britain's China policy as ""injuring others without benefiting  oneself."" The Foreign Affairs Select Committee, however, turned  a deaf ear to these criticisms, and on 13 April published a  report entitled: ""Anglo- Chinese Relations Before and After  1997."" Following its publication, the report was widely  criticized by the media, which said that it ""is ""out of step  with the times,"" ""lacks a sense of historical reality,"" and ""is  irresponsible and erroneous."" The Foreign Affairs Committee of  the China's National People's Congress also sternly rebuked the  report for flagrantly advocating viewpoints and suggestions  hostile to China, and expressed its strong indignation at the  report's wanton interference in China's internal affairs.    The British parliamentary report lacked a sense of  historical  reality. It could not but admit that the Chinese economy, with  a vast market, is developing at full speed and thus Britain must  maintain ties with China, but with the exception of this, all of  its viewpoints and suggestions were hostile to China's  flourishing development. Moreover, the report barefacedly  stated that it was necessary not only to reverse the Joint  Declaration, but also to repudiate the principles for  establishing diplomatic relations between China and Britain. It  called for turning back Britain's China policy to the 19th  century to try to revive the old historical dream in which the  great British Empire wantonly interfered in and split up China.    The report confessed that ""Britain undeniably has changed  its  ways."" It said: ""It should not be taken for granted that the  Beijing regime will last beyond 1997, so Britain should not draw  up a rigid China policy."" That is to say, even though Britain  promised in the Joint Declaration to return Hong Kong to China  and to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during the  transition period, the report proposed that the above-mentioned  China policy ""should not be formulated rigidly,"" which clearly  laid bare Britain's malicious intention to rack its brains and  to seize any opportunity to obstruct the implementation of the  Joint Declaration.    The article ""Our Basic Stand on the Issue of Hong Kong"" and  its annotations, which were published in the ""Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping,"" showed very clearly that the British side would  not return Hong Kong to China willingly. The fact that at that  time, Mrs Thatcher put forward the ""thesis of the validity of  the three unequal treaties"" and the ""thesis of exchanging  sovereignty for administrative authority"" indicated Britain's  holy grail of extending its administration over Hong Kong, but  China warned the British side that if it did not change its  position, China could not but unilaterally announce its own  principles and policies for settling the Hong Kong issue. Only  under this situation did Britain acknowledge that Hong Kong's  sovereignty and administration should completely revert to  China, and did Britain sign the Joint Declaration. However,  Deng Xiaoping foresaw long ago that during the transition  period, it would be mainly the British that created artificial  chaos. It showed that the Chinese side was on the alert long  ago against the likelihood that the British side -- under  various pretexts and by all kinds of tricks -- definitely would  attempt to obstruct China's resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong. The report imputed the reason for  the change in Britain's China policy to the ""Beijing  disturbance"" in 1989, which was absolutely a sophistry. As a  matter of fact, this is the natural instinct of the British  colonialists. International agreements, once signed, should be  implemented, and no signatory should ever flagrantly interfere  in the other party's internal affairs and take the latter's  internal affairs as a pretext for not fulfilling agreements.  The raging tide of cracking down on separatist activities in  Northern Ireland and of mass resistance to the poll tax, as well  as human rights problems, also were seen in Britain, but China  had never made it a pretext for shirking its responsibility to  fulfil the Joint Declaration.    In her memoirs entitled ""The Downing Street Years,"" Mrs.  Thatcher wrote that faced with China's solemn position, the  British side could not but ""indicate that we did not anticipate  there would still be any power linkage between Britain and Hong  Kong, or that Britain would have any obligation in Hong Kong  after 1997. However, I felt sorry about that."" For those who  ""felt sorry about"" the fact that the British side could not but  sign the Joint Declaration, the ""Beijing disturbance"" was a  misfortune over which they gloated, and they harbored the  illusion of a fluke rather than felt ""sorry"" about the  situation, and even did not hesitate to make a reckless move,  which was precisely a manifestation of colonialists unwilling to  retreat from the historical scene. The report attacked Articles  18 and 58 of the Basic Law, barefacedly opposed the fact that  China has sovereignty over Hong Kong, urged the European Union  to draw up anti-China policies, extended support to Patten's  unilateral action in his ""three violations"" political reform  package, and even flagrantly called for meddling in the Tibet  and Taiwan issues. All these attacks are a resurgence of the  die-hard nature of colonialism throughout history.    The report made various viewpoints and suggestions that  were hostile to China, demonstrating that some people in Britain  still try to employ tricks and to handle Sino-British relations  with the gestures of a past century. The extent of the  deficiency in their sense of historical reality and their  inability to keep up with the times is amazing. The report  said: ""From the Opium War on, China has been forced to adapt to  a new order of the international community backed by the  international law, and this process is yet to be completed.""  This remark really hit the nail on the head and fully exposed  Britain's motive in changing its China policy, that is, it wants  to revert to the historical stage, from the Opium War to the  years before 1949, when Britain plundered and split up China.  The new China, however, rejected the so-called ""order"" imposed  by Britain and other powers from the West. Hence, those  die-hard colonialists in Britain yearn for the likelihood that  the Chinese people's regime ""may not last beyond 1997"" and that  the ""process"" of extending British rule over Hong Kong will be  ""completed!""    However, as China grows rich, strong, and prosperous, it is  fully capable of resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong on schedule. Moreover, Britain and other countries from  the West will never be allowed to interfere in China's internal  affairs or to split up its territory. While it has become a  historical trend for every country in the world to develop its  cherished relations with China, the British parliamentary report  attempted to organize an international anti-China coalition to  contain China, split it up, and obstruct it from resuming  sovereignty over Hong Kong. However, all these moves indicated  that they merely overrated their abilities.

But Tong Jiemin, deputy director general for European  affairs  at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation,  suggested that Britain's undesired stance over the Hong Kong  issue could have a crippling effect.    ""Bilateral economic and trade relations can hardly escape  damage from an uncooperative and unfriendly Britain,"" Tong said.    ""That is what China won't like to see.""    International analysts have expressed fears that Britain  could follow the example of France, whose trade with China was  set back by political skirmishes.    Tong declined to make any comment on this speculation.    Instead, he stressed that trade between China and Britain  has  grown over the past two years.    ""We welcome large British enterprises, financial groups and  multi-nationals to come and compete on the Chinese market,"" he  said.    Tong suggested that British firms consider investing in  energy, natural resources, infrastructure and other technical-  and capital- intensive projects.    He stressed that Britain has been an important trading  partner of China, and that each can help meet the other's needs.    China mainly buys equipment systems, machinery, metals,  minerals and petrochemical products from Britain while selling  mostly textiles and garments, ferrous metals and  light-industrial appliances.    Chinese customs figures show that Sino-British trade in the  first 11 months of 1993 reached $3 billion, up 85.6 percent over  the corresponding period in 1992.    In that time, China's exports grew by 109 percent to $1.63  billion, while imports increased 63.7 percent to $1.37 billion.     "

Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, one of Iran's most outspoken clerics, said yesterday parliament should review economic and trade relations with Britain because of its insults to Islam. Speaking at Friday prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Jannati said a meeting last month between Mr Rushdie and Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister at the Foreign Office, was aimed at 'shattering Islam's dignity and opening the way for anyone to insult Moslem sanctities'. He added that it was a tactic aimed at forcing Iran to submit to Britain's wishes. Britain has recently stepped up its demands that Iran should withdraw the religious ruling, or fatwa, passed by the late Ayatollah Khomeini which calls on Moslems to kill Mr Rushdie for sentiments expressed in his book The Satanic Verses. Ayatollah Jannati said yesterday it was a divine ruling which 'sooner or later, would be carried out'. He added that trade with Britain could be replaced by dealing with other countries. 'Whatever we buy from Britain can very easily be bought elsewhere,' he said. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is expected to meet Mr Rushdie within the next few weeks to underline the government's insistence that the fatwa has to be withdrawn before diplomatic relations between the two countries can improve.

The report is a self-confession of how the British  side ruined Sino-British cooperation. It is also excellent  teaching material for Hong Kong compatriots to know the nature  of British colonialists.    The report affirms and supports Chris Patten's  confrontational policy and provocative methods of pursuing  political reform in Hong Kong and states that the British side  will act unilaterally in the remaining years of the transition  period. This clearly announces that in the next three years,  Britain will not converge with the Basic Law or devote itself to  a smooth transition, but will continue to proceed on the path of  the ""three violations,"" set up illegitimate organizations (such  as a human rights commission) and various other obstacles to the  composition of the special administrative region and the smooth  implementation of the Basic Law, impose on the special  administrative region groups of people chosen by Britain and new  laws and a new political system unilaterally formulated, and  challenge China in the resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty. Reinforcing this line of confronting China to the  end is now intended to win support from parliament. It is also  intended to reduce domestic pressure on the Major  administration, whose performance has been unceasingly  criticized and which is heading toward a dead end, and shift the  attention of the British people. The British administration  thinks that by holding a confrontational attitude and adopting a  stance of protecting British interests, it will immediately show  an image of ""being able to accomplish something"" and will arouse  the nationalist feelings of the British people.    On the contrary, this only has exposed its weaknesses.  First, this has exposed the fact that the British  administration does not have powers of political analysis and  will only continue to forfeit Britain's long-term interests in  the Far East and forfeit the opportunity to develop Sino-British  cooperation and develop British economic and trade interests.    Second, it has exposed the administration's empty show of  strength. The less strength it has, the more it wants to take  risks. The outcome will be that its strength and timing will be  at a disadvantage in the competition and it will surely fail.  The report encourages unilaterally setting up the three-tier  councils and pursuing Patten's proposals, while admitting that  the British can do nothing to prevent China overturning his  proposals and reorganizing the three-tier councils in accordance  with the Basic Law.    Third, it has exposed the fact that Britain's international  card has failed everywhere and can no longer create the  scenario. Britain is attempting to organize ""allied forces"" and  launch a crusade on the Hong Kong issue. It has proposed that  the European Union formulate a common policy to deal with China;  used ""human rights"" and ""democracy"" as weapons in relation to  loans, aid, and trade agreements with China; issued threats; and  supported its stand on Hong Kong. But the international  situation is that, on the question of joining the EU, Britain  has been isolated from the European continent. At first, it  appeared tough on relations with other European countries.  Later, when none of its allies conformed, it drifted to their  side like a deflated balloon. Its allies do not care about its  complaints, and it simply does not have much influence in the  EU. The fact that Britain played the ""international card"" in  Europe by asking its allies to follow its policies toward China  and Hong Kong is just ridiculous now that it has not correctly  assessed its own strength and does not know its limitations at  all. France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Finland,  and Luxembourg are all busy developing relations with China,  doing a lot of business, and seizing markets. Moreover,  Portugal, taking a different path from Britain, is successfully  implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and  negotiating cooperation. Now, Britain is asking for help from  its allies, but who is going to listen?    The British perhaps still cherish hopes about the  ""international card,"" so the report on Sino-British relations  once again put forward plans and proposals in hope of success.  This is a signal and Hong Kong people had better heighten their  vigilance on the British Hong Kong authorities'  internationalization scheme.    The report does not take the facts into account when it  links  Sino-British relations, which are now at a low ebb, with ""human  rights obstacles."" Of the Western countries, Britain was the  first to recognize China, but did it ever consider ""human rights  obstacles then?"" Why were there no ""human rights obstacles"" in  the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, when Britain maintained  good relations with China? It was not until Patten began to  pursue a confrontational line when he arrived in Hong Kong that  Sino-British relations worsened. The report, however, did not  mention these facts but shirked responsibility, so how can it  serve its purpose?    The fact that the report attacks Article 18 and Article 158  of the Basic Law precisely shows that the current low ebb of  Sino-British relations is caused by Britain's incorrect policy  on Hong Kong. Britain signed the Joint Declaration and promised  that Hong Kong would be returned to China and that China would  resume exercising sovereignty in 1997. But it is unwilling to  do so and is using tricky plans to prevent China from exercising  sovereignty over Hong Kong. Everyone on the street knows that  Britain is opposed to and is preventing China from stationing  troops in Hong Kong after 1997. Now, it is attacking China for  having the right to proclaim a state of war preparedness in Hong  Kong if it is invaded by a foreign enemy and if national unity  is endangered and has attacked China's NPC Standing Committee  for having the right to interpret the Basic Law. This has fully  exposed Britain's ambition of opposing China's possession of  sovereignty over Hong Kong in ways conducive to the extension of  its concession-style rule. This ""country within a country"" only  appeared in the former Shanghai concessions where the central  government could not station troops, could not interpret or use  Chinese laws, and did not have the right to defend its territory  and deal with riots, and such rights are possessed by all  countries. Only those in Britain who wish to throw Hong Kong  into confusion and who shield troublemakers would put forward  such absurd demands.    The report is very frank about telling us the intentions  which Britain has never told before. Now, Hong Kong people who  love the country and who love Hong Kong can see more clearly and  know more clearly what dangerous factors have to be removed in  order to guarantee a smooth transition and guarantee Hong Kong's  long-term prosperity and stability.

The deadline has angered Chinese officials who said they  would not tolerate any suggestion of a British ultimatum. ""We  think we have been too lenient towards all sorts of British  requirements in this regard,"" a mainland official said last  night. ""In principle, Britain should hand over all the sites to  us.""    British sources said that unless an accord was endorsed by  the next full meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  [JLG], likely to be held by the end of this month, many of the  military facilities to be built for the People's Liberation Army  would not be completed by 1997. There are fears that without an  agreement on the military land, construction projects, in  particular the Central-Wan Chai reclamation, might have to be  put on hold.    Britain is aiming for a settlement before the Legislative  Council's summer recess next month. Officials say this is  dictated by ""practical considerations"", such as the finance  committee having to approve any funds required to build a new  naval base for China. Negotiations are scheduled to start this  week between experts from China and Britain. Talks have been  under way for seven years.    A party of Chinese experts arrived in the territory last  night to prepare for the meeting expected to be held this  afternoon at the venue for the JLG meetings. The dozen  delegates will hold a meeting this morning to discuss whether  there is a need to meet their British counterparts this  afternoon.    A British JLG official refused to confirm the meeting but  said informal contacts between the two countries had been going  on.    An agreement seemed likely last month but the British said  China changed its position by making further demands. China, in  turn, has accused Britain of playing ""propaganda tricks"".    ""Nothing was settled after last month's meeting,"" a Chinese  official said. ""We have never given Britain a definite yes to  their offer. We only said we needed to report back to a higher  authority. Then, when we finally responded to the British, they  said we were making new demands. What a trick. They probably  just want us to accept whatever is on the list. As to which  sites and how many of them should be passed to the Hong Kong  government for redevelopment, it is purely a matter between the  People's Liberation Army [PLA] and Hong Kong's future  government. Look at how many sites the British army has  occupied and look at how many the Chinese PLA will be able to  get.""    He complained that Britain was willing to give China only 30  per cent of the residential blocks available. ""This is also  despite the fact that all expenditure for the PLA garrison to be  stationed in Hong Kong will be borne by the Chinese Government,""  he said.    He then criticised Britain for making public some unresolved  matters in a bid to create a false impression that the two  countries were close to a deal.    It is already known that the PLA will take over The Prince  of  Wales Building and the land to the west of it but Britain needs  agreement from China to redevelop the naval base which forms  part of the reclamation project.    China was furious when the government unilaterally announced  that it was relocating the British naval base to Stonecutters  Island.    It would be almost impossible to persuade private developers  to build on the site, even if it was filled in, without an  agreement with Beijing.    In all, it is estimated the Government would stand to lose  more than $1bn from the military sites it is hoping to sell off.     "

It seems that  Britain focuses more attention on its long-term interests than  on its long-term allies. So it is no coincidence that mutual  interests have brought Britain and Azerbaijan closer.  Considering requirements earlier this century, British  officials have turned to Azerbaijan again, never mind that 70  years have passed since the last time. Several officials have  linked that with Britain's bid for Baku's oil. But Britain,  which has established links with the Caucasus as one of the most  developed countries, maintains more serious objectives, which  will serve stability in the region.    Of course, all that will be widely discussed in the  high-level talks between Britain and Azerbaijan in London.  Undoubtedly, President Geydar Aliyev and Prime Minister John  Major will deliberate on the dispute between Azerbaijan and  Armenia and try to establish a way to remove the dispute.  Britain's position on it is common knowledge. After Turkey, it  was the second country to establish its final approach to the  Karabakh dispute. And it did that long ago. Perhaps that is  why President Ter-Petrosyan left Britain with empty hands at the  end of his visit there 10 days ago. He visited Britain with a  great deal of hope.    But malicious circles in Azerbaijan have described President  Aliyev's visit as an effort to seek Western support. They have  made unreasonable and wrong statements in that regard. There is  nothing in Azerbaijan's cooperation with Britain to harm the  interests of third countries. Naturally, Azerbaijan also wishes  to cooperate with France, Germany, Russia, and several other  countries. Everyone knows that those countries have adopted a  [word indistinct] approach to Azerbaijan's sincere wish to  cooperate with them.    The bilateral agreements that will be signed during  President  Aliyev's visit to London will further consolidate the legal and  political basis of bilateral relations. Consequently, our  relations will become more productive. The cooperation with  Britain, which is a leading country in modern technology in  industry and agriculture, will create an opportunity for  Azerbaijan to reorganize its industry somewhat.    And President Aliyev's visit may lead to surprising and  favorable developments. Naturally, all that will create a new  opportunity for Azerbaijan to improve its cooperation with  Western countries.     "
0,FT922-9016 ,"FT922-9016 _AN-CEIBCADNFT 920509   FT  09 MAY 92 / Albania and UK resolve war disputes      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   ONE of the last major diplomatic and legal disputes arising out of the Second World War was resolved yesterday at the British embassy in Rome. At a low-key ceremony, Albanian and British officials agreed to bury all outstanding differences caused by the 'Corfu Channel incident', when, in 1946, two British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines while exercising their rights passing through the Corfu Channel. One destroyer was sunk with the loss of 44 lives. The other was holed and had to be scuttled. In retaliation Britain broke off diplomatic relations and withheld gold claimed by Albania. The gold had been seized by the Nazis in their occupation of Europe and was found by the allies at the end of the war in caves in southern Germany. It was impounded and subsequently administered by a tripartite commission of Britain, France and the US being used to settle numerous state and private post-war claims. Britain took the Corfu Channel incident to the International Court of Justice at the Hague which ruled in 1948 that the Albanian government pay Pounds 843,947 compensation. The communist government in Tirana never recognised the decision and with the isolationism of the regime of Enver Hoxha a dialogue was impossible. The first tentative contacts began only seven years ago. Yesterday's agreement involved Britain undertaking to hand over some 1,574kg of gold to Albania as the latter's share held by Britain in the tripartite commission. In return, Britain will receive Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.1m) from Albania in settlement of all outstanding claims. It is doubtful whether any money or gold will change hands. Britain accepted the impossibility of Albania paying the accumulated value of the court judgment, and the democratically-elected government of President Sali Berisha refrained from pressing for payment of the current value of the gold. Britain established diplomatic relations last year but the agreement smoothes the way for increased bilateral assistance from the UK. The agreement requires formal approval from France and the US.

John Major told 1,000 businessmen in New York: ""What we are  working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for  the 21st century.""    He used a key speech to the British-American Chamber of  Commerce to stress that the UK was emerging from recession  faster and more strongly than any other leading country in  Europe.    During the address, the culmination of Mr. Major's three-day  trip to the US, he also:     -  Pledged to go ahead with the  ""three strand"" talks on Northern Ireland, despite the rebuff he  has suffered from the Ulster Unionists;    -  Announced he hoped the  GATT world trade deal could be implemented on January 1, 1995 --  six months ahead of the original plan.    Mr. Major said: ""Britain has changed out of all recognition  in the past 15 years and is changing again in the 1990s.""    He told his audience: ""Like you, we have just come through a  recession. It was painful, but we have come out stronger than  before.    ``This past year, Britain's economy has been growing twice  as  fast as forecast. And this coming year we are again expecting  the fastest growth rate among main European countries.''    However, Mr. Major stressed that more change was needed for  Britain to sharpen its competitive edge.    ""That is why we are embarked on a fundamental review of all  the factors affecting our ability to succeed in the global  marketplace. Competitiveness is the key challenge for the 1990s  -- and it is one the British welcome.""    The Prime Minister pledged: ""What we are working for is  nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st  century.""    He said added that it was not just industry that must  innovate, but government as well.    ""The days of monolithic government are over. The governments  that will help their countries to be competitive will do less  but do it better. All our government departments have been told  to roll back the burden of regulation.    ``There is one British produce I want to see less of -- our  famous red tape.''    Mr. Major said Britain and America were now driving through  the historic GATT trade deal.    He and President Clinton had agreed they should set an early  target for tariff cuts to be implemented -- January 1, 1995 --  but other countries had to be consulted before this could become  a reality.    Mr. Major also stressed that Britain was the ideal base for  operations in Europe, saying: ""It is no accident that nearly 40  percent of all U.S. investment in Europe comes to Britain. We  intend to keep it that way.""    He claimed that much of Europe was over-regulated, something  which cost jobs and added to the burdens carried by employers.    On Bosnia, the Prime Minister said he and President Clinton  had agreed that Britain and the U.S. would take joint action to  build on the Sarajevo ceasefire.    ""We are sending a joint British-American planning mission to  see how we can help restore public utilities there.""    He said they both believed in firm action to enforce the  no-fly zone and that Britain was supporting the American-led  diplomatic initiative to seek agreement between Bosnia's Croats  and Muslims.    On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister spoke of the  overwhelming support the Downing Street Declaration had  received, highlighting the BBC poll showing over 90 percent of  people throughout the island of Ireland wanted Sinn Fein to  renounce violence.    ""Yet they continue to hold back from the peace process and  perpetuate violence. There have been 17 attacks on the security  forces since the declaration.""    The Prime Minister said he hoped Sinn Fein could yet be  persuaded to change.    ""I believe that strong support for peace coming from America  can play a part in this. In the meantime, the British and Irish  Governments will continue to work with the constitutional  parties for a lasting political settlement.""     "

0,FT944-9067 ,"FT944-9067 _AN-EKQEIACGFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / EU officials angered as retraining aid is shunned      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   Britain risks losing European Union aid worth up to Ecu674m (Pounds 525m), intended to retrain workers in frontline industries, because it is refusing to apply for it, the European Commission confirmed yesterday. Senior commission officials warned that the UK would not be allowed to 'opt out' of this policy, which is intended to lift EU competitiveness. The aid Britain risks fore - going comes under Objective 4 of the European Social Fund. This policy, agreed by all member states last year, is designed to boost the skills of workers in industries being restructured. Social Fund money was previously aimed exclusively at young and long-term unemployed, while Objective 4 targets workers in threatened industries in order to prevent them becoming unemployed. The UK regards this switch as part of a French-inspired commission effort to build up an industrial policy by subterfuge, and wants to be allowed to spend all Social Fund money on the jobless. The commission yesterday agreed on a share-out of Objective 4 funds for the UK's partners, but confirmed that it was 'holding in reserve' finance for which Britain had submitted no programme. Britain is entitled to a total of Ecu3.37bn under the Social Fund up to 1999. Under the formula about 80 per cent of this would go to training the unemployed, and 20 per cent to Objective 4 - about Ecu674m in the UK's case. The UK has asked for 95 per cent of its full Social Fund entitlement between this year and 1996 - the first half of the scheme - but purely for funding training for the jobless and ignoring Objective 4. Brussels has allowed this through, while withholding the remaining 5 per cent, worth Ecu80m. The commission is insisting that the UK redress the balance towards the Objective 4 programme in the second half of the scheme. Brussels officials say they are prepared to be flexible, allowing Britain to spend perhaps no more than 10 per cent of its Social Fund grant on retraining employed workers. But Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs commissioner, made clear yesterday that all member states should implement Objective 4. Mr Flynn would not spell out publicly the consequences for Britain if it continued to boycott the retraining policy, beyond stressing that 'we have no indication we are going to get a programme from the UK' to take up its Objective 4 entitlements. Britain has traditionally got the biggest single share of the EU Social Fund. Between 1989 and last year it received Ecu2bn out of the Ecu7.4bn total. Its full entitlement of nearly Ecu3.4bn in 1994-99 compares with a total of Ecu14bn parcelled out to all member states.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

After the talks broke down as a result of side issues  that Britain created, Chris Patten brazenly submitted to the  Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] his ""political reform  bill,"" which goes against the three principles [adherence to the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, convergence with the Basic Law  of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),  and the observance of the agreements and understanding reached  by China and Britain]. According to the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law, Britain's administration in Hong  Kong will end on 30 June 1997, the political framework of the  British Hong Kong Government will also terminate at that time,  and the three-tiered frameworks created in the 1994-95 elections  will also be dissolved. This is inevitable for China to  reexercise its sovereignty over Hong Kong and bring the British  rule there to an end, and it will be an important step that  China will take to execute the Sino-British Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law and to carry out the ""one country, two  systems"" principle.    Hong Kong's three-tiered political structure made up by its  district boards and two municipal councils as well as by the  Legco is a major issue relevant to Hong Kong's smooth transition  in 1997. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, during  Hong Kong's latter transitional period, all measures taken to  ensure its smooth transition in 1997 should be examined and  discussed by China and Britain. However, refusing to consult  China on this major issue, Britain incessantly schemed to ""make  transitional arrangements on its own"" in an attempt to keep  China out from participating in transitional affairs. This move  itself has violated the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law. If Hong Kong's three- tiered framework should end on  30 June 1997, China cannot be totally uninvolved with the issue;  but because there is the issue of the transition of members of  the three-tiered council to the post-1997 period, China and  Britain have held 17 rounds of talks on the 1994- 95 elections  in Hong Kong. Now that Britain has undermined the talks and  there is no through train to speak off, the three-tiered  framework has to be overturned and rebuilt. This is to say that  the three-tiered framework of the British Hong Kong Government  will end on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will  rebuild the political framework of the HKSAR in accordance with  the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National  People's Congress on 1 July 1997.    The British side has been hoping that by forming a group  during the 1994-95 election, the new HKSAR Government in 1997  would have no other choice but to swallow the bitter fruit  created by Britain so that people acceptable to Britain can  continue to control the future HKSAR Government and Legco, and  Britain's ruling power can continue in Hong Kong. Now they are  infuriated, knowing that their wishful thinking is just an  illusion. So they have counterattacked, claiming that ""the  Basic Law will be violated if the tenure of the three-tiered  council members cannot straddle 1997,"" and that ""China has  expanded the kitchen"" and ""threatened members of the  three-tiered council."" But like the proverbial donkey in  ancient Guizhou, it has exhausted its tricks. The outcome has  gone against its wishes, the life of colonialism will soon end,  and Britain will eventually gain nothing in this respect.    When Britain's ruling power in Hong Kong terminates on 30  June 1997, all the political structures of the British Hong Kong  Government there, including the Legco, the district boards, and  the municipal councils, will have to wither away on their own on  1 July 1997. Britain will have no right whatsoever to meddle in  our business and make unilateral arrangements for Hong Kong's  political structure after 1997.    The Basic Law has embodied the sovereignty which China will  reexercise over Hong Kong, and when China does what has been  prescribed in the Basic Law, it simply is not ""expanding the  kitchen"" as certain people have clamored in saying. As for the  claim that China has ""threatened members of the three-tiered  council,"" that is even more absurd. Even if China and Britain  have reached an agreement through consultations, whether members  of the Hong Kong Legco can go on to become Legco members of the  HKSAR after 1997 will still have to be confirmed by the  Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. Because Britain has  refused to cooperate with China and has acted on its own, it is  totally justified that the three- tiered structure and the term  of the council members must be discontinued after 1997.    We must say that because the Basic Law embodies and codifies  the ""one country, two systems"" principle into law, abolishing  all laws which contravene the Basic Law and all organs created  by these laws is an act which firmly safeguards the Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law as well as the principles  governing ""one country, two systems,"" ""the administration of  Hong Kong by Hong Kong people,"" and the ""high degree of  autonomy."" Any mudslinging, attack, rumormongering, or  distortion cannot stop the Britain's colonial rule from  collapsing and the political doom of the pro-British and  anti-China elements.    ""One thousand sails are passing by the sunken ship, and  10,000 trees are sprouting in front of the sick wood."" The day  when China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong will be  the time when the principle of ""one country, two systems"" will  be formally carried out. One important requirement is that we  must make genuine efforts to safeguard China's national  sovereignty and territorial integrity so that this principle can  be implemented in Hong Kong. This is a responsibility that  cannot be shirked by any Chinese countrymen. Acting as the  masters of their own country, all Hong Kong citizens who are  patriotic and who love Hong Kong will be concerned with Hong  Kong's smooth transition, they will actively participate in all  preparations for the transfer of political power in 1997, and,  with a new spiritual outlook, they will also greet the day when  China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong.

Stress tea parties rather than castles if you want to attract the Japanese. And do not mention Britain to the Irish. Urge them to come to England, Wales or Scotland instead. The conclusions were reached by the British Tourist Authority, which has been conducting market research into how to reverse the fall in the UK's share of world tourism. Although a record 19.2m foreign visitors came to the UK last year, Britain's share of world tourism earnings fell from 6.7 per cent in 1980 to 4.3 per cent last year. Researchers interviewed people in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York to find out whether the authority should change its US projection of the UK to that of a modern society rather than one steeped in history. The answer was a categorical 'no'. Americans told researchers that Britain conjured up images of bobbies, barristers, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey - and they wanted it to stay that way. Americans also said they found the British 'friendly but proper'. One said he found the prospect of visiting the UK 'daunting' as he would have to be on his best behaviour. Research in Japan found that Britain's image was too masculine, making it difficult to attract more Japanese women travellers. Mr Keith Beecham, manager of the authority's Tokyo office, said the BTA was concentrating on afternoon tea when selling Britain to the Japanese. He said: 'The Japanese tend to associate Britain with heroic, masculine castles. Our campaign is designed to create a softer and more feminine feel  -quaint country house hotels, green landscapes and Laura Ashley. Afternoon tea is the ideal vehicle.' The authority placed a two-page advertisement in a Japanese newspaper inviting people to buy tickets to a British tea party. It received 18,000 replies. A survey in Ireland detected unsympathetic responses to the notion of Britain. When asked about England, Scotland or Wales, the answers were far warmer, so advertising was changed.

He rejected a request from 33 members of Congress  that he try to block the Thorp plant in Cumbria but told them  the continued production of plutonium was not justified.    Britain defied international public opinion yesterday by  refusing to support a worldwide ban on dumping nuclear waste in  the sea.    The decision to abstain, also taken by France, Belgium,  China  and Russia, came at a meeting of the International Maritime  Organisation, a UN body based in London.    Britain could now resume dumping radioactive material at any  time.    Officials at the agriculture department, which spearheaded  the government's stance, insisted there were no immediate plans  to resume dumping defunct nuclear submarine reactors or waste  from power stations, hospitals and research laboratories.  However, they said they wanted to keep open such options.    Ministers at the defence, environment and agriculture  departments now have 100 days in which formally to reject the  ban, otherwise they will be automatically bound by the majority  decision, despite abstaining.    More countries could join the boycott. About 30 signatory  nations ignored the meeting and, like Britain, can register  their opposition within 100 days.    Last night there was every sign that Britain is prepared to  defy the agreement. While a spokesperson for the agriculture  department said: ""We will now carefully consider our response,""  official sources said the government's position remained the  same: Britain argues there are good scientific reasons for  having the option to resume nuclear dumping at sea rather than  keeping it on land, particularly for bulky items such as pieces  of submarines.    Critics claim radioactive substances in the sea respect no  territorial boundaries and that monitoring and retrieving leaky  containers is significantly more difficult from oceans than from  land-based stores.    Yesterday's vote, supported by 37 members of the  International Maritime Organisation, including America and  Japan, replaces a ten-year voluntary ban that was broken by  Russia recently when it dumped radioactive wastes off Japan.    Before the voluntary ban, Britain had dumped about 74,000  tonnes of low and intermediate level waste at 15 locations.  Currently, Britain has six radiation contaminated submarines  awaiting disposal at naval dockyards.    Russia said earlier in the week that it could not support a  ban at the moment as it had no other option for dealing with its  radioactive wastes from its fleet of nuclear submarines.    Dick Trump, a Dutch official who chaired the meeting, said  yesterday: ""I would have been much happier if we would have  adopted the resolution unanimously.""    ""We will have to look to the future,"" he said, referring to  the 100-day response time.    Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group whose lobbying  in the early 1980s led to the preliminary ten-year voluntary  ban, initially reacted with delight to the vote.    As it became clear that several key nuclear powers might  ignore the ban, Remi Parmentier, an adviser in the political  division, said: ""It would be a public outrage if France, the UK,  Russia and Belgium filed a declaration of non-acceptance. It is  about time these governments realised that no one wants to see  the oceans become a radioactive waste garbage site. It is about  time they joined the ranks. The oceans belong to everyone, not  Her Majesty's government or the French Republic.""    COPYRIGHT: TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1993     "

The Ford parent company has been forced to pump in Pounds 330m in new equity to shore up the balance sheet of the UK subsidiary in the face of continuing heavy losses. The UK operation was hit last year by a further decline in car sales, forced production cuts, and heavy marketing and restructuring costs as well as exchange rate losses of about Pounds 100m. The company remained in loss in the first quarter of this year and it warned yesterday that it was uncertain whether it would return to profit in 1993. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman since January 1 last year, has been forced to take a sharp cut in pay compared with his predecessor. He earned Pounds 94,129 last year according to the Ford of Britain annual report published yesterday. Mr Derek Barron, his predecessor earned Pounds 158,454 in 1991 and Pounds 214,086 in 1990. Ford of Britain's board has been streamlined and cut from 10 to six members. The outlook for a return to profit in 1993 has deteriorated in the face of the steep decline in new vehicle demand in continental Europe in the first four months this year, Mr Bill Brooks, finance director said yesterday. About 41 per cent of vehicles from Ford's UK assembly plants were exported last year. Ford of Britain still expected to achieve a substantial financial improvement this year after two years of heavy losses, Mr Brooks said. The parent company's injection of Pounds 330m in new equity into Ford of Britain last year follows its provision of Pounds 390m of new capital in 1991 - Pounds 100m in new equity and Pounds 290m through the transfer, at an inflated price, of the ownership of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, from Ford of Britain direct to the US parent. Ford of Britain made losses of Pounds 935m in 1991 and Pounds 274m in 1990 however these were heavily influenced by losses from Jaguar. Excluding these, Ford of Britain incurred a loss of Pounds 487m in 1991 and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 61m in 1990, on a comparable basis with last year's pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m. This figure included a Pounds 68m restructuring charge for redundancies. Details, Page 25   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-13703 ,"FT941-13703 _AN-EAYDAAIWFT 940124   FT  24 JAN 94 / Investment in Britain rises tenfold      By NIKKI TAIT      SYDNEY   Australian investment in Britain has risen more than tenfold, to almost ADollars 16bn (Dollars 11bn) since Australia lifted exchange controls a decade ago. This makes Britain the biggest single offshore home for Australian investment. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, 'Australia sends about 35 per cent of its offshore direct investment to Britain, which is eight times more than could be expected from the size of the UK economy.' Australia is the fourth largest overseas investor in the UK. The report also finds Britain is the second largest investor in Australia, although only 7 per cent of its offshore direct investment goes in this direction. The strength of investment ties is surprising, given the shift in Australian trade flows towards Asia and Britain's, toward Europe. Around 60 per cent of Australia's trade is now conducted with Asia, while around 56 per cent of British exports go to the European Union countries. The report points out that the wave of Australian investment in Britain over the past decade is largely accounted for by 16 companies - among them, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which owns the Pearl and London Life insurance companies, and Foster's, the brewing company which takes in Courage. But it contradicts the widespread impression that much of this investment took place occured in the mid- to late-1980s, when the last wave of Australian entrepreneurs was at full power. The report says some ADollars 6.5bn was invested over the past five years, and cites a number of companies  -such as Amcor, the paper and packaging group - which has made an initial investment in the UK, as the first step to a European operation. The report suggests a range of reasons for Australia's investment interest in the UK, including cultural, regulatory and language similarities, and the opportunity for expansion into other European markets.

The ""action Japan"" program is aimed at creating a  partnership  between Japan and Britain both at the governmental and private-  sector levels to make British products more competitive not only  in Japan but in global markets, British Trade and Industry  Minister Richard Needham said at a news conference in Tokyo.    The British Government has selected 10 industrial sectors  with the most growth potential as focusing areas under the  export campaign, Needham said.    He said the program will center on trade missions, trade  fairs, seminars and marketing research, all to be conducted  jointly with the Japan External Trade Organization.    The 10 designated sectors are health care, auto parts,  marine  equipment, power generation equipment, construction, giant  global projects, electronic components, environmental equipment  and services, food and beverages, and lifestyle-related areas  such as clothing, textiles and retailing.    Britain wants to expand Japanese-bound exports to 3.5  billion  pounds a year from the current 2.6 billion pounds within two or  three years, Needham said.    As a way to create larger business opportunities for British  firms, needham stressed the need for the Japanese Government to  ease its control on rules and regulations.    Needham said he recently presented to the Japanese  Government  a list of industrial sectors where Britain wants to see  deregulation.    The sectors are financial services, legal services,  telecommunications, oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, liquors,  food and beverages, autos and marine equipment, the trade  minister said.    It is necessary for British firms to compete with Japanese  counterparts ""on a level playing field,"" Needham said.    Needham is visiting Japan as part of an export-promoting  tour  of five Pacific rim countries.    ""Action Japan"" is the third program of its kind that Britain  has formulated, following ""opportunity Japan"" in 1988 and  ""priority Japan"" in 1991.     "

The department said the agreement settled a long dispute over fees at the airport between 1983 and 1989. It said Britain had agreed to change the charging system at Heathrow to make it fairer to US carriers. The settlement was reached after an international arbitration panel ruled that Britain had failed to use its best efforts to ensure that charges at Heathrow were just and reasonable. It concludes years of negotiations and litigation. Britain also agreed to drop claims it had filed against the US over charges at US airports.

While dealing with the right of permanent abode in Hong  Kong,  an issue of concern for Chinese residing in Britain and  Sino-British trade in an interview with reporters here today, Ma  Yuzhen said that on the right of abode in Hong Kong of those  Chinese who have already acquired foreign passports and Chinese  living overseas as well in the second generation, the Chinese  authorities were studying the question according to the Basic  Law; it was believed that the matter would certainly be  appropriately resolved in due time; Chinese friends had no need  to worry about it.    Earlier, some individual responsible person of a Chinese  organization aired his view involving the right of abode in Hong  Kong in the future of former Hong Kong residents now residing in  Britain, and was ready to reflect their anxieties to the Chinese  Embassy in Britain. Regarding this, Ma Yuzhen said: ""Chinese  compatriots and friends are welcomed to actively relay their  opinions to the Chinese Embassy; the matter is now under the  study of the Chinese Government. Our compatriots may rest at  ease; at the same time, we hope that our compatriots will guard  against some people sowing discord at this moment.""    Ma Yuzhen explained: ""On the Hong Kong issue, the British  Government has pursued a plan for Hong Kong residents' right of  abode in Britain, which the Chinese Government is against;  however, the Chinese Government will not oppose or target those  people who have already acquired the right of abode in Britain;  furthermore, convenience will be allowed people in this category  regarding their right of abode in Hong Kong; as to specific  conditions, they are under study at present.""    He also talked about the contributions Chinese residing in  Britain make to the British economy and Sino-British trade and  the understanding of the anxieties of Chinese capital in Britain  over the effects of the Hong Kong issue on Sino-British trade.    While reiterating the Chinese Government's view on the  issue,  Ma Yuzhen said that because Britain had adopted a  non-cooperative attitude, effects on other arenas in  Sino-British relations would be inevitable. ""Although  subjectively, we do not wish to see such circumstances, there is  nothing we could do about it. The responsibility does not rest  with us; objective conditions and subjective wishes are two  different kettles of fish."" Ma Yuzhen said the above was what  he told some British friends of the business circles of the  British Industrial Association.    He criticized Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's attitude  toward Sino-British trade relations in his appearance at the  hearing of the British Foreign Affairs group yesterday; it was  unwise for Patten to have deliberately linked it to the issue of  China applying for restoral of GATT membership.    At the hearing yesterday, Chris Patten said that he did not  believe that China would resist Sino-British trade because of  the Hong Kong issue on the grounds that China was applying for  the restoration of its GATT membership. ""Restoring China's  position in GATT will be helpful to China as well as the whole  international community; should an attitude of obstruction be  adopted, that would be unwise, nor would it be helpful to  Britain,"" Ma Yuzhen concluded.

Relations between the two countries now stand at their lowest  ebb following Britain's protest to Iran for allegedly supplying  the Provisional IRA with cash or arms.    Tehran formally denied that and hit back today with new  allegations claiming that Britain was sheltering terrorist  organisations working against the Iranian Government. The  Tehran Times said that Britain had no right to question Iran's  adherence to international conventions against aiding  terrorists. ""Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead  ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian  groups they harbour in the West,"" the newspaper said.    But a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""The Government denies  any contact of any kind with the Mojahedin-e Khalq group.  Opposition groups from any country are free to operate in the  United Kingdom within the law. If they break the law they will  be prosecuted. If the Iranian have evidence of illegal activity  they should let us have sight of it.""    Earlier this week, Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas  Hogg summoned the Iran charge d'affaires Gholam Reza Ansari to  give him a dressing down about Iran's alleged involvmenet with  the Provisional IRA. Afterwards, Iran flatly denied this  allegation, although Britain remains convinced that there were  such links.    The paper says that the British protest about the IRA was ""a  smokescreen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian  terrorists are providing material and personnel to the  Iraq-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic  republic.""    Britain's relations with Iran have been in a state of  turbulence ever since the late Ayatollah Khomeyni passed  sentence of death (a ""fatwa"") on author Salman Rushdie in 1989  for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses.

The Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] today passed the  first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election  arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will also submit the  second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for discussion.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that last December,  before the Chinese and the British sides had reached any  agreement on the district board election arrangements, the  British side submitted the first-phase draft of legislation to  the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus directly causing the  termination of the talks between China and Britain.    Now, in disregard of repeated dissuasion by China, and the  aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong for a  settlement of the question concerning the 1994-1995 election  arrangements through negotiations, the British side has had the  first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election  arrangements passed by the Hong Kong Legco and also decided to  submit the second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for  discussion.    The spokesman said: ""This fully shows that the British side  does not have sincerity to solve the question through  cooperation with the Chinese side, and is bent on moving further  on this erroneous path.    ""The door of negotiation has been closed by the British  side,"" he said.    ""The responsibility for the disruption of cooperation  between  China and Britain on Hong Kong's political system rests entirely  with the British side,"" he said.    He noted that the Chinese side reiterates that without an  agreement between China and Britain, the framework of the  three-tiered political system established through British Hong  Kong authorities legislation cannot last beyond June 30, 1997.    The British side today published a white paper to disclose  the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks.    An understanding not to disclose to the public the contents  of the negotiations was reached between China and Britain before  the talks began last year, he said.    Today's act by Britain ""is against the understanding,"" he  said. ""The Chinese side cannot but make due reactions,"" he added.    Asked about Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, in a  recent TV interview in Australia, expressing strong support for  the political package of Chris Patten, the spokesman said that  what was now at issue between China and Britain on Hong Kong ""is  not whether Hong Kong should have democracy, but whether  commitment is to be honored.""    He said that there were a series of agreements and  understandings between the two countries on the evolution of  Hong Kong's political system. ""But the British side is now  trying to repudiate them and have its own way. This is  absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side,"" he said.    ""In the more than one hundred years during the British rule,  there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""It  is with ulterior motives that Britain pushes a Chris Patten  package in Hong Kong before it leaves. It will be futile to  defend the package.    ""The maintenance of Hong Kong's social stability and  economic  prosperity is not only in the interests of China and Britain,  but also of those countries that have economic interests in Hong  Kong,"" he said.    ""The question of Hong Kong is a matter between China and  Britain before June 30, 1997, and from July 1, 1997, it will be  purely an internal affair of China,"" he said. ""It is  inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on the political  affairs of Hong Kong.""     "

The warning followed one by Sir Leon Brittan, Britain's senior EC Commissioner, that Britain would become a less attractive place for new investment by countries outside the EC if it was seen to be a reluctant member of the EC. Mr Lang told a gathering of leading Scots at Gleneagles, Tayside, that if Britain failed to ratify Maastricht it would 'undermine the confidence in us of those partners with whom we do so much business. That would damage our reputation beyond repair'. Mr Lang said failure to ratify the treaty would hurt the export-led Scottish economy particularly badly and 'cost tens of thousands of Scottish jobs'. Both men were addressing the international forum of the Scottish Council Development and Industry, an annual conference of 200 of the most prominent people in Scotland. A substantial majority of those present appeared to be in favour of Maastricht. In an impassioned after-dinner speech on Thursday, Sir Leon urged Britain to ratify the treaty. Companies from the US and Japan that had set up manufacturing plants in Britain to exploit the single European market were asking whether Britain was going to be part of the new Community or was going to be 'cast adrift' in second-class membership. That is a significant worry for Scotland, where about 25 per cent of manufacturing employment is in foreign-owned factories. Britain needed to ratify Maastricht to ensure that the rules of the single market were applied fully, Sir Leon said. That would not happen if Europe was thrown into turmoil because of Britain's failure to ratify the treaty.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

They pointed out: The  facts have amply testified that the Chinese side made tremendous  efforts at the talks. The essence of the Sino-British dispute  is not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong,  but one of whether to act in good faith and whether to converge  with the Basic Law in the three aspects so as to realize a  smooth transition in Hong Kong. In the face of the iron-clad  facts, Britain can hardly shirk its responsibility for the  rupture of the talks.    Fan Xu Litai and Li Zetian, members of the Preliminary  Committee, said: China's publication of the facts concerning  the talks is a good thing which can help the public in Hong Kong  understand the truth. The facts show that during the talks,  China made considerable concessions over the three preconditions  set by Britain, that is, ""lowering the voting age, abolishing  appointed membership, and implementing the system of single  seat, single vote."" China also agreed to the British proposal  concerning elections of the two municipal councils and the  district board. China only requested that discussion of the  single seat, single vote system in the Legislative Council  elections be left to a later stage. However, Britain used this  as a pretext to suspend the talks. This move by Britain shows  that it has no sincerity whatsoever in the talks. Fan Xu Litai  said: It is China's consistent goal to maintain Hong Kong's  smooth transition, prosperity and stability. China had hoped  the talks would be successful; the responsibility for the  breakup of the talks lies with Britain.    Li Liansheng, a deputy to the National People's Congress,  said: Since Britain has unilaterally published the tailored  contents of the talks, it is only natural that China has been  compelled to make a corresponding response by making the facts  public. In so doing, Hong Kong residents can distinguish right  from wrong and will not be misled by the British-orchestrated  public opinion. He added: The British unilateral publication  of the White Paper is an attempt to take the initiative to  misguide Hong Kong residents and make them believe that  responsibility for the rupture of the talks lies with China.  The facts prove that the essence of the Sino-British dispute is  not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong, but  one of whether to abide by the agreements reach between the two  countries. The Chinese and British Governments long ago reached  a series of agreements and understandings concerning the  arrangements for Hong Kong's political system. The unwarranted  dispute has been started by Britain's inconsistency and failure  to honor its commitment.    Hong Kong affairs advisor Chen Wanxian welcomed China's  publication of the details of the talks, and deemed the document  as helpful for Hong Kong residents to draw a fair judgment. She  said: By using the promotion of democracy to cover up its  failure to honor the Sino-British agreements and understandings,  Britain's ultimate objective is to perpetuate its vested  interests in Hong Kong beyond 1997.    Hong Kong affairs advisor Tang Yizhu pointed out: The facts  show that Britain, devoid of sincerity in the talks,  unreasonably brought up at the negotiation table the demand to  discuss issues falling within the scope of China's sovereignty  and manipulated the Hong Kong's Legislative Council to discuss  the ""constitutional reform package."" Obviously Britain wanted  to use the talks to cover up its efforts to peddle the so-called  ""constitutional reform package."" He added: As we understand,  in order to reach agreement with Britain on electoral  arrangements for the district board and the two municipal  councils, China repeatedly made concessions during the talks and  proposed a compromise which took into consideration the stand of  both sides and which would skirt the differences between the two  sides. However, Britain raised obstacles which led to the  rupture of talks.    The Hong Kong Federation for Democratic Construction,  Association of Freedom and Democracy, Liberal Party, Focus,  Association for the Advancement of Democracy and the People's  Life, and many other political parties and social organizations  in Hong Kong also published commentaries, giving a ""big welcome""  to the Chinese publication of the facts concerning the talks. A  few of social organizations believe that the contents released  by China are ""comprehensive,"" while those in the British version  are ""selected and prioritized."" China's move can help the  residents better understand the truth that Britain's  faithlessness led to the failure to reach a Sino-British  agreement on electoral arrangements.    Yang Yaozhong, a representative of the Hong Kong Educators'  Association, said in a commentary: The contents of the details  of the talks released by China can ensure a correct  understanding of the facts. In the face of the facts, Britain  cannot shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks.  In more than a century of colonial rule, Britain has never  promoted democracy in Hong Kong. Now it is holding the banner of  democracy. The essence of this is to maintain Britain's  influence on Hong Kong after 1997.     "

This makes Britain the biggest single offshore home for Australian investment. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, 'Australia sends about 35 per cent of its offshore direct investment to Britain, which is eight times more than could be expected from the size of the UK economy.' Australia is also the fourth largest overseas investor in the UK. The report finds Britain is the second largest investor in Australia, although only 7 per cent of its offshore direct investment goes in this direction. The strength of investment ties is surprising, given the shift in Australian trade flows towards Asia and Britain's, toward Europe. The report points out that the wave of Australian investment in Britain over the past decade is largely accounted for by just 16 companies - among them, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which nows owns the Pearl and London Life insurance companies, and Foster's, the brewing company which takes in Courage.

The Iranian news agency said the Majlis would give Britain a week to  ""reconsider its unprincipled stand on the contents of 'The Satanic Verses'  before ordering the Iranian Foreign Ministry to cut off all diplomatic ties.""    The agency quoted one deputy, Hussein Mahlouji, as saying that ""if Britain  apologized and regretted the contents of 'The Satanic Verses' and said it had  no part in the production of the book, it would be a great political victory  for Iran.""    In London, British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said Britain  regrets the Iranian Parliament's threat to sever diplomatic relations but will  not change its stance concerning Rushdie.    ""Clearly, the British position will not be altered by threats of that kind,""  Waldegrave said. ""We regret the statement and hope Iranian leaders will  consider again what so many international leaders have now said to them, that  they have an obligation to behave within international law.""    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons today that  freedom of speech and expression are ""subject only to the laws of this land ...  and will remain subject to the rule of law.""    ""It is absolutely fundamental to everything in which we believe and cannot be  interfered with by any outside force,"" she said.    The fact about 100 lawmakers of the 270-member Parliament were absent from the  vote fueled speculation among political observers that there are some moderates  among the ruling clergy who oppose Iran's current anti-Western policy because  it may damage Iran's oil-based economy and further delay its economic recovery  from its 8-year war with Iraq.

0,FT943-7995 ,"FT943-7995 _AN-EHSD0AD6FT 940819   FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: AHP defends delicate chemistry of Dollars 9.7bn acquisition - The merger with American Cyanamid has left some industry experts puzzled      By PATRICK HARVERSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS   American Home Product's successful Dollars 9.7bn acquisition of American Cyanamid this week is only the latest, but certainly largest, convulsion to shake the troubled pharmaceuticals industry. The merger of the two groups will create the world's fourth-largest drug company, behind Merck, Glaxo, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Combined turnover will be about Dollars 12.5bn, of which drug and health care products will account for almost 75 per cent. The industrial logic of the deal, unlike with SmithKline Beecham's asset-swap with Cyanamid proposed earlier this month, is not immediately clear. Admittedly, there is little product overlap. AHP produces top-selling food and consumer products such as Chef Boyardee pasta and Chap Stick, but is best-known for its drug brands. These include the headache tablets Advil and Anacin, the estrogen drug Premarin, and the contraceptive Norplant. Cyanamid's drug unit Lederle is known for its vaccines, cancer agents, antibiotics and Centrum vitamins. However, this impressive list of products does not tell the full story. Industry analysts say AHP's range of drugs is ageing rapidly, and facing intensifying competition from newer drugs on an increasingly price-sensitive market. There is nothing to suggest that the acquisition of Cyanamid will help rectify the situation. Lederle has not produced a new drug in years, and both Cyanamid and AHP have been consistently criticised for the poor quality of their research and development. 'Lumping two stones together doesn't make them float any better,' says one analyst. 'What is key is that the combined group starts producing some innovative products that can generate volume growth.' One potential route for greater innovation is the combination of the two groups' biotechnology businesses. AHP is a majority owner of Genetics Institute, and Cyanamid a majority owner of Immunex. Between the two, AHP will control a formidable biotech operation, says Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst with the independent US research firm Metha and Isaly. 'In terms of dollars spent on biotech research, it will be comparable to Roche's Genentech.' AHP, however, says there are no plans for merging Genetics Institute and Cyanamid's Immunex in the near term. There are the interests of the minority shareholders to consider, and Mr John Stafford, AHP's chairman, believes early benefits can be achieved from closer co-operation between the two biotech companies. While AHP sets about integrating the companies' drug businesses, the big question is what will it do with Cyanamid's agricultural-chemicals operation? Many Wall Street analysts believe it will be sold, if only because AHP will need to reduce its heavy debt load soon, and because there should be no shortage of buyers, at least for the non-animal health parts of it. Says Mr Desai: 'The agrochemicals business of Cyanamid is very attractive because it's in a fairly consistent growth pattern with high operating margins. By the end of next year, it could be worth Dollars 4.5bn or even Dollars 5bn.' However, specialists in agrochemicals are more doubtful about such large figures. They argue that with sales of about Dollars 1.7bn a year, it might command one to one and half times sales, but no more. The animal health business, with annual sales of about Dollars 305m, would command a lower premium. As for who might buy the agrochemicals business, Mr Desai names Zeneca of the UK; AgrEvo, the joint-venture between Hoechst and Schering of Germany; Rhone-Poulenc of France; and Ciba of Switzerland. Monsanto, Dow Chemical and Du Pont in the US are also mentioned. There would be few takers for the animal health operations. This speculation, however, is off the mark, says Mr Stafford, who insists that the agrochemicals unit is a good fit for AHP. 'It's growing. It's technology-based, which is consistent with our approach to the business. It's really an outstanding business, and will become part of our diversified portfolio.' Although the only obvious synergy between Cyanamid's agricultural unit and AHP is in the area of veterinary pharmaceuticals, Mr Stafford says there is unrealised potential in the business. 'It has a chemical library of some 300,000 compounds; by using today's technology, it can be screened for pharmaceutical uses - that can be an extra plus.' The immediate task for AHP is to start squeezing all the possible cost savings out of the merger. Considerable savings should be realised from eliminating the duplication of administrative, research and development, and marketing operations in the drugs businesses. Given AHP's renowned ability to control costs, analysts estimate that such savings could total as much as Dollars 300m a year. Saving money, however, was not the chief force behind the acquisition of Cyanamid, says Mr Stafford. 'The basic reasoning for doing this is not cost-reduction. The primary motivation is to build the business for the long term. It makes us a world player in vaccines. It dramatically increases our size in the pharmaceutical business worldwide. It gives us a position in Asian markets, where previously we were somewhat weak.' Yet, the company will have to move quickly on costs in order to start cutting into the Dollars 9bn in debt AHP took on to finance the purchase of Cyanamid. Mr Stafford is confident AHP can bear the debt burden for now. 'We can service and reduce the debt out of the cashflow of the combined companies. We may take other actions to help reduce debt, but we have no specific plans yet. And we'll still pay the dividend.' The deal may trigger even more cost-cutting in a sector that has already lost tens of thousands of jobs. One analyst comments: 'Either Mr Stafford has done his sums wrong, or there are huge cost savings in pharmaceuticals companies that we haven't even started to contemplate.' Meanwhile, the pressures of worldwide healthcare reform show no sign of letting up, and the fax machines of finance directors are known to be humming with proposals from investment bankers.

Mr Spring said it was not a walkout,  but he had to be back in Dublin tonight for a cabinet meeting.    An Irish Government spokesman admitted: ""He would have  stayed  longer if he had thought there was any chance of reaching  agreement today."" Mr Spring said the failure to decide the  balance of voting in the enlarged European Union was a failure  of leadership. ""This is not the best example to be giving. We  may well be running out of time.""    He said there was no sign at all of a compromise by Britain  and Spain -- both fighting to keep the ""blocking minority"" vote  at 23 -- and the other 10 -- insisting it must increase to 27.    ""I have difficulty understanding the British position,"" said  Mr Spring. ""If we don't resolve this then we will be facing a  very difficult situation. Positions have not changed today,""  added Mr Spring.    He left the talks after an inconclusive lunch between the  foreign ministers and amid signs of a tougher stand on both  sides. Officials said Britain was pressing for a ""protocol""  formally limiting the blocking minority vote to 23.    In what was seen as a sign of growing frustration Holland,  Belgium and Luxembourg retaliated with a threat to hold the  ""qualified majority"" at 54.    This would neatly turn the tables on Mr Hurd by demanding a  freeze at present levels on the voting balance in favour instead  of against Euro legislation. The effect would be to make  agreements easier -- and push up the ""blocking minority"" to 37.    Mr Spring said he hoped to see signs of compromise from  Britain when foreign ministers meet in Greece at the weekend.  Other member states were talking of imposing a two-week  deadline on Britain to give Mr Hurd a breathing space to talk  the Tory Euro sceptics round to what is seen as inevitable -- a  legal requirement for a new ""blocking minority"" of 27.

Failure by Mr Hurd to prevail would set the stage for  Britain's influence to grow ever more marginal. It is, in fact,  a desperate struggle to preserve what remains of British  sovereignty in an ever-expanding Community.    Since 1987, when Mrs Thatcher signed the Single European Act  which first made it possible for Britain to be out-voted, the  majority of EC decisions have been taken on the basis of  Qualified Majority Voting (QMV).    Major issues -- such as taxation, budgets and foreign policy  -- are still taken by unanimous vote. But lesser decisions,  such as permitted food colourings, maximum working hours, water  quality or the fitting of catalytic converters, are all taken by  QMV, the scope of which was greatly extended by Maastricht.    Each country has a number of votes very approximately  determined by its population, the big countries getting 10  votes, and the smallest, Luxembourg, only two.    To prevent large countries dominating completely, QMV gives  the small countries more votes than their population merited.  So Britain has one vote per 5.6 million people, while Ireland  has one per 1.1 million.    With 12 EC members there are 76 votes. To pass a directive  requires a qualified majority of 54 votes -- 70 percent. So 23  votes constitutes a ""blocking minority.""    Yesterday's arguments which were suspended last night after  10 hours, arose because the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway  and Sweden, planned for 1995, will raise the total number of  votes to 90. The dispute was where to set the blocking minority.    Everyone except Britain and Spain wants to move it to 27,  thus keeping it at 30 percent, because of a fear that retaining  it at 23, which would be 25 percent of the votes, would lead to  more decisions being deadlocked.    Britain argues holding the blocking minority at 23 is vital  to reverse the erosion of the large countries' voting shares  brought about by the entry of small countries. Raise the  minority to 27, Mr Hurd says, and it becomes possible for  countries with 41 percent of the EC's population to be outvoted.    If that argument were as strong as Mr Hurd claims, France  and  Germany would be behind him. But they are not. It is only the  British who want the EC to slow down: the rest of the Community  believes in pressing ahead.    Mr Hurd's strongest argument is that Westminster may refuse  to ratify the enlargement treaty, which needs to be approved by  all 12 members and the European Parliament if the minority is  raised to 27. However, if Britain holds the minority to 23 the  European parliament might throw it out.    Were Britain to climb down now, the effect on Conservative  morale in the run-up to June's elections would be catastrophic.  At a stroke, Mr Hurd's attempt to draw a line in the sand  against further ""deepening"" of the EC would be invalidated.    Britain would also set a bad precedent for 1996, when an  inter-government conference is to review the entire  institutional framework of the EC, with a view to letting  eastern Europe countries join the EC over the following 10 years.    As the row wears on, the procedures for incorporating the  four new members are held in limbo. This can hardly endear  their electorates, who have to approve entry by referendum, to  the Brussels way of doing things.    Compromises litter the conference tables in Brussels. Mr  Hurd said yesterday none was acceptable, presumably including a  Spanish one which would set the blocking minority at 27 in  general and at 23 where three countries could muster that  number. None of the other members like Madrid's solution either.     "

Speaking to executives at the British American Chambers of Commerce in New York, the prime minister said the government had set in place 'solid foundations for sustained growth throughout the 90s'. Seeking to dispel any impression in the US that the recovery might be in doubt, he said the end of the recession had left Britain in a much stronger competitive position. Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening. Britain was again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European countries in 1994. Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation. 'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it that way.' He added that low inflation was creating its own dynamic for investment and growth. But the government was determined to move further in sharpening Britain's competitive edge. Emphasising that education remains at the top of his domestic political agenda, the prime minister said that long-term competitiveness would depend 'above all on the quality, the ability, the skills of our workforce'. Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st century.' Stressing Britain's commitment to free and open trade, Mr Major said that the industrialised nations could not insulate old industries and old habits from global competition. In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Mentioning the Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping said:  Britain is stirring up certain political trouble [gao xie zheng  zhi feng bo 2269 0067 2398 3112 7364 3134] to probe our reaction  and this is what we have long anticipated. It would be strange  if the British did not do such things and in the remaining time,  they will continue to do such things. Britain is unwilling to  see the disappearance of its political and economic influence  [shi li 0528 0500] in Hong Kong. However, the British Government  should be aware that the Chinese Government and the Chinese  people will not sit idly by and allow Britain to do such things.  The timetable for recovering Hong Kong is determined by the  Chinese Government.    The sources also said that Zeng Qinghong, director of the  CPC  Central Committee's General Office, told Deng that in two  opinion polls in some major mainland cities, 99 percent of the  people supported the Central Government's policy on the Hong  Kong issue. However, some people thought that the central  government was not tough enough toward Britain and still  cherished unrealistic ""illusions."" Some people even criticized  the central government for being ""rightist"" on this issue.  Deng said: I do not think there is any rightism. We  should give time to Britain to perform. The Preliminary Work  Committee should now quicken its work and should work in a  down-to-earth manner. Britain's political attempts will not  succeed because Hong Kong belongs to China.    According to sources, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing  and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu recently gave separate  speeches on the situation in the Sino-British talks and the  central policy on the Hong Kong issue to various central  departments, commissions, offices, and military academies.  Jiang Enzhu also answered questions raised by cadres in the  Ministry of National Defense and its affiliate institutions.  Li Lanqing said: In addition to playing political tricks,  Britain also tried to undermine Hong Kong's economy, including  Hong Kong's financial conditions. The central authorities were  prepared against this in 1990. When talking with British  Foreign Secretary Howe on 31 July 1984, Comrade Xiaoping  expressed the hope that the British Hong Kong authorities would  persuade British companies not to take the lead in transferring  funds out of Hong Kong. However, if the British decided to  withdraw their funds, we would not try to keep them from  quitting; if they tried to reenter Hong Kong later, we would not  hold a welcome meeting. If some people want to quit, it is  certain that other people are willing to come. The key lies in  China's political stability and vigorous economic development,  with the policy toward Hong Kong remaining unchanged. Britain  is trying to stir up trouble and undermine the Hong Kong economy  in order to prolong its colonial rule. Britain's attempt to  foster a pro- British and anti-China force, which attaches  itself to foreigners, to disrupt Hong Kong's smooth transition  and disrupt the work of the future special administrative region  [SAR] government will not succeed. The central government has  the ability and strength to ensure Hong Kong's long-term  stability and development. We shall not only protect  local-funded enterprises but also foreign-funded enterprises in  Hong Kong and we shall create more favorable conditions for  foreign investors. The Hong Kong stock market has been soaring  in recent months and many foreign investments are long- or  medium-term ones. Foreign investment in China was almost twice  as much as that in the same period of last year. This shows  that the troublesome events in Hong Kong only had a temporary  impact on the situation and it was China's policies that played  a decisive role in maintaining Hong Kong's development. Even if  disorder occurs in Hong Kong, the unrest will not last long.  The central government will adopt resolute measures to solve  the problem.    Li Lanqing also said: In the future, China will give full  consideration to the foreign companies and businessmen who have  made substantial contributions to Hong Kong's economic  development, and have sincerely cooperated with the Chinese  Government, will be given more favorable consideration regarding  their interests and development space in China. The Chinese  Government acts in good faith and greatly cherishes friendship.    Jiang Enzhu said: When holding talks with the British  Government on the convergence of Hong Kong's political structure  before and after 1997, the Chinese Government did not give up  its principles. It was the British side which deliberately  stirred up trouble to undermine the talks but the decision of  the Chinese Government to hold the talks was still correct. In  the 17 rounds of talks, the British side fully laid bare its  sinister purpose of stirring up political trouble in order to  prolong British colonial rule or the influence of the British  colonialist ideology. This was a good thing.    Jiang Enzhu added: Because Britain violated the Sino-British  Joint Declaration, the Joint Declaration has lost its function  and value. Britain went as far as to flagrantly negate the  existence of the agreements reached by the Chinese and British  Governments. This is rarely seen in international relations.  The statements and agreements between the two countries and  between the two governments must be jointly observed and  implemented by the two sides. If one side seriously violates  the agreement and insists on continuing such violation, or even  negates the existence of such statements and agreements, then  the statements and agreements will lose their binding force on  the other side.    Jiang also said: On the Hong Kong issue, Britain even  interfered in China's internal affairs and challenged China's  sovereign power. It was natural that Britain's practice was  rejected by the Chinese Government.    Jiang said: The central government still does not endorse  the demand of some localities, departments, institutions, and  schools to stage demonstrations in front of the British Embassy  and consulates. Such a form of expression is not suited to our  country's current political environment but this idea cannot be  regarded as a wrong one.    Reportedly, since early December, more than 40 institutions,  schools, and organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,  Chongqing, and Guangzhou have applied to stage demonstrations to  protest against Britain's behavior in trampling upon the  Sino-British Joint Declaration but their applications were not  approved by the authorities.

'We have ensured that Britain will remain rabies-free,' he said during a meeting of European Community farm ministers. Britain, keen to keep the island free of the disease, had been worried that pets and other animals would be able to get into the country without going into quarantine first. Now ministers have agreed that dealers will be able to import dogs and cats to Britain without quarantine provided the animals fulfil strict health criteria and pass blood tests to show they are rabies-free on entering the country. But when the Commission gets round to drafting proposals for pets travelling with their owners, Britain has been promised legislation that would be at least as tough as its current quarantine laws, Mr Gummer said. The Commission had floated the idea of 'pet passports' certifying animals as disease-free, but Mr Gummer said the plan agreed yesterday ruled this out.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Red-Headlined Documents and Qian Qichen's Instructions    On 1 July 1997, a day which marks the 76th anniversary of  the  founding of the CPC, Communist China will restore its  sovereignty over Hong Kong. As this day approaches, when there  will be a change of ""national flags,"" some people are proud and  feel avenged, some feel helpless, and of course there are some  who feel it is the end of the world.... But whatever the  attitude toward the return of Hong Kong in 1997, most agree that  day will not be a happy or bright one.    ""What kind of problems will there be during the transfer of  sovereignty?"" Like a large unwelcome cloud, this question looms  above the high levels of the CPC as an increasing worry. A  report relayed in early April by the State Council's General  Office, ""On problems that may appear during Hong Kong's  transition, the transfer of sovereignty, and the early days of  the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government,"" drafted by  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Research Office, highlighted this worry.    The report was issued as a red-headlined document to the  party committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and cities,  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and party committees of  the relevant military regions, obviously to get the whole party  and Army mentally prepared. From what Qian Qichen, State  Council vice premier and director of the Preliminary Work  Committee, wrote on the document, we can see that without the  cooperation of British Hong Kong, Communist China's hands are  tied in the latter phase of Hong Kong's transition. Qian Qichen  said in his remarks: We must fully assess changes in the Hong  Kong situation, be fully prepared, and properly handle and solve  problems and be ready with solutions to them in order to  maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability.    Under its requirement for ""full assessment"" and ""full  preparation,"" the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office report  listed 15 possible serious problems that may occur during Hong  Kong's transition, its transfer of sovereignty, and the early  days of the SAR government. These problems are excerpted as  follows:    ""British Hong Kong Pushes Executive Council to the Forefront  of Confrontation With the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office""    1. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  agitate and sow dissension among high-ranking civil servants.    2. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  pick, promote, and groom a group of pro-British and anti-Chinese  elements and install them in the Hong Kong Government and elite  positions in professional circles.    3. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities appoint  pro-British and anti-Chinese elements to the Executive Council  and push it to the forefront of confrontation with the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office.    4. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  rely on U.S. influence and internationalize the Hong Kong  problem.    5. To win over public opinion, Britain and the British Hong  Kong authorities institute a social welfare system like those  pursued in northern Europe which puts an excessive burden on the  SAR government.    Reference to Trump Card Held by British Hong Kong That Could  Throw Hong Kong Into Chaos    6. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and  make use of Hong Kong's anti-Chinese and extreme rightist forces  and hostile forces overseas to turn Hong Kong into a virtually  semi-independent polity or political entity.    7. Britain, together with the United States, Japan, and  their western allies, withdraw all of their capital from Hong  Kong, paralyzing its finances.    8. British capital, led by the Hong Kong and Shanghai  Banking Corporation and Chartered Bank [Standard Chartered Bank]  abruptly announce the end of their domicile in Hong Kong,  causing great confusion in Hong Kong.    9. Britain and the United States grant passports to  anti-Chinese political figures in Hong Kong in support of their  activities to oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong to keep  it in turmoil.    10. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and  support anti-Chinese political forces in Hong Kong in collusion  with Taiwan's anti-communist forces and ""Taiwan Independence""  forces to pursue activities opposing China and creating chaos in  Hong Kong.    Reference to Possibility That British Hong Kong  Would Deprive SAR Government of Functioning Government  Bureaucracy    11. Abetted and controlled by Britain and the British Hong  Kong authorities, a large number of civil servants resign or  retire early in order to deprive the SAR government of a  functioning government bureaucracy.    12. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities  manufacture political incidents. Such incidents will be fronted  by anti-Chinese hostile forces, which will encourage Hong Kong  citizens to go on strike and close up shop so that there is  turmoil during the transfer of political power.    13. Britain supports or plans for hostile forces in Hong  Kong to engineer violence and conduct assassinations and  sabotage with a view to creating chaos in Hong Kong during the  transfer of sovereignty, causing foreign capital to leave and  the industrial and commercial sectors to divert their funds.    14. During the transition, Britain and the British Hong Kong  authorities use their executive and judicial prerogatives to  purge, persecute, or threaten patriotic and Hong Kong-loving  industrialists and businessmen, middle and high-ranking civil  servants, and former or incumbent legislative and executive  councillors who do not agree with Britain's violation of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements between the  two countries.    15. During the transition and the transfer of sovereignty,  Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to  monopolize Hong Kong's finances and rob it of its money under  the cover of construction projects, franchises, and contract  awards to maintain Britain's economic and financial privileges  in Hong Kong for a long time after its withdrawal.    Hong Kong Policy Doubted and Questioned by the Military    It is surprising that the scenarios ""conceived"" by the  report  about Hong Kong's prospects are so horrific and apocalyptic.  Communist China has always said that it has the ability to  maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. However, after  Zhongnanhai has played all of its trump cards, the initiative is  now in the hands of British Hong Kong. The report stressed  specifically that some of the 15 scenarios had occurred during  the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, some are  continuing, some are being planned, and some are very likely to  occur during the transfer of political power. For Communist  China, a ""small move"" by the other side would be enough to dim  the luster of the pearl of the Orient.    The Hong Kong policy has been severely challenged within the  CPC. At first, Communist China adopted a ""high-handed"" approach,  as if once Chris Patten tabled his political reform package to  the Legislative Council, the People's Liberation Army [PLA]  would immediately ""liberate"" Hong Kong. However, when Chris  Patten's package was tabled to the council, Communist China  could not move further.... To deal with inner-party  dissatisfaction, especially within the Army, during this  two-year period, Qian Qichen attended sessions at the invitation  of the PLA deputy group to answer questions. The question put  by the PLA deputy group was very candid: ""What specific  measures does our government's have given Britain's  confrontational and noncooperative stance?""    Qian Qichen Puts Forward Five Options for Taking Back Hong  Kong    Qian Qichen was very clever in fielding the question. Unlike  previous times when he gave clear-cut answers, he put forward  five options, without saying who had the right to decide on  which option or providing the basis of the options.    Qian Qichen's five options were:    1. Before 1997 or in early 1995, form a SAR government  according to the Basic Law and begin work on the changeover --  this is an option for reduced disruption and confrontation with  Britain.    2. If the situation changes, the schedule must be advanced  to have a basic framework for the SAR government in place by  mid-1996, and by then preparations for the SAR should be coming  to an end.    3. If the present situation continues and Britain persists  in undermining the Sino-British Joint Declaration and negating  the agreements between the two governments, the Chinese  Government will, at the right time, inform the British  Government of the end of its rule in Hong Kong.    4. In case of violent political turmoil and prolonged  political strife during the transition or the appearance of an  ""international political city,"" ""political entity,"" or  ""semi-independence"" masterminded by British Hong Kong, take  action to recover Hong Kong immediately.    5. The National People's Congress Standing Committee has the  right to order or authorize necessary measures.    Begin Drafting the ""Right To Hold Perpetrators Accountable  for Past Acts"" To Deal With Hong Kong Dissidents    There is still more than three years for Communist China to  ""decide"" on a way to take back Hong Kong. There is still time.  But already there are signs that to deal with ""hostile forces""  in Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish a ""right to  hold perpetrators accountable for past acts"" to ""justify"" a  crackdown on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands.    At a seminar held at the Jingxi Guesthouse on 26 March,  which  was attended by persons-in-charge of the military, armed police,  public security, and the militias, the public security and  military suggested applying the right to hold perpetrators  accountable for their past acts in Hong Kong and Macao. There  would be three ""retroactive periods:""    1. The period after the signing of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration;    2. After the promulgation of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law;    3. After Britain unilaterally stopped cooperating in the  transition, forcing China to publicize diplomatic documents.    Xu Huizi [Central Committee member and deputy chief of PLA  General Staff] stressed specifically that the PLA supported and  assisted public security and the armed police in maintaining  public order in the country and cracking down on hostile forces  and elements, including hostile forces and elements based in the  Chinese territory of Hong Kong and Macao and aimed at  overthrowing the Central People's government and the CPC-led  socialist system.    This is an alarming move. No wonder some mainland people are  discussing this matter, saying that the first thing Communist  China will do after recovering Hong Kong is to crack down on  counterrevolutionaries!    Will the tragic ""Movement To Suppress  Counterrevolutionaries""  in the mainland of those years be replayed in Hong Kong?     "

In a rare show of unity, the Liberal  Party gave its backing to a motion initiated by the United  Democrats leader, Martin Lee, attacking the current and incoming  sovereign powers for violating the Joint Declaration -- the  agreement under which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.  Lee's motion was passed without opposition -- by 23 votes, but  three government officials and a maverick legislator, Chim  Pui-chung, abstained. Other members were absent.    Lee accused China of interfering in Hong Kong affairs ahead  of 1997 and said Britain was ""joining hands"" with China in  violating the Joint Declaration, signed in 1984. The leader of  the Liberal Party, Allen Lee, said he did not believe Britain  and China ""deliberately went back on their word"" to uphold the  Joint Declaration, but he charged them with abandoning their  promises to co-operate to achieve a smooth transition.    Martin Lee said the motion amounted to a vote of no  confidence in the two powers. ""My motion is effectively a vote  of no confidence aimed at both Britain and China,"" Lee said  outside the chamber. ""It shows a profound concern among  legislative councillors that Britain and China will not adhere  to their obligations under the Joint Declaration.""    During the debate his colleague, Szeto Wah, said: ""We have  reason to believe that the British and Chinese sides have ganged  up to destroy the spirit of the Joint Declaration. We are being  betrayed."" Martin Lee said the Joint Declaration seems to have  become ""a declaration of joint destruction"". He listed 10  ""incidents of violations of the Joint Declaration"". Among them  were the seven diplomatic letters exchanged between Britain and  China in 1990 which showed a joint attempt to slow democratic  development. He also quoted a secret Sino-British agreement on  the composition of the Court of Final Appeal as an example of  Britain's complicity in violating the Joint Declaration.    Martin Lee said the Basic Law, announced in 1990, violated  the Joint Declaration, without protest from Britain. ""If we  don't defend the spirit of the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will  be ruled by a puppet regime from the north,"" Martin Lee said.    Christine Loh, an independent legislator, said Britain  seemed  resigned to letting China ""re-interpret and redefine"" the Joint  Declaration. ""Britain seems to take the view that it will have  vacated Hong Kong by 1997, so that whatever happens here is not  Britain's responsibility,"" she said.    The Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, said  it was ""plainly untrue"" that the Hong Kong-British government  had failed to abide by the objectives of the Joint Declaration.  Ng rejected criticisms that the government betrayed the  aspirations of Hong Kong people for a legislature of more  directly-elected seats.    ""As a responsible government we have to strike the right  balance between the expressed desire of the community for a  greater say in running their own affairs on the one hand, and a  form of government capable of transcending 1997. I believe  we've struck the right balance,"" he said. Ng also defended the  secret Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final Appeal.     "

The prime minister told executives at the British American Chambers of Commerce in New York that the government had set in place 'solid foundations for sustained growth throughout the 90s'. Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening, he said. Britain was again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European countries this year. Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation. 'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it that way.' Emphasising that education remained at the top of his domestic political agenda, the prime minister said that long-term competitiveness would depend 'above all on the quality, the ability, the skills of our workforce'. Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the re-skilling of Britain for the 21st century.' In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT933-2713 ,"FT933-2713 _AN-DIQB4ACNFT 930917   FT  17 SEP 93 / Record number of tourists visit Britain      By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent   A RECORD 18.5m tourists visited Britain in the 12 months to March, 8 per cent more than the previous year - and the British Tourist Authority said yesterday that it was expecting even higher numbers this year. The authority's forecast for this year, contained in its annual report, is based on figures for the January-to-June period when there were 8.5m visitors, up 10 per cent on the same period last year. Launching the report, Ms Adele Biss, who chairs the authority, said: 'We are forecasting an even stronger year to come as we reap the benefits of devaluation and the move away from simple sun-bathing to the more fulfilling holidays that Britain offers.' Spending by tourists in the year to the end of March grew less dramatically, increasing by only 7 per cent to Pounds 7.9bn. Tourists have bought cheaper holidays, cut short their length of stay and taken advantage of heavy discounting by the tourist industry, the authority said. Ms Biss added that Britain was still perceived as an expensive destination 'so delivering value for money will continue to be paramount'. Travel from North America was up 18 per cent last year on 1991 - but tourism from the US that year was hit badly by the Gulf war. The number of Americans has still not recovered to 1990 levels. Growth in visitors from south-east Asia was strong, with tourists from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore increasing by 22 per cent and from Japan by 21 per cent. Of the nearly 10m tourists from other European Community countries, France and Germany provided the greatest number of visitors: there were 2.5m tourists from France (up 8 per cent) and 2.3m from Germany (up 6 per cent). The authority said it had raised a record Pounds 26m from the industry for tourism promotion worldwide. For every Pounds 1 spent on marketing overseas, up to Pounds 56 in extra tourist expenditure was generated. The authority, which last year had an income of more than Pounds 46m, reported that it now promotes Britain in 65 countries and has recently set up new offices in Milan, Lisbon and Johannesburg. Overseas staff dealt with more than 1.5m enquiries and a further 600,000 were handled by the British Travel Centre in London. Research showed that one in four overseas visitors to Britain gets information from the authority before setting off, it said. Sir John Egan is to become chairman of the London Tourist Board. Sir John will remain as chief executive of BAA, which owns and runs the three London airports. He takes over from Sir Hugh Bidwell, who is stepping down to spend more time as deputy chairman of London Forum, the private-sector body which promotes the capital.

He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. He will also meet opposition politicians and business leaders. In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year. Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However, the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to be invited to London soon. Mr Di Tella is trying to win over the Falkland islanders by convincing them that Argentina has changed for the better. He has met Falkland representatives and broadcast to the islands via the BBC World Service. But suspicious Falklanders reject his advances and Britain refuses to discuss the islands' political future. The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries, the Falklands' main source of revenue. Mr Di Tella will sign a new one-year fishing agreement.

Last year, Britain's visible exports exceeded Pounds 850m, an unprecedented 50 per cent increase over the previous year, making Israel Britain's 24th-largest export market. So far this year, growth in exports has increased by a further 40 per cent and now averages Pounds 90m a month. This growth has occurred almost exclusively in capital equipment and manufactured goods, areas where Britain must focus its attention in order to consolidate economic recovery. Israel's sales to Britain are also growing and Britain is currently its second-largest customer after the US. This year, bilateral trade could exceed Pounds 2bn. Israel will import Dollars 20bn worth of goods this year and export Dollars 15bn, and Britain's share is a healthy 9.5 per cent of this market. The effects of the Arab trade boycott continue to be felt in spite of the peace process, yet it seems that British exporters are increasingly taking advantage of this vital and innovative market.

Britain cannot hope to compete in the global economy 'by driving down its wage levels', he told the Institute of Personnel and Development's conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He said: 'We have to increase the value that people add to their business through education and training. The aim must be a highly motivated workforce where the individual is rewarded for skill and productivity.' In his first big speech outlining his employment policy, Mr Portillo was keen to dispel any suggestion that he wanted to turn Britain into a sweat shop in order to compete with the emerging economies of Asia and South America. He said: 'For the moment, those emerging economies have the competitive advantages of low wages and even lower non-wage costs. But for the moment, the developed world, including Britain, retains an advantage in terms of the skills and knowledge of its workforce.' But he warned that the competition was not standing still and that the Asian competitors, in particular, were laying 'heavy emphasis on the education of their people'. Mr Portillo said Britain and the rest of Europe had to 'keep costs firmly under control' and 'raise the knowledge and skill-base of its workforce'. While dismissing the idea of a statutory minimum wage and more social regulation from the European Union, Mr Portillo said Britain should increase its competitive edge by creating products which owed 'more to human knowledge than to human muscle'. He added: 'Our future lies in providing goods and services which have high added-value because of their technology, design or innovation. They are likely to be the basis of our prosperity in an increasingly competitive world.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As an ex-pat for the last 7 1/2 years in the US, I have witnessed the UK's increasing marginalisation with growing anxiety. While other European countries get widespread coverage in US print and broadcast media with their trading, industrial and technological achievements, Britain's coverage seems limited to the latest folly about the royal family or the government. Meanwhile, UK companies, advertising to US audiences, seem to perpetuate the stereotype of the British class system. The full extent to which Britain has failed to get its message across about the role it can play came home to me the other day. An American friend was discussing renewed tensions in Kuwait and recalled the Gulf war. 'I think the best troops, apart from the Americans and the Israelis, were the Jordanians and the French,' he said. He was unaware of the SAS raids on the Scuds (although John Major has since commented on them), or of the RAF low-level strikes against the Iraqi airfields, or, indeed, of any British participation. The good things that Britain can do get overshadowed by a whole lot of absolutely trite, irrelevant imagery that portrays the country as a museum run by patronising dodderers for the benefit of a few capricious duchesses. I have noticed, with reference to your comments on the millennium commission, that many Americans are unsure that Britain truly knows which century is about to close around its ears. Something must be done - unless Britain is to return to its pre-industrial status of an insignificant island somewhere off the north-west coast of Europe.

Domestic rows over economic policy and street beggars were  bypassed as Labour and the Liberal Democrats rounded on the  Prime Minister, claiming he was relegating Britain to Europe's  second division.    But Mr Major again made the campaign running launching a  strong defence of his call for a more ""flexible"" Europe and  accusing opposition parties of a ""craven"" surrender to Europe.    He said his call for a Europe in which member states were  free to do ""some things in their own way"" was in tune with  public opinion.    With the campaign past the half-way mark, he said the  Conservatives were the only party addressing the important  European questions and resolutely committed to a realistic  assessment of Britain's place in Europe.    ""So far we are the only party which has not played fast and  loose with the national veto. We are the only party  unequivocally committed to maintaining the veto,"" said Mr Major.    Addressing a Tory campaign conference in London, Mr Major  stood by his call for a ""multi-speed, multi-track, multi-layered  Europe.""    He said it did not contradict his original aim to see  Britain  at the heart of the Community and described talk of Britain in  the ""slow lane"" of Europe as defeatist and old-fashioned.    A multi-speed Europe was already happening, and he cited an  agreement between France, Germany and the Benelux countries to  dismantle their border controls -- a policy not adopted by other  EC members.    European governments had to note a ""sourness"" among voters  towards the way the Community was developing.    ""I approach this question from the angle of someone who  wishes to see Europe succeed. This is a very great venture. It  is vitally important it is not pushed aside by sourness and  moving too rapidly. We have to carry the people with us.""    Emphasising the Government's determination to maintain the  veto on policies affecting Britain's vital national interests,  he said Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be at the ""tail  of Europe,"" following policies advocated by other states.    ""That is the most craven foreign policy I have ever heard  from any British political party. If that is the policy of  Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they have forfeited every  conceivable right to be trusted in Government with British  foreign policy.""    Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Jack Cunningham,  accused Mr Major of trying to play ""hokey pokey"" with Europe:  ""In-out, shake it all about.

The Libyan ambassador to Brussels and The Hague, Mr Mohammed Sharaf Eddine El Faitouri, said he had delivered an 'official complaint' to the court. Libya's mission at the UN said it was asking the court to resolve the dispute and to take 'appropriate interim action' regarding the extradition case. The US and Britain have threatened reprisals against Libya unless it hands over two men accused of the bombing. Britain last night described the Libyan move as 'extraordinary', but said it would co-operate if the court decided to consider the application. Meanwhile, Britain said President Muammer Gadaffi's claim to have broken links with the Irish Republican Army 'falls far short' of demands that Libya renounce backing for terrorism. Words alone were not enough, officials said.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT942-13035 ,"FT942-13035 _AN-ED0DLACCFT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / Orders soon for attack helicopters      By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent   If anyone expected more windfalls from the end of the cold war, those hopes were dashed yesterday by a defence policy statement that committed Britain to unflagging engagement in the defence of a fast-changing Europe. It described the armed forces as a 'valuable and prestigious national asset' which could not be surrendered without grave damage to the 'security and reputation' of Britain. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is now firmly insisting that all future savings in expenditure will neither eat into the country's fighting strength nor rest on any over-hasty assumptions about diminishing risks. Far from running down Britain's fighting strength, Mr Rifkind 'hoped for some enhancement' in front-line capacity as a spin-off from the efficiency drive now in progress. He emphasised the 'broad range of capabilities' Britain could deploy. The statement reaffirms Britain's commitment to a wide-ranging renewal of its aircraft, helicopters and tanks. It also vigorously defends the performance of the armed forces in Northern Ireland, noting that the frequency of terrorist attacks is now only a fraction of the peak reached in 1972. The paper's robust tone makes plain that the defence ministry has fought off veiled suggestions from the Treasury that a major land war is now so unlikely that Britain could dispense with much of its heavy armour. It describes developments in Russia as 'perhaps the key factor' for British security, and acknowledges that the evolution of that country is almost impossible to predict. 'We will not know for many years to come whether it will develop into an economically successful and stable democracy, and a permanent friend,' it says. Apart from endorsing the Partnership for Peace programme, which invites the former Warsaw Pact nations to engage in military co-operation with Nato, the document also lays stress on bilateral co-operation with eastern Europe. It says Britain has plans for a joint exercise with Poland this year and may hold one with Russia next year. Ironically, the statement's release yesterday coincided with an announcement from President Boris Yeltsin that he was turning against the idea of joint military exercises with the US. On arms control issues, the paper commits Britain to playing a 'positive and constructive role' in negotiations on a test ban treaty though it had 'not been an entirely easy decision' to make. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, criticised the government's lack of enthusiasm on this issue and said Britain should take the lead. He said it made little sense for Britain to drag its feet over nuclear tests when it could conduct them only with the goodwill of the US, which now favoured a moratorium. The main procurement plans the document reaffirms are: The purchase of 259 more Challenger 2 tanks, the details of which are being negotiated with Vickers. Plans to purchase a fleet of up to 100 attack helicopters, for which six tenders have been received; the Apache, produced by McDonnell Douglas, is widely seen as a front-runner. An order for about 45 support helicopters, to be divided between Boeing's Chinook and the EH-101 made by Westland. Plans to order more of the 'Trafalgar' class of nuclear submarine, which will replace nuclear hunter-killers near the end of their operational life. A tender for this is to be announced shortly. Participation in the four-nation Eurofighter project, now in development; Britain has repeatedly pledged to buy 250 of the new aircraft.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Speaker after speaker at the Strasbourg parliament stated  during a debate on the enlargement talks that it would be  impossible for the treaty to be ratified by the 518-member  chamber if the British position were adopted.    There was support for Britain from only one MEP, a Spaniard.    The problem arises because of British fears that the  admission of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next year will  dangerously dilute Britain's ability to block measures it  disapproves of.    During two days of talks in Brussels this week, Mr Douglas  Hurd, Foreign Secretary, told his European counterparts that  Britain did not want the number of votes needed to block  decisions increased when the Council of Ministers, the EC's  decision-making body, gains in size. Britain now faces either a  humiliating climb-down or the rancour it will cause by delaying  the expansion of the EC.    Currently, two large countries and a small one can stall  legislation by assembling a ""blocking minority"" of 23 votes out  of a total of 76. Fifty-four votes out of a total of 76 are  needed to approve an EC proposal in the present 12-member  Council.    The number of votes are allocated to each country roughly  according to population size, but small countries enjoy a  disproportionate weighting.    Britain has 10 votes, or roughly one for each five million  people; the new members will get a vote for roughly every three  million.    Mr Hurd argues that, if the blocking minority is raised to  27, it would be possible for countries with 41 percent of the  EC's population to be outvoted.    Britain, with limited support from Spain, wants to keep the  blocking minority at 23 after the enlargement. The remaining  members, led by Belgium and the Netherlands, want it raised to  27 to make it harder to veto majority decisions.    Herr Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister, opposed  keeping the blocking minority at 23 for fear that the European  Parliament would refuse to ratify the treaty.    ""Britain has no chance of getting its position approved. It  is a mystery why they have dug themselves into such a hole,"" a  senior diplomat said.    Diplomats last night outlined a possible, though far from  satisfactory, compromise, which would at least allow the  enlargement procedure to go ahead.    It is a classic Euro-fudge. Under the compromise the  blocking minority would be frozen at 23, in accordance with  British wishes, pending the report of a high-level committee, to  be established at June's EC summit in Corfu.    The committee would also prepare for institutional reform at  an Inter-Govermental Conference in 1996.    The compromise would allow Britain to claim a degree of  victory, although the row will merely be deferred for a year or  so.    But it will be difficult to get through the European  Parliament. There is also the strong possibilty that either the  Belgian or Dutch parliaments would then reject the treaty.    The row, which is pitting Britain against its European  partners to a degree rarely seen since the days of Mrs  Thatcher's campaign for a budget rebate, will rumble on until  ministers meet next Tuesday [15 March].    That meeting will also attempt to resolve outstanding issues  over Norway's membership.     "
0,FT944-9126 ,"FT944-9126 _AN-EKQEIAATFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / UK risks losing millions in EU aid      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   Britain risks losing European Union aid worth up to Ecu674m (Pounds 525m), intended to retrain workers in frontline industries, because it is refusing to apply for it, the European Commission confirmed yesterday. Senior Commission officials warned that the UK would not be allowed to 'opt out' of this policy, which is intended to lift EU competitiveness, and to which Britain's partners are committed. The UK government's refusal to draw down its full EU aid entitlements comes as it faces a potentially damaging revolt by right-wing Conservative MPs because of planned increases in UK and other member states' contributions to the Union's budget. The aid Britain risks foregoing comes under the so-called Objective 4 of the European Social Fund. This policy, agreed by all member states in mid-1993, is designed to boost the skills of workers in industries being restructured. Previously, Social Fund money was aimed exclusively at young and long-term unemployed, while Objective 4 targets workers in threatened industries in order to prevent them from becoming unemployed. The UK regards this switch in funding as part of a French-inspired Commission effort to build up an industrial policy by subterfuge, and wants to be allowed to spend all Social Fund money on the jobless. The Commission yesterday agreed on a share-out of Objective 4 funds for the UK's partners, but confirmed that it was 'holding in reserve' finance for which Britain had submitted no programme. Britain is entitled to a total of Ecu3.37bn under the Social Fund in 1994-99. Under the Commission formula, about 80 per cent of this would go to training the unemployed, and 20 per cent to Objective 4 - in the UK's case, therefore, some Ecu674m. The UK has asked for 95 per cent of its full Social Fund entitlement in 1994-96 - the first half of the scheme - but purely for funding training for the jobless and ignoring Objective 4. Brussels has allowed this through, while withholding the 5 per cent remnant worth Ecu80m. But it is insisting that the UK redress the balance towards the Objective 4 programme in the second half of the scheme, in 1997-99. Brussels officials say they are prepared to be flexible, allowing Britain to spend perhaps no more than 10 per cent of its Social Fund grant on retraining employed workers. But Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs commissioner, made clear yesterday that 'all member states should implement Objective 4'. 'Flexibility in dividing up the spending does not extend to opting out,' he warned. Mr Flynn would not spell out publicly the consequences for Britain if it continued to boycott the retraining policy, beyond stressing that 'we have no indication we are going to get a programme from the UK' to take up its Objective 4 entitlements. Britain has traditionally got the largest single share of the EU Social Fund. In 1989-93 it received Ecu2bn out of the Ecu7.4bn total; its full entitlement of nearly Ecu3.4bn in 1994-99 stands against a total of Ecu14bn parcelled out to all member states. The Commission retains a portion of the Fund for programmes it runs itself. These include the Adapt scheme for upgrading industrial skills across the Union, from which the UK should get Ecu250m in 1994-99. Commission officials see virtually no difference between Objective 4 and the Adapt programme. 'It's puzzling that (British) ideological differences don't appear to extend that far,' one Brussels official remarked yesterday.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The visits of British statesmen to our republic have  become more frequent. How do you evaluate Britain's position in  the solution of questions of vital importance to Azerbaijan?    [Akhundov] I would note Britain's objectivity both in  respect  to the events in our region and during discussion of all the  first three resolutions in the UN Security Council. The draft of  the latest, fourth, resolution, which Britain is at this moment  correcting, was submitted for Security Council discussion  recently. It differs from Resolution No. 874, with whose content  Azerbaijan has in principle remained dissatisfied and which it  has regarded as a retreat from the provisions of the preceding  Resolutions 822 and 853.    [Correspondent] You mean that Britain is preparing a draft  new resolution?    [Akhundov] Britain is a member of the UN Security Council.  Usually each country on the Security Council makes its  corrections and submits its observations and revisions during  the elaboration of official documents. At the present time the  draft new resolution is being studied at the British Foreign  Ministry.    [Correspondent] May it be maintained that all these visits,  meetings, and talks will somehow influence the opinion of the  world community, help Azerbaijan find new supporters, and  produce specific results?    [Akhundov] The first British parliamentary delegation came  to  Azerbaijan this April. It consisted of representatives of the  Conservative and Labor parties. It was followed on a visit to  our republic by Dr. Clark, representative of the Labor Party and  shadow defense secretary. And, finally, this month--the latest  visit of representatives of the British parliament. The result  of all these contacts was the joint decision to form a special  group in the British parliament for liaison with the parliament  of Azerbaijan and our republic as a whole. This group will  register with the Interparliamentary Union, which may be seen as  a positive factor in Azerbaijan's favor.    [Correspondent] How are relations with the parliaments of  other countries shaping up?    [Akhundov] There are no further such examples of cooperation  as yet, unfortunately. Relations have been established with  neighboring Turkey, but they have not been seen through to the  end. It is very important today that at this difficult, dramatic  time for Azerbaijan foreign countries and the public obtain  objective information and learn the truth. I believe it to be of  considerable importance that Britain itself and the British  parliament are commenting objectively on the events taking place  here. Interparliamentary contacts--a guarantee of the  development of further cooperation between our states--are  taking shape. I have to mention Mr. James Spicer--a sponsor of  the creation of the interparliamentary group. He is the head in  Britain of the Westminster Democracy Foundation, which,  obviously, will perform an important role in relations between  our states. We outlined in the negotiations the first specific  steps, and Mr. Spicer proposed the formation of a group of 10-15  young politicians which would in the future visit Britain. It is  contemplated that the Azerbaijani politicians will meet with  politicians of Britain, visit the British parliament, and  acquire visual lessons in parliamentarianism and democracy. In  addition, we believe that the foundation will associate itself  actively with the implementation of cultural activities.    [Correspondent] In other words, the foundations of further  mutual relations between Azerbaijan and Britain, between the  parliaments of the two countries, are being laid today, now?    [Akhundov] Yes, and this is in itself a very good beginning.  It implants hope of the possibility of cooperation and the  establishment of stable relations with the parliaments of other  states of Europe and Asia and neighboring Iran and Turkey. I  believe that Azerbaijan could find political partners in the Far  East also.    [Correspondent] I would like to hope that this cooperation  will not be of an episodic nature but will become a system and a  direction of the parliament of Azerbaijan's overseas activity.    [Akhundov] We will aspire to constant interaction with all  parliaments of the world. Relations based on cooperation, mutual  trust, and friendship have stood the test of time and given a  good account of themselves and serve only the interests of peace  and stability.    [Correspondent] Than you for the interview.     "

The Bahraini foreign minister expressed the belief that the  British Government's position toward the Gulf region and the  Middle East peace process is both positive and constructive.

In a speech reasserting his own political authority in the  cabinet, Mr Hurd publicly derided those who thought Britain  could turn its back on Europe.    The comments contrasted sharply with the anti-Brussels  remarks earlier this week of Mr John Major, the prime minister.  Mr Hurd's speech to Tory activists at the party's spring  conference in Plymouth, left the impression he was delivering an  implicit warning to the prime minister not to cede ground to the  party's right-wing Eurosceptics. Later in the day, the foreign  secretary coupled his strong words with a clear signal that  Britain could compromise on the voting issue as long as its  European partners give ground.    As he flew to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece  last night, he said the dispute would sooner or later be  resolved: ""At the end of the day there is agreement. That's the  way the Community works. That's the way it will work this time.""    Mr Hurd's Plymouth speech appeared to deliver a thinly  veiled  rebuke to those in the cabinet who have turned the present votes  row between Britain and its partners into a broader onslaught  against the European Union.    The traditionally sceptical tone of right-wing cabinet  ministers like Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has more  recently been echoed by similar sentiments from Mr Kenneth  Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine -- both self-avowed  pro-Europeans, but also potential successors to Mr Major in any  leadership contest.    But the foreign secretary told party workers to call a halt  to the ""lunatic"" discussion of whether they were pro or  anti-European. Instead they had to grasp the central message:  ""The future of Britain rests in Europe.""    Mr Hurd's untypically tough language in Plymouth appeared to  reflect his growing frustration at the way in which the dispute  over majority voting once the Union is enlarged next year has  shifted the centre of gravity among Tory MPs towards the  Eurosceptics.    He insisted he was as determined as anyone to fight for  Britain's interests in Europe but the Conservatives must reject  a ""sour, defensive attitude which concentrates exclusively on  the negative things about the European Union.""    Speaking after his address, Mr Hurd said the cabinet had  agreed on Thursday that it must fight a positive, pro-European  campaign in the critical elections to the Strasbourg parliament  on June 9.    Mr Major, who is to address the closing session of the  Plymouth conference later today, is now expected to tone down  attacks on Brussels. He will be joined on the platform by both  Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke.    It also emerged yesterday that the cabinet agreed this week  that all future ministerial pronouncements on Europe must in  future be cleared through 10 Downing Street in order to minimise  the appearance of divisions.    Mr Hurd told his colleagues on Thursday of the need to  maintain a positive and consistent line if the Conservatives are  not to suffer heavy losses in the June Euro-elections.    The foreign secretary offered a detailed assessment of the  economic and security realities which meant that Britain could  not detach itself from Europe. He concluded: ""Unless we can  lift our sights we shall put at risk Britain's position.""    Mr Hurd stressed that this did not mean that Britain could  not argue its case strongly in Europe.     "

The acknowledgement that Britain had bowed to U.S. and  French  pressure came as Conservative MPs voiced deep concern that the  threat of NATO air strikes might draw the West into greater  military involvement in Bosnia.    After a meeting with senior ministers, the MPs said they  would push for an immediate withdrawal of the 2,500 British  troops in the former Yugoslav province if the 10-day ultimatum  brought an escalation in the conflict.    But as the government temporarily suspended its aid convoys  in Bosnia for fear of retaliation by Serbian forces, ministers  admitted that the choice had been between supporting the NATO  plan and a damaging rift with the U.S.    It is understood that in a telephone call on Wednesday,  President Bill Clinton warned Mr John Major that if Britain  blocked the strategy it might seriously undermine the U.S.  commitment to NATO. Senior ministers said President Clinton had  made clear that failure to act would strengthen the hand of  those in Washington arguing for a much faster and bigger  disengagement of US forces from Europe.    A shift in the French position in favour of the air strikes  also seriously undercut Mr Major's position that such action  posed too serious a threat to the troops on the ground. France  has committed more troops than Britain to Bosnia.    One senior minister said that in such circumstances it would  have been ""disastrous"" for the future of the alliance to oppose  the ultimatum.    Mr Major, whose government was seriously at odds with  President Clinton over the admission to the U.S. this month of  Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, judged that Britain could  not afford another damaging breach. Significant tensions still  remained within the cabinet before the decision to go along with  the U.S. was taken.    The ministers said the cabinet had agreed to the ultimatum  only after military commanders on the ground said limited use of  air power was feasible and that the risk to British troops could  be contained. It was also agreed that if air strikes failed in  their objective, there would be no further escalation in British  military involvement.    In a Commons statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign  secretary, alluded repeatedly to the tensions within the Western  alliance when he said there was a need to present a united front  within NATO. The government had backed the ultimatum because  ""there is a strong British interest in maintaining the strength  and solidarity of NATO.""    He also emphasised hopes that the demilitarisation of  Sarajevo would speed the process towards a political settlement  in Bosnia. But he admitted: ""No one would pretend that this was  an easy decision.""    Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence  secretary, in an attempt to calm Tory backbench fears at a  hastily convened meeting last night. The two ministers stressed  that contingency plans had been made to secure the safety of  British troops and, if necessary, to withdraw them.    The ministers stressed also the advantages of the new U.S.  commitment to more active involvement in the search for a  peaceful settlement. Washington had made it clear it is still  opposed to the involvement of U.S. troops, but British ministers  hope the Bosnian Moslems will be persuaded that the U.S. can no  longer be relied on as a ""secret ally.""

Iran's charge d'affaires  Gholam Reza Ansari was summoned to see Foreign Office [FO]  Minister Douglas Hogg following reports that Tehran's spies have  been secretly helping the terrorists.    After the 10-minute showdown at the Foreign Office, a FO  spokesman said: ""We are convinced that there have been contacts  between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We take the gravest  view of any contact which might assist or encourage terrorism.  Mr. Hogg summoned the Iranian charge to convey our concern and  to request an assurance at senior level that contact would be  immediately and conclusively severed.""    Britain believes contacts have been going on for some time  and it is clear measures will be taken against Tehran if today's  warning has no effect. Relations between the two countries are  already sour following the late Ayatollah Khomeyni's death order  on author Salman Rushdie over his controversial book, The  Satanic Verses. Britain and Iran do not have full diplomatic  relations, with only an Iranian charge d'affaires in London,  instead of an ambassador. But Britain is unlikely to break off  all diplomatic relations with such an important Middle East  country and will be reluctant to impose sanctions.    The Iranian embassy refused to comment on today's events.    The Government is believed to be concerned that Iran was  planning to supply money and arms to the IRA.    Later, Mr. Ansari told ITN's Lunchtime News that his meeting  with Mr Hogg was very friendly. ""I was informed about their  concern. I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact  with my country -- definitely it is not right.""     "

Scientists with the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said  yesterday that despite measures to phase out ozone-depleting  chemicals, such as the aerosol gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),  the layer will continue to be destroyed into the early part of  next century.    By 2005, the levels of ultraviolet light hitting Aberdeen  could be equivalent to those in mid-France.    Joe Farman, of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit  and the man who discovered the ozone hole over Antarctica in  1985, said the main threat could be to seedlings and  ""pollinating insects at the heart of the food chain.""    He said that to the best of his knowledge no research had  been carried out on the links between higher levels of UV and  insects such as bees increased levels of ultraviolet light may  damage the leaves of seedlings and kill insects by damaging  their genetic material.    As the ozone layer thins, environmentalists and medical  researchers fear that the levels of skin cancer will rise. The  UN has predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in the ozone layer  will lead to 300,000 more skin cancers a year and 1.75 million  cataracts.    Dr John Pyle of Cambridge University, chairman of the ozone  review group, said this was unlikely, particularly if people  took sensible protective measures such as wearing a hat and sun  cream.    The fifth report of the group, which was set up in 1985 by  the Department of the Environment and the Meteorological Office,  assesses the results from satellite measurements, aircraft and  field work. It finds that between May 1992 and May 1993 the  average global thickness of ozone fell by between 2 and 3 per  cent. Over northern Europe, however, winter levels of ozone  slumped by around 25 per cent between 1991 and 1993.    The scientists said the sharp decline was partly due to  unusual weather conditions, in particular a strong and  persistent anticyclone over the area, and the eruption of Mount  Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991.    They also said the destruction was triggered by a build-up  of  chlorine chemicals. Such chemicals, released from products such  as aerosols, refrigerants and fire extinguishers, have been  shown to be causing the hole over Antarctica, but these are the  first firm findings showing they are also damaging ozone over  the northern hemisphere.    The scientists said that measures under the Montreal  Protocol  to phase out CFCs and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by  1996 were working, with concentrations beginning to tail off.  Nevertheless, build-ups of breakdown chemicals, the actual ozone  killers, will persist into the next century, peaking between  2000 and 2005. This is likely to trigger a 20 to 25 per cent  average thinning over Britain and northern Europe since records  began in 1979. Dr Pyle said the hole over Antarctica was  unlikely to disappear until 2080.    The scientists also called on the Government to save  Snoopy, the C130 Herculese aircraft operated by the  Meteorological Research Flight at Farnham, Hampshire. Last week  The Times reported that the plane, which is involved  in crucial atmospheric research, was on a Ministry of Defence  hit list. While America and Germany are building new research  aircraft, Britain will have none if Snoopy goes.    Dr Pyle said the aircraft was not only vital for research,  but secured Britain a presence in scientific projects of  international importance.     "

Figures published by the European Commission yesterday will spare Britain potential embarrassment at today's Edinburgh summit. They show that the UK is no longer among the Community's legislative laggards. On the other hand, Italy and Belgium are still among the slowest to pass single market legislation through their national parliaments. The triumphant opening of the single market at midnight on December 31 is one of the aims of the British presidency, and EC leaders meeting in Edinburgh are certain to declare that the market is effectively complete, in spite of loopholes caused by delays and political compromises. The leaders will also have to admit that one of the single market's principal objectives - the lifting of border controls on people - will not be fully achieved until the end of 1993, if then. Britain leads opposition to abolishing passport checks. EC directives cannot take effect until they are transferred into national law, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC internal market commissioner, has continually stressed the need for effective implementation. After October 30 figures revealed that Britain, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and Italy were lagging behind their EC partners, Mr Bangemann wrote to their governments urging them to accelerate the legislative procedure before January 1. Britain and Spain have both taken his complaints to heart. According to figures compiled on December 8, they are now fifth and sixth in the league table, compared with eighth and 12th in the October list. Britain has transferred 81.2 per cent of the relevant measures, just above the Community average. Denmark, which has consistently been the most efficient at transferring legislation into national law, has tranposed 95.9 per cent of the laws.  The Financial Times   International Page 4  "
0,FT943-2256 ,"FT943-2256 _AN-EITEUAENFT 940920   FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Britain sees catches in EU fish plan      By ALISON MAITLAND   Britain said yesterday that it smelled 'a stinking fish' in European Commission plans for opening up European Union waters around Ireland to the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets in 1996. Mr Michael Jack, UK fisheries minister, said Britain would call on the commission at next week's fisheries council in Brussels to rethink proposals that were 'a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare'. The government has come under strong pressure from the fishing industry to oppose the plans, which are designed to share out access among member states to waters lying west of the UK, France and north-west Spain. Mr Jack said British fishermen feared the new rules were so complex that the huge Spanish fleet would be able to flout them with impunity. 'There's a very real worry that in some way an increase in Spanish fishing effort will be unleashed on these sensitive waters and there will be no means of controlling it,' he said. When they joined the community, Spain and Portugal were barred access to the so-called Irish Box, which covers the waters immediately surrounding Ireland. That exclusion ends on December 31 next year, although they will still not be allowed to fish in the Irish Sea for species subject to quotas. They will also remain barred from the North Sea. The commission has tabled two draft regulations covering access to the EU's 'western waters' for all member states and monitoring compliance by individual vessels with the new rules. It agreed the rules would not cause member states to lose quota and would entail no increase in fishing. However, its proposal to allocate countries with a fixed number of fishing days has run foul of the British government, which says its position is backed by Ireland and France. In a letter to 48 members of parliament from fishing constituencies released yesterday, Mr Jack questioned the way the allocation of days - known as Standard Vessel Days - had been calculated. 'It is not clear that the allocations of SVDs set out in the proposal would represent equitable allocations among member states or respect relative stability (existing quotas),' he said. Britain feared it had not been allocated enough days to fulfil its quotas, whereas Ireland might have been granted too many. He added that the proposals for monitoring compliance were complex and would impose 'excessive burdens on our fishermen'. Britain is particularly unhappy that the commission has left it up to member states to allocate days to individual vessels in their own fleets - a highly sensitive task - without prescribing how this should be decided. The council on September 28 is unlikely to decide this issue, which could drag on into next year. Mr Jack said Britain would present a 'practical and simple' alternative, but he was unable to give details beforehand.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-13040 ,"FT942-13040 _AN-ED0DLAB7FT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / Settling for fourth place      By BRUCE CLARK   For much of the post-war period, British politicians have been embarrassed to boast about their country's military prowess; but now Mr Malcolm Rifkind has suggested to Britons, and above all to his own rightwing supporters, a new source of pride - it might be dubbed the importance of being fourth. 'Only the United States, Russia and France can deploy as broad a range of capabilities . . .' as Britain, Mr Rifkind said yesterday, in one of few real sound-bites he had to offer reporters. His definition of strength is a carefully chosen one: there are many countries with far bigger land armies - Turkey, for example - and, by next year, the Royal Navy's total of 35 main surface ships will leave Britain as little better than a middle-ranking sea power. However, the basis for his statement is clear enough. By retaining its submarine-based nuclear deterrent, a land army in Europe and a host of minor ex-colonial commitments, Britain can certainly claim to be carrying out an extraordinarily wide range of duties for a country of its size. Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the British armed force: from the Falkland Islands to Belize to Gibraltar to Hong Kong. But several of the ex-colonial commitments are due to disappear imminently, and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind is referring simply to the geographical extension of Britain's commitment, then the country will not hold its fourth place for long. Britain will soon withdraw land forces from Belize and Berlin and and its naval presence in Bermuda is also due for the axe. By 1997 it must quit Hong Kong. Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out that the document confuses two things: the fact that Britain retains some minor colonial commitments, which are an accident of history, and the fact that Britain is still highly respected for the quality of its armed forces. The reputation of the British military should ensure the country a role  - in training, peace-keeping and as an arms exporter - far beyond its shores.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-3185 ,"FT942-3185 _AN-EFPDDAA0FT 940616   FT  16 JUN 94 / UK 'must push for total test ban'      By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent   Britain has this week made a welcome shift in its attitude to stopping nuclear tests but should go much further, according to a group of US arms control experts visiting London to lobby for a comprehensive test ban. The experts criticised US handling of the North Korean crisis, saying it had raised the stakes too quickly and left Pyongyang with no way to back down without losing face. 'We are pushing the North Koreans into a corner,' said Mr Paul Warnke, the US government's former head of arms control talks. The shift in British policy was indicated by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, in a parliamentary answer. He made it clear Britain would no longer insist any test ban treaty must contain loopholes that would allow small-scale explosions in the interests of safety. 'We now aim to use and develop alternative technologies,' the minister added, indicating Britain was confident computerised simulations could substitute adequately for nuclear explosions. Arms control advocates are lobbying hard for the five nuclear powers to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty at their negotiations in Geneva this year. They believe a test ban will help persuade smaller countries to agree to extension and consolidation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty when it comes up for renewal in 1995. Mr Warnke and his colleagues urged Britain to become an advocate of an early test ban, as opposed merely to following the US lead. They said Britain was wrong to insist that as many as possible of the world's potential nuclear 'miscreants' should sign up before any test ban treaty entered force. This stance could lead to fatal delays in installing a new non-proliferation regime. The Korean crisis had driven home the need for some internationally agreed arms control system, even if not all countries wanted it, because otherwise there would be no mechanism to isolate and punish wrongdoers. China wants to complete a series of nuclear tests before agreeing to a ban. In France, President Francois Mitterrand is a strong advocate of a ban, but right-wing opponents have reservations.

The declaration was signed in Downing Street on the second day of Mr Walesa's state visit to Britain and before an hour's talks between the two leaders, described as 'warm and friendly'. The four-page document disclosed that Britain had agreed to write off Pounds 750m (Dollars 1.3bn) of official Polish debt as part of the Paris Club's decision earlier this month to reduce by 50 per cent Poland's total official debts of Pounds 19bn (Dollars 33bn). Though Poland welcomed this move, Mr Walesa urged Britain in a speech at the Guildhall last night to make an even more generous gesture, as the US and France had done. The declaration said that Britain and Poland would 'encourage mutually beneficial economic and industrial co-operation and promote closer commercial contacts between the enterprises in our two countries.' Britain recognised the importance to Poland of increased western investment and would continue to encourage companies to invest there. The UK also promised to consider granting medium-term credits to Poland. In welcoming Poland's negotiations with the EC for associate membership, Britain stressed that the option of full membership should be available when Poland was able to meet the political and economic obligations involved. It was announced earlier that the bank SG Warburg had been chosen to act as consultants to the Polish government for its privatisation of 500 enterprises. The Foreign Office said that it had agreed in principle to finance this arrangement from the British government's five-year Pounds 50m 'Know-How Fund for Poland.' In his speech at the Guildhall, where he was the guest of the Lord Mayor of London, Mr Walesa said Poland had helped to eliminate the barriers which had divided Europe ideologically for 40 years. 'We do not want them replaced by economic barriers.'  The Financial Times   London Page 2 Photograph ALL SMILES, Mr John Major yesterday greeting Polish President Lech Walesa at Downing Street.

Deputy foreign ministers from Turkey, France, the United  States and Britain reviewed the implementation of the operation,  expressing their satisfaction with the work.

The JANA international affairs editor commented on this,  saying: This campaign is merely a repeated attempt on the part  of Britain to falsify the truth and abolish rationality. This  attempt is governed by a colonialist logic based on  misrepresentation, deception, and turning the given facts upside  down, if what gave rise to the British Government's rancor was  the contact of a certain party with the IRA.    As it recently confessed, it was in official contact with  this organization at a time when it was describing it as a  terrorist organization and anyone who had contact with its  members as a terrorist who supported terrorism.    But if the matter is related to aid from one party to  another, in Britain's history and the behavior of its  governments are matters which make it the first to be condemned  and the first against whom a campaign should be waged motivated  by the anger of peoples rather than those campaigns based on  falsification. It has been noticed that it was Britain who  received and provided support for the Iranian opposition. Now  it is trying to cover up this stance by waging its propaganda  campaign against Iran.    When it raises the Irish issue in this framework, it is  trying at the same time to deceive peoples' minds by diverting  attention to the essential cause of this problem which is its  occupation of Ireland and its determination to colonize this  country and deny Irish people the right to self-determination  and then has recourse to pinning its evil actions on others.    The Editor added that what Britain is complaining about  today  is its own doing, as it is the one which occupied Ireland and  the Irish people did not go to occupy Britain. It is also the  state which built an empire on colonizing peoples and draining  their wealth and is now reaping what its hands committed and  that empire and its limbs were cut off by the struggle of  peoples for freedom and independence. Britain has collapsed to  the point where it retreated to its capital London and in front  of which it is taking in its doorstep and might even retreat to  beyond this capital unless it submits to the logic of right and  law and abandons its behavior ruled by the colonialist and  guardianship mentality and becomes aware of the fact that the  resistance by the Irish -- whose fire is burning as the result  of its occupation -- is not caused by Iran or anyone else.  Britain has no other way to get out of this situation apart  from ending its occupation of Ireland and letting the Irish  people achieve self-determination.     "

Instead, a majority of Tory activists actually wants the  government's blocking powers to be increased.    The Central Office survey of 3,400 Tory party members across  Britain has been leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES and its findings  sent to John Major and Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.    Further evidence of Tory opposition to any dilution of  Britain's remaining sovereignty comes from a poll of 70  backbench Conservative MPs, conducted by THE SUNDAY TIMES over  the past three days. This shows a 3-1 majority against any  change in the present voting system in the EC Council of  Ministers, the [European] Union's key decision-making body.    Both surveys will increase party pressure on Hurd not to  give  ground at a critical meeting of European foreign ministers in  Brussels on Tuesday [22 March].    This has been called to find a way out of the voting rights  crisis caused by the EC's pending enlargement from 12 to 16  countries following the accession of Norway, Sweden, Finland and  Austria scheduled for next January.    One leading Euro-sceptic MP said yesterday that Major would  be forced to resign as prime minister if Britain climbed down on  the issue. Major would be challenged for the party leadership  in November, he said.    ""If this does not come out right, the bulk of the  Conservative party might feel that John Major no longer served  any useful purpose.""    Britain has 10 votes out of 76 under the current system of  voting and 23 are needed for a blocking minority. When Austria  and the Scandinavian countries join, the total number of votes  will rise to 90 and the number required for a veto -- if Britain  yields -- will rise to 27.    Britain and Spain want the blocking minority to remain at 23  but are under intense pressure from the other 10 countries.    The cabinet has authorised Hurd to make some concessions  because, without unanimous agreement, accession of the four new  members will be at risk    The confidential Central Office report on 400 group  discussions on European policy records ""a substantial majority""  in favour of larger countries, including Britain, having more  voting power at the expense of smaller countries. A small  majority favoured giving Britain ""additional rights of veto.""    Tory activists in Major's Huntingdon constituency said the  voting system should be based on financial contributions, giving  Britain and other large countries permanent membership on a new  governing body, reducing smaller countries to rotating  membership.    The survey was conducted by the Conservative Political  Centre, the Tory think-tank, to test grassroots opinion before  the European Parliament elections this June.    Surprisingly, Tory leaders are urged to minimise attacks on  Labour and fight a positive campaign. This reflects fears that  a negative campaign would result in a low turnout damaging the  party's prospects.    In THE SUNDAY TIMES poll 48 Tory MPs rejected any increase  in  the existing blocking minority, while 17 said it should be  raised in the interests of the Union's enlargement. There were  five ""don't knows.""    Tory MPs are reserving their judgment on whether they will  vote against the necessary legislation this autumn. Eight said  they would vote against the enlargement bill if Britain's right  of veto was reduced; 17 would support the bill, one would  abstain and 44 said they ""could not say"" at present.    Tory MPs who took part in THE SUNDAY TIMES survey said  preserving Britain's existing power of veto would prove popular  with the public. ""We either make a stand or we will have a  federal Europe,"" said Sir Rhodes Boyson, a member of the 1922  committee executive.    John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, said: ""The government has  got to stand absolutely firm at 23 votes. Any move from that,  even to 23.5 would be a defeat.""    Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: ""The government is telling  us that it is standing firm at the moment. A lot of people are  very doubtful about that.""    Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, denied  yesterday that the Tory party was split over Europe. He told  BBC radio: ""What there is in every party is a debate, and it is  unthinkable with historic change of these proportions taking  place there shouldn't be a debate.""    Tory sensitivity on Europe is shown by the refusal of party  managers to allow a debate at next weekend's meeting of the  party's central council in Plymouth.    Five local Tory associations have submitted motions to the  conference in defiance of a ruling that none will be accepted.     "
0,FT931-10127 ,"FT931-10127 _AN-DBJCVAEAFT 930210   FT  10 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Rethinking British defence   MR MALCOLM Rifkind, the British defence secretary, sought to pre-empt yesterday's report from the House of Commons select committee by rescinding some planned cuts in the country's armed forces - at a cost of 'only' Pounds 80m or one-third of 1 per cent of the defence budget. On Monday Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, announced a sweeping review of public expenditure in general, but appeared to exempt defence as a principal target. Yesterday the select committee duly reported, seeking even more concessions than Mr Rifkind had already offered. It may be concluded from these events that Britain is still far from a political consensus about the scale of its defence spending in a post-imperial world. The question that has haunted the debate for decades continues to hover. Is there a case for economically battered Britain to outspend its richer European neighbours, devoting 4 per cent of its economic output to defence, compared with 3.4 per cent for France and only 2.2 per cent for Germany? There are many signs that old lessons have not been learnt. In 1990 the statement Options for Change by the then defence secretary, Mr Tom King, suggested substantial reductions in force levels as a result of the end of the cold war, though even then the cuts in costs did not match the proposed cuts in manpower. With these cuts still not fully implemented, there is already talk of overstretch, which is merely the current term for describing the old problem of too few resources to match too many commitments. The select committee calls the overstretch 'chronic' and wants all planned cuts in ground forces to be stopped. Top tables The motives behind such thinking too often stem from a nostalgia for a country that was more powerful and relatively richer than it is today. More insidiously, attempts to keep up with defence spending spring from a desire to impress the Americans and to maintain a place at top tables. Almost invariably, however, the dilemma returns: Britain tries to do too much and, in the context of the latest public spending crisis, has to cut back. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has done something to develop the context for an alternative view. In a recent speech at Chatham House, he noted the trend towards international military intervention, whether of the peacekeeping or peacemaking variety, and envisaged for Britain a worthy rather than a leading role. His theme was that Britain cannot do everything towards which it feels morally or politically impelled. Burden-sharing Mr Hurd's analysis, however, stopped short of suggesting solutions. If Britain is to do less, who is to do more? In Europe, Germany? In Asia, Japan? If there is to be more burden-sharing, by what process is that burden to be shared: by ad hoc contributions of the kind which financed the war against Saddam Hussein, or via the United Nations, which is already bedevilled by the failures of some members to pay their dues? Nor is this a complete list of the awkward questions which lie ahead. If Britain is to cede more international defence activity to others, how long can it maintain its position as a permanent member of the UN Security Council? If it is seriously to consider relinquishing that seat, what price could it or should it seek in return? And within the European Community, how can a potential British desire for more burden-sharing be made to fit with its anxiety about more integrated EC defence structures? As the world seeks answers to these complex questions, Britain has much to offer. Its armed forces have a deserved reputation for professionalism. Its relationship with the sole superpower, the US, is special. Britain can do much to help modernise Nato, develop the Western European Union and cement bilateral links with France. It can also play a worthy part in international peacekeeping. But it cannot evade larger questions about the resources of its own economy or shifts in relative global economic and political standing. Mr Rifkind's concessions will comfort those who prefer old glories to harsher truths.   Countries:-  UnZited Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

0,FT932-1738 ,"FT932-1738 _AN-DFVCUAGSFT 930622   FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): Why Britain went wrong  -Finance      By MARK ARCHER   BRITISH PROTECTIONISM AND THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: OVERSEAS COMMERCIAL POLICY IN THE 1930s by Tim Rooth OUP, Pounds 40, 357 pages ON SEPTEMBER 21 1931 the UK abandoned the gold standard. On March 1 1932, when the Import Duties Act came into effect, Britain had finally adopted full protection. Thus within less than six months two of the great symbols of Britain's leadership of the 19th century international economy, the gold standard and free trade, had gone. Analysing both measures together, as Tim Rooth does in this commendable book, is vital to understand the history of UK PLC. Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 ignored the dramatic fall in the UK's share of world trade. Between 1890 and 1929 Britain's share of world exports in manufactures declined from 40.7 per cent to 20.4 per cent. Britain was exporting the wrong commodities to the wrong places, Empire countries such as India and Australia, where demand was weakest. Instead of meeting the challenge posed by its competitors by developing newer commodities, Britain had deflected it by finding new markets for old products, and pumping up demand by the export of capital. The result was high unemployment and deteriorating balance of payments. Enforced by the need to meet the challenge of the US, Britain's return to the gold standard aggravated the problems of UK exporters and made maintaining the value of sterling even more difficult. Support for protectionism was gaining ground even as the return to gold was made. By raising prices, Keynes thought tariffs would reduce real wage cost, the rigidity of which he saw as the prime cause of unemployment. A tariff could help solve unemployment without jeopardising the gold standard. Keynes did not favour devolution, because it would have undermined London as an international banking centre and might start a series of competitive devaluations. When devaluation happened, Keynes opposed tariffs, since by causing the exchange rate to appreciate, they would reduce output and have the opposite effect upon unemployment to that intended. So why were they introduced? Rooth's argument is that the Conservative majority in the National Government, led by Neville Chamberlain, was enacting the protectionist policies championed by Chamberlain's father, Joseph, in the 1890s. Public opinion was also pro-protectionist. A Bankers' Manifesto signed that year also complained that 'the sale of surplus foreign products in the British market has steadily grown.' The more banal truth, is that, like the luckless Norman Lamont, the government was simply trying to keep an eye on a 'variety of indicators.' They were as concerned about sterling, inflation, and the balance of payments, as much as about unemployment. The surprise is that Britain did manage to muddle through this period as successfully as she did, using protectionism to bargain for trade advantages in the markets of its chief suppliers of food and raw materials. Britain was still an important market for primary producers, within and outside the Empire. The depression, accentuated by the rise of protectionist barriers elsewhere, gave Britain enhanced economic leverage. Britain continued to favour the emergence of an Empire trading bloc for itself in the organisation of its tariffs. It had still not addressed its competitive weaknesses, but it was making the most of a weak hand when its competitors were even weaker. Once Germany became stronger in the 1930s, Britain's economic appeasement consisted of meeting the challenge by trying to agree on target markets. The true test came with America's departure from the gold standard. The Anglo-American trade agreement of 1938 was the first sign of the US wanting to wrest free trade back onto the agenda and to its own advantage. Even if the second world war had not consolidated its hegemony over the rest of the world, the writing was on the wall.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The gloves are off.  The wonder of it is that the question was not asked earlier.  Let us cut ourselves off, voices are saying within the  Government, and have done with it. The European Community was  founded in 1957, at the height of the Cold War. Its core  policy, agricultural subsidy, was devised at a time when hunger  was not unknown in Europe. The Cold War is over. Free trade is  now enshrined in the GATT treaty. Agricultural surpluses tower  to heaven. Why not get out?    There should be no embarrassment now in questioning the  point  of the whole European construction. Indeed, British Euro  sceptics might have attracted wider sympathy during the  Maastricht debate if they had drawn the logical conclusion of  their own arguments.    The Foreign Office was yesterday active with the sand  bucket,  fighting the spread of speculation. ""Complete rubbish,"" it said.  But it was clear last night that the extraordinary words imputed  to John Major -- ""I'll pull out of Europe"" -- emanate from a  clique which has the support of some senior members of the  Government and a widening section of the parliamentary party.    They are casting their eyes ahead to the 1996 negotiations,  which could begin as early as this autumn; and their objective  is to bounce Mr Major into an extreme position. They wish him  to fight federalism with a threat: that any further incursions  upon national sovereignty would cause Britain to uproot the tent  pegs in Brussels and depart.    As a serious proposition, from serious members of the  establishment, it has no precedent since the referendum of 1975.    After so many humiliations, the mood in Westminster is  lightheaded, nihilistic. Exasperated by detail, befuddled by  its defeats, parts of the Government, or at least the Tory  party, are prepared to debate the question of Europe from first  principles.    They are right to do so. The mere threat of withdrawal would  change the way the Government is viewed, both abroad and at  home. Too often, other countries have been able to drive Britain  into a corner because they know, or have hitherto assumed, that  Britain would never be so anarchic, so mad, as to deploy the  doomsday weapon. The threat could serve the Government well,  moreover, in the Euro election campaigns. Both Labour and  Liberal Democrats have left themselves badly exposed on the Euro  sceptical flank.    But if such a threat is to carry weight for long, there must  be a serious intention behind it. Could it ever be in Britain's  interests to depart? I know of only one reason for staying in  the Common Market. It is, however, quite a good one: If Britain  extricated herself from the pact she joined in 1973, the balance  of probability is that the remaining 11 would not disintegrate.    The Eurocrats would reel. The recriminations would be  shrill. But the organisation would not explode. The EC  Commission would continue to promulgate screeds of legislation.  These would cease to be directly applicable to Britain. But  the writ of Brussels would run through an ever wider dominion,  as first the Scandinavians and then the East Europeans joined.  With more than half our exports going to the Community, British  firms would have no choice but to conform with the standards,  weights, sizes, dimensions determined by the continentals. The  only difference would be that, out side, Britain would have no  way of influencing those standards to its advantage. Excluded  from the corridors of power, Britain would be unable to  safeguard her interests.    That is a good reason for staying in the EC. But as the  debate gathers way, as it seems likely to do, we will hear  plenty of bad reasons, not least from the Government. Some will  say we are now so intimately bound in that we could not  physically excise ourselves, that the union was now beyond  surgery.    In reality, withdrawal presents few practical difficulties.  Parliament would simply have to abrogate the Treaty of Rome, as  amended by the Single European Act and Maastricht. British MEPs  [Members of the European Parliament] would easily find  employment as ""consultants"" in Strasbourg or Brussels and  British ministers would no longer have to fly in for  interminable meetings in the Charlemagne building. Britain  would not even need to disengage its diplomatic representation  to Brussels, the 40 or so diplomats. Most of them would stay,  though as observers rather than negotiators.    Euro-enthusiasts of an old fashioned cast of mind, such as  Sir Edward Heath, might lament the offence caused to our  ""partners"" in Europe. On the other hand they perhaps exaggerate  the need to be polite to foreigners. They are not especially  polite to us.    Some, especially the Labour party, will feel we have to stay  on the inside if we wish to share in the defences of a giant  trading bloc, able to project its will in the face of Japan and  America, and the challenge of cut price labour from the Third  World. In fact, the opposite is true. If there is a commercial  reason for Britain staying in, it is to prevent such a fortress  Europe from being created.    Britain's farmers and John Gummer, former Agriculture  minister, are likely to say that departure would damage our  agricultural interests; and it is true that we have become  junkies of the Common Agricultural Policy as much as any other  EC country. Pump-primed by Brussels subsidies, British exports  of agricultural products rose by 7 percent per year during the  early 1980's. But the cost has been absurdly high, in food  prices and in the tax burden.    Local councils might protest that they would be cut off from  all those Brussels hand-outs from the regional and social funds.  It is true that the 12-star emblem would vanish from the signs  on inner-city developments and bypasses in Scotland. But we  could fund our own roads, schools and hospitals ourselves and  plough back, moreover, the billions that we contribute to the EC  budget.    The worst reason of all for remaining inside is the  widespread assumption that Brussels, ""Europe,"" would save us  from ourselves. It is a common middle-class sentiment that  Government, or Mr Major, is so lacking in direction that some  kind of Euro-government could scarcely be worse. On the  contrary, one could argue that is the EC's very tentacles which  undermine confidence in British institutions.    My own hunch is that pulling out of Europe might, at least  in  the first few years, cause an immense feeling of national  renewal. It would be intoxicating to cast off the incubus of  Brussels. It would end the wearisome arguments about  sovereignty, the confusion about who governs Britain. It would  be like winning the World Cup, or the wave of national unity at  the beginning of the Second World War.    But I think it would not last, for the one big reason I have  mentioned. British businessmen would face discrimination.  Investors in Britain would be deterred. As long as the Community  exists, we are better off making trouble from the inside. In  any case, the question is unlikely to present itself in those  terms.    In 1996, the issue will not be in or out. With so many new  countries presenting themselves for membership, it will be the  end of the old all-or-nothing EC compact. For the first time,  Britain will be able to choose from a menu of options. Some may  want tighter integration. Others may be able to content  themselves with little more than free trade. It is at that  point that battle will be joined in earnest between Europhiles  and Eurosceptics.     "

Mr Mohamed Sacirbey cited the convention against genocide and asserted that UK opposition to lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia was responsible for a massive loss of life. He accused Mr John Major, UK prime minister, of opposing lifting the arms ban for domestic political reasons. He said other countries were not blameless but Britain was accused because it was 'at the forefront' in maintaining the embargo. The UK foreign office last night indicated that the delegate's legal challenge brought the Bosnia debate back on to familiar territory.

He said: The door to  negotiation has been closed by the British. Responsibility for  the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on Hong  Kong's political system rests entirely on the British.    A reporter asked: On 24 February, Legco passed the  first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election  arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will next submit the  second-phase draft legislation to Legco for discussion. What  are your comments?    Shen Guofang said: Last December, before the Chinese and the  British had reached any agreement on district board election  arrangements, the British side submitted the first-phase draft  of legislation to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus  directly causing the termination of the talks between China and  Britain. Now, disregarding repeated dissuasion by China, and the  aspirations of every social level in Hong Kong for a settlement  of the question of the 1994-1995 election arrangements through  negotiation, the British side has had the first-phase draft  legislation on the 1994- 95 election arrangements passed by the  Hong Kong Legco and has decided to submit the second-phase draft  legislation to Legco for discussion. This fully shows that the  British do not have the sincerity to solve the question through  cooperation with the Chinese, and are bent on moving further on  this erroneous path.    Shen Guofang said: ""The door to negotiation has been closed  by the British. Responsibility for the disruption of  cooperation between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political  system rests entirely with the British. The Chinese side  reiterates that, without an agreement between China and Britain,  the framework of the three-tiered political system established  through British Hong Kong authorities, legislation cannot last  beyond 30 June 1997.""    Another reporter asked: The British side today published a  white paper which discloses the detailed contents of last year's  Sino- British talks. What are your comments on this?    Shen Guofang said: An understanding not to disclose to the  public the contents of the negotiations was reached between  China and Britain before the talks began last year. Britain's  unilateral publication of the contents constitutes a violation  of the understanding reached between the two sides. The Chinese  cannot but react in due course.    Asked about the comments of Australian Foreign Minister  Evans  who, in a recent television interview in Australia, expressed  strong support for Chris Patten's political package, Shen  Guofang said the current issue between China and Britain on Hong  Kong was not whether the territory should have democracy, but  whether a commitment was to be honored. There had been a series  of agreements and understandings between the two countries on  the evolution of Hong Kong's political system. But the British  were now trying to repudiate them and have their own way. This  was absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese.    He said: In the more than one hundred years of British rule  there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong. It is with  ulterior motives that Britain is pushing Chris Patten's package  in Hong Kong before it leaves. It is futile to defend the  package.    Shen Guofang emphasized: The maintenance of Hong Kong's  social stability and economic prosperity is not only in the  interests of China and Britain, but also of those countries that  have economic interests in Hong Kong. The question of Hong Kong  is a matter between China and Britain before 30 June 1997, and  from 1 July 1997, it will be purely an internal affair of China.  It is inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong  political affairs.     "

He  said that the details of Goodlad's visit would be made public in  late June and would not be revealed at the present stage.    Before the relevant diplomatic consultations had been  completed, the British side became too impatient to wait any  longer and disclosed this information. Moreover, it stressed  that Goodlad would limit his discussions to Sino-British  relations, including business cooperation and cooperation on  international affairs, but would not talk about the Hong Kong  issue.    People with a discerning eye could see that British  businessmen were unhappy with the state of Sino-British  relations, and some members in both chambers of the British  Parliament have openly criticized the current China policy  pursued by the British Government. All other industrial  countries have attached great importance to the giant China  market, have successively increased their economic and trade  cooperation with China, and have been pursuing a friendly and  cooperative diplomatic policy toward China. Even the United  States, the leading Western country, has adjusted its policy on  MFN and the human rights issue and has made efforts to expand  its economic and trade exchanges and develop the China market.  The exchange of visits by vice premiers and ministers was  arranged; however, Britain does not have much bargaining power  in its relations with China.    Britain has been pursuing a policy of confrontation. In  particular, after Patten dished out the ""three violation""  political reform package in Hong Kong, Britain disregarded the  ""consultation and cooperation"" principle stipulated in Annex II  of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, broke the confidentiality  principle regarding its diplomatic contacts, and violated the  understanding that no unilateral action with effects extending  beyond 1997 could be taken before agreement was reached through  diplomatic channels. Patten also alleged that ""secret diplomacy  and agreement"" were gone forever. The British side launched  opinion and propaganda offensives launched and used television,  radio, and newspapers to propagate Patten's scheme. They  continued to act perversely and willfully and had no scruples  about terminating the talks and making the political structure  different from that designed by China for the post-1997 period.  In pursuing this confrontational policy, the British  authorities flagrantly played the ""international card."" They  thought that, if other Western countries supported them, they  might be able to intimidate China. The situation, however, did  not develop as Britain expected. The Western industrial  countries, including the United States, all attached importance  to their own economic interests, and were not willing to be  Britain's pawn. Thus, Britain's ""international card"" was not  supported by other Western countries, and Britain found it  difficult to continue to pursue the policy of isolating China by  itself. This policy would only end up isolating Britain.    After Clinton announced that MFN would no longer be linked  to  human rights on 26 May, Britain found that the situation had  become extremely unfavorable and it also hastily changed its  position and tried to warm up its relations with China. It then  decided to proceed from the low-level contacts at the vice  minister level, but this was not a bad thing.    It was prudent not to announce the agenda beforehand and  even  to say that the visit will not be related to the Hong Kong  issue. This may leave more leeway and may enable both sides to  move onto the course of quiet diplomacy. In the past, megaphone  diplomacy only played into the hands of some politicians and  enabled them to put on political shows to serve their selfish  calculations; such a practice was certainly detrimental to the  resolution of problems. It only served to completely destroy  the foundation for mutual trust and diplomatic cooperation. The  Foreign Office is certainly the organ in the British Government  that is in charge of relations with China. If Britain is  sincerity about conducting a diplomatic dialogue with China and  solving problems between the two countries through  consultations, China is naturally willing to maintain contracts  through diplomatic channels. The Joint Declaration explicitly  stipulates the channels and forms of contacts between the  Chinese and British Governments. So, if the British side is  willing to follow the consultation channels specified in the  Joint Declaration, China certainly welcomes this.    The first of these channels is the Sino-British Joint  Liaison  Group, and the second is diplomatic consultations between the  two governments. Certain changes have indeed occurred, and both  sides have become more willing to conduct consultations more  positively. The discussions on the issues of military land,  localization of laws, the court of final appeal, and the Special  Administrative Region passports have all made certain progress.  The holding of a Joint Liaison Group meeting on 21 June also  showed that some issues had moved closer to resolution. The  British side has now also adopted a more realistic attitude  toward the airport financial issue. As the Chinese side did not  raise any objections, it seems that an agreement will be reached  soon.    Some press reports have pointed out that the controversy  over the political structure has become a thing of the ""past.""  If this reflects the opinion of the British side, then it will  not help the thaw in Sino-British relations. The breakdown of  the talks on the political structure was caused by the British  side, and the consequences cannot be undone. The three-tier  councils in Hong Kong must be reorganized in 1997. However, it  seems that the British side is still trying to move even further  away on the political structure issue. Some people are now  calling for direct elections arrangements which deviate more  radically from the Basic Law; some people are calling for  revising more laws in Hong Kong; and some people are even trying  to shake the executive-led government structure... All this  shows that some people have never given up the confrontational  policy. The breakdown of the talks on the political structure  is indeed an event of the past, but the dispute over the  political structure has not come to an end. The fundamental  reason lies in the fact that the British side still refuses to  give up its ""three violation"" position. Recently, some people  in the British Hong Kong authorities continued to insist that  China cannot reorganize the three-level council structure built  up unilaterally by the British side. This proves that the  dispute over the political structure has not yet come to an end.  Moreover, these remarks in fact foreshadow the future  development of the dispute. If the British side really wants to  cooperate, it must improve its deeds and attitudes to  demonstrate its sincerity. If a benign cooperation atmosphere  can be created before Goodlad visits China, then he may not  return home empty-handed after his trip in July.     "

Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons. There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and for defence spending to be reduced progressively following the end of the cold war. But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference in the way they did in the mid-1980s. The party endorsed each of the proposals to maintain defence spending put forward by Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet possible new threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another raid' on the defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in Northern Ireland led to a reduction in troops there. He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in Bosnia, vetoing any attempt by the UN to lift the arms embargo in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Campbell said lifting the embargo on the Bosnian Moslems and other factions would destroy the efforts of UK peace-keeping troops in the region. 'If it is lifted, the position of UN forces, particularly our own, will become intolerable. Their withdrawal will be perilous in the extreme,' he said. Ms Liz Mayer, a delegate from Islington, north London, said Britain had to reduce defence spending if it was to regenerate its industrial base. 'We cannot afford not to adopt such policies,' she said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.     P8651 Political Organizations.

He faced  the tricky dilemma of maintaining Britain's voting powers to  block EU legislation while not threatening the enlargement  process, which Britain backs.    He was applauded by Tory backbenchers at a private meeting  in  the Commons tonight after returning from Brussels, where he and  fellow foreign ministers reached deadlock after 10 hours of  bitter talks.    Britain is refusing to budge from the present position where  23 votes (from the 76 available among the 12 member states) can  block Brussels legislation. All the other countries -- except  Spain -- say that with the addition of Finland, Austria, Norway  and Sweden, that figure should increase to 27 from the 90 votes  then available.    Negotiations will resume in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March]  --  with the prospect of one of the biggest Euro-rows blowing up for  years.    But Mr Hurd warned Tory MPs that delay could threaten  Community enlargement, which Britain champions.    Equally any weakening of Britain's position could create  fresh Tory strife which could have a calamitous effect on the  party's showing at the June Euro-elections.    Mr Hurd bluntly told the MPs that enlargement was something  they had worked for for many years and for very good national  reasons. ""This is the kind of Europe we want,"" he said. ""It  clearly would not be sensible to scrap that policy just when it  had succeeded. We are not prepared to accept an automatic  mechanical upgrading of the qualifying majority from 23 to 27.""    But he warned them that to delay enlargement indefinitely  could risk the collapse of the enterprise.    Mr Hurd told his colleagues, at the meeting which lasted  more  than an hour, that he did not want to get into details of the  ideas coming forward. But he declared: ""I have not shifted at  all.""    Even so, MPs expect the days between now and Tuesday to be  occupied with attempts at compromise -- without, in the words of  one Tory Euro-dissident, ""selling Britain down the river.""    There were, Mr Hurd told MPs, people ""trying to breach the  gap.""    Meanwhile, Tory Euro-rebels -- who caused such havoc during  the Parliamentary passage of the Maastricht legislation -- are  tonight standing four-square behind Mr Hurd. But the growing  fear among Tory business managers is that if Britain is forced  to compromise and weaken her position, the Euro-storm will flare  up uncontrollably again.    Mr Hurd, however, has told colleagues since the meeting that  when he said that support was what he needed, it was forthcoming  ""beyond the ordinary."" His clear message was: ""We will just go  on until we get there.""    But he remained tight-lipped about his tactics, saying that  he was in the middle of difficult and delicate negotiations.  Plainly he did not wish to expose his hand to his opponents  ahead of the next Brussels encounter. [passage omitted]     "

The contributors will be on parade at Labour rallies during the campaign.

In a speech reasserting his own political authority in the cabinet, Mr Hurd publicly derided those who thought Britain could turn its back on Europe. The comments contrasted sharply with the anti-Brussels remarks earlier this week of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Hurd's speech to Tory activists at the party's spring conference in Plymouth, left the impression he was delivering an implicit warning to the prime minister not to cede ground to the party's right-wing Eurosceptics. Later in the day, the foreign secretary coupled his strong words with a clear signal that Britain could compromise on the voting issue as long as its European partners give ground. As he flew to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece last night, he said the dispute would sooner or later be resolved: 'At the end of the day there is agreement. That's the way the Community works. That's the way it will work this time.' Mr Hurd's Plymouth speech appeared to deliver a thinly veiled rebuke to those in the cabinet who have turned the present votes row between Britain and its partners into a broader onslaught against the European Union. The traditionally sceptical tone of right-wing cabinet ministers like Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has more recently been echoed by similar sentiments from Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine - both self-avowed pro-Europeans, but also potential successors to Mr Major in any leadership contest. But the foreign secretary told party workers to call a halt to the 'lunatic' discussion of whether they were pro- or anti-European. Instead they had to grasp the central message: 'The future of Britain rests in Europe.' Mr Hurd's untypically tough language in Plymouth appeared to reflect his growing frustration at the way in which the dispute over majority voting once the Union is enlarged next year has shifted the centre of gravity among Tory MPs towards the Eurosceptics. He insisted he was as determined as anyone to fight for Britain's interests in Europe but the Conservatives must reject a 'sour, defensive attitude which concentrates exclusively on the negative things about the European Union'. Speaking after his address, Mr Hurd said the cabinet had agreed on Thursday that it must fight a positive, pro-European campaign in the critical elections to the Strasbourg parliament on June 9. Mr Major, who is to address the closing session of the Plymouth conference later today, is now expected to tone down attacks on Brussels. He will be joined on the platform by both Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke. It also emerged yesterday that the cabinet agreed this week that all future ministerial pronouncements on Europe must in future be cleared through 10 Downing Street in order to minimise the appearance of divisions. Mr Hurd told his colleagues on Thursday of the need to maintain a positive and consistent line if the Conservatives are not to suffer heavy losses in the June Euro-elections. The foreign secretary offered a detailed assessment of the economic and security realities which meant that Britain could not detach itself from Europe. He concluded: 'Unless we can lift our sights we shall put at risk Britain's position.' Mr Hurd stressed that this did not mean that Britain could not argue its case strongly in Europe.

0,FT931-10381 ,"FT931-10381 _AN-DBICOADMFT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / French outburst over UK may be a cry for help: Prime Minister Beregovoy's attack on British policies was not solely for home consumption      By WILLIAM DAWKINS   THE outburst against Britain last week by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister - triggered by Hoover's decision to close a vacuum cleaner factory in Dijon and shift production to Scotland - was one of the stiffest public criticisms ever heaped by one European Community head of government upon another. But there is more to it than meets the eye. French officials stressed that while they did not want to spark a diplomatic row, Mr Beregovoy's statement - that Britain was heading down a dead-end - was not only heartfelt, but it was a symptom of a general malaise, deeper than the Hoover problem. This includes anxiety over Britain's refusal to sign the EC social charter - designed to reduce differences in labour conditions between community countries - its delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on monetary and political union, and the competitive advantage accorded to British exports by the fall in sterling's value after its exit from the European monetary system. A few days earlier, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, had criticised Britain's policies of 'every man for himself'. In short, Britain looks a decreasingly reliable friend at a time when France needs all the help it can get to counterbalance growing German power. 'We need Britain, but it is not always there, especially on many European issues. This weighs on many other subjects,' said a French foreign office official. As Mr Beregovoy said a day earlier: 'One must know if Great Britain wants to be a full part of Europe. . . Great Britain must be placed in front of its responsibilities.' The shadow of next month's parliamentary elections, in which the ruling Socialists are set for a humiliating defeat, helps to explain why the government is in no mood to make friendly gestures to London. One of Mr Beregovoy's officials explained that the fight over Hoover was all part of the government's attempts to defend its European policies in the face of sceptics in the opposition Gaullist RPR. The Gaullists based their Maastricht referendum campaign on the theme of how the EC could harm powerless French citizens. 'I recognise it was a bit quick tempered. . . but Britain has been taken a bit as a counter-model in an election campaign in which, to put it very bluntly, social policy on the left stands against economic liberalism on the right,' the Beregovoy aide explained. Just how much relations with Britain have become part of the election campaign was underlined when Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR member of parliament who led the anti-Maastricht campaign, told the newspaper Le Monde that France and Britain should seek more common positions on European policy. But how serious are the other sore points? Mr Beregovoy cares deeply about the social charter, which he said was essential to getting ordinary people to support European construction. He even claimed that Mr Major could increase his parliamentary majority by signing the charter, an idea likely to cause merriment in Westminster. He made no reference to the attacks on the franc in his criticism of Britain, but there is a general suspicion in French government and opposition circles that there is US and UK political pressure to break the link between the franc and the D-Mark, defence of which has the status of a religious crusade among mainstream French politicians. Even the mild Mr Raymond Barre, a former prime minister, last week denounced 'a political assault' from 'Anglo-Saxon circles' against the franc/D-Mark parity and the Franco-German alliance. Meanwhile, France has just started to feel the effects of sterling's competitive devaluation. This is unlikely to improve tempers in the government. UK exports to France rose 5.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, according to the British government. Yet all this is unlikely to spark a serious diplomatic row. Neither side wants one, as French and British diplomats in Paris emphasised. Some British Conservative MPs did react angrily, accusing Mr Beregovoy of electioneering. If he was indeed electioneering, it fell on deaf ears. The day after, not a single French national newspaper reported his outburst.   Countries:-  FrZance, EC.     UnZited Kingdom, EC.

Irfan denounced Britain saying London had adopted the  dirtiest policy for the destruction of Bosnia.    The foreign minister arrived here on Friday [10 June] at the  invitation of Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati for talks  with Iranian officials on Balkan problems.    In an exclusive interview with the TEHRAN TIMES, Irfan  denied  the British allegation that the Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo  circulated a letter in which London was blamed for the  deteriorating situation in Bosnia.    ""Not Iran, but we, Bosnians, circulated that letter which  mentioned simple facts,"" Irfan said.    British policy on Bosnia is transparent and no document is  needed to prove that London has adopted the disgusting course  against Bosnian Muslims, Irfan said.    He scoffed at the logic of Britain, France and Russia who  claim that the arms embargo has been imposed on former  Yugoslavia to curb bloodshed in that war-torn country.    ""This assumption is wrong,"" he said. ""Bloodshed could have  been restricted if there would have been a balance of weapons  between the Muslims and Serbs,"" he said.    ""The continuation of the arms embargo is one of the reasons  we consider Russia, Britain and France partners in the crimes of  the Serbs,"" Irfan said.    ""Bosnia is not situated in Latin America or Africa, it is  sitting in the heart of Europe, that claims to be the most  civilized,"" Irfan said, adding that what is going on in Bosnia  is the most shameful issue for the West.    He disputed with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias  who  in a recent statement from Tehran said that the Bosnian issue  belongs to Europe and the fact is Europe does not want an  Islamic state in that continent.    However, he said, there are a great number of open-minded  people in Europe who accept Muslims and Islam and they denounce  the feelings of apprehension for Islam.    ""We are a peaceful nation and do not want to bother others,""  Irfan said.     "

The expulsion order is the latest in a  series of rows between the two countries.    Iran's charge d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was told of the  decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see  Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg, according to THE  GUARDIAN newspaper.    The Foreign Office refused to comment on the expulsion, but  officials confirmed the meeting took place.    The expulsion follows a row over British charges that the  Iranian intelligence services had been in contact with the IRA.  Tehran denied the charge and claimed that Britain had bugged  its London embassy.    Relations between Britain and Iran have been strained since  the Islamic revolution in 1979. Ties between the two countries  were severed in 1989 over the Salman Rushdie affair, when  Iranian religious leaders issued a fatwa [Islamic legal ruling]  calling for the killing of the author.

Thanks to the labour market reforms of the past decade, he said, Britain would be able to sustain a higher level of employment without succumbing to inflationary pressures than in the early 1980s. Mr Portillo told the OECD annual ministerial meeting that Britain was continuing those reforms with measures to restrain unofficial strikes. Changes in education and vocational training would lead to higher standards and a better qualified workforce. There was a danger, however, that European Community social policies could intensify unemployment by making labour markets less flexible. The draft EC directive on working time, which Britain opposes, could impose an additional cost of around Pounds 5bn on UK employers, he said. Mr Portillo underlined that he and other ministers from the OECD's 24 industrialised member states saw 'no quick fix' to the problem of unemployment. But confidence was returning to Britain, he said. The full benefits of lower inflation and the drop in interest rates from 15 per cent in October 1990 to 10 per cent today had yet to come through.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

By accusing Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl of masterminding a German ""racket""  to take over Europe and then comparing him to Adolf Hitler, British Minister of  Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley -- who resigned under fire last Saturday --  neatly fits the stereotype of the narrow-minded, xenophobic Englishman. However  appropriate to Ridley himself, this assessment trivializes the true nature of  British concerns over the impending unification of Europe and its long-term  meaning for North America.    Like most of their European counterparts, the bulk of British businessmen and  the ruling Conservatives, including Ridley, strongly favor some form of  European union, and a broader alliance with Eastern Europe and non-European  Economic Community member states. Their problems focus not so much on the  principle of integration but on the future relationship of Europe with the rest  of the world.    ""Most people in the British business class want a united Europe, but they want  to keep the global market open,"" said one London executive, who is close to  leading Conservative circles. ""The French and Germans have their first interest  always in Europe. There's a huge gap in the emphasis between us and them.""    Viewed from this perspective, the British, far from conforming to their insular  image, actually stand, along with the Dutch, as the strongest advocates of a  cosmopolitan and open Europe -- closely tied to trading partners in North  America, Asia and other regions of the world. This globalist view conflicts  strongly with those on the Continent, where a united Europe means a challenge  to the long-entrenched economic power of North America and of Japan and the  Pacific Basin.    Americans and others around the world have been slow to focus on this latest  permutation of Euronationalism and its potential threat to the U.S. position in  the world. Already, Italy's Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis and French  President Francois Mitterrand's adviser, Jacques Attali, see in the rise of the  ""new Europe"" a harbinger of U.S. decline in international science.    Having dismissed the supposedly declining United States, the Euronationalists  primarily see the European Community as a means to resist further economic  advances by the Asian-Pacific Countries. Attali, recently named director for  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, envisions the new united  Europe emerging along with Japan as one of the two ""cores"" of the advanced  industrial world. France's willingness to ally with its historic German enemy  -- a posture that Ridley compared to that of subservient ""poodles"" -- stems  from a deep-seeded fear of Japan. ""They have an appetite for revenge, they have  a desire to conquer the world,"" claimed Edith Cresson, France's Minister for  European Affairs. ""They buy the Rockefeller Center, things that are  significant.""    To the British, such a vision of Europe threatens not only their long-standing  ties to the United States but their basic economic interests. Although Britain,  like other major European countries, now does a majority of its product trade  on the Continent, its economy is far more dependent on investments, financial  flows and technological links with non-European partners. In a European  superstate cut off from the global economy, many fear Britain would become a  second-rate power compared with France or Italy, not to mention Germany.    ""Our links to the world are our last power base. If we didn't have our  connections with the Americans and others we'd become a minor state, a state on  the fringe of Europe,"" said Sue Birney, professor at the Canfield School of  Management near London and an expert on the dynamics of the British economy.  ""It's what we are . . . . It's our history, it's our skill.""    Nowhere is this more true than in London, the European financial capital that  remains the core of Britain's last claim to worldwide prominence. As a center  for stocks, financial consulting, accounting and other services, the financial  center dominates Europe, with a volume of outstanding loans three times those  of France and almost six times those of its German rivals. Only Tokyo comes  close as an international source of debt capital.    London's pre-eminence is based not on the strength of the British or even  European economy, but on its critical links to other critical money centers.  Japanese, U.S. and other non-EC banks, for example, account for roughly  two-thirds of the international loans made from London, while other EC  countries account for a mere 15%.    The globalism of British financial circles, traditionally a critical pillar of  the Conservative Party, also shows in their investment patterns. In contrast to  those on the Continent who see a European resurgence set against a backdrop of  a declining American and a growing Asian threat, British capitalists continue  to hedge their bets, keeping their largest investments in regions outside of  Europe.    Throughout the 1980s, British firms solidified their position as the  pre-eminent investors in the United States, with 1988 flow levels running  nearly twice the level for the entire European Community. British interests  also remain closely tied to more far-flung regions such as Africa and Asia. In  Hong Kong, the estimated book value of British-controlled holdings is estimated  to be as high as $15 billion.    At the same time, Britain also began depending on non-EC investment. Last year,  Britain attracted at least 38 U.S. projects, the most in Europe and more than  twice the number for West Germany or France. They also received nearly half  Japan's roughly $12 billion direct investment in the European Community, more  than six times that in Germany or France.    Particularly critical has been investment in Britain's long-deteriorating  industrial sector. Largely incapable of competing with West German and other  continental powers in such fields as electronics and automobiles, Britain has  turned to the United States and Japan for expertise and industrial investment.    In Scotland's high-tech ""Silicon Glen,"" U.S. firms now account for roughly  four-fifths of manufacturing. Similarly, British-made Japanese Hondas, Nissans  and Toyotas -- mostly from sparkling new plants -- along with locally made  Fords and Vauxhalls (General Motors) increasingly dominate British roads.    As in financial services, such linkages create British political attitudes in  conflict with both their major continental counterparts and neo-mercantilist  European bureaucrats in Brussels. Britain has been feuding bitterly, for  example, with the European Commission's plans to limit Japanese cars made in  Britain with 80% European components as ""imports."" That move could essentially  throttle any resurgence in this once vibrant British industry because the cars  would be counted within quotas for Japanese imports.    Given these realities, Britain is likely to emerge in the coming decade as the  strongest advocate within Europe of a political economy friendly toward the  United States, as well as the Pacific nations. Today, fashion calls for the  United States to abandon its long-standing ""special relationship"" with Britain  for the embrace of Germany and other continental European states. A more  prudent course would be to remain close to Britain -- a nation whose economic  realities, as well as historical ties, make them our most reliable ally on a  potentially hostile continent.

THATCHER CALLS THE HANGING  OF JOURNALIST 'BARBARIC.'      From Times Wire Services      LONDON      Britain on Thursday recalled its ambassador from Iraq and halted ministerial  contacts with the government of President Saddam Hussein to protest Baghdad's  hanging of a London-based journalist it accused of spying.    ""Thatcher wanted him alive. We sent him in a box,"" Information Minister Latif  Nassayif Jassim said in breaking the news of the Thursday morning execution in  Baghdad.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had led the campaign to repeal the  death sentence imposed on 32-year-old Farzad Bazoft. Bazoft was working for The  Observer, a British weekly, investigating reports of an explosion at an Iraqi  military facility when he was arrested.    Iraq alleged that Bazoft had spied for Israel and Britain, charges that Bazoft  and his colleagues denied.    ""It is an awful day for the newspaper,"" said Observer Editor Donald Trelford.  ""We have had one of our number killed for simply being a reporter.""    Trelford and about 200 journalists held a vigil outside the heavily guarded  Iraqi Embassy here until word of Bazoft's execution broke. Journalists left a  single candle burning in Bazoft's memory in St. Bride's Church, Fleet Street,  London's former newspaper row.    Hussein had said repeatedly that his country did not fear Britain's anger in  executing the journalist, and the information minister repeated this after the  execution.    ""It seems the British could not understand our psychology that we are not  intimidated,"" Jassim said.    Thatcher said: ""This is a very, very grave and serious matter. The Iraqi  government's action is an act of barbarism which is deeply repugnant to all  civilized people.""    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced that Ambassador Harold Walker is being  recalled from the Iraqi capital. Hurd called off a trade mission to Iraq and  said all ministerial visits have been halted.    Hurd also said that all six Iraqi military trainees in Britain are being  ordered to leave the country. But he said that trade sanctions would likely  harm Britain and ""not alter the stance of this regime"" in Iraq, so there were  no plans to implement them.    Britain has a trade surplus of about $648 million with Iraq.    In Washington, the Bush Administration expressed regret Thursday but did not  join the strong condemnation of the execution.    Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist, was detained in September near a military  industrial complex south of Baghdad. He was investigating reports that hundreds  of people had died in an explosion at the complex in August.    A British nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, was convicted on charges that she drove  Bazoft to the Al Iskandaria military complex and was sentenced to 15 years in  prison.    Robin Kealy, the British general consul in Baghdad, visited Bazoft shortly  before his hanging at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.

THATCHER CALLS THE HANGING  OF JOURNALIST 'BARBARIC.'      From Times Wire Services      LONDON      Britain on Thursday recalled its ambassador from Iraq and halted ministerial  contacts with the government of President Saddam Hussein to protest Baghdad's  hanging of a London-based journalist it accused of spying.    ""Thatcher wanted him alive. We sent him in a box,"" Information Minister Latif  Nassayif Jassim said in breaking the news of the Thursday morning execution in  Baghdad.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had led the campaign to repeal the  death sentence imposed on 32-year-old Farzad Bazoft. Bazoft was working for The  Observer, a British weekly, investigating reports of an explosion at an Iraqi  military facility when he was arrested.    Iraq alleged that Bazoft had spied for Israel and Britain, charges that Bazoft  and his colleagues denied.    ""It is an awful day for the newspaper,"" said Observer Editor Donald Trelford.  ""We have had one of our number killed for simply being a reporter.""    Trelford and about 200 journalists held a vigil outside the heavily guarded  Iraqi Embassy here until word of Bazoft's execution broke. Journalists left a  single candle burning in Bazoft's memory in St. Bride's Church, Fleet Street,  London's former newspaper row.    Hussein had said repeatedly that his country did not fear Britain's anger in  executing the journalist, and the information minister repeated this after the  execution.    ""It seems the British could not understand our psychology that we are not  intimidated,"" Jassim said.    Thatcher said: ""This is a very, very grave and serious matter. The Iraqi  government's action is an act of barbarism which is deeply repugnant to all  civilized people.""    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced that Ambassador Harold Walker is being  recalled from the Iraqi capital. Hurd called off a trade mission to Iraq and  said all ministerial visits have been halted.    Hurd also said that all six Iraqi military trainees in Britain are being  ordered to leave the country. But he said that trade sanctions would likely  harm Britain and ""not alter the stance of this regime"" in Iraq, so there were  no plans to implement them.    Britain has a trade surplus of about $648 million with Iraq.    In Washington, the Bush Administration expressed regret Thursday but did not  join the strong condemnation of the execution.    Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist, was detained in September near a military  industrial complex south of Baghdad. He was investigating reports that hundreds  of people had died in an explosion at the complex in August.    A British nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, was convicted on charges that she drove  Bazoft to the Al Iskandaria military complex and was sentenced to 15 years in  prison.    Robin Kealy, the British general consul in Baghdad, visited Bazoft shortly  before his hanging at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.    In a British Broadcasting Corp. interview, Kealy said Bazoft looked  ""hollow-eyed and subdued"" and repeated that he was not a spy.    Bazoft, a stateless Iranian, was the son of an Iranian National Oil Co.  manager. He never returned to Iran after moving to Britain as a teen-ager.

Everything seems to have driven John Major to prompt  this European crisis. As far as politics is concerned, the  facts are well known. Unappreciated by his electorate, who  recently humiliated him by granting Labor a triumph in the  European elections, the British prime minister is, above all,  unpopular within his own party. Indeed, the Conservatives accuse  him of lacking charisma, while the Right of his party -- which  has not forgiven him for betraying Thatcher and which accuses  him of being too European (no less!) -- is just waiting for its  chance for revenge.    So John Major had everything to gain from being tough in  Corfu, because in that way he disarmed the Thatcherites while at  the same time displaying strength of character, which hitherto  has not been regarded as his foremost quality.    The second reason for Britain's veto is less petty. True,  the Belgian prime minister -- from whom John Major wanted to  withhold the presidency of the Commission -- is the opposite of  an extreme economic liberalist and therefore of a British  Conservative. A Christian Democrat, but from the left-wing of  this movement, Jean- Luc Dehaene is indeed, from the political  viewpoint, another Delors, imbued with social Catholicism;  convinced that it is the state that creates the difference  between a market economy and the law of the jungle; and, last, a  supporter of a Europe that is present on the international scene  and whose influence extends beyond that of a free trade area.    All this is a matter for a genuine debate -- a political  Europe versus a free trade Europe; a Europe of social consensus  versus a laissez-faire Europe; the Europe of the new ideological  Right versus the Europe of the social-democratic and  Christian-social center.    Then there is the question of the historical vision. Here  there is no debate. The facts are clear to all: John Major's  Britain is simply blind. It refuses to see, first, that the  United States of the post-communist era has its mind mainly on  regaining its economic health, that leading the world is the  least of its concerns, and that it therefore no longer needs a  Britain which, halfway between itself and Europe, will represent  it there.    Britain no longer has a future as a forward post of the  United States. Its future is Europe. It has no other, but,  incapable of acknowledging this obvious truth, it fails to see  that it could perform an exceptional role within the European  Union.    A crisis is in fact looming within Europe, because of the  influence that Germany is acquiring. It is the Union's most  populous country, and also the one which will derive the  greatest benefits from it. Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden  -- the four states that will join the Union next year -- are  closer to the Germanic world than to France, Britain, or  southern Europe. Already Europe is sliding toward the north,  toward Protestantism and austerity. And this is just the first  step. Central Europe is knocking on the Union's door. It will  enter, too, and this part of Europe is, from every viewpoint --  historical, cultural, linguistic, and of course economic --  indissolubly linked to Germany.    Having been invented by the French, the united Europe is  becoming a German Europe. It is no conspiracy. It is worse  than that. It is geography that is dictating this, because  united Germany is at the center of the western part of the  continent, which now extends as far as the borders of the former  USSR.    Apart from the Germans, who are terrified by this situation,  each country is behaving as though the collapse of the Wall had  changed nothing. The French in particular still base their  entire foreign policy on strengthening the ""Franco-German axis.""  But some day, doubtless soon, the malaise will surface. If  only it wanted to, Britain could, by making a real commitment to  Europe, become the guarantor of the continental balance, helping  to counterbalance Germany's power.    Britain needs Europe as much as Europe needs it. And yet  because of Britain Europe is losing time. And losing itself.     "

The conventional view in London is that, after a tense period during the first 15 months of the Bush administration, relations between the US and Britain have improved considerably. Since last November Mr Bush and Mr John Major have worked well together, especially during the war in the Gulf. All this is true - and Britain played its loyal ally card to the full during the war. But it should not be exaggerated in the way that some anti-European Conservatives are apt to do in celebrating an alleged return to the 'special relationship'. Americans prefer to talk about the Atlantic Alliance. Valued as Britain is on defence matters, especially non-Nato ones, Washington views the UK as part of Europe. As Mr Seitz pointed out in his confirmation hearings last month, Britain has decided that much of its future lies with Europe, and it faces the challenge of maintaining a strong alliance with the US while also being 'good Europeans'. The tilt by the Major government towards the EC occurs at reassessing its broader relations with Europe. As assistant secretary for European and Canadian affairs for the past two years, Mr Seitz is well placed to act as an interlocutor at a time when transatlantic relations are at their most uncertain since the late 1940s. He is the first foreign service officer to be US ambassador to Britain, in more than 200 years. He knows British politics well from his period as deputy chief of mission in the late 1980s, so his appointment has been widely welcomed both among State Department officials and in Whitehall and Westminster.

0,FT932-6577 ,"FT932-6577 _AN-DE0B8AG8FT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (8): Diplomatic talks go on - The Falkland Islands      By JOHN BARHAM   ARGENTINA is obsessed with the Falkland Islands. Eleven years after its defeat in the 74-day conflict with Britain, the country's overriding foreign policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands. In every important speech, President Carlos Menem makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over the Falklands. He claims his policy of rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with Britain will enable Argentina to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by 2000. Mr Menem said: 'We will continue talking. In the world of diplomacy one needs great patience. There is no possibility of taking this conflict over the Falklands to a situation similar to 1982.' His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible. Stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain. Eventually, London will have sufficient confidence in Argentina to consider transferring sovereignty. Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in Argentina. But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in bilateral relations. Argentina continually presses for greater involvement in developing the natural resources. In 1991 the UK agreed to co-operate to conserve fisheries. Last year Argentina began to issue fishing licences, muscling in on the main source of revenue. Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that Mr Menem's policy has still not led to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty. London has remained unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with Argentina does not imply any recognition of its claim to the islands. The UK foreign office says this policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000 inhabitants agree to a change in their status. Last month, Argentina suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when Britain announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the remote and uninhabited South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups, which Argentina also claims. Oil is emerging as another source of friction. The Falklands are believed to have big oil and gas deposits and Argentina wants to tie Britain into a joint oil regime. London has ignored Argentina's arguments, and last year licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around the islands. Britain refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities. There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine attitudes. Memories of Argentina's three-month military occupation remain fresh. And Britain has still not lifted its arms embargo on Argentina. London has also successfully persuaded Washington not to sell two squadrons of ageing Skyhawk fighter bombers to Argentina. However, talks are planned later this year to resume training courses for Argentine officers at British military academies.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

0,FT942-15697 ,"FT942-15697 _AN-EDNE4ACIFT 940414   FT  14 APR 94 / Hurd urges more confident Britain: Foreign secretary's speech hits at Euro-sceptics      By DAVID OWEN   Mr Douglas Hurd last night warned Britain not to turn in on itself and urged the country to make more vigorous use of its distinctive skills and experience. The foreign secretary used his traditional speech at the Lord Mayor's Easter banquet at the Mansion House in London to map out a three-pronged agenda, focusing on Europe, for British foreign policy in the 1990s. In a wide ranging address, he also underlined the government's determination to restore full trading relations between Britain and Malaysia. The government was 'working hard in our contacts with the Malaysian government, and through the business community, to get things back on an even keel', he said. Speaking with the European elections less than two months away, the foreign secretary delivered a thinly veiled rebuke to diehard Euro-sceptics, saying that 'while we dispute among ourselves' on issues like Maastricht and European Union voting rights, 'we risk failing to notice how the world is changing'. Maastricht - though necessary and important - would not go down as 'one of the great turning points in European history'. The 'endless, fevered' discussion of the treaty often led people to lose sight of the real issue. In a strongly worded passage, Mr Hurd said Britain ran the risk of 'intellectual shrinkage . . . as if we simply wanted to devise ways of protecting ourselves against a Europe and a world which was bound to run against us'. He continued: 'This is negative and damaging nonsense . . . Let us use what I hope may be a period of relative calm to regain the self-confidence we need.' He said Britain had to use assets like the City of London, its experience of successful privatisation, and the reputation of the BBC and the armed forces, 'more vigorously than hitherto'. Mr Hurd enumerated three main strands of British foreign policy in the 1990s: Shaping a Europe with which Britain and its partners could feel at ease. This would be 'more than a single market' and would require policies and institutions which were 'sensitive to the citizen'. Opening Europe to the east. This would come partly through the search for security. Britain had made it clear that Nato enlargement was 'not a question of 'if' but 'when''. Putting new substance into old friendships around the world. Mr Hurd made positive and conciliatory remarks about Britain's relations with both Argentina and China. The country was injecting 'new vitality' into commercial links with Argentina; relations with China were 'returning to calm'. The foreign secretary's remarks came as another staunchly pro-European minister attacked hardline Euro-sceptics and federalists for attempting to define the terms of debate on Europe 'in a way which excludes the viewpoint of the great majority'. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, used a speech in London to argue that the priorities of Britain's European policy should be economic. 'The binding force of the Union is our shared interest in improving European living standards,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Head of the British Foreign Office Douglas Hurd and Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev offered flowers at the memorial  in honour of British and U.S. navy personnel who were killed  while conducting sea convoys with allied aid to Murmansk. The  heads of foreign departments visited the navy museum. They had  conversation with commander of the Northern Sea Fleet Admiral  Oleg Yerofeyev on board the cruiser ""Admiral Nakhimov"". The day  before the talks Andrey Kozyrev had noted that as of today  Russian nuclear force rockets are no longer targeted at Great  Britain, similarly British missiles are also no longer aimed at  Russia. This symbolises new relations of trust between the two  countries, Kozyrev said.    Douglas Hurd and Andrey Kozyrev left by a special plane for  Moscow the same day. The British foreign minister will continue  discussing bilateral cooperation. In particular, he is to meet  with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Then he will leave Moscow for Kiev. Replying to a question  about the aim of this visit to Kiev, the British diplomat said  that during his one-day visit to Ukraine he will meet with  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Great Britain wants to  assist democratic reforms and Ukraine's movement towards the  market economy as well as to see Ukraine live in peace with its  neighbours, especially with Russia, Douglas Hurd added.

0,FT931-2229 ,"FT931-2229 _AN-DCUAGAFHFT 930320   FT  20 MAR 93 / Sour sound of twisted surveys: Dominic Lawson hears pro-Maastricht politicians utter the most depressing words in English      By DOMINIC LAWSON   WE ALL have our own ideas about what constitute the most depressing words in the English language. Sir Kingsley Amis, famously partial to a drink before lunch, once nominated the phrase 'Shall we go straight through?' As I recall, Sir Kingsley's runner up for the prize was 'Red or White, Sir?'. My nomination would have to go to the phrase 'according to a recent survey . . .' Usually this forms the introduction to the sort of article which purports to prove that breathing can give you cancer, that advertising pays, or that pigs can fly. More dangerously, it is a phrase beloved of politicians hoping to justify a policy or to defend their appalling record. A horrible example was perpetrated last week by the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, as part of his increasingly desperate attempts to persuade members of his party that they should support the government's Maastricht Bill. Hurd quoted a survey by a body calling itself the European Policy Forum - a disinterested body, I am sure - to the effect that if Britain failed to ratify the Maastricht Treaty 'the cost to our national income of . . . a policy of detachment . . . would be some Pounds 50bn over five years.' This fantastic figure was later given the highest political authority, by being quoted in a speech by the prime minister. You are probably wondering how the European Policy Forum arrived at this figure. Simple. It supposed that foreign direct investment in Britain would amount to 3 per cent of output, or Pounds 20bn a year. It further supposed that this figure would be halved if Britain pulled out of the Maastricht process. This is the truly heroic assumption, which the prime minister and the foreign secretary apparently share, and which enables them to claim that Britain would 'lose' Pounds 10bn a year, and hence Pounds 50bn over five. QED, I don't think. Not surprisingly this piece of arithmetical mumbo-jumbo failed to impress anti-Maastricht Tory MPs. So the government's faithful euro-hound, the Confederation of British Industry did its bit by circulating a brief to MPs and peers which claimed that: 'If the UK fails to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and is perceived to be part of a second tier in a two speed Europe, this would have a negative effect on half the (foreign) investors'. It later turned out that of the 16 foreign companies questioned by the CBI, only one said categorically that a failure to ratify Maastricht would have a serious impact on its investment in Britain. According to the Sunday Telegraph, one of the companies, a Japanese car maker, was typical of the general tone, saying: 'Disinvestment is unthinkable regardless of the political situation. We have made a commitment to the UK and disinvestment will not happen, no matter what.' Possibly that response contains an element of diplomatic exaggeration, but is it not odd that Major and Hurd did not give this part of the survey the publicity they gave to the more negative aspects? They are always complaining about those who knock Britain. Yet here was a Japanese company prepared to say it would invest in Britain regardless of Maastricht, and the government attempts to suppress the good news. The truth is that politicians use only those survey answers which suit their political objectives. That is why the government will not wish to draw attention to another, heartening, survey, which was reported in the FT on Monday. KPMG Peat Marwick Consultants interviewed 50 EC banks, and found that most assume that Britain will be in the slow lane, and that monetary union will take place with an inner core of Germany, France, and the Benelux countries. Bad news for Britain? Not a bit of it, say the banks, who 'anticipate a trend towards centralised currency trading in London in the aftermath of union, irrespective of whether or not Britain rejoins the EMS.' Why does the government keep twisting surveys to prove that Britain will become an economic pariah, if it does not ratify Maastricht? The answer is, because it has no positive reasons for wanting the treaty. So it is left only with negative ones, which amount to no more than handwringing and bedwetting. It does not take a survey to see that. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P99   Nonclassifiable Establishments.

That is why  some of them are strenuously opposing moves to obtain legal  advice on the issue.    Three of those members, the United States, Britain and  France, are extremely sensitive about the legality of nuclear  weapons. Britain and France, in particular, owe their  precarious position as permanent members to their past status as  great powers and to their possession of nuclear arms.    A request by the UN General Assembly to the International  Court of Justice (ICJ) -- the ""World Court"" -- to advise if the  threat or use of nuclear weapons is in any circumstances  permitted under international law, Resolution L25, has been  dropped. But another, asking if use of nuclear weapons would be  a breach of international law, including the constitution of the  World Health Organisation (WHO), is still being considered.    Although only confined to the health and environmental  aspects, the question is causing deep unease. The U.S. State  Department has reportedly set aside $800,000 to challenge the  submission of the question to the ICJ. From 17 to 26 January,  the executive board of the WHO meets to discuss its agenda for  the 1994 World Health Assembly session in May. The U.S. State  Department is working ""flat-out"" on a counter-resolution, saying  the question lies outside the WHO's competence.    Although a straightforward challenge to the legality of  nuclear arms has therefore failed, an indirect one, via their  longterm health and environmental effects, could succeed.  Chemical and biological weapons are already banned by  international conventions. The declared nuclear powers have a  vested interest in banning these weapons, which are easier for  less-developed countries to make, while preserving a  near-monopoly on nuclear weapons (Israel excepted), even though  nuclear weapons are, potentially, more destructive. Making them  illegal could have profound implications: it would give the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), up for renewal in 1995,  a legal basis -- which it lacks at the moment.    Existing conventions ban weapons which release poisonous  gases, affect neutral states, cause widespread, severe and  long-term environmental damage. The prevalent view is that in  some circumstances it is acceptable to blast, burn or slice  people to death, while it is never acceptable to poison them,  irradiate them or infect them with deadly microbes.    But nuclear weapons do have some characteristics that have  led to chemical and biological weapons being outlawed --  long-term and indiscriminate effects. Such effects are the  target of a fundamental challenge to the privileged and  increasingly anomalous position of nuclear weapons.    Suggestions that big nuclear weapons could be made illegal  while small ones should be allowed have run up against the  awkward fact that in big weapons the effects of blast and heat  predominate, whereas below about 10 kilotons radiation effects  predominate. So small nuclear weapons are less acceptable to  conventional military morality than big ones.    The British government's attitude to resolutions on the  legality of nuclear weapons has been robust. Asked about the  fate of L25, the Minister of State at the Foreign Office, David  Heathcoat-Amory, said on 24 November: ""The resolution was, in  the end, not put to a vote. We believe anyway that the use of  nuclear weapons would have to be judged as lawful or not in the  light of the particular circumstances in which they were used  and that therefore it would be wrong to burden the International  Court of Justice with this hypothetical question.""    Robert Green, a former Navy commander and nuclear bomber  pilot turned antinuclear campaigner, has become involved in the  World Court Project, as it is known. He believes it is far from  a hypothetical question; such a technicality -- an ICJ opinion  that nuclear weapons would violate the WHO constitution -- could  completely upset the nuclear status quo and bring about a  disarmament race which Britain could lead. If it seized on this  opportunity to renounce its nuclear weapons -- the first state  to do so -- it would gain great international prestige, making a  virtue out of a new necessity.    An ICJ opinion is not mandatory, but it could cause  enormous problems for anyone in charge of nuclear weapons. The  Manual of Military Law says: ""If a person...receives an order to  do some act that is manifestly illegal, he is bound under a  legal duty to refuse to carry out that order."" Firing a Trident  missile would be, unquestionably, illegal.    Mr Green believes an ICJ opinion could act as a catalyst,  either isolating Britain further from changing world opinion or,  if used cleverly, be open to exploitation. If the World Court  were to deliver an oninion on the illegality of nuclear weapons  before the NPT comes up for renewal in 1995, it could have a  profound effect on disarmament.    Its opinion could reflect, and stimulate, a change in the  mindset of governments. The time might be right. It is  increasingly difficult for Britain to maintain with any  sincerity that its deterrent is ""independent,"" When the last of  the WE-177 free-fall bombs becomes unusable, around 2006, it  will be hard to see how Britain could use any nuclear weapon  except as an arm of the U.S.    There is increasing concern about the disposal of nuclear  material, and a comprehensive test-ban treaty is also on the  cards. The technology of modelling the likely performance of  nuclear warheads has, according to defence sources, been  developed to the stage where it is no longer necessary to test  warheads to keep arsenals in working condition. But it would  presumably be impossible to develop new nuclear weapons without  some testing. Britain, having relied on U.S. facilities in the  Nevada desert, has more of a problem than other nuclear powers.    Britain and France are nervous about their permanent  membership of the Security Council. If nuclear weapons are to be  the sole qualification, then why not admit Israel? If economic  and political muscle are the qualification, then Germany and  Japan have strong cases.    Or perhaps participation in UN peace-keeping operations  around the world should carry weight -- an area where Britain  and France can claim to have done a certain amount. Whatever the  future holds, clinging to nuclear weapons as an entry-ticket to  permanent Security Council membership is looking increasingly  difficult.    Should the World Court rule that nuclear weapons are  illegal,  many people who until recently supported the retention of  nuclear weaponry might favour dismantling Britain's nuclear  arsenal.     "

He said: This  stance is in line with Article 5 of the agreement linking Cyprus  with the European Union.

I'M MIDDLE-AGED and middle-class and have no history of violence. In fact, the  only thing I do with any physical force at all is exercise, and I do that in a  fancy health club in the Valley. So I surprised myself a few weeks ago when I  nearly came to blows with a half-naked man in my aerobics class.    The man had planted himself front and center in a fast-paced class and refused  to budge when the class began moving back and forth across the room. He just  stood there, doing his own little duck paddle. When I crossed what he  considered to be his territory, he pushed me -- hard. This was no warning  nudge. This was an outright mean shove.    I turned on him like a kid in a schoolyard fight. The music stopped; luckily,  no fists flew. We stood toe to toe, eyes blazing. ""Don't you ever push me  again!"" I said, teeth clenched. ""You'd better watch out!"" he lashed back, jaw  jutting.    Never mind that I felt foolish. What matters to me now is why I was so angry  with this otherwise unprepossessing middle-aged man. At the time, I just felt  that he was an intruder, an intolerably male and self-important intruder.    The truth is -- and I'm fully aware I'll be called a reverse sexist, but I've  lived with direct sexism a long time, and now it's my turn -- I'm highly  annoyed by men in aerobics classes. This is simply because, in my experience,  men -- with the exception of professional athletes and the Chippendales dancers  -- are not good at aerobics. Their movements are too big, too lumbering, too  uncoordinated. No aerobics teacher will admit this publicly because men are  paying customers, and fitness people tend to be evangelical. Instead, teachers  offer special (meaning ""slow"") classes to introduce men to aerobics. (I even  read somewhere that a gym was using martial music for men's classes, the theory  being that they respond to it better.)    But men seem to like aerobics, and more and more of them are showing up at my  health club's crowded advanced workout at 5:15 p.m., wearing their gym shorts  and tank tops, swinging their arms and perspiring heavily. They don't notice  the women around them edging a few extra inches away. And it doesn't occur to  them that they are annoying, maybe even, well, unwelcome.    I hasten to say I'm not suggesting that men be banned from aerobics classes --  not now anyway, when the Jonathan Club and the California Club have finally  admitted a few women. I just wish men would understand that they are entering a  woman's domain and learn how to behave acceptably.    After all, women have always struggled to live in a man's world. As children,  we were tossed out of games for ""throwing like a girl,"" or even worse, ""running  like a girl."" As adults, some of us wear suits and neckties to enter business  and politics and straight-hipped pants to join the police and fire departments.  We labor valiantly to act like men, to be more competitive, to hide our tears,  to hold our liquor. We spend a good part of our lives trying one way or another  to be one of the boys.    But men never have to be one of the girls. When they enter what they consider  female territory -- the produce section of the supermarket, for instance --  they turn adorably bumbling. ""What are baking potatoes?"" they ask aloud,  clutching a list prepared by a woman, until a clerk or a female shopper comes  forward to help them. It's a subtle form of slumming, a way of saying, ""I don't  need to know this.""    I got angry in that exercise class because I realized that men are so  comfortably at home in the world that it never dawns on them to act like women.  For instance, women are self-conscious, a little self-effacing, about their  physical abilities. A woman who couldn't keep up with the class would tuck  herself discreetly in the back or to the side of the room. Men don't seem to  mind not keeping pace with their companions, at least not in aerobics. They  blithely stand up front, blocking everyone else's view of the instructor, and  step to music only they hear. One man does odd yogalike stretches while the  rest of us are following the warm-up routine. Another jogs monotonously from  side to side.    Women also use space humbly. Notice the way men and women sit. He sprawls over  both armrests in the movies; she keeps her knees together and elbows close to  her side. In the gym, women mentally cordon off enough territory to raise their  arms and keep repositioning to make room for others. Men stand where they  please and expect others to watch out for them.    And physically, women have better control and coordination. We can remember  steps and keep the beat. Maybe it's a matter of hormones. A recent study  connects greater verbal skills and muscular coordination with high estrogen  levels. But it's also a matter of values. Some men (the ones who don't just  duck-paddle in place) think that the benefit of aerobics comes from the sheer  hurtling of the body. They heave and flail, sometimes with weights precariously  clutched in their slippery hands. Gasping for air and dripping lakelets on the  floor, they'd be a serious distraction even if they weren't out of step and off  beat.    One man at my health club pins his locker key to his shorts so that it jingles  off beat with him. A friend who works out at a famous Westside studio says a  man there once sweat so profusely that six women shouted in unison, ""Get a  towel!"" Minutes later, he lost his grip on a weight and sent it flying into  someone's face.    Obviously, men can't trade in their large muscles for our small ones; they  can't control their sweat glands, and they probably shouldn't take estrogen.  But they could emulate us and strive for grace, rhythm and control, instead of  sticking to the masculine ethos that all exercise is a show of force. And if  they can't keep up with the class, they can do their modest jog in the back of  the room until their stamina and coordination improve.    They might also dress like women. This is a touchy point, I know, because men  feel funny about wearing tights. But a man in shorts, spread-eagled on a mat,  is no sight for strangers. Anyway, tights are useful garments. They absorb  perspiration; there's no way to pin a locker key to them.    Men could think of it as dressing for success.

In the gym, women mentally cordon off enough territory to raise their  arms and keep repositioning to make room for others. Men stand where they  please and expect others to watch out for them.    And physically, women have better control and coordination. We can remember  steps and keep the beat. Maybe it's a matter of hormones. A recent study  connects greater verbal skills and muscular coordination with high estrogen  levels. But it's also a matter of values. Some men (the ones who don't just  duck-paddle in place) think that the benefit of aerobics comes from the sheer  hurtling of the body. They heave and flail, sometimes with weights precariously  clutched in their slippery hands. Gasping for air and dripping lakelets on the  floor, they'd be a serious distraction even if they weren't out of step and off  beat.    One man at my health club pins his locker key to his shorts so that it jingles  off beat with him. A friend who works out at a famous Westside studio says a  man there once sweat so profusely that six women shouted in unison, ""Get a  towel!"" Minutes later, he lost his grip on a weight and sent it flying into  someone's face.    Obviously, men can't trade in their large muscles for our small ones; they  can't control their sweat glands, and they probably shouldn't take estrogen.  But they could emulate us and strive for grace, rhythm and control, instead of  sticking to the masculine ethos that all exercise is a show of force. And if  they can't keep up with the class, they can do their modest jog in the back of  the room until their stamina and coordination improve.    They might also dress like women. This is a touchy point, I know, because men  feel funny about wearing tights. But a man in shorts, spread-eagled on a mat,  is no sight for strangers. Anyway, tights are useful garments. They absorb  perspiration; there's no way to pin a locker key to them.    Men could think of it as dressing for success.      Drawing, Lou Beach      Column    "

The group says in a report that legitimate cross-Channel trade in alcohol costs Britain between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m a year, while illegal trade results in further losses. The price of an average bottle of wine is 69 per cent higher in Britain than in France, while a case of beer costs 123 per cent more. The consultancy estimates that cross-Channel travellers could soon be spending Pounds 1bn a year on alcohol, and that by 2000, more than 10 per cent of UK spending on alcoholic beverages will occur in France. It adds that the trade also limits the ability of the government to discourage alcohol abuse by raising prices. The report has been backed by Tesco, the supermarket chain, which said it lost Pounds 38m of alcohol sales to French retailers last year. Tesco is calling for a freeze on excise duties and a harmonisation of European Union duty rates. Cross-Border Shopping. London Economics, 91 New Cavendish Street, London W1M 7PS.

But the prime minister's vision of a multi-speed, multi-track Europe provoked anger among pro-European Tories and blistering attacks from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to dampen the controversy by insisting that in many areas Britain would welcome closer co-operation with its EU partners. Speaking in Derby, Mr Hurd singled out Britain's strong support for European policy co-ordination as an example of where 'we are leading the pack in an area of crucial importance to Europe'. But Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman and a prominent sceptic, said the sentiment and tone of Mr Major's remarks were 'clearly incompatible' with the Maastricht treaty which had been forced through parliament. Welcoming the prime minister's apparent conversion to the Euro-sceptic cause, he said that the speech would persuade many Conservatives not to abstain in the June 9 European elections. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, insisted that Mr Major had put his own position ahead of the interests of the country. Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Ashdown added: 'Its historic importance is that Mr Major, in order to save his own skin in the short-term, is now preparing the way in which the Conservatives - if they lose the next election - will risk becoming the anti-European party in Britain.' Members of the Conservative party's pro-European wing also privately attacked the prime minister for ceding ground to the sceptics. They warned that his stance would significantly weaken his support from the centre-left in any contest for the Tory leadership. But Mr Major was unrepentant over his suggestion that Britain might opt out of any further moves by its EU partners towards a centralised European state. He said in London that there was no contradiction between his oft-stated commitment to keep Britain at 'the heart of Europe'. Mr Major said the Conservative party alone was committed to 'a realistic assessment of the future of Europe and of Britain's place in Europe'. Underlining his determination to preserve the national veto, Mr Major said: 'I approach this question as someone who wishes to see Europe succeed.' But that did not mean that Britain had to accept every idea that came from its European partners. Sometimes it would stand aside from 'the nonsense'.

In its application, Libya requested that the US and Britain be told to stop 'taking any action against Libya calculated to coerce or compel Libya to surrender the accused individuals to any jurisdiction outside of Libya.' Libya saw 'no reason why it should give into this illegal and arbitrary blackmail,' Mr Mohammed Al-Fatouri, Libya's ambassador to Brussels, said. Addressing the court's 16 judges in the main chamber of the Peace Palace, the court's seat in The Hague, Mr Al-Fatouri drew attention to what he said were the 'progressively more explicit threats' from the US and Britain.' He recalled in court that Libya had been the target of US air raids in 1986, when the US had linked Libya to the bombing of a Berlin disco frequented by US servicemen. Professor Ian Brownlie, an Oxford law don speaking on behalf of Libya, described the refusal by high-ranking officials such as US President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle to rule out the use of force, coupled with their demands for extradition of the two Libyans, as a 'pattern of ultimatums not seen for some decades'. Britain said the case was an attempt by Libya to ward off UN Security Council-mandated sanctions. Mr Frank Berman, a Foreign Office legal adviser, told the court that the case was 'directed at interfering with the function and prerogatives of the Security Council under the United Nations charter'. Professor Rosalind Higgins, counsel for the UK, said Libya's request for provisional measures were too 'vague, imprecise and unsuitable' to be ordered by the World Court. Mr Alan Rodger, solicitor general for Scotland, said Libya's legal reasoning was fundamentally flawed. 'Libya will say anything, however inconsistent, to postpone the day that it may have to accept responsibility for its actions.' The hearings are expected to continue today but it is likely to take at least several weeks before the court rules on Libya's request for 'provisional measures'. The US, Britain and France have already said that they will not wait for the verdict before putting a sanctions resolution before the Security Council. Mr Edwin Williamson, a legal adviser to the US State Department who will address the court later in the proceedings, said yesterday, 'This (court) action in no way inhibits what the Security Council is doing.' Britain and the US wish to put the two men on trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 above the Scottish town of Lockerbie in which 270 people died.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

In a debate last month, the Prime Minister staked much of  his  credibility on defending the compromise negotiated by Mr Douglas  Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, saying it would protect British  interests.    But yesterday, M Delors told the European Parliament that,  given his ""constant concern to strengthen the decisionmaking of  the Union and its capacity for action"" and the fact that he had  opposed the compromise, he had ""embarked on a damage-limitation  exercise."" He declared that the compromise agreement ""is  political declaration, not legal text"" and that the Commission  retained the power to declare that the ""reasonable period"" for  delaying decisions had been exhausted.    To force a vote to go through, with the blocking minority at  27, would require the support of only half the EC members. In  the circumstances, that would be an easy proposition.    He also stressed that the British concession will only last  until voting procedures are reviewed in 1996.    M Delors fears any attempt by Britain to slowdown EC  decisionmaking.    Britain lost its battle to freeze the number of votes  required to block EC decisions at 23 when the EC is enlarged  with the addition of four new members next year.    The ""blocking minority"" will rise to 27, thus making it  harder for Britain to block EC decisions.    But, as a sop to the British, the EC agreed that, in cases  where 23 votes are mustered against a proposal but not the full  27, there will be a ""reasonable delay"" while consensus is sought.    Even this minimal concession has annoyed federalist-minded  Euro-MPs, many of whom may vote against the treaty admitting  Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway to the EC because of it.  For them, any widening of the EC must be accompanied by  ""deepening"" -- further integration -- to prevent the wheels of  the Community from seizing up. Enough of these MEPs [Member of  the European Parliament] may oppose the enlargement treaty, or  abstain, to prevent it from going through, and the EC is  embarked on an attempt to persuade them to vote positively on  May 4.

The UK secured a controversial four-year exemption last year to allow children under 15 - such as paper boys and girls - to work more than 12 hours a week. This gave the UK a six-year breathing space, including the two years allowed to pass the directive into national law. Since then the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation has complained that the special treatment for Britain flouts international conventions on child labour, and the European parliament has voted to take the British dero-gation out of the directive. The European Commission accepted the parliament's amendment, so that, under EU voting procedures, only a unanimous vote of the 12 labour and employment ministers yesterday could safeguard the British exemption. Countries that remain unhappy with the package, such as Ireland, Italy and Spain, were expected to abstain to allow the opt-out through. But Greece, without any warning, announced it would vote for the parliament's amendment. The directive will come back to the next Social Affairs Council in June, but the controversy surrounding the provisions for Britain looks set to intensify. 'The more it goes on, the more it is likely to unravel,' a commission official said yesterday. Mr Michael Forsyth, junior employment minister, nevertheless said: 'We've today succeeded in preventing the European parliament proposal to remove the UK opt-out, so I'm very relaxed.' Greece's change of heart seemed to be caused by annoyance with Britain for supporting German objections to the EU's fourth poverty programme, an Ecu122m (Pounds 96.1m) programme to help the estimated 52m union citizens earning less than half the average income of their countries. Germany said that under subsidiarity this was a matter for national governments. The UK, which has no objection of principle, backed Bonn. In spite of this expression of solidarity, the gulf between Britain and its partners on social policy gaped anew when the 11 forged ahead with the directive setting up elected works councils in large trans-European companies.

0,FT931-11106 ,"FT931-11106 _AN-DBDCDAFLFT 930204   FT  04 FEB 93 / Political Notebook: Finding a place in the world      By PHILIP STEPHENS   ASK any group of Conservative MPs about Britain's place in the world and the competing cross-currents of opinion surface within minutes. First comes a surprisingly pragmatic realism appropriate to a middle-ranking European power in the 1990s. Applied most obviously to Bosnia but also to Saddam Hussein's Iraq, it states with certainty that Britain must no longer aspire to the role of world policeman. Its stretched armed forces have a part to play in humanitarian aid efforts in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. But British soldiers are too scarce and too precious to be cast in the dangerous role of peace-makers. So successive debates in the Commons have left the government in no doubt that its supporters would not tolerate the risk of significant casualties in a Balkans conflict seen as tangential to British interests. Unquestioning support on the backbenches for military action against Iraq has given way to questions over whether it serves a strategic purpose. But then comes the second, more familiar, strand of opinion. It is rooted in Tory nostalgia for empire. Britain is placed still centre-stage, interpreting its national interest in the context of a much wider international order. It is a current that abhors the temerity of those - most recently Mr Warren Christopher - who raise questions about whether Britain deserves still its seat at the top table in institutions such as the UN. It is one that has persuaded many Tory MPs that the cuts in the armed forces mapped out by the government for a post-cold war world went too far. The peace dividend promised by Options for Change no longer looks quite so attractive when the government is obliged to admit that it could not have found a few hundred troops to send to Somalia. Britain must retain at least the option of reinforcing its diplomacy with military might. The Tories are not alone with their uncertainties. Labour has yet to fashion a coherent foreign policy from the ashes of last year's election defeat. The Europeanism which Mr Neil Kinnock put at the centre of Labour's strategy has been undermined by its subsequent record on the Maastricht treaty. The election of President Bill Clinton has led some to flirt again with Atlanticism. What is left is confusion. But it is harder always for the Conservatives to come to terms with Britain's waning influence. Mr Douglas Hurd sought to negotiate the currents in a speech last week at Chatham House. He suggested Britain should retain a prominent role in the interlocking network of international organisations - from a reinvigorated UN to the European Community and the Commonwealth - confronting international disorder. He foreshadowed yesterday's reprieve of two army regiments by arguing that Britain should spend more on its diplomatic service and be ready to shave less from its defence budget. But it must recognise also its diminishing economic power by saying 'no' more often than 'yes' to new entanglements. The speech won plaudits as a typically eloquent contribution. But it was more convincing in its diagnosis than its prescription. It provided also only a fleeting glimpse of the most uncertain dimension of British foreign policy. Mr John Major's meeting with President Clinton later this month will generate endless analysis of whether the 'special relationship' has survived the Tories backing for Mr George Bush. In reality the prime minister's concern about the new administration is much more profound. What he wants to discover above all is the extent to which President Clinton will hasten US disengagement from Europe. For more than a decade the Conservatives have seen the US presence in Europe as a vital wedge between the Franco-German alliance. It has curbed the ambitions of those in Paris and Bonn seeking distinctly European defence and foreign policies. If President Clinton decides to accelerate the run-down in US forces in Europe - and by implication the priority Washington attaches to Nato - that wedge will be removed. With it will go one of the principal props which have allowed Britain to punch above its weight in the world. The cross-currents then would be not simply be between those remaining hopes that Britain might cling on to the illusions of empire or whether it must accept with dignity a modest role on the world stage. The Conservatives would face also the choice they most fear: between Europeanism and Atlanticism.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721  International Affairs.

His attempt to rebuild a facade of unity between the party's enthusiasts and sceptics was accompanied by a renewed warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that the party could not go back on its historic commitment to Europe. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, meanwhile accused the party's sceptics of 'undermining the prime minister' and damaging the Conservatives' chances in next week's local elections. He said party workers would be appalled at the behaviour of some Tory MPs. In a clear message to those on the Tory right at Westminster who have suggested Britain could disengage from the European Union, Mr Hurd said that talk of withdrawal was 'out of touch with reality'. He told a Conservative meeting in Plymouth: 'Our party took Britain into the European Community in the 1970s. Anybody seeking to reverse that decision now is out of touch with reality, and with all the questions of politics and security which western Europe will have to tackle in the years ahead.' Mr Major offered the same message on a local election tour in Bury when he underlined the economic and security interests tying Britain to the EU. But refusing to be labelled either a Europhile or a Europhobe, Mr Major stressed that a commitment to a leading role for Britain in the EU did not mean accepting every suggestion or plan from Brussels. Instead Britain would argue the case for Euro-realism. As both men laid out a strategy designed to unite all but the most extreme anti-Europeans, Mr Hurd stressed also that the Conservatives were the only party opposed to a centralised federal Europe. Mr Hurd, dismissing suggestions that Mr Major had sought to appease the Tory right by giving the election manifesto a more sceptical tone, suggested that 90 per cent of the Tory party would offer whole-hearted support for the government's platform. Trailing the party's manifesto for the June campaign, Mr Hurd said its belief in a free trading, decentralised, outward-looking Europe was reflected increasingly in the mood in the rest of the EU. He said the Liberal Democrats, the main threat to the Conservatives in south-west England, were, like the Labour party, wedded to the Brussels centralism which would lead to a European superstate. But ministers acknowledged that the attempt by Tory Euro-sceptics to seize the initiative threatened a constant series of potential upsets in a campaign which could be critical to Mr Major's future as prime minister.

Who pushed the talks into a dead end? Who  should be held responsible?    This correspondent took part in covering the talks from  beginning to end, which lasted more than seven months. From  what I covered and from what I learned from various sources, we  know there is only one answer to these questions: Britain  stubbornly insisted on its erroneous position of ""three  violations""; from beginning to end Britain had not the slightest  sincerity towards the talks; and in the absence of a  Sino-British agreement, Hong Kong Governor Patten unilaterally  took action, submitting part of the ""constitutional reform  package"" to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion.  These are the root causes which resulted in the breakdown of the  talks.    It is evident Patten himself established numerous obstacles  in order to completely block the talks, yet recently he  hypocritically called for ""continuing the talks"" as if the  responsibility for their breakdown belonged to China. Such an  outdated colonialist trick of the thief calling someone else a  thief and putting all the blame on the victim cannot deceive the  people in light of justified public opinion from the mainland,  Hong Kong, and the world.    As everyone knows, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks  from 22 April to 27 November 1993. The major topic of the talks  was the final elections to be held in Hong Kong while still  under British rule -- that is, the arrangements for the  1994-1995 elections of the 19 district councils, the two urban  councils (the New Territory Regional Council and the Hong Kong  Island and Kowloon Urban Council), and the Legislative Council.  This deals with a string of specific problems on whether or not  the four-year three-level framework resulting from the elections  will continue after Hong Kong returns to China in 1997. In  other words, it deals with Hong Kong's stable transition and the  smooth handover of Hong Kong's political power in 1997.    Before and during the talks, the outstanding focus of the  dispute between the two sides had persistently revolved around  whether the common understanding, understanding, and agreements  [gong shi, liang tie, xie yi 0364 6224 6156 6043 0588 6231]  reached between the two sides in the past should be abided by --  in other words, it is a problem of whether or not one should act  in good faith.    The Origin of Differences and the Proposal for Talks    In fact, in the decade following 1982, both sides held  protracted, consultative talks on the recovery of Hong Kong by  China, its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong once again,  and the development of the political system during Hong Kong's  transition period. Their talks produced a series of results,  including the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong signed  by both sides, together with relevant agreements,  understandings, and common understandings reached between the  two countries.    The signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration solved all  the problems concerning Hong Kong's reversion and its smooth  transition.    In the process of formulating the ""Basic Law"" of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region, China incorporated a number  of reasonable suggestions made by Britain, and the latter also  repeatedly promised to converge with the ""Basic Law.""    In seven letters containing nearly 10,000 characters  corresponded between Chinese and British foreign ministers  shortly before the promulgation of the ""Basic Law,"" they  exchanged views on Hong Kong elections to be held in 1995, the  number of districts in which there would be direct elections of  the Legislative Council, and other issues concerning the  political development of Hong Kong, and reached an understanding  and some agreements in principle.    Therefore, if China and Britan could discuss the issue of  Hong Kong's political system under comparatively cooperative  circumstances during the decade following 1982, it should be an  easy matter for both sides to conduct friendly consultations on  election details when Hong Kong is approaching the elections,  which are due to be held in 1994 and 1995.    However, things went contrary to one's wishes. On 7 October  1992, without prior consultation with China, Britain suddenly  presented a ""constitutional package"" through Hong Kong Governor  Chris Patten's policy address. It sent a serious message to  China, namely, Britain was prepared to repudiate the basis on  which it had maintained consultations and cooperation with  China over the previous decade and to tear up the agreements  both sides had reached. The method by which the package was put  forward, and its substance, violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the principle of converging with the ""Basic Law,""  and the relevant agreements and understandings (called the three  principles for short) reached between the Chinese and British  Governments.    The presentation of the package was such that Chris Patten's  sudden attack directly deviated from the stipulation that the  two countries conduct ""discussions,"" ""consultations,"" and  ""deliberations"" on matters related to the smooth handover of  Hong Kong's political power in 1997, which are contained in  Annex II of the ""Basic Law."" Please take a look at a few events  which occurred before the policy address was delivered:    -- First of all, on 18 September 1992, the British FINANCIAL  TIMES reported the news that Britain had made a major change to  Hong Kong's existing political system.    -- When British Foreign Secretary Hurd met Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen in New York on 25 September 1992, he  briefly mentioned Chris Patten's policy package. Foreign  Minister Qian unequivocally set forth China's stand there and  then.    -- Britain sent a brief note to Lu Ping, director of the  Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, and  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu on the policy package  less than 10 days before it was made public. Immediately after  receipt of the notice, Director Lu Ping sent a reply letter,  reaffirming China's stand.    However, ignoring China's persuasions and clinging  obstinately to his course, Chris Patten unilaterally took  action, thereby stirring up an open polemic between China and  Britain which has lasted now for six months.    The core of the ""constitutional reform package"" is to  emphasize ""change.""    The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that Hong  Kong's existing political system, economic system, and way of  life will remain unchanged and its laws will remain basically  unchanged. However, Chris Patten has made great changes in the  political development and in the electoral arrangements which  will directly affect the systems after 1997. Several examples  are as follows:    -- Of the 441 members of district boards and two urban  councils, 140 are appointed. Such a practice can complement  direct elections, and help bring in people of ability with  various specialities, and it conforms to the aspirations of the  Hong Kong residents. However, Chris Patten has proposed that  all the appointed seats be abolished.    -- Dual membership of both the Executive Council and the  Legislative Council of Hong Kong has always been permitted, and  some Executive Council members are concurrently Legislative  Council members. Such a practice is conducive to the operation  and mutual restraint of the two councils. However, Chris Patten  has called for a complete separation of the two councils,  attempting to change ""leading role of the administration to the  leading role of the legislature"" and wantonly raising the status  of the Legislative Council.    -- Articles 45 and 68 of the ""Basic Law"" stipulate that Hong  Kong's political development should be carried out in accordance  with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. However,  Chris Patten advocates immediate, drastic changes, such as  expanding Hong Kong's basic constituency from fewer than 100,000  voters in 15 functional groups (organized among specialized  people in business, economic and other sectors) in 1991 to 2.7  million, including all non-specialized personnel, by 1995. He  attempts to create chaos and exclude genuine, specialized  personnel on the pretext of ""democracy.""    Chris Patten's package, therefore, is designed to completely  negate the agreements reached between China and Britain in the  past. Its only purpose is to prop up a pro-Britain, anti-China  force in the Hong Kong Government, turn Hong Kong into an  independent or semi-independent political entity, and thus  continue British rule over Hong Kong in a disguised form after  1997.    Chris Patten's ""constitutional reform package"" has been  strongly criticized by people from all walks of life in Hong  Kong. Early last year, Britain was compelled, under pressure of  criticism, to express its desire to hold talks with China.  Considering the overall interest of Sino-British cooperation,  as well as the fundamental interest of the two countries, the  Chinese side agreed to hold talks between government  representatives of the two countries, hoping the British side  would abandon its ""three violations"" and return to the track of  Sino-British cooperation. So, the two sides conducted internal  consultations from early February to 12 March. During the  course of consultation, the Chinese side insisted on the ""three  principles"" as the basis of talks. The British side agreed  verbally, but deliberately complicated the issue and requested  that Hong Kong Government officials participate in the talks as  ""official representatives."" In order to hold the talks at an  early date, the Chinese side assumed a flexible attitude and  agreed to let Hong Kong Government officials assist British  Government representatives as advisers and experts.    When the two sides were about to reach an agreement on the  talks, Chris Patten suddenly decided to publish the  ""constitutional reform bill"" in the Hong Kong Government's  Gazette for the purpose of submitting it to the Legislative  Council for discussion. So, the British side unilaterally  discontinued internal consultations between the two sides on 12  March 1993. In early April last year, the two sides resumed  internal contacts and agreed to hold talks in accordance with  the ""three principles."" To avoid external interference, the two  sides promised to keep the contents of the talks secret.    Set Up Obstacles and Talks Bog Down    During the talks, Chinese Government representatives abided  by the agreement reached between the two sides and, from  beginning to end, did not disclose any substance of the talks to  the press. However, before and after the talks, Chris Patten was  always ready to air his unfavorable view of the talks by every  possible means in an attempt to influence Hong Kong's public  opinion, and even ""jumped the gun"" to obstruct the smooth  progress of the talks. During interviews with reporters before  every round of talks began, British representatives repeated  that they adopted a ""positive"" and ""constructive"" attitude  toward the talks and that they wanted to make efforts to enable  the talks to ""ascend a peak,"" but, on the other hand, they set  up roadblocks from time to time to obstruct the ""mountain  climbing"" of the talks.    When China and Britain concluded their third round of talks  and were about to begin the fourth, the British authorities in  Hong Kong hastily adopted ""Draft Regulations on the Boundary and  Election Commission"" on 26 May last year. A few days later, the  Legislative Council's constitution drafting group on 31 May  passed an agenda on holding discussions on a draft plan for  elections once every two weeks [as received]. Thus, Britain  unilaterally took action on issues that should have been solved  by representatives of Chinese and British Governments through  consultation in an attempt to force China to accept Chris  Patten's ""constitutional package"" and to bring the talks into  Patten's orbit by varying its tactics. China very quickly saw  through the scheme.    Despite the fact Britain made some alterations to Patten's  package under pressure, it still has not given up its erroneous  stand on the ""three violations.""    During the talks, Britain kept setting new, unreasonable  demands and even attempted to meddle in affairs under China's  jurisdiction by virtue of its sovereignty. For instance,  according to a stipulation of the ""Basic Law,"" the ""Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"" to be  established by the National People's Congress [NPC] in 1996  ""shall be composed of mainland members and no fewer than 50  percent of Hong Kong members and its chairman and members shall  be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee."" But Britain  proposed during the talks that Hong Kong members of the  Preparatory Committee must be appointed by China and Britain  through consultation. Britain also wanted China to guarantee  that general elections will be held for the Hong Kong  Legislative Council in 2007, and proposed that the 1995 election  committee established through talks should become the pattern of  the recommendation committee and election committee for the  chief executive of the special region after 1997.    The issue of the ""express train"" [zhi tong che 4160 6639  6508] was an important agenda item discussed by the two sides.  Elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council are held once  every four years. The Legislative Council elected in 1995 will  remain in office until after 1997. It will be called the Hong  Kong Legislative Council for the first two years and the  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region in the last two. According to a stipulation in a  relevant resolution adopted by the NPC, if the formation of the  Legislative Council elected in 1995 complies with the resolution  and with relevant regulations of the ""Basic Law,"" if its members  support the ""Basic Law,"" and if they are willing to pledge  loyalty to the government of the special region and meet the  qualifications stipulated by the ""Basic Law,"" they may make the  direct transition to become members of the first Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong Special Region in 1997 after they are  approved by the Preparatory Committee of the Special Region.  They are, therefore, described as being in the ""express train.""  However, Britain proposed that members of the Legislative  Council elected in 1995 become members of the first Legislative  Council after merely swearing an oral oath. This disregards the  basic condition for ""boarding the express train"" stipulated in  the NPC resolution and attempts to strip the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of its  power to approve Legislative Council members.    Continuous obstructions on the part of Britain made it  difficult for the talks to proceed; the talks kept pacing up and  down at the crossroads.    The Motive for Deliberately Complicating the Issue is All  Too Clear    In order to promote progress in the talks, the Chinese side  in the early stages of the talks proposed that the election of  district boards and the two urban councils and the 1995  Legislative Council election be separated in discussion.  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated the proposal during his  meeting with Foreign Secretary Hurd in New York in October 1993.  The reason is that the district boards and two urban councils  are not organs of a political power by nature, elections to them  involve fewer questions, the questions are relatively easier to  solve, and the elections to them will be held first. The  Legislative Council elections involve such questions as the  functional groups and electoral committees, and the questions  are relatively more difficult to solve. For this reason, we  might take care of elections to the district boards and two  urban councils first, and the elections to the Legislative  Council later. In other words, ""easier things first.""    The British side at first rejected the proposal, though  later  expressed consent. However, it put forward three conditions --  lowering voting age, adopting the ""single-seat, single-vote  voting system,"" and abolishing appointed seats in the district  boards and two urban councils. Although it insisted on honoring  the agreements reached between the two sides in the past, the  Chinese side assumed a very flexible and open attitude toward  Britain's proposal and agreed to lower the voting age from 21 to  18. It also agreed to adopt the ""single-seat, single-vote  voting system"" in elections to the district boards and two urban  councils. On the question of appointed council members,  however, the Chinese side maintains that to properly retain the  appointed seats can complement direct elections in terms of  ensuring sufficient number of specialized personnel among the  council members. At the same time, the Chinese side holds that  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself should decide  the number of the appointed seats on the district boards and two  urban councils after 1997, according to Article 98 of the ""Basic  Law."" By adopting this position, the Chinese side is in fact  giving telling the British side it need not set up more  appointed seats before 30 June 1997.    We could say that the Chinese side has made every compromise  possible to deal with the three conditions set by the British  side. While the two sides had almost reached an agreement in  view over elections to the district boards and two urban  councils, the British side insisted on simultaneous discussion  on the voting method for the Legislative Council election. The  Chinese side continued its restrained and patient attitude, and  maintained that the voting method question could and should be  discussed in later talks, together with the discussion of other  matters concerning Legislative Council elections. The British  side, however, completely ignoring our view, openly and  unilaterally proposed to discontinue the talks on arranging the  election of regional organizations. Such an act clearly showed  that the British side did not have even the slightest bit of  sincerity in the talks. In short, they were pretending to  participate in the talks, but their true intention was to carry  out Patten's package. While the two sides failed to reach  agreement, Chris Patten recently wantonly submitted part of his  reform bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council for discussion.  Are his motives not all too clear?    The aforesaid facts show that it goes without saying that  the  responsibility for the failure of the talks lies entirely on the  British side. The failure is something which people in all  walks of life on both the mainland and in Hong Kong do not want  to see. The failure to reach an agreement on arrangements for  the 1994/1995 elections also means that the question of the  through train mentioned in the talks has become non-existent  with the end of the talks. The three-level councils, as  component parts of the present British Hong Kong government,  will be disbanded with the end of the British rule in Hong Kong  on 30 June 1997.    People on the Chinese side fully believe that so long as the  6 million Hong Kong residents work hard together, the prosperity  and stability created by them in Hong Kong can surely be  maintained and enhanced. The Chinese side will, as always,  continue to implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration, work  strictly according to the ""Basic Law,"" and earnestly practice  the principle of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong. We  can anticipate that tomorrow's Hong Kong will certainly become  even more prosperous.     "

Britain uses the US site in Nevada, and cannot test unless the Americans lift their ban. The decision the president looks set to make would be a heavy defeat for the British government, which has been lobbying fiercely for a resumption of tests. There is a widespread misconception that Britain wants to test to make sure that its existing nuclear weapons are safe and reliable. This misconception has been deliberately fostered by British officials in Washington. However, if parliamentary answers by government ministers are to be believed, Britain does not need to test Polaris, the WE177 free-fall bomb or Trident for safety or reliability. On November 30 1992 Viscount Cranborne said: 'We are concerned purely with the safety of future systems.' On October 23 1992, armed forces minister Archie Hamilton, asked what the moratorium would mean for Trident, stated: 'There are no implications for the Trident warhead programme, the tests for which have been completed.' In fact, there are safety worries about British nuclear weapons, but they could all be rectified without a single nuclear test, by changing operational procedures. Safety is used as a smokescreen to obscure the real purpose of tests. Recent reports in Washington suggest that Britain wanted to test a replacement warhead for the WE177. British weapons development tests would have caused a storm of protest on Capitol Hill, in this country and elsewhere. It seems that once it became clear that its safety and reliability cover had been blown, the government concluded that the game was up and withdrew its plans to test. The government will doubtless now proclaim itself as world leader in the fight against nuclear proliferation.

0,FT933-1885 ,"FT933-1885 _AN-DIVB9ABFFT 930922   FT  22 SEP 93 / UK finds success in Malaysia: Background to Major's visit      By KIERAN COOKE      KUALA LUMPUR   TEN YEARS ago Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, piqued at what he perceived to be British high-handedness on issues ranging from trade matters to increased fees for Malaysian students studying in Britain, instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy. When Mr Major, the UK prime minister, meets Malaysia's leaders today during his official visit to the country he will find attitudes very much changed. Malaysia is now one of the success stories in Britain's overseas trade and investment drive. Aside from the mainly transshipment traffic through Singapore, Malaysia is Britain's biggest export market in the South-East Asia region. Britain's exports to Malaysia have nearly trebled in value in the last five years, reaching Pounds 636m last year. In the first three months of this year Britain became the leading foreign investor in Malaysia, putting Pounds 122m into a variety of projects. Malaysia's exports to Britain have also been growing strongly, reaching Pounds 1.1bn last year. Its economy has been growing at more than 8 per cent in each of the last five years. The country is industrialising fast. Malaysia's exports to Britain are no longer confined, as in the old colonial days, to the more traditional goods, such as rubber and tin. The manufacturing sector is now leading the country's export drive. Up to April 1993, Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, had exported nearly 57,000 of its cars to Britain, where it has become a popular low-priced model. The improvement in British-Malaysian trade was in large part due to the close relationship through the 1980s between Dr Mahathir and Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Dr Mahathir espouses many of the beliefs - and an amount of the leadership style - of the former British prime minister. Mrs Thatcher, on a private visit to Kuala Lumpur this month, received red carpet treatment and, in return, was effusive in her praise for Dr Mahathir. The big breakthrough for Britain in Malaysia came in 1988 with the signing of a memorandum of understanding on defence. Since then Britain has made Pounds 1.3bn of defence sales to Malaysia, including 28 Hawk trainer aircraft and two frigates. British officials calculate civil projects have been worth another Pounds 1bn in British exports. But bigger prizes are still to be won: Power projects. To keep pace with expected economic growth, Malaysia's power output, now about 5,000MW, needs to grow five times over the next 25 years. The government calculates that in the next 10 years alone MDollars 40bn (Pounds 10.3bn) needs investing in the power sector. To alleviate the financial burden, Malaysia is encouraging private sector participation in its power industry. A multi-million-pound independent power producer (IPP) project involving a British company is expected to be announced during Mr Major's visit. National Power, the British electricity company, recently withdrew from an IPP project because of contractual differences with the local company involved. However other UK companies such as John Brown, British Gas, Rolls Royce/NEI and the National Grid continue to win substantial amounts of business. A new international airport outside Kuala Lumpur is scheduled for completion before the city hosts the Commonwealth Games in 1998. An Anglo-Japanese consortium which includes GEC, Gammon and Balfour Beatty (BB is also lead contractor in a Pounds 350m hydroelectric scheme in peninsular Malaysia) is hoping for a large share of the work in the Pounds 2bn airport project. However, Malaysia is pressing for substantial concessionary finance from Britain. It has also signalled it wants other trade-offs - such as more British landing rights for Malaysia Airlines, the national carrier. Other infrastructure sectors in which British companies are pursuing business include upgrading Malaysia's railway network, developing ports, building private hospitals, and work in the country's rapidly expanding telecommunications sector. Both Shell and BP are involved in petrochemicals projects, while North West Water is finalising negotiations on its 25 per cent stake in a Pounds 1.5bn project to privatise the country's sewerage system. As elsewhere, Britain faces tough competition in winning contracts ahead of Japan and, more recently, Germany and France.   Countries:-  MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.

But the relationship is in worse  shape, politically speaking, in 1994 than at any time since Suez.    The damage is at its worst among the Democrats, and this is  extremely serious, since they have majorities in both houses of  Congress, as well as the presidency. But the Republicans don't  have much use for Britain's present government, either, even  though that government went to such extraordinary lengths to  help George Bush in the presidential election of 1992, thus  alienating the winner, Bill Clinton. But the Republicans of  today don't want to know about George Bush anymore than about  John Major. A Republican flier has just been issued in  connection with this year's mid-term congressional elections.  It carries pictures of three worthies: Ronald Reagan, Margaret  Thatcher and Bob Dole. This is a reminder of how great the  relationship once was, and now is not.    All Americans knew who Mrs Thatcher was. Most admired her,  and all who could conceivably vote Republican not only admired  her when she was prime minister but still admire her. That is  why her picture is on that flier.    The Tories, when they ditched Mrs Thatcher, may possibly  have  been doing the right thing by their party, and for its fortunes  in Britain. But they were throwing away a great asset in  international relations, especially relations with America. And  Britain acquired, in place of that asset, a liability. If  Britain repudiated that marvellous Margaret Thatcher, well,  there must be something wrong with Britain, mustn't there?    As for Mr Major, his name and image carry hardly any  connotations here. But for those who do know something about  him, the connotations are negative, consisting mainly of a vague  impression that he is the guy who stabbed Mrs Thatcher in the  back.    The deterioration shows in a number of ways. There is the  decision to ignore British protests and sell aircraft with  advanced radar to Argentina. That could not have happened under  Mrs Thatcher. There is increasing talk of an emerging  Franco-American leadership, especially over Bosnia. Britain is  presented as dragging its feet over Bosnia. I believe Britain  was right to oppose the drift towards military intervention.  But for the present it is the French who are giving a lead in  the direction favoured by popular opinion in America.    Then there is the small but revealing episode of Gerry Adams  and his visa. First of all, Mr Adams would not have been  granted an American visa while Mrs Thatcher was prime minister.  Mrs Thatcher inspired fear, both in Washington and in Dublin.  Mr Major inspires nothing in particular, in either capital.  Since the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December, with its  fatal concession of the Hume-Adams wording on  self-determination, Albert Reynolds has been under the  impression that he can get away with pretty well anything where  the present British government is concerned, even getting an  American visa for the political head of the Provisional IRA,  while the IRA's ""armed struggle"" against Britain continues.    The granting of that visa was one symptom of a general  deterioration in Anglo-American relations. But the consequences  of granting the visa have accelerated the deterioration. This  was not mainly a result of Gerry Adams' anti-British tirades on  Larry King Live and elsewhere. These reached huge audiences but  embarrassed his more respectable sponsors, who had bought the  line that Mr Adams is now an earnest seeker after peace. There  was consequently a certain revulsion against him in influential  quarters.    But then Mr Major's government, by the form of its protest,  compounded the damage already done. It is in general  inadvisable for a government to protest publicly against  something it has been unable to stop. This only advertises the  inability in question. And this was all the worse because the  inability was the result not of harsh fate but of sheer  incompetence.    Mr Major could have nipped that visa in the bud. He should  have known what Albert Reynolds was up to and made him stop. He  should have called on Mr Reynolds to oppose -- as all previous  Irish governments have done -- the granting of a visa to the  president of Sinn Fein. He should have warned Mr Reynolds that  if he failed to do so, he would be placing the future of the  Anglo-Irish agreement in danger. Had Mr Major done that, Mr  Reynolds would have advised Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and  Edward Kennedy to withhold support from this year's visa  application as from previous ones, and the visa would not have  been granted.    Having failed to prevent what he could quietly have  prevented, Mr Major then protested at the top of his voice:  several decibels too loud to be of help to Anglo-American  relations in their present frail condition. To send a formal  protest to the British ambassador in Washington would have been  enough. To carpet the American ambassador in London was far too  flamboyant. It inevitably evoked the anti-British component  always latent American nationalism.    The New York Times is rather less nationalistic than most  Americans and is generally not anti-British. Yet its comment on  the carpeting of the America ambassador was the nastiest I have  seen in a respectable American newspaper in relation to an ally  of the United States. The editorial appeared Saturday under the  headline: ""The Lion Whines About Mr Adams."" The heading  faithfully reflects the hostile and contemptuous tone of the  whole editorial.    The argument was on First Amendment lines, as if this was a  British attempt to impose censorship on the United States,  instead of a protest against the granting of a visa to a known  enemy of Britain and a spokesman for terrorism. But the tone of  the editorial was unmistakably that of aroused American  nationalism on an anti-British binge. Intellectually, the  editorial is contemptible, but as a symptom of dangerous forces  at work in unexpected places it must be taken seriously.    In general, there may not be a lot Mr Major can do about  improving Anglo-American relations. But there is one not  insignificant area in which he can do something. He can warn  Dublin -- belatedly but still effectively -- that if it again  lends itself to making trouble for Britain in the US, it will  undermine the Anglo-Irish agreement through activities  incompatible with the spirit of that agreement. Mr Reynolds  would take such a warning seriously.    For the rest, Mr Major should reflect that he has now to  mend  his fences with a US administration which his government  foolishly strove to prevent from ever coming into being. He has  a lot to live down. President Clinton's hero is John F Kennedy,  whose motto was: ""Forgive your enemies, but remember their  names.""     "

Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons. There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and progressive cuts in defence spending given the end of the cold war. But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference as they did in the mid-1980s. The party endorsed each proposal to maintain defence spending put forward by Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet possible new threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another raid' on the defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in Northern Ireland led to a reduction in troops there. He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Campbell said any attempt by the UN to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems and other factions would destroy the efforts of UK peace-keeping troops.

Neither London nor Madrid appeared ready last night to soften their position at today's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels. The issue may force the EU to delay a decision on new voting arrangements, jeopardising an already tight timetable for the entry of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union by January 1, 1995. The European Parliament further damped hopes of a solution being reached today. The largest group in the Strasbourg assembly, the Socialists, rejected the compromise being offered to Britain and Spain. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said: 'What is at stake is the whole concept of a future Europe.' The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty by May 4 to make it possible for the four newcomers to enter by January. But the Strasbourg assembly has said it will withhold assent if Britain and Spain win their demands to retain the 'blocking minority' at 23 votes in the Council of Ministers, allowing one small and two large member states to obstruct decisions. London and Madrid's 10 partners insist that the blocking threshold should rise to 27, since the weighted votes in Council will rise from 76 to 90. But as a compromise, they are prepared to offer a two-month delay on decisions which are opposed by 23 votes, to try to get consensus. Mr Cot said yesterday: 'There is no chance of having any sort of mixed solution go through (the European) Parliament, such as a two-month cooling-off period, which would only exacerbate delays in decision-making.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, repeated that Britain was determined to keep the weight of voting power with the larger EU states. 'The situation now, where two large and one small country can block a decision, is perfectly satisfactory,' he said in Brussels. 'I am not prepared to see a situation develop where a collection of small states can vote down a collection of bigger ones.' Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was more conciliatory, but indicated that it was unlikely that a solution could be reached today. The Union had to find a way through the voting impasse, he said, during a visit to Dublin. 'We may not do so in Brussels tomorrow (Tuesday), but we will persevere until we do.' In Paris, the French foreign ministry, quoted by Reuter, said France and Germany would still press for a solution at today's meeting:. 'There are ways to take account of some countries' concerns.' Mr Clarke said it was wrong to assume that enlargement automatically meant changes to make decision-making easier at the expense of the minority. But an EU diplomat said all 12 member states, including Britain, had agreed at the EU summit in Lisbon in June 1992 that the admission of the four Nordic and Alpine countries would require a 'mechanical' adjustment in voting weights. A senior Brussels diplomat played down speculation about a special summit to break the impasse. Joe Rogaly, Page 18 Observer, Page 19   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

'The pressure from Britain is there, but we think it is being overcome,' Mr Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, told a radio interviewer. 'We hope it will not succeed.' He was commenting on a report in the daily Clarin which said London was pressing Washington to ban the sale of advanced radar to equip three dozen ageing Skyhawk fighter aircraft. Mr Oscar Camilion, the defence minister, made similar charges in a separate radio interview, blaming London for what he described as US reluctance to allow Argentina to purchase the radar together with the aircraft. 'The objections are coming from the US State Department. . . this is apparently due to British pressure,' he said. The British embassy in Buenos Aires declined to comment. Argentina is buying the Skyhawks from the US to replenish its forces, decimated during the 1982 conflict with Britain over the Falkland islands.

The conclusion at Westminster of the Maastricht bill's tortuous committee stage was followed by an upbeat speech by the prime minister underlining his determination to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. Dismissing the 'nameless' fears of Tory Euro-sceptics, he linked directly the prospects of sustaining the recovery with maintaining Britain's influence in the European Community. He told a Conservative party din-ner: 'Outside Europe Britain can survive; inside we will thrive.' Buoyed by the favourable economic news and the growing conviction at Westminster that ratification of Maastricht is within his grasp, Mr Major launched a public relations blitz to underline the wider message that his government has put behind it the crises of the past year. While other ministers were cautious in announcing formally the end of the recession, Mr Major used a series of television interviews to declare that: 'We are beginning now to see the recovery. I think that it is self-evident from what businesses themselves are saying.' The interviews will be followed by a speech to businessmen in Manchester this evening in which the prime minister will emphasise the government's determination to help extend the economy's manufacturing and technological base. His theme in last night's speech was that the government had an agenda which would give Britain a pivotal role in shaping the future of Europe. Operating at the centre, the government could press its case for a wider, free-trade, liberal community that would in turn render irrelevant the idea of a centralised European superstate. He said: 'The idea of a centralised Europe had resonance in a Community of six. But for 12, soon 16, and eventually 20 plus nations, it is a grandiose doodle.' The government's long-term aim was 'the whole continent of Europe with free democra-cies and without trade barriers'. After several months on the defensive Mr Major felt confident enough to dismiss as 'nonsense' claims from Tory Euro-sceptics that enthusiasm for Europe meant putting Britain second. He told the dinner: 'It is precisely because we put Britain's interests first that we need to be in there, shaping the new Europe.' Developing the argument, Mr Major said that Britain had to take its 'rightful place' in the world: 'Though no longer a global power, we still have global interests. We need to defend them with determination but also with subtlety. We cannot afford to subject ourselves to the despotism of nostalgia.' In a subtle sideswipe against Baroness Thatcher - once dubbed 'the Iron Lady' - the prime minister accused opponents of full participation in the EC as practising 'a sort of phantom grandeur, a clanking of unusable suits of armour'.

AT THE TIME, JOSEPH W. GRIGG  WAS A CORRESPONDENT FOR UNITED PRESS IN BERLIN.      By JOSEPH W. GRIGG, FOR UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      On Sept. 14, 1940, a hot, brilliantly sunny Sunday, Adolf Hitler's  Nazi-controlled Berlin radio launched an all-out propaganda campaign to  announce to the world the climax of what later became known as the Battle of  Britain and the start of the German Luftwaffe's bombing blitz against London.    Along with other foreign correspondents in Berlin, I was summoned to a special  Sunday afternoon news conference at the Nazi Propaganda Ministry.    Raucous trumpet fanfare, special Nazi government communiques and purported  eyewitness stories by breathless Nazi radio reporters -- this was long before  the days of television -- and a new battle tune titled ""Bombs on England"" kept  the German radio running at white heat throughout that late summer Sunday and  the next week.    With the defeat and surrender of France in June, 1940, Britain had been left  alone to face the might of Hitler's victorious Wermacht and a Luftwaffe that  was at that time the world's most formidable air force.    Over the English Channel and the green fields of southeast England, young,  largely inexperienced and heavily outnumbered British Royal Air Force fighter  pilots plunged in their Spitfires and Hurricanes into battle with the  Luftwaffe's crack Messerschmidt 109 and 110 squadrons.    Nazi bombers blasted Britain's fighter airfields at Manston, Biggin Hill and  elsewhere in southeast England in a bid to smash the Royal Air Force's fighter  resistance.    Hitler's strategy, as expanded at the time to American and other neutral  reporters in Berlin by Nazi officials, depended first on defeating the small,  greatly outnumbered RAF.    His goal was nothing less than the invasion and defeat of Britain and its  elimination from the war. By September, 1940, Hitler already had given orders  to his commanders to prepare for what was to be know as ""Operation Sealion,""  the code name for a planned invasion of England.    But Britain's powerful Royal Navy still controlled the English Channel. Nazi  officials with whom I talked argued that if the RAF were first driven from the  skies, a German invasion armada could cross the Channel under what was  described as an ""umbrella"" of Nazi bombers and fighter planes, against which,  it was claimed, Britain's Royal Navy would be powerless to block the planned  invasion.    Before this, Hitler's master plan called for a general softening up of British  government and civilian morale by means of devastating air raids on London and  other big British cities by the concentrated might of the Luftwaffe.    So convinced were the Nazis that this strategy would succeed that officials in  Berlin boasted that within weeks they would be holding news conferences in  Buckingham Palace, home of Britain's royal family.    Three German reporters of my acquaintance bet me 25 bottles of Champagne that  by July 1, 1941, London and the rest of the British Isles would be under Nazi  occupation. I never collected on that bet because, by the target date in 1941,  Champagne was practically unobtainable in Germany.    For the coming Battle of Britain, Hitler named one of his top aides,  Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering, to be Luftwaffe supreme commander.    Goering concentrated all his available air strength of 3,000 planes in occupied  northern France. He set up his own headquarters on the French channel coast  from which in clear weather he could stare across the 20 miles to the white  chalk cliffs of Dover.    In the last days of August and early September, Goering unleashed his bomber  fleets to attack British coastal shipping and ports and to pound key RAF  fighter bases in southeastern England. His aim was to drive the RAF back into  the interior of the country.    But the British managed to make their fighter bases usable again much faster  than the Nazis had expected.    In the ensuing air battles the RAF's Spitfires and Hurricanes suffered grievous  losses. Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6, according to British figures, Britain lost  nearly one-fourth of its 1,000 fighter pilots.    But the RAF still survived as an effective fighting force.    As Winston Churchill declared later in a historic speech to the British House  of Commons, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many  to so few.""    Sept. 14 and 15 are commemorated in Britain. On those two days the Luftwaffe  launched its greatest concentrated onslaught yet in daylight attacks against  London. But postwar information has shown that Luftwaffe losses on those days  alone were 56 fighters and bombers. British losses were about half that number.    British leaders had estimated that in order to survive, the RAF needed to down  three Luftwaffe planes to every one RAF plane lost.    Despite grim RAF losses, the result of the Battle of Britain was a defeat for  the Luftwaffe. All told, in three months in 1940 the Luftwaffe lost nearly  2,000 planes. Hitler had to abandon forever his plan to invade England.    British civilian morale remained high despite 20,000 casualties and long nights  spent in bomb shelters and London subway tunnels.    An angry Goering returned from northern France to Berlin after delivering a  tongue-lashing to his Luftwaffe pilots with these words, ""You have not only  deeply disappointed me, you have betrayed me.""    Nearly four years after the defeat of Hitler's plan to invade Britain, U.S.,  British and Canadian forces crossed the English Channel to Nazi-occupied Europe  on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the forerunner of Allied World War II victory in  Europe.

The Bush proposals, which include cutting submarine warheads, would not affect the UK's plans for obtaining Trident II missiles from the US. However, he did not specifically rule out the possibility that Britain's Trident force, due for deployment in the mid-1990s, might go to sea with less than its full load of warheads. The new submarines - three under construction and a fourth due to be ordered soon - will carry up to 16 missiles, with up to eight British-made warheads each, compared with two or three on the current system. This means a maximum of 128 warheads per boat. Mr King said that the UK needed the full fleet of four submarines for 'operational security'. They would carry 'the minimum load necessary' - he did not say what that would be. Britain had to pose a credible threat of unacceptable damage to an aggressor, he said, arguing that such a threat was not in the same league as that of the US or the former Soviet Union. However, Britain has previously felt obliged to conform with the spirit of US-Soviet nuclear arms agreements. Plans for an air-launched missile were geared to a range of under 500km, for instance.

Speaking after a meeting of EC finance ministers, he claimed  to have won considerable sympathy for his complaint that the  cost of a waste water treatment system accepted by Britain in  1991 had spiralled out of control.    British officials say the cost of the system has snowballed  to 10 billion pounds (about 15 billion dollars) currently, up  from an estimate of two billion pounds (three billion dollars)  in 1991.    Clarke said Britain wanted the European Commission to accept  that the project would be phased in over a longer period, to  lessen the effect on the water bills of British consumers.    But he used the issue to highlight the way in which EC  decisions often had ``unexpected economic consequences,'' and  urged that EC finance ministers be allowed in future to vet all  decisions carrying substantial costs.    Under the water treatment directive, all towns with over  10,000 people must add a third stage to the treatment of waste  water being discharged into ``sensitive areas'' such as the  ocean if seawater cannot clean it up naturally.    ``In health terms the directive is desirable,'' Clarke  admitted, but added that it was too expensive to be fully  implemented by the target date of 1998.

The sources said that the most important organization  targeted by the campaign is an organization which calls itself  ""the British branch of the Islamic Liberation Party.""    The police has sent documents obtained during the storming  and searching of houses of some members of the organization to  the attorney general and the home secretary to take urgent  measures.    The documents include propaganda material calling for the  hijacking of passenger planes and the use of terrorist methods,  on the grounds that they are legitimate means, to confront what  it terms ""real enemies of Islam.""    The organization is accused of inciting racist and  anti-Semitic feelings, thus violating British law.    So far the authorities have not officially proved the  existence of channels of communication between the British  organization and the ""Liberation"" parties operating in the  Middle East. As is known, one of the Liberation Party's  organizations was accused recently of trying to assassinate King  Husayn of Jordan.    The Liberation Army is officially banned from operating in  almost all Islamic states because it participated in violent  operations in several states, including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt,  and Indonesia. Its members are known as the Afghan Arabs, even  though a small number of them actually fought in Afghanistan.    Police sources say that the British branch of the Liberation  Party is active among university students in London, who come  from more than 20 Muslim countries, and recruits some of them.  The party is active in Birmingham, Bradford, and York among  students and emigrant workers from the Indian subcontinent and  Arab states.    Campaigns are launched against other groups operating as  charity organizations, especially to support Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Farid Qasim, spokesman for the British branch of the  Liberation Party, yesterday denied the accusations leveled at  the party by the police. He said that his group is carrying out  ""legal informational actions"" dissociated from any ""activities  violating the law.""    The information about the Liberation Party's activities and  other groups in Britain came from France and several Arab  states, according to the sources.    The police sources estimated the number of the  organization's  members in Britain at ""a few score,"" saying that some of them  received special training in states like Iran, Afghanistan, and  Sudan. The organization's members could face imprisonment or  expulsion from Britain if they are convicted of violating the  law.     "

The ratification war is not yet won. But the end is near enough for the prime minister to believe he can and should re-affirm his support for the treaty. So he has started delivering some pro-European speeches, despite the undiluted hostility of a minority of his party, led by Lady Thatcher. So far it is not easy to detect the policy prescriptions in Mr Major's pro-European message. He is in favour of Britain's continued membership of the Community, because being outside would be worse; he believes Britain should be at the heart of Europe, whatever that may mean; but he does not have any positive agenda for where the EC should go next or what it should do. Mr Major is happy to express hostility to any form of centralism in Brussels. But for the rest, what we are getting is a message which is pro-European in tone, but without any discernible policy content. We should not be surprised. There was a time, in the distant past, when some people in the original six member states believed that Britain would eventually outgrow its innate scepticism, and come to understand, or even share, their commitment to the Community model of European integration. The reality of two decades of British membership has disabused them of this touching faith. The plain fact is that the British political establishment does not like the treaty, and does not care much for the Community either. And the depth of its aversion has emerged clearly in the Maastricht ratification debates. Ostensibly there is a large majority in Westminster in favour of the treaty. But the debate over the social chapter has exposed a deeper reality, because it has generated conditions in which quite different alliances can conduct a covert fight against the Community behind the cloak of opposing party ideologies. Objective reasons for Britain's Euro-scepticism are elusive. The UK economy is not radically different from other Community members. Whatever Mrs Thatcher's wishes, Britain is not like America: its social structures are similar to those of all other European countries, with highly developed networks of public welfare, health, education and social protection. Whatever its irrational reasons, it is manifest that the British political establishment is uncomfortable with the European ambitions of its opposite numbers on the Continent. Until last September, Mr Major pretended to have a European policy, in the formula: Pounds 1 = DM 2.95. Events showed this was just a slogan, built on a fantasy. Arguably, Mr Major needs a more solid European policy, and needs it urgently. Ratification of Maastricht is not the end of the story. Unless the exchange rate mechanism collapses completely, the other states will press forward. What will Mr Major say then? The negotiations to admit new members from EFTA cannot fail to re-open debate on the full gamut of Maastricht commitments. What will Mr Major say then? At the very least, enlargement must include more majority voting, and most likely a strengthening of the European Parliament. What will Mr Major say then? If he is not to be wrong-footed on such politically loaded policies, he needs to look for some issue where he can take a slightly more constructive stance. The obvious choice should be the foreign and security policy chapter in the treaty, because Britain has real assets: its diplomatic service, its professional army, its seat on the Security Council, its nuclear weapons. But the British establishment's conditioned reflexes jerk it three ways: the claims of European co-operation have tended to give way to great-power nostalgia or to vice-regal submission to the US. Bosnia has been a case in point. While the US stayed home, Britain and France worked hand-in-hand. When President Clinton threatened to get involved, Britain cranked round to get in line, regardless of the merits of the new US policy. This US whip-saw cannot be good, either for Europe or for Nato. Now there is a school of thought in Whitehall that Britain is under no urgent pressure to respond to the Community agenda. First, the programme for Economic and Monetary Union is in disarray. Second, some other member states are themselves in political difficulty; for example, Italy, Belgium, Spain. Third, there are major uncertainties over the costs of our social welfare systems. It would be difficult to deny the reality or the gravity of these problems. There is clearly a multi-faceted crisis of the European nation state; one facet is political corruption, as in France, Spain and, above all, Italy; another is the failure of the left-right political model, as in France; a third is the tension between the illusion of national sovereignty and the pain of regional solidarity. There is also the crisis of European competitivity, which shows up in the arguments over EMU, over the costs of the welfare state and the social chapter, and contradictory pressures between protectionism and trade liberalisation in the Uruguay Round negotiations. And then there is the crisis of strategic disorder - witness the disintegration of Russia and Yugoslavia. But anyone who argues that these crises exonerate Britain from coming to terms with the Community paradigm, and from finding a constructive European policy, is making a mistake. Unfortunately, it is the same mistake Britain has been making for 50 years.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.     P9721 International Affairs.

It finds that UK retail prices for a range of branded foods, drinks and consumer products are 17 per cent less than the average for 14 European countries and 43 per cent lower than in Sweden, the dearest country. The survey, carried out for the Financial Times last month by Nielsen, the market research company, also finds little evidence that leading consumer product manufacturers have raised their UK prices since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Of 31 market-leading branded products surveyed, 17 have fallen in price since August, by as much as 7 per cent. The biggest rise, for canned salmon, was 23 per cent, though the price had moved sharply up and down in the previous six months. In several cases, price cuts of brand leaders were not matched fully by retailers' own-label products, which are usually cheaper. The survey covered a basket of 45 'Euro-brands' - products sold in at least four of the larger European countries. Among the products assessed were processed foods, snacks, pet food, alcohol, soft drinks, household cleaners and personal care products. Britain was cheapest in every product category except alcoholic drinks, for which prices were 6 per cent above the European average. Prices in Austria were 56 per cent higher than the European average and in Ireland and Switzerland 47 per cent higher. Among the best bargains in Britain are Heinz tomato ketchup, Kellogg's cornflakes, Whiskas cat food and Palmolive washing liquid. All are half or less the average European price. However, some items still cost more in Britain than elsewhere. The UK price of Ajax household cleaner is 8 per cent higher than the European average and twice the level in Spain, while Nutella chocolate spread and Danone yoghurt are respectively 10 per cent and 18 per cent above the European average. The cheapest country after Britain is France, where the basket of 'Euro-brands' costs 96 per cent of the average, followed by Greece, Spain and Germany.

Many thousands of Malaysians study at British universities and colleges. The Malaysian Trust Council, a government-backed agency, said that about 1,000 students it had intended sending to Britain would now go elsewhere. The council would terminate a contract with a British company which places Malaysian students in British universities, it added. Last Friday, Malaysia announced a ban on giving government contracts to British companies in retaliation for reports in the British media alleging that senior Malaysian officials had taken payments from British companies which had been seeking contracts in Malaysia. Mr Sulaiman Daud, Malaysian education minister, said Malaysian colleges should end twinning arrangements with British educational institutions. 'Private colleges which do not comply will be risking their business,' Mr Sulaiman added. Concern has been expressed by British companies that virtually all contracts in Malaysia, whether public or private ones, would be affected by the ban. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian minister for trade and industry, said yesterday that the move against British companies should not be viewed in any way as a trade barrier or sanction. 'The notion that Malaysia had imposed trade sanctions against Britain is not true at all,' the trade and industry minister declared. 'It's merely centred on not entertaining tenders from British firms.'   Countries:-  MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT931-14128 ,"FT931-14128 _AN-DATCPACLFT 930120   FT  20 JAN 93 / The myth of Britain's decline      By GEOFFREY OWEN   Is there no limit to the British passion for self-denigration? Newspapers and magazines are filled with articles lamenting - or revelling in - the breakdown of national institutions, the demise of traditional British virtues and the weakening of the economy. After a false dawn in the 1980s, some commentators are delighted to report, Britain has regained its reputation as the sick man of Europe. This mood, spread by a coalition of frustrated anti-Thatcherites on the left and nostalgic conservatives on the right, is dangerous. By encouraging the belief in an all-encompassing British decline, it distracts attention from the piecemeal attack on specific problems which are neither insuperable in themselves nor substantially different in character and severity from those that afflict other countries. The media establishment (far more powerful than the old 'establishment' which is said to rule our lives) trots out the usual culprits - class system, public schools, anti-industrial culture and so on. Most of these gloomy diagnoses are linked, directly or indirectly, to a sense of disappointment, even despair, over Britain's economic performance since the second world war. But is this despair really justified? An understanding of Britain's postwar record is not helped by the tendency, perhaps reflecting wartime successes, to overstate the country's competitive strengths in the 1940s and 1950s. There is a widespread view that Britain, mainly through the ineptitude of businessmen, threw away opportunities for industrial leadership after the war. But it is quite unrealistic to suppose that, in the trading environment which prevailed from the 1950s and 1960s onwards, Britain could have retained industrial leadership, except in one or two sectors where domestic conditions were particularly favourable. The liberalisation of world trade posed problems of adjustment for Britain, as it did for the other advanced industrial nations. As a medium-sized industrial power Britain had to find a place in an integrated world economy in which other nations - the US and Japan in some fields, the newly industrialising countries in others - had important competitive advantages. Britain faced a number of particular obstacles in making this transition, some stemming from the legacy of the industrial revolution (outdated structures and institutions in older industries such as textiles and steel), some from post-war events (the sellers' market of 1945-51, the orientation to the Commonwealth, delayed entry into the Common Market). These and other factors made it more difficult for Britain to grow as fast as its continental neighbours in the 1950s and 1960s. It might have been better if Britain had resigned itself to slower but steadier expansion during that period, instead of trying to kick-start the economy and then, after the dash for growth had fizzled out, looking for scapegoats to explain its failure. From the early 1960s, when the habit of national self-denigration began to take hold, the search for scapegoats - and for miracle cures borrowed from other countries - has been a recurring theme in British economic comment. Viewed from today's perspective, the industrial adjustment which has taken place since 1960 can be seen as neither brilliant nor catastrophic, but a patchy outcome not hugely different from that of, say, France. Compared with the continental countries, Britain did less well in the earlier post-war period, with governments and industries fumbling for a way round the obstacles, but more respectably since the late 1970s, as companies responded to intense international competition and took advantage of the Thatcher government's reforms. None of this justifies complacency over the productivity lag which persists in many industries, or over the loss of capacity resulting from the earlier period of floundering, followed by two severe recessions. But it is not helpful to regard these problems, and more generally the serious economic difficulties which the country now faces, as symptoms of some deep-seated flaw in the system which, almost by definition, is irremediable. Constructive self-criticism is welcome, as are practical proposals for dealing with individual ailments. Exaggerated gloom about all things British is unnecessary and counter-productive.

The payment, to be made to Australia, was the two countries'  contribution towards settlement of an International Court of  Justice (ICJ) case brought by Nauru.    Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating last year announced  Canberra would pay 107 million Australian dollars (75 million  U.S.) to Nauru to assist in rehabilitation of the island,  severely strip mined for its phosphate under colonial rule.    Australia, New Zealand and Britain shared rule of Nauru from  1914 to 1968 and, under the quasi-government British Phosphate  Commission (BPC), took the phosphate at very low prices, while  paying nothing to repair the land.    After Keating made the sudden offer as Nauru prepared to  take  Australia to the ICJ. [sentence as received]    ``Australia had sought appropriate contributions from New  Zealand and the United Kingdom and the level of contribution has  now been agreed,'' McKinnon said.    He said Britain had already paid Australia and Wellington  would do so shortly.    Nauru has not ruled out the possibility of taking separate  action against London and Wellington, but if Tuesday's  contribution is all the two countries now have to pay they will  have done much better in the deal than Canberra did.    Given that the BPC was controlled by a representative each  from the three powers, and its resources were shared, Australia  could have asked for as much as 36 million dollars from both  London and Wellington.    Nauru, a former German colony, was extensively mined by the  BPC, in contravention of the League of Nations, and later United  Nations, mandate.    BPC's operations were a state secret and details never  revealed at the time.    It was both the buyer and seller of phosphate, rigging the  price to subsidize farmers and publishing two sets of books --  one for the League and another secret set showing the real  picture.    In preliminary pleadings to the ICJ in 1990 Australia  objected to the court dealing with the case on the grounds of  lack of jurisdiction, bad faith on Nauru's part, and failure to  join New Zealand and Britain as parties.    Australia argued a full and final settlement was reached at  the time of independence in 1968.    Although the colonial powers were committed to  rehabilitation  in law, nothing was done and 21 square kilometre (8.4 square  mile) Nauru is largely a wasteland, its 9,600 people living on a  narrow coastal strip.

Downing Street officials indicated that Britain may not veto a rise in the number of votes needed to block legislation from 23 to 27 to prevent it being blamed for jeopardising the Union's enlargement. Agreement by Britain to compromise would allow successful negotiations on the entry into the EU of Sweden, Finland and Austria to be approved by the European Parliament and help smooth the few remaining obstacles to Norwegian entry into the Union. The signs of movement in London were welcomed by European Commission officials in Brussels last night. Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, who oppose increasing the number of votes required to block decisions by the EU Council of Ministers, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next January. However, government business managers are worried about possible backbench rebellions by Euro-sceptic MPs and have warned ministers of the difficulty of getting legislation through the House of Commons if they agree to compromise. At present the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76, distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement, with the entry of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, it is proposed that the blocking minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90. But Britain may have been attracted by a Spanish proposal which would allow the blocking vote to rise to 27 once the new members join the EU, while maintaining a further blocking vote at 23 provided a maximum of three countries made up the 23 votes. That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one small one - with a combined population of at least 100m - to block decisions, possibly until an EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 when voting weights could be renegotiated. But as Mr John Major last night met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to finalise Britain's negotiating position, leading Conservative Euro-sceptics said they would oppose any 'climbdown'. Mr William Cash, one of the leading Euro-sceptics, said the Commons would not put up with 'more erosion' of its powers. However, faced with the choice of another dispute with its European partners or its Euro-sceptics, Whitehall officials predicted the government would pick the latter as long as it was confident of limiting any backbench rebellion. Mr John Major's officials said the prime minister was determined to defend British interests 'in an enlarged Community and get enlargement'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last night said that it had not received any acceptable offer over the size of the blocking veto, but underlined its commitment to enlargement. Another official predicted that 'a compromise of some sort will emerge'. Senior British officials in Brussels signalled over two weeks ago that they could live with the Spanish formula, although, formally, they were yesterday insisting there was no change in London's position. Nevertheless, Spanish negotiators are depending on UK support, and any likely compromise may take the form of a 'declaration' by the 12. Anything more binding risks being turned down by the European Parliament, which is refusing to ratify the new members' accession treaty if the 12 make it too easy for a minority of member states to block Euro-laws.

A British Gas executive yesterday confirmed that 'we have been discussing with YPF a number of possible joint ventures. There is an offering in the South Atlantic and we have discussed the possibility of joining up with YPF, but there is nothing formal yet.' The government plans to sell rights to six blocks in Argentine waters adjacent to Falkland waters. A tender was scheduled for last Wednesday, but YPF requested it be postponed for 90 days after British Gas had asked for more time to analyse technical data. A government official said no other companies were interested in the region because of the dispute with Britain over the Falkland islands. None the less, two companies are carrying out seismic exploration surveys off the Falklands under licences issued by the islands. Buenos Aires is anxious to increase British trade and investment, which it hopes would allay the Falklands' suspicion of Argentina and create commercial ties with Britain that would offset the vociferous pro-Falkland lobby in London.

0,FT924-2485 ,"FT924-2485 _AN-CLMAOAAXFT 921212   FT  12 DEC 92 / Brussels takes embarrassed look at UK barriers to porn      By ANDREW HILL      BRUSSELS   WITH LESS than three weeks to go until the single European market is born, EC Commission officials are being obliged to take an interest in British pornography. Brussels has received a number of inquiries from 'small UK importers', questioning whether British customs authorities have the right to impound certain magazines and videos. The importers say the pornography - mainly Dutch - is no worse than items made in Britain and sold as sex education videos and manuals in High Street newsagents and bookshops. Brussels officials will have to decide whether the UK is discriminating against foreign pornography and whether the British authorities should be able to continue to control the import of videos, magazines and sex aids at the border after January 1. If the importers' claim can be proved, then Britain is almost certainly breaking EC law. So far there has been no formal complaint and no inquiry has been opened. What's more, the Commission has no objection to EC countries outlawing certain types of pornography on moral grounds, and certainly does not want to be cast as the arbiter of decency in such a case. A much higher priority is being given to the question of border controls on pornography, which, like all frontier checks on goods, should disappear on January 1. On Thursday, Britain will chair the final meeting of internal market ministers before declaring Europe open for business. One of the UK's priorities will be the abolition of systematic frontier controls on goods. As one British official pointed out yesterday, 'removal of border controls won't mean that Dutch porn can flood into the UK'. Instead, checks will be based on intelligence information. But, as Commission officials point out, if the checks are too heavy - and carried out exclusively at border crossings - Britain may find itself in front of the European Court for breaking single market rules on the free movement of goods.

The Foreign Office gave Sudan'a fundamentalist Islamic  government a deadline of Tuesday January 4 to think again.    As the already strained relations between the two countries  worsened, the Sudanese charges d'affaires in London, Abdul  Rahman Bakhit [name as received], was summoned to the Foreign  Office to explain the ""totally unjustified expulsion.""    He left after a 35-minute meeting with Sir Michael Burton,  the assistant under-secretary covering the Middle East, Near  East and North Africa.    Officials said he had been given a strong rebuke and was  told  that his explanation for the expulsion of envoy Peter Streams  was ""wholly inadequate.""    Mr. Bakhit had said one of the reasons for the expulsion was  Mr. Streams' persistent contacts with opposition leaders in the  southern rebel-held area of Sudan.    The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. George Carey, is currently  on a high-profile visit to Christians in southern Sudan.    Foreign Office officials said the visit had merely brought  to  a head a simmering situation between Britain and Sudan.    In a strongly worded statement after the meeting, the  Foreign  Office said Sir Michael had underlined Britain's ""profound  dissatisfaction and regret"" at the ""unjustifiable"" decision to  expel the ambassador.    Mr. Bakhit had told Sir Michael that Mr. Streams was seen as  an ""obstruction to attempts to improve bilateral relationships.""  His contact with opposition figures was also criticised.    Sir Michael dismissed these explanations as ""wholly  inadequate"" and asked Mr. Bakhit to convey this message to his  government together with the request to ""immediately reconsider""  the expulsion if it valued its relationship with the UK.    The Foreign Office said Mr. Streams was a highly respected  ambassador who had reported back to it about human rights abuses  in Sudan. A spokesman said: ""We consider our ambassadors have a  duty to report a wide range of political views.""    He added: ""We value our relationship with the Sudanese  government but we want to see progress in finding a just  solution to the current war in the south.""    Asked if Britain was considering retaliation such as  expelling Sudan representatives in London, the spokesman said:  ""It is clearly one of the options, but we do have to await the  response of the Sudanese government.""    Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs  spokesman, warned against Britain adopting a ""tit-for-tat  attitude"" in the row with Sudan.    ""If you want to get to grips with the real problem, which is  the application of Islamic fundamentalism to the rule of the  state, you don't help dialogue by breaking off relations,"" he  told Radio 4's ""The World at One.""

0,FT944-5288 ,"FT944-5288 _AN-ELECYAAHFT 941205   FT  05 DEC 94 / Germans and British hold similar views on European Union: One third support local council power - Both countries find US most reliable ally / Single currency widely opposed      By DAVID MARSH   In the Euro-enthusiasm rankings, Britain and Germany usually appear at different ends of the league table. Germany traditionally embodies a commitment to deepening and widening European integration, while Britain is well known for its scepticism. The customary view of the breadth of the Euro-gulf between the two countries was put baldly by a German minister earlier this year: 'We want a united Europe. All you (the British) want is a free trade zone.' In fact, as one of the most comprehensive polls ever undertaken on the subject shows, the views of the British and German electorates on the future of Europe are closer than such statements suggest. Although Germans are much happier with the present position of their country and their regions within the European Union, they are even more sceptical than the British about intensifying political and monetary ties with existing EU partners. They have also grown reluctant about widening the EU towards the east. There is a similar desire in both countries for decisions to be taken as much as possible at the local level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity that the EU has been trying to foster. A third of respondents in Britain and Germany say decisions affecting ordinary people should be carried out by local government or councils. However, this wish is much more difficult to put into practice in Britain because of the weakness of local and regional governments. Both countries think the US is more reliable than their European partners, with two-fifths of respondents naming Washington as their nation's strongest ally. The Germans view France far more favourably than Britain. More surprisingly, a relatively large percentage of Britons above the age of 60 - some 8 per cent - sees Germany as Britain's strongest ally. Eastern Germans show above-average reliance on the US and are even less inclined than west Germans to point to Russia as an ally. In attitudes towards Europe, there are large disparities according to age, social background and region in both Britain and Germany. Broadly speaking, in both countries young higher-income males are most in favour of EU membership, while women take a more sceptical line. Conservative voters in Germany are more positive about the EU than those on the left, while in Britain Labour supporters are slightly more inclined to call EU membership 'a good thing'. Younger British people are much more in favour of increasing powers for the European parliament and building up EU political ties than are older voters. The generation gap on such points is less marked in Germany. In Britain many more older people than younger ones say their region is worse off as a result of the EU, while in Germany, the opposite is true: older people are more favourable to membership than those under 30. Support for the Ecu as a possible name for a future European currency is strongest among higher-income voters with better educational backgrounds in both Germany and Britain. Britons are much more gloomy than Germans on the present economic impact of the EU. Although support for EU membership has declined significantly in both countries during the past few years, it has descended in Germany from a much higher base. In Britain, only one region - Scotland - out of 11 maintains, on balance, that it has benefited from EU membership. By contrast, in Germany six of the 10 regions say they are 'better off' as the result of the EU. In Germany, Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Berlin are most enthusiastic about regional benefits. Overall support for the EU is only slightly greater in western Germany than in the east, a sign that increases in Brussels funding for east Germany may be starting to improve pro-EU sentiment in the east. Some of the most negative attitudes on the EU's regional impact are found in areas of high unemployment such as Yorkshire and northern England, and Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. However, relatively prosperous southern regions in both countries - London and south-east England, and Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg - also show negative reactions. There is a sharp contrast between Britain and Germany over the European parliament, with half of Britons opposed to giving it new powers to control the Commission, compared with only 12 per cent in Germany. On fundamental questions of the EU's future structure, however, the two countries are closer. Opposition to a single currency, a strong desire for a referendum on the issue, and lukewarm views on political union are put forward consistently by all categories of respondents in different regions in the two countries. Lowest support for a single currency comes from southern regions of both Britain and Germany, with eastern Germany more reticent than the west. Strongest support for a referendum comes from the state of Hesse - the home of the German Bundesbank. German eagerness to forge closer links with eastern Europe may be cooling as a result of economic pressure. East German states are only slightly more keen on enlarging the EU eastwards than the generally sceptical west Germans; in previous opinion polls the east Germans had been much more in favour. Supporters of the Christian Democratic Union are least enthusiastic about enlargement. The German states with the strongest desire for enlargement - Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, close to the French border - are furthest away from the east. In Britain, Scotland and south-west England are most in favour of eastward enlargement, with other southern areas much less keen. When scores are combined on a range of issues linking feelings about the EU's present impact to views about its future, Rhineland-Palatinate has by far the highest 'Euro-comfort' index of the two countries. Only one British region - Scotland - has a positive score, compared with nine in Germany. The population in the newcomer east German states seems much less ignorant about the EU than much of Britain. In Brandenburg an above-average 57 per cent answered correctly that Brussels is the site of the European Commission. The east Midlands takes the prize as the worst-informed region, with only 38 per cent of respondents replying correctly. The most knowledgeable areas seem to be North Rhine-Westphalia and south-west England, where 64 per cent of respondents correctly identified Brussels.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What Britons and Germans think of Europe  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Which regions say they are better or worse off as a result of EU membership Numbers indicate difference between 'better off' and 'worse off' Britain                            Germany Scotland                    2      Schleswig-Holsten, Hamburg       12 North-west                -15      Bremen, Lower Saxony            -13 West Midlands              -9      North Rhine-Westphalia            9 Wales                     -18      Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate   29 South-west                -26      Baden-Wuttemberg                 -4 North                     -23      Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Yorkshire  Humberside    -21      Brandenburg                     -10 East Midlands              -4      Berlin                            8 East Anglia                -7      Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, South-east                -16      Thuringia                         4 London                    -12      Hesse                             6                                    Bavaria                          -5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Is your region better or worse off as a result of your country's membership of the European Union?

The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF  [Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of  Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa.  British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics,  shipbuilding and technical training.    British security interests are expected to increase  significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are  already working in several countries in the region and Mr  Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa  might return to the Commonwealth.    South African and British officials regard the appointment  of  Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating  that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which  could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa.    South African officials suggest the renewal of military  links  with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with  Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology  weapons industries.    South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain  its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has  allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious  contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1  billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters.    It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this  week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.     "

Mr Alastair Goodlad, a Foreign Office minister, said that Britain received representations from Malaysia over the trial of Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian banker who was accused of taking part in a fraud in Hong Kong. Mr Goodlad did not reveal details of the exchanges between British and Malaysian officials between 1983 and 1993. But his statement added to newspaper speculation that the government withheld important telexes from Mr Osman's trial in exchange for Malaysia's decision to buy Pounds 1.3bn of British military equipment. Mr Goodlad's response came in a parliamentary written answer to Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery. He is pressing ministers to release the telexes suppressed in the Osman case under the system of public interest immunity certificates. Dr Kua Kia Soong, an opposition leader in Kuala Lumpur, is reported to have claimed in the Malaysian parliament that his country had agreed to buy arms from Britain to avoid the release in court of 'sensitive documents' which could have implicated Malaysian politicians in a banking scandal. The Commons public accounts committee will next week produce a highly critical report on the government's support for Malaysia's Pergau dam project.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

There will be grounds  for accusing the Dublin government of folly, if not mischief, in  pressing Britain so hard to extend the written dialogue with the  Republicans.    For now, Sir Patrick's explanation -- that merely answering  questions does not represent the ""clarification"" which he and Mr  Major ruled out when Sinn Fein first responded to the Downing  Street Declaration -- seems narrowly tenable. The original  demand for ""clarification"" seemed to mean negotiation in all but  name -- an impression borne out by Mr Adams's refusal to say  exactly what he wanted -- while the IRA continued to exert  pressure by means of terrorism.    If Mr Adams is still merely playing for time, further  disingenuous inquiries will no doubt be forthcoming from Sinn  Fein, designed to inch the Government ever closer to the  negotiating table. The form of some of Sinn Fein's current  questions invites such suspicion. For instance, ""What are the  means and within what time does Britain expect to see agreement  reached between all the Irish people?"" is tantamount to  demanding a timetable for a united Ireland. On this and other  points, Mr Adams should be directed towards the relevant  passages of the Declaration. The Government cannot prudently go  further, in advance of a permanent IRA cease-fire.    There remains the possibility, however, that Britain's  uncompromising tactics have started to bear fruit. Sinn Fein  may at last realise that negotiation is unattainable without a  cease-fire. Answers to his questions may enable Mr Adams, who is  alleged to be among the Sinn Fein ""peace party"", to win over  some of the more militant IRA cadres without losing face. If  Sir Patrick is merely issuing prolix statements of the obvious,  thereby assisting Mr Adams to get off the hook on which he has  publicly impaled himself, the risk he is taking might yet prove  worthwhile.    Dublin's position is less straight-forward. By adding its  own voice to Mr Adams's request for answers from Sir Patrick,  the Irish government has chosen to vouch for the good faith of  this latest initiative. But the Irish government's agreement to  use its influence with Britain in this way imposes a duty to  apply equal pressure in the other direction. As we have said  before, Dublin's principal responsibility now is to use its  weight to educate and moderate Nationalist and Republican  sentiment, in Ireland and elsewhere, while not upsetting, Ulster  Unionist opinion. In the wake of Sir Patrick's replies, Dublin  must move to assure Irish and world opinion that Britain will  have done all it could reasonably be expected to do.     "

The former Labour leader angered Tory MPs by immediately making known his intention to seek to overturn the opt-out secured by Mr John Major, the prime minister, from the regulations that can be imposed on employers from Brussels. Mr Kinnock's appointment to the Pounds 103,000-a-year post was welcomed by Mr Tony Blair, the new leader of the Labour party. Mr Blair said: 'He will be a great asset both to Britain and Europe and I wish him every success.' Mr Kinnock explained why he would back the demands that Britain should keep in line with the other member states of the European Union by accepting the social chapter. He said: 'It is a modest way of defining basic standards for workforces.' He emphasised that there were several countries and many employers in Europe who took strong exception to the possibility that, while free from the obligation to comply with the social chapter, Britain would become a place for 'social dumping'. Mr Kinnock said: 'My general disposition is to seek to ensure that none of the employers in the EU are disadvantaged in their relationships one with the other.' Sir Leon Brittan, the former Conservative cabinet minister, will continue as Britain's senior representative at the European Commission. The government is expected to exert strong pressure in Brussels to ensure that Mr Kinnock's role in the commission covers overseas development - a policy area in which he has always been closely interested. Mr Kinnock's wife, Glenys, became one of the Welsh Labour members of the European parliament in June. Mr Kinnock's departure from Westminster will necessitate a by-election in his Islwyn constituency, a Welsh Labour stronghold, which he has represented since 1983. He had a majority of 24,728 at the last election. Before that he represented the former Bedwellty constituency from 1970. Mr Kinnock led the Labour party for nine years, resigning in 1992 after the party's second general-election defeat under his leadership.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT923-5123 ,"FT923-5123 _AN-CIEAPAAAFT 920903   FT  03 SEP 92 / Brussels and UK close to agreement on border controls      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   THE UK and the European Commission are close to a compromise on the long-running dispute over Britain's insistence on retaining border controls on people beyond the end of this year. The Commission has conceded Britain's right to maintain general spot-checks at British ports of entry, while the UK government has pledged to lighten the controls on European Community nationals, EC and British officials said yesterday. The border issue has proved one of the thorniest questions to resolve in the movement toward a single EC market. Under the Single European Act, all controls on goods, services and people are to be lifted by January 1 1993. But Britain has insisted on guarding its frontiers against the threat of drug-smugglers, terrorists and organised crime. Mr Martin Bangemann, the German commissioner for the internal market, held talks this week with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, in which Mr Clarke presented new proposals for breaking the impasse. 'My feeling is that we can find a pragmatic solution,' Mr Bangemann said in Brussels yesterday. The commissioner said that Britain and the Commission shared the general aim of scrapping controls on the movement of people within the EC. The dilemma was how EC citizens could be identified by British immigration without having to subject their passports to scrutiny or other onerous controls. One solution would be for EC nationals merely to wave their EC passports as they walked through immigration, he suggested. The British authorities would be able to retain controls on non-EC nationals, while also maintaining spot-checks on suspected illegal entrants, he stressed. Mr Bangemann also hinted that earlier Commission threats to bring Britain before the European Court of Justice for maintaining its border controls had been dropped. In effect, both sides had agreed to disagree on their interpretation of article 8a of the Single European Act requiring an end to all controls. Britain has insisted that its vulnerability as an island state is much greater than that of its continental partners and cited the border issue as an example of Commission meddling. British officials have also cast doubt on the effectiveness of immigration controls in southern EC states such as Greece. Despite the prospect of compromise with the Commission on border checks, Britain remains at odds with Spain over the sovereignty of Gilbraltar. This is holding up the long-awaited convention on strengthening the EC's external frontiers. Mr Bangemann, who has just completed a report on progress towards the single market, painted a rosy picture yesterday. Some 90 per cent of the proposals originally set out in 1985 had been adopted by the 12 partners.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

The MPs are expected to echo in a report to be published later this month calls by the Department of Trade and Industry's aviation committee for increased government backing for the sector to help British aerospace companies keep pace with their overseas rivals. The MPs - on the trade and industry select committee - will recommend that the DTI should work more closely with the Ministry of Defence, the industry's biggest customer, to chart a strategic course for Britain's aerospace sector. They are expected to urge that a regular survey of the level of government support for aerospace in Britain and other countries be compiled and to warn that Britain could be squeezed out of international markets unless adequate resources for technological RD are provided. In a confidential report last October the aviation committee - which includes civil servants and industry representatives - called for Britain to develop a national strategic technology acquisition plan. It said it was 'imperative' to protect Britain's position as a world class aerospace manufacturer that the government-corporate sector partnership in research and technology acquisition be reinforced. Funding by the government-industry partnership should 'at least be in proportion to the investment undertaken by our closest competitors and collaborators'.   Countries:-  GBZ   United Kingdom, EC.

The memorandum of understanding, a copy of which has been  obtained by the GUARDIAN reveals that the Government was  prepared to set up cheap loans for the Malaysians to subsidise  their purchase of British defence exports. The Government would  pay the difference between the banks' commercial rates and the  concessionary rate it was offering, involving potential  subsidies worth tens of millions of pounds.    Labour and Liberal Democrat MP's expressed outrage last  night. The terms of the memorandum were ""absolutely monstrous,""  said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman.    The funding deal is in addition to the 234 million pound aid  that Britain agreed to give to Malaysia to build the Pergau dam,  which was described as a bad buy by Sir Tim Lankester, permanent  secretary at the Overseas Development Administration.    Foreign Office ministers have already admitted that this aid  was tied to a mathematical formula on the sale of arms.    On funding, the agreement reads: ""The total payment for any  equipment procured under this (memorandum) will be provided by  the Malaysian government but in the event that there is any  shortfall in the funding, the United Kingdom government will  assist in the arrangement of financial facilities provided by a  United Kingdom bank or a group of United Kingdom banks and the  United Kingdom will ensure that the interest to be charged will  be at concessionary rates.""    The 15-part memorandum reveals that Britain was prepared to  go further than the normal practice of providing spares and  ensuring that defence companies offered training to foreign  troops and pilots in the use of arms equipment. In this case  the Government agreed to train Malaysian troops in Britain in  military strategy, advising on war and defence plans.    The document reveals that like the huge arms deal with Saudi  Arabia, Lady Thatcher agreed to set up a unit inside the  Ministry of Defence [MoD] in support of the 1 billion pound  deal, and she established an MoD team in Malaysia to assist.    Lady Thatcher also agreed to supply the Malaysians with a  list of firms supplying arms aircraft and ships, and advising on  companies the Government regarded as most reliable.    The British proposed to charge the Malaysian government a  sum  tied to the order price of up to 10 million pounds as a  management fee for its assistance in training and advice,  including a down-payment of 1 million pounds within 30 days of  the first order being made.    Mr Campbell said: ""The terms of the funding arrangements  which required the British government to arrange cheap credit  for the Malaysian government are absolutely monstrous. What  possible justification can there be for such an arrangement  unless there was a direct connection with some other financial  deal?""

George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, said: ""This is  absolutely outrageous. It amounts to a sweetheart deal financed  by the British taxpayer.""

This is a pragmatic approach.    Ma Yuzhen told reporters yesterday that the Chinese  Government has taken account of Hong Kong's interests in  adopting this pragmatic attitude on current Sino-British  relations.    Both the Chinese and British sides clearly understand that  it  is impossible to hold talks again on Hong Kong's constitutional  reform, Ma Yuzhen pointed out; but both sides are aware that  there is still a need to cooperate on issues other than Hong  Kong's constitutional reform, he added.    He cited as an example that Hong Kong's economy and its  people's lives must not be ignored because the talks on Hong  Kong's constitutional reform have failed. In addition, China  and Britain must cooperate in international affairs and in their  economic and trade relations. British Foreign Office Minister  Alastair Goodlad will visit Beijing in July. This indicates  both sides' wish for cooperation.    On the prospects for Sino-British trade, which has received  attention in all circles, Ma Yuzhen said that the Chinese  Government welcomes British businessmen's investments in China  and hopes that British businessmen will have opportunities.

Aiming To Support the Independence of Tibet, Taiwan    The Report quotes a 1943 British diplomatic document,  saying:  ""The British Government has always been willing to recognize  China's suzerainty over Tibet; however, such recognition must be  based on an understanding of Tibet's autonomy""; at the same  time, the document maintained that Tibet should be allowed  ""fuller autonomy"" when necessary, and proposed that the British  Government ""hold discussions on the issue of Tibet's right to  self-determination"" with its Chinese counterpart. Those who  have a knowledge of politics see clearly that suzerainty and  sovereignty are two entirely different concepts; the  nationality-defined autonomous region within a sovereign country  and the relations between a metropolis and its vassal are  basically different. The so-called recognition of China's  ""suzerainty"" and Tibet's ""fuller autonomy"" referred to in the  document is precisely meant to violate China's sovereignty, so  that Tibet would leave the Chinese Government's jurisdiction and  realize its independence in disguise under the pretext of  ""autonomy."" The reason why the British Parliament shows such  extraordinary concern over Tibet lies -- just as the report says  -- in ""the historical ties between Britain and Tibet."" Such  ""ties"" actually stem from the shameful history of Britain's  invasion of China's Tibet and its intervention in Tibetan  affairs. Regrettably, the British have the guts to glorify  themselves with that incident. Back in 1888 and 1903, when  Britain met with strong resistance in its invasion of Tibet,  Britain changed its strategy and took the goal of separating  Tibet from China. In 1907, when imperial Russia signed the  ""Treaty on the British-Russian Alliance,"" which aimed to contend  for Central Asia, it had -- for the first time in history --  misrepresented China's sovereignty over Tibet and changed it  into ""suzerainty."" At the Simla Conference in 1913, with  participation of British and Tibetan delegates, the British  Government required the Chinese Government to recognize the  ""autonomy of outer Tibet (including Tibet and western Sikang),""  and ""refrain from intervening in its internal affairs,"" with the  effect of changing China's sovereignty over Tibet into  suzerainty. Thanks to the strong opposition of the Chinese  Government, the British attempt to sever Tibet from China was  never successful. This shows that the British Parliamentary  Foreign Affairs Select Committee is actually playing the same  old tune and Britain has never given up its effort to separate  Tibet from China. The so-called ""violation of human rights in  Tibet and threats to Tibetan cultural and religious  characteristics"" are nothing but pretexts. The report asserts,  ""a satisfactory solution to anxieties over the former (human  rights violations) will be possible only by making progress in  the latter (the Tibetan right to self-determination); this  statement reveals the aforementioned British effort. If we  examine Tibet's actual conditions, in the 43 years since its  peaceful liberation, it has thoroughly abolished the extremely  backward feudal serfdom, and, consequently, a million former  serfs have taken the bright road of modernization. There is a  world of difference between the present human rights conditions  and those under the previous rule of slave owners in Tibet. The  so-called ""human rights violations"" are obviously a deliberate  exaggeration, and even a fabrication at that.    According to the report's own words, ""signs of a thaw"" in  the  ""rigid"" relations between the British Government and Taiwan have  surfaced in recent years. In 1992, Britain appointed a diplomat  to the general executive office of the Committee for  British-Taiwan Trade (which was later changed into the British  Office for Trade and Culture.) For the first time, the British  Minister of Trade paid Taipei an official visit in 1993. Since  Chris Patten's arrival in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong  Government has kept one eye shut, given silent consent, and  tolerated the Taiwan Authorities when they conduct activities in  a governmental capacity as well as the high-sounding activities  of Taiwan governmental organizations in Hong Kong. While  expressing admiration for such tendencies, the report says, ""it  is suggested that the Government should reassess the status of  the Taiwan office in Britain,"" ""relax related restrictions,"" and  even ""propose closer ties between Westminster and Taiwan's  Legislative Yuan."" Furthermore, it expresses the hope that the  international community ""will help Taiwan pursue its goal of  obtaining official status in the world."" In actual fact, this  aims to maintain and expand the separation of Taiwan and  mainland China, tolerating and supporting Taiwan independence,  and thus directly violating the position and commitment the  British Government has openly taken on the ""Taiwan issue.""    British Strategy of Disintegration    The report links its position on the issues of Tibet,  Taiwan,  and Hong Kong, and it is not difficult to see that the truth  behind all this can be summed up with but one word:  ""independence."" Specifically, by supporting the independence of  Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, Britain seeks to secure ""Britain's  essential interests"" and protect and expand its influence.  There are several differences: In Tibet, the British want to  recover their lost influence; in Taiwan they want to expand  their influence; and in Hong Kong, they want to protect and  maintain their special vested interests. The British have bet  their largest stake on Hong Kong. Because 1997 is approaching,  Britain knows pretty well that its influence in Hong Kong is  continuously dwindling. That being the case, it is  simultaneously playing the ""Tibet card"" and the ""Taiwan card"" so  as to more powerfully contain mainland China. At the same time,  it is attempting to join hands with the EC and the United States  to jointly deal with mainland China. Thus, the report calls on  ""the world to concern itself with the Tibet issue"" and is  pinning high hope on international public opinion toward the  Hong Kong issue. In addition, the report has done its best to  sow discord between China and its neighboring countries and has  brazenly alleged that ""other countries, especially China's  northern and western neighboring countries, will show  increasingly greater interest in how China is treating other  minority nationalities,"" in an attempt to tempt those countries  to work for Britain.    What are some British politicians really after? After some  further analysis of the report, we find that some British  politicians have become psychologically imbalanced when faced  with the rapid growth of China's national strength and its  increasingly elevated position in the world. They do not want  to see a powerful China and are being unable to forget their  dreams of splitting and weakening China and making China return  to the state of disintegration of the 1940's. Beyond a shadow  of a doubt, that is the general goal of the British politicians'  proposal for a policy toward China. The report supports Hong  Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan to pursue independence in disguise, and  calls Macao China's ""neighboring country."" It instigates  foreign intervention in China's minority nationality issues,  along with the creation of public opinion on disharmony between  the central and local governments in China. All this is being  done in pursuit of ""disintegration"" and represent important  steps in their general policy toward China. Out of the need to  maintain its rule over Hong Kong in the past, Britain was not in  the position to openly intervene in Taiwan affairs, nor dared it  be excessively aggressive over the Tibet issue. Now, the  British seem to have no misgivings whatsoever; in addition to  the tremendous changes in the world situation in the late  1980's, Britain has eventually changed its entire policy toward  China, including its policies toward Hong Kong, Taiwan, and  Tibet. Regarding the British strategy of disintegration, a  report written by British International Strategy Society early  this year contained a relatively detailed discussion of the  plan, and may serve as a footnote to the British Parliament  report.    China Is Able To Face Any Challenges    The Chinese Government has repeatedly reiterated that the  Tibet and Taiwan issues and Hong Kong affairs after its return  to China in 1997 are purely China's internal affairs, and no  foreign forces have the right to intervene. It is absurd that  the report should link opposing intervention in another  country's internal affairs to ""restricting the freedom of speech  of the citizen of another country."" Just as was indicated by  Hong Kong media, should the Chinese discuss the issue of  Northern Ireland, it is believed that Britain would not tolerate  it. Especially considering that the issues of Hong Kong,  Taiwan, and Tibet have a bearing on China's national security  and stability. Facing such major issues of principle, there is  no leeway for the Chinese Government. Furthermore, in recent  years, China has enjoyed a stable political situation, social  solidarity, and sustained rapid economic growth. Facts have  shown that China has sufficient confidence and strength to face  challenges from any international forces. At the same time,  China's relations with peripheral countries have been  consolidated and developed, and some Western countries are  showing their friendliness one after another. The current world  situation is favorable to China as well. In contrast, British  domestic issues are piling up, and the Major government can do  nothing to improve the situation. The Conservatives are  suffering from a confidence crisis which grows increasingly  serious with every passing day. In recent British local  parliamentary elections, the Conservatives have been reduced to  a third party. At the international level, British influence  within the EC has all along been insignificant, and its  relations with the United States are far from what they used to  be. With increasingly greater importance being attached to  economic factors, the British attempt to join hands with  international forces to deal with China is undoubtedly wishful  thinking. In the final analysis, all factors have decided that  any evil plots to split China will be in vain.     "

This has made rabies and the movement of pets across Europe one of the most emotive of the single-market issues. The notion that Europe is foaming with rabid wildlife and that only the channel stands in its way has led to turbulent ministerial negotiations. The UK is to be allowed to retain tough anti-rabies laws and European Commission plans to encourage free movement and substitute a Community-wide animal vaccination 'passport' in place of quarantine have been thwarted. Under the deal agreed between farm ministers in June, border controls involving domestic pets were left up to the member states, so pets coming into Britain with their owners will still have to undergo the expensive six months' quarantine, as they have for the past 25 years. Future legislation will have to involve controls at least as effective as the current ones. However, dogs and cats imported into member states by recognised dealers for sale will be able to enter without undergoing quarantine under strict conditions similar to those already imposed on farm livestock. These regulations come into force in Britain in January 1994. Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said the ability to keep quarantine regulations in Britain once other customs barriers come down would lay to rest all fears of rabies spreading from the Continent.

0,FT941-8485 ,"FT941-8485 _AN-EBTAMABUFT 940219   FT  19 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A mid-Atlantic recovery   In the dark days of the 1970s, Britain was said to have the only economy in the developed world that overheated when the chancellor started the ignition. This week a welter of statistics showed that the UK economy is as far removed from that diagnosis as Rover Group is from the days when firebrand conveners could bring it to a halt at the drop of a hub cap. The message in the official data was that most of the surprises are still coming on the side of a better than expected inflation outcome. Yesterday's weak bank lending figures confirmed that consumer demand is nothing like as buoyant as some had assumed. Everything continues to point to a slow and fumbling recovery along the path earlier described by the US. The engine has yet to warm up. In the English-speaking economies and in Japan, this is an economic cycle where financial factors are having a disproportionate influence. A build-up of debt in the personal and corporate sectors, followed by a high incidence of bad debts in the banking system, has dampened demand and reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy. A well-judged response from the US Federal Reserve, which until this month had made the recapitalisation of the banks a specific target of monetary policy, has ensured that the US banking system is now playing its part in a recovery that is robust enough to call for modest pressure on the monetary brake. While Britain went into the downturn at much the same time as the US, membership of the European exchange rate mechanism deferred its recovery. The subsequent devaluation and reduction in short-term interest rates from 15 per cent to 5 1/4 per cent means that the British economic cycle, like the soul of the Tory party, is awkwardly suspended between the US and continental Europe, which is lagging the rest of the developed world. The question is whether the present stance of monetary policy is sufficiently relaxed to ensure that April's fiscal tightening will not bring the economy to a grinding halt. Fiscal squeeze One striking difference between the British experience and that of the US is that American exporters had the benefit of a much more substantial devaluation. Another is that US real interest rates have been close to zero throughout the early stages of the recovery. In contrast, real rates in Britain remain high by comparison, with the underlying inflation at between 2 and 3 per cent. Moreover, the fiscal squeeze now proposed by the government is on a scale that far exceeds the modest tightening under way in the US. And since Britain is a more open economy, it is more beholden to its trading partners in Europe. Their problem has less to do with debt than overvalued exchange rates; and the resulting stagnation has proved a massive stumbling block to the kind of balanced, export-led recovery that Britain ought to have enjoyed against a background of continuing high personal sector borrowing and a return to surplus in the corporate sector. Modest loosening The Bundesbank's decision to signal a modest loosening of monetary policy on Thursday looks overdue. Coming after the earlier quarter-point reduction in British rates, it confirms that the US and Europe are now on divergent monetary paths. Yet despite the fact that British rates are converging with those in continental Europe it remains striking that British gross domestic product since the start of the decade has not only lagged behind the US but behind Germany and France as well. It remains way below trend by any comparative yardstick. That suggests that the authorities are still finding it hard to adjust to the new disinflationary circumstances and that UK rates will have to come down again. And it may be that the markets are finding it equally hard to adjust. The Fed's tightening at the start of the month continues to make both bond and equity markets nervous in Europe. To the extent that interest rate differentials have altered in favour of the US, some repatriation of US capital was always on the cards. Yet disinflationary forces in Europe remain very powerful, which makes the bond market response look slightly perverse. Equities, meantime, are enjoying the benefit of a very American-style mutual fund boom as falling rates make bank deposits less attractive. In Britain the personal sector has ceased to disinvest in equities and has also pushed unit trust sales to record levels. A less remarked phenomenon is the way Italian mutual fund inflows have soared over the past 15 months and French equity investment in SICAVs (unit trusts) has done much the same. If interest rates have further to fall in Britain and the rest of Europe, then instinct suggests that European capital markets should no more be taking their cue from the US than the underlying economies. The change in the direction of US interest rates was bound to impart a profound shock to global capital. But the markets, hitherto effervescent, will prove difficult to read until the dust has properly settled.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     USZ  United States of America.

Shortly after that, the U.S.  Consulate General in Hong Kong issued a statement: ""According  to what is known to the U.S. Government, it seems that Xi Yang  merely collected data by the reasonable and habitual  professional means used by reporters worldwide and his sentence  was far more serious than the crime he was accused of  committing."" The two sides expressed themselves in different  ways but the meaning was the same. They were echoing each other.    In the British Parliament report, highly praised by Patten,  a  passage stated: In its China policy, Britain ""should adopt the  same policy and carry out cooperation with other countries in  the world, especially the European allies and the United  States."" By linking these words with current happenings, people  may ask: Was Britain trying to carry out ""cooperation"" with its  allies against China by using the Xi Yang case?    Here, we may first quote the ""Proclamation"" of international  law: ""A country does not have the right to directly or  indirectly interfere in the internal and foreign affairs of  other countries for whatever reasons; therefore, armed  interference or interference in other forms, or attempts to  threaten another country's dignity or political, economic, or  cultural affairs must be condemned.""    Was the handling of Xi Yang's secret-stealing case by the  municipal judicial organs of Beijing Municipality an internal  Chinese affair? Did the criticism of China's handling of the Xi  Yang case in the form of making comments and issuing a statement  constitute interference and should this be condemned? China has  never made comments on the handling of criminal cases inside  Britain and the United States but Britain and the United States  have often attacked China's handling of criminal cases according  to its own laws. Why so? Can Mr Patten answer this?    Here, we can analyze ""what was known to the U.S.  Government.""  According to the United States, ""Xi Yang just collected data by  the reasonable and habitual professional means used by reporters  worldwide."" If that was the case, Xi Yang should not have been  found guilty but should have been given credit. Would there  still then be any difference between good and evil in the world?  Would there be any rule-of-law society?    In June and July last year, Xi Yang did not collected  so-called ""data"" in Beijing but secrets. This is a plain fact.  Some people said that China did not clearly define ""secrets""  and demanded that the state give the definition. This is  untrue. Like all other countries, China has its own secrets and  the degrees of confidentiality are determined by their influence  regarding state security and state interests. The state will  not maintain things which need not be kept confidential as  secrets. Being a reporter, especially one who has lived and  worked on the Chinese mainland for many years, Xi should be well  aware of this. Xi Yang was not unaware that he was collecting  secrets; on the contrary, he was well aware that the documents  about the printing of banknotes, the People's Bank of China's  decision on selling gold on the international market and  adjusting the interest rates, and the ""Explanation of the  Interim Rules for the Renminbi Business Operation of  Foreign-Funded Banking Institutions"" were all confidential  documents. Therefore, he pried into such information and stole  the secrets by taking surreptitious action and coming into  secret personal contact with the information supplier.    As for the ""means,"" Xi Yang adopted the means of stealing  secrets rather than the means of gathering news. Lumping these  two things together and even describing secret-stealing as the  ""habitual means used by reporters worldwide"" is just an insult  to reporters worldwide.    Reporters are not supermen and superwomen free from the  control of the law. When gathering news in any country or  region, reporters must abide by local laws and the international  norms and practices. Naturally, when gathering news in China,  reporters from outside the mainland should abide by China's  laws. When covering news in Britain and the United States,  Chinese reporters should also abide by the laws of Britain and  the United States. Would Britain and the United States allow  foreign reporters to freely pry into their secret information  and steal their secrets by despising their laws? The means is  always linked with the purpose. By seeing whether a means is  proper and legal, we should link the means with the purpose.  The means aimed at stealing secrets constitute illegal means  and must not be regarded as news covering.    A country has its national dignity, a newspaper has its  reputation, and a person has his or her personal dignity. Being  a reporter with personal dignity, he or she must not do things  which violate the rights and interests of other people in order  to curry favor with his or her employer, or do things  endangering the security and interests of a country or even his  or her own motherland! A provision of the international  convention specifies that when citizens exercise their right of  ""freedom of speech,"" they ""have to be subject to certain  constraints,"" including the need to ""respect other people's  rights and reputation"" and to ""guarantee national security,  public order, or public health and morality."" Is it not true  that reporters worldwide should abide by this norm? Can they  behave like Xi Yang in doing what is harmful to their  motherland's security and interests for the self-interest of  themselves and their newspapers? Is this the ""reasonable and  habitual professional means used by reporters worldwide?""    When covering news in China, reporters from outside the  mainland can dispatch as many reports as they like. The Chinese  authorities do not censor such reports and do not require them  to only report good news and cover up bad news. Are they not  free enough? If some people say that they are still not free  enough, does this mean that they should be allowed to freely pry  into the state's secret information and steal state secrets?

But that was 100 years ago      By DAVID MARSH   ONE HUNDRED years ago, Britain had its own single market. It was called the world. Accounting for 35 per cent of international trade in manufactured goods, the UK in 1893 ruled the waves of global commerce. A large deficit in merchandise trade was habitually more than offset by a healthy surplus in 'invisibles' - exports of services, and remittances from assets abroad. Between the battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the outbreak of the first world war, it chalked up a current account surplus - normally of the order of Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m - in every year except 1827, 1840 and 1847. In 1892, when Britain registered a visible trade deficit of Pounds 95m (and a current account surplus of Pounds 57m), roughly 40 per cent of British exports and imports represented transactions with the rest of Europe. During the last 100 years (particularly since EC membership in 1973), trade has shifted strongly towards Europe. In the first nine months of 1992, Britain ran a trade deficit of Pounds 14.5bn. Last year 56 per cent of British exports, and 52 per cent of imports, were transacted with the rest of the EC. Counting countries outside the EC, western Europe accounted for about 63 per cent of both imports and exports last year. What a difference a century makes] In 1892 Britain's trade with India exceeded that with Germany by about 10 per cent. Last year, British exports to Germany were 15 times those to India, while imports from Germany were 23 times larger than Indian ones. Nearly half of all Britain's imports in 1892 were foodstuffs and livestock. The trade returns for that year read like a colonial warehouse catalogue: grain and flour, sugar, tea, meat, butter and margarine were among the main items purchased from abroad. Britain bought 4.4m cwt of wheat from Russia, worth Pounds 1.47m; 392,679 cwt of oxen from the US, worth Pounds 7.5m, and 671,882 cwt of bacon from Denmark, costing Pounds 1.9m. Australia had already started its marketing campaign for wines: the UK bought 461,007 gallons, valued at Pounds 80,551. But the 1892 drinks trade was then, as now, dominated by the Continent. The British purchased 4.2m gallons of French red wines (Pounds 989,859) and 1.6m gallons of higher-value French whites (Pounds 1.9m). Raw materials and non-manufactured goods made up most remaining imports. Apart from raw cotton, timber, wool, tobacco and hides, Britain bought in large quantities of more exotic items. On the import list for 1892 were 11.5 cwt of ivory, worth Pounds 559,073, and 27.8 tonnes of guano manure, setting back the nation Pounds 189,433. Victorian industrial power is summed up in the figure for imports of machinery in the 1892 trade figures: nil. On the export side, cotton goods made up about one quarter of all sales, followed by woollen goods, iron and steel, coal, machinery and chemicals. At the beginning of 1893, Britain's trading performance looked strong. Yet there were still complaints. 'There is not very much that can be called satisfactory in a review of the trade of the past year,' moaned The Economist in its issue of January 14 1893, recording that in many categories exports and imports had shown declines in the year just passed. If not exactly an annus horribilis, 1892 turned out to have been a year of recession, with modern estimates putting the decline in gross domestic product at about 2.6 per cent. Britain was the world's sole mercantile superpower. Hindsight has confirmed what should, even then, have been obvious. The UK faced only one direction: gradually, though remorselessly, towards 100 years of relative economic decline.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The craft belonging to the Russian Northern Fleet called at  the Navy base Dolphin in the town of Gosport in the south of  Britain, marking the first ever visit of a Russian submarine to  this country.    The Russian sailors received a hearty welcome with a  military  band, gun salute and guard of honour which would have been  unheard of only several years ago.    This is a historic event, base Chief of Staff Jeff Goodwin  told ITAR-TASS. During the World War Two Russia and Britain  were allies, but then the Cold War set in and the base was the  main watchdog for Soviet subs in the Northern Atlantic, he  continued. But now everything has changed and Russian sailors  are welcome guests in Britain, Goodwin said.    ""When the military make friends, there are fewer chances  that  a war will break out,"" Russian submarine Captain Sergey Rozanov  said. ""I cannot even imagine myself fighting against Jeff,"" he  said.    During the visit, the submarine crew led by Rear Admiral  Georgiy Titarenko, first deputy chief of staff of the Northern  Fleet, will meet with British military officials, tour warships,  navy bases in Gosport and Portsmouth, and the museum of  submarines. The Russian sailors will also take a trip to London  and hold receptions aboard the submarine for their British  colleagues.    On May 25 the submarine will leave Britain and head for its  base in Severomorsk.     "

This  is because Malaysia is not a GATT signatory on procurement,  which stipulates that a country opens its contracts to free  competition, he told newsmen after the presentation of prizes  for the sixth national furniture design competition here.    However, we have not slapped any trade sanction on Britain  and the private sectors of both countries are free to trade with  each other, he said in response to queries that a British firm  had stopped its order of furniture from Malaysia. Asked whether  this was a retaliation from the British company, he said, we are  not afraid ..... We are ready to face any consequences. .. It  looks like the British firm has succumbed to the emotional  effect of the patronising attitude of the British press. He said  Britain was only a small market as far as Malaysian commodities  were concerned, adding that efforts had always been underway to  diversify export markets of local products, meaning which the  action of the British firm was unlikely to have any impact.    Dr. Lim, however, said he was compiling the list of  commodities being sold with Britain which would be presented to  the cabinet if the need arose for information on commodities  traded with that country.    He also said that the action by the government showed  Malaysia's daring in questioning the values that the British  press has set, which are alien to us and which they insist we  uphold.     "

0,FT943-15176 ,"FT943-15176 _AN-EGKDTADAFT 940711   FT  11 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Time for a defence review   This week, amid the familiar clamour about base closures and job losses, the government will present what at first sight will look like welcome news. In unveiling a new round of defence cuts it will claim, in effect, that Britain's armed forces are to carry on doing exactly the same job at greatly reduced cost to the taxpayer. If this strategy were sustainable, it would indeed be welcome. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that it is not: that in being asked to pursue a fixed set of tasks in ever more economical ways, the forces are being stretched too thin. In the process, the fundamental question - whether straitened circumstances dictate reordered priorities - is left unanswered. After this week's cuts, the forces will still be shouldering three 'defence roles': to protect Britain and dependent territories; to insure against threats to Britain or its allies; and to help maintain international peace and stability. Although the government now discloses the number of forces nominally assigned to each role, it has never explained in detail what it understands by these tasks. The government has its reasons for shying away from a full-blown defence review. One is that it dare not further alienate constituents by adding the insult of a confusing new defence philosophy to the injury of reduced military spending. Another is the unpredictability of the subject. Nobody can forecast how long, and on what scale, the US will be prepared to commit money and men to the defence of Europe. Nobody can tell where Russia's new assertiveness in Europe will lead; or which extremist regime will be the next to acquire ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction. Respond flexibly Yet this very uncertainty should be a spur to think harder about how Britain can, within the limits of its budget, enhance its capacity to respond flexibly and rapidly to potential threats. The geopolitical challenges faced by France and Germany are no less complex than those confronting Britain; yet both those countries have published wide-ranging white papers on defence this year. Britain eschews such a theoretical approach, preferring to focus on practical experience: its involvement in Bosnia, for example, which has highlighted some basic vulnerabilities as well as strengths. Although the UK contingent has played a crucial role in saving Bosnian lives and  - so far - in preventing the conflict from spreading, its deployment has stretched Britain's forces to the limit. In some new international crisis requiring the despatch of another multinational peace-keeping force, it seems unlikely that Britain would have the spare capacity to help. Searching questions That is one important reason why the government needs now to undertake a fundamental review of defence policy. Such a review should be completed before 1996, when the European Union is due to consider common security policies as part of its next inter-governmental conference. And it should ask searching questions about the potential threats facing Britain and the resources available to deal with them. How best can Britain contribute to multinational peace-keeping coalitions, and what does this imply in particular for future levels of land and sea forces? Is there scope for further cuts in the army's permanent strength in Germany, without sacrificing the advantages derived from frequent training and exercising with allies? Is the cost of defending Britain's remaining dependent territories justified by any strategic advantage or overriding moral commitment? How useful is Britain's submarine-based nuclear deterrent, and how does this compare with, say, the case for anti-missile defences? Perhaps above all, with the US pressing Europe to develop greater self sufficiency in defence and encouraging Germany to play a leading role, which aspects of the US-UK relationship can be sustained indefinitely? These are, of course, all issues of the utmost sensitivity in British politics - and the picture is complicated further by Britain's need to maintain a substantial presence in northern Ireland. But that is no excuse for continuing to sweep debate under the rug. In the end, such a review might make it easier, not harder, to muster political support for the necessary changes in spending priorities.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The announcer of the British Broadcasting Co. radio program, ""The World News,""  signs off in a clear and pleasant voice, untroubled by calamity. ""This,"" the  broadcaster says, ""is the end of 'The World News.' "" It is a phrase easy to  misconstrue. Anthony Burgess, author of ""Clockwork Orange,"" thought so, too.  Another of his books is called ""The End of the World News.""    American essayist and novelist Marilynne Robinson tells us in ""Mother Country,""  her own end-of-the-world news, that Great Britain is the largest commercial  producer of plutonium in the world. Great Britain is also ""the largest source,  by far, of radioactive contamination of the world's environment.""    Nuclear waste arriving in England from client countries -- Japan, Germany,  Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland and Spain among them -- is likely to enter  England at the port of Dover for transport by train on a diagonal cross-country  journey via London to Cumbria on the shores of the Irish Sea.    There, at Sellafield, on a site shared with Calder Hall, Britain's first, aging  and still-operating nuclear power station (1956), the waste is processed by  government-owned British Nuclear Fuels.    Sellafield is near the Lake District, a countryside so beautiful, one map  exults, ""few places can compare."" It is Wordsworth country, Beatrix Potter  country, shepherd's country; fells and dales with wonderful names: Windermere,  Buttermere. But the lambs on the deep green hills are radioactive.    At Sellafield -- called Windscale until the disgrace of a major nuclear  accident in 1957 -- the houses are radioactive. So are -- because of 30 years'  contamination, occasional bursts of high emission and irradiated slicks -- the  Irish Sea and its spray, the sand, the seaweed and flotsam, the fish, the boats  and the wind. One in 60 children in nearby Seascale village dies of leukemia, a  rate 1,000 times the national average.    Really.    The nuclear accident at Chernobyl was a boon to Sellafield apologists. Its  fallout, they say, contaminated Cumbrian fields and lambs. No one had tested  local livestock for radiation before Chernobyl; no one, in fact, tested the  livestock for months after. (And the only post-Chernobyl Geiger-counter  readings on the west coast of England were made by a high school science  class.) But Sellafield is closer to Cumbria than Chernobyl is, by many thousand  miles, and ""so productive of contamination that there is no reason to look  elsewhere for a source.""    What happens at Sellafield? The waste products of British and foreign nuclear  reactors are delivered, cleansed with solvents (if ""cleansed"" is the right  word), processed to yield usable, salable plutonium and uranium, and disposed  of (if ""disposed"" is the right word).    Sellafield is part of the power industry (in England a government monopoly)  because it handles the wastes of British reactors which produce power.  Sellafield has a military function because its processing produces  weapons-grade plutonium for British military use. Its civilian cum military  function, Robinson says, ""limits its accessibility to EEC (European Economic  Community) inspection, among other advantages.""    Britain has long produced its own toxic wastes. It was, after all, the cradle  of the Industrial Revolution. Britain has long imported chemical toxics, for  profitable disposal. Now it has found that disposal of imported nuclear waste  is profitable, too.    Britain's attitude toward virulent waste is relatively carefree.

The announcer of the British Broadcasting Co. radio program, ""The World News,""  signs off in a clear and pleasant voice, untroubled by calamity. ""This,"" the  broadcaster says, ""is the end of 'The World News.' "" It is a phrase easy to  misconstrue. Anthony Burgess, author of ""Clockwork Orange,"" thought so, too.  Another of his books is called ""The End of the World News.""    American essayist and novelist Marilynne Robinson tells us in ""Mother Country,""  her own end-of-the-world news, that Great Britain is the largest commercial  producer of plutonium in the world. Great Britain is also ""the largest source,  by far, of radioactive contamination of the world's environment.""    Nuclear waste arriving in England from client countries -- Japan, Germany,  Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland and Spain among them -- is likely to enter  England at the port of Dover for transport by train on a diagonal cross-country  journey via London to Cumbria on the shores of the Irish Sea.    There, at Sellafield, on a site shared with Calder Hall, Britain's first, aging  and still-operating nuclear power station (1956), the waste is processed by  government-owned British Nuclear Fuels.    Sellafield is near the Lake District, a countryside so beautiful, one map  exults, ""few places can compare."" It is Wordsworth country, Beatrix Potter  country, shepherd's country; fells and dales with wonderful names: Windermere,  Buttermere. But the lambs on the deep green hills are radioactive.    At Sellafield -- called Windscale until the disgrace of a major nuclear  accident in 1957 -- the houses are radioactive. So are -- because of 30 years'  contamination, occasional bursts of high emission and irradiated slicks -- the  Irish Sea and its spray, the sand, the seaweed and flotsam, the fish, the boats  and the wind. One in 60 children in nearby Seascale village dies of leukemia, a  rate 1,000 times the national average.    Really.    The nuclear accident at Chernobyl was a boon to Sellafield apologists. Its  fallout, they say, contaminated Cumbrian fields and lambs. No one had tested  local livestock for radiation before Chernobyl; no one, in fact, tested the  livestock for months after. (And the only post-Chernobyl Geiger-counter  readings on the west coast of England were made by a high school science  class.) But Sellafield is closer to Cumbria than Chernobyl is, by many thousand  miles, and ""so productive of contamination that there is no reason to look  elsewhere for a source.""    What happens at Sellafield? The waste products of British and foreign nuclear  reactors are delivered, cleansed with solvents (if ""cleansed"" is the right  word), processed to yield usable, salable plutonium and uranium, and disposed  of (if ""disposed"" is the right word).    Sellafield is part of the power industry (in England a government monopoly)  because it handles the wastes of British reactors which produce power.  Sellafield has a military function because its processing produces  weapons-grade plutonium for British military use. Its civilian cum military  function, Robinson says, ""limits its accessibility to EEC (European Economic  Community) inspection, among other advantages.""    Britain has long produced its own toxic wastes. It was, after all, the cradle  of the Industrial Revolution. Britain has long imported chemical toxics, for  profitable disposal. Now it has found that disposal of imported nuclear waste  is profitable, too.    Britain's attitude toward virulent waste is relatively carefree. There is no  legal obligation, for instance, to warn developers that a site has been a toxic  dump. There is no restriction on the use of radioactive materials in British  goods. Poisoning the well, Robinson says, is ""established practice . . . a bit  of 19th-Century tradition.""

The European Commission last month levelled the threat of legal action at Britain and any other EC member which did not abolish all controls by January 1. But Mr Clarke told fellow-interior ministers at a two-day meeting in Lisbon they should not elevate the border controls issue into a 'legal battle' - especially at a time when the Danish vote against Maastricht had raised much larger problems for the Community. 'I don't believe you can create the European Community on the basis of legalisms,' he said after yesterday's session on immigration. Britain is alone in actively wanting to retain controls, arguing that they are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. Other countries such as Denmark and Ireland also have difficulties because of existing passport unions with the Nordic states and the UK. After talking yesterday to Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC's internal market commissioner, Mr Clarke said he thought the issue would be resolved through political discussions during the British presidency which begins next month. However, he did not say how a compromise might be reached, and reiterated that Britain did not see January 1 as a firm deadline for lifting controls. 'We don't think we are under any obligation about lifting border controls, but we are quite happy to minimise inconvenience for EC travellers,' he said. 'We are not going to compromise our system of immigration controls.' Only Greece, Portugal and Luxembourg seem to back the Commission's legal approach wholeheartedly. Most other countries recognise there are practical difficulties in applying the Brussels' hard-line interpretation of the 1986 Single European Act, which defines the internal market as 'an area without internal frontiers'. Portugal - which holds the EC presidency - was yesterday trying to persuade Spain to sign a convention strengthening the Community's external frontier. The Spanish have been blocking the convention for more than a year because of the continuing dispute with the UK over how Gibraltar should be treated.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Wang Fengchao said he would try to visit Hong Kong this year  if he had the time.    In his news conference given this morning to the media  before  a meeting with the Preliminary Work Committee Political Affairs  Panel, Wang Fengchao, promoted from second department director  to deputy director late last February, said that China would act  according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law, safeguard Hong Kong's executive sovereignty together  with Hong Kong people, and properly handle preparations in  various areas. After 1997, a high degree of autonomy will be  allowed according to the policy of one country, two systems to  lay a foundation for Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong.    He continued: China's wish is cooperation with Britain in  the latter period of transition and working for a stable  transition and smooth political changeover according to the  Basic Law.    However, he pointed out, as Britain has refused to cooperate  politically with China, turned its back on the relationship of  cooperation with China, persisted in its course, got itself in  deeper and deeper, and ruined the basis of cooperation. Without  an atmosphere of cooperation, it is difficult for work in other  areas not to be affected. This is something China did not want  to see and the responsibility lies entirely with Britain.    Regarding ""setting up another kitchen,"" Wang Fengchao said  Britain did not recognize the agreements and understandings for  the transition it made with China and set up another kitchen;  because of this China could only ""set up another kitchen"" based  on the blueprints outlined by the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law. On the current division of labor within the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, he said Deputy Director Wang  Qiren has been transferred to the Bank of China as its  president. There are now three directors. Director Lu Ping  oversees general affairs; Chen Zhiying takes charge of the work  of Sections 1 and 3, that is Hong Kong and Macao affairs. Wang  himself is responsible for the work of Section 2 (that is Hong  Kong political and social affairs) and the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Research Desk. Wang said that he felt the heavy burden  of responsibility after he became deputy director. Fortunately,  he could see the direction clearly.     "

Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, yesterday hinted that Britain wanted to discuss transferring resources from the bank to the IFC, so as to reflect the growing importance of private-sector finance in developing nations. 'Over time, the relative balance between bank lending and IFC investments will inevitably alter, with IFC growing faster than the bank. We must explore ways of expanding the IFC's activities without further early calls on shareholder resources,' he told a meeting yesterday of the development committee of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He is concerned that, for every Dollars 19 (Pounds 12.75) provided for development by the World Bank, the IFC invests only Dollars 1. Britain believes that the IFC's activities need to be strengthened to build on its work of providing support for private-sector investment, financial institutions and capital markets, and on the private provision of infrastructure and services in developing nations. The chancellor's concern about World Bank activities was echoed by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary. The development committee meeting yesterday adopted a proposal from Mr Bentsen to create a task force in order to review the role of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks. The task force, which has yet to be appointed, will focus on cutting out overlapping activities. It aims to report by October 1995.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the  restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure  to resume testing in response to China's test last October.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr Clinton was  concerned about the impact resumed U.S. nuclear tests would have  on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January.    Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its  nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium  extension was not unexpected.    ""We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the  United  States' moratorium continues,"" said a Foreign Office spokesman.    ""And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with  energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear  test ban treaty.""    When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear  testing in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three  tests were planned on Trident warheads ""for safety reasons.""    But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world  opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop  computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts.    The need for testing in any case has eased after the  Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic  nuclear missile.    Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles  fitted with single warheads.    Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the  Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be  fitted with the same warhead.    However, Britain is retaining its capability to design,  develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.     "

He began  his talks in a meeting with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz at the  Foreign Ministry. After a news conference, the two proceeded to  the Presidential Palace, where a meeting was held with President  Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. President al-Hirawi held a  dinner banquet in honor of Hurd, which was attended by Birri,  al-Hariri, Buwayz, and a number of ministers.    At a news conference following his talks with Buwayz, the  British foreign secretary said that his visit to Beirut has two  goals: The first is to learn all the latest developments  regarding the peace process that pertain to Lebanon. He said:  We in Britain realize that peace must be comprehensive and  involve an agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well as the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 to open the  way for the implementation of the al-Ta'if Agreement and to  enable Lebanon to regain its full independence. This is  important to us.    Hurd added: The second goal goes beyond the peace process.  You in Lebanon are embarking on a reconstruction process after  the war with skill, enthusiasm, and dynamism, as anyone would  expect from the Lebanese on economic issues. I am anxious to  understand what is happening so that we in Britain can translate  this into cooperation and assistance, and this is what I did. I  am pleased to note that our British exports to Lebanon increased  quickly in the last month of last year. I am very pleased that  British companies are interested in the airport project. I hope  that the increasing exchange of trade and ministerial visits  will help promote such cooperation.    He added: I want cooperation to expand to include the  cultural field, cooperation between our armed forces, and  cooperation in combating drug trafficking.    Hurd explained that he did not come as a mediator in the  Middle East negotiations. But Britain has an interest in the  success of the peace process, and if it can do something to  help, it will do so without becoming a mediator.    Hurd said: Lebanon is a principal partner in the Middle East  peace process. Peace must be comprehensive. We welcomed the  September agreement between the PLO and Israel. We think that  this is a very important step forward. But it is clear to me  that it will not become final until agreements are concluded  between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. We are  maintaining close contacts with the Jordanians, the Israelis,  and the Syrians. He noted that the summit meeting between  Presidents Clinton and al-Asad is very important and expressed  the hope that it will advance the negotiations on the  Syrian-Israeli track and make it possible to overcome the  difficulties. He noted that he is in touch with the U.S.  secretary of state on the peace process.    Hurd affirmed Britain's support for UN Security Council  Resolution 425 and said: All these matters are linked to the  al-Ta'if Agreement, which we strongly support. These matters  must be implemented in stages. Resolution 425 and the al-Ta'if  Agreement-- which we support--are the basis for progress and for  Lebanon regaining its complete freedom.    Minister Buwayz said:    [Begin recording] [Buwayz] I would like first to welcome His  Excellency Minister Douglas Hurd on his visit to Lebanon. As  you know, and as I have already said during my visit to the  United Kingdom, Britain has a long history that qualifies it to  understand the problems of this area. There is no doubt that as  Arab foreign ministers we have repeatedly called for effective  participation by the European countries. When we refer to the  European countries, we include Britain, of course. We think  that in view of Britain's historical role in the Middle East, it  is qualified to play a role in bilateral negotiations and in the  peace process.    The talks between us dealt with the regional situation, the  peace process, and ways to promote economic and cultural  cooperation between Lebanon and Britain. We think that  Lebanon's democracy, its free economic system, and the  effectiveness of the Lebanese private sector provide numerous  common denominators between the two countries and peoples and  make it possible to discuss ways for fruitful cooperation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did Secretary Hurd suggest  anything new to advance the peace process?    [Buwayz] Mr. Hurd is closely following the peace process.  There is no doubt that as a result of his visit and becoming  acquainted with the Lebanese views on the occupied territory in  the south, he will be able to play a role in one way or another.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct]  implementation of Resolution 425?    [Buwayz] I think that you have heard Mr. Hurd clearly state  Britain's frank position on this resolution. I imagine that  Britain is known for its firm views and positions.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you regard the British role  today as complementing the U.S. role [words indistinct]?    [Buwayz] I imagine that there is cooperation between  Britain,  the United States, and a number of European states to promote  the peace process.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what about the British role in  the reconstruction of Lebanon? Were there new developments on  this matter?    [Buwayz] Of course, we held talks on this matter. As you  know, British companies specialize in various sectors. I think  that Britain is interested in Lebanon because of its democratic  system and free economy and because of the things we have in  common. [end recording]     "

Because of uncertainty in the political situation, the  money markets were upset, and the pound-mark exchange rate fell  to its lowest point in five months.    On the afternoon of 29 March, Prime Minister Major delivered  an official statement to Parliament, saying that Britain would  accept a package from the Council of Ministers of the EU to  reform the current voting mechanism. In his statement, Major  defended himself by arguing that the EU had made concessions to  Britain by agreeing that, although veto power remained at 27  votes, a resolution could be postponed ""for a reasonable time""  if there were 23 opposition votes and that Britain would enjoy  the prospect of additional provisions in the social charter.  Major also explained that this was just ""a transitional  arrangement,"" as the EU would renegotiate the voting mechanism  in 1996. He said that the EU would be expanded according to  schedule in line with Britain's interests.    People remember that only one week ago, Major was still  using  tough words to indicate that he would not make any concessions  on reforming the voting mechanism, and announced that he would  ""fight for Britain's interests."" Just one week later, he made a  180-degree turnaround and accepted the voting reform package.  Although he tried hard to play down the impact of such a change  in position, he still faced strong criticism from MP's. Labour  MP's said that Major was ""struggling in vain as he knew he could  not win"" and once again showed the ""political stupidity of the  Major cabinet."" Conservative MP's put Major in a more  embarrassing position. Conservative MP Tony Marlow, who has  doubts about the European Community, said that this showed John  Major had lost his ""credibility"" and ""ability to lead the  Conservative Party."" He demanded that Major step down and give  up his office to a more capable person. His speech was  described by the mass media as the ""fiercest attack on an  incumbent prime minister in the past 30 years,"" and aroused  strong repercussions in the Parliament. Other Euro-skeptics  said that he ""said what they wanted to say."" Some celebrities,  newspapers, and magazines in Britain also commented and held  that John Major had lost the trust of the Conservative Party and  the British public, and it seems it is hard to restore people's  trust. In British political circles, a gust of strong wind is  blowing to drive Major out of office.    The trend to unseat Major has also appeared inside the  Conservative Party. Not long ago, four or five members of the  British cabinet disagreed with John Major's idea about  ""returning to basic values""; after that, in an investigation of  British arms sales to Iraq, Secretary for Trade and Industry  Michael Heseltine, who played a key role as ""political assassin""  in the action to topple Mrs. Thatcher, held a different attitude  from Major and other cabinet members, and this attracted  extensive attention from the mass media. It is generally held  that Heseltine has ambitions to ""make a comeback"" and has become  a strong threat to Major. Reportedly, in a televised interview,  Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also admitted that  ""when Major has no intention of being leader of the Conservative  Party,"" he would ""be willing to succeed Major."" Reportedly,  four members of Major's cabinet expressed doubts about the EU  voting mechanism reforms. Although Heseltine and Clarke  indicated separately on 31 March that they would continue to  support Major, differences among senior officials of the  Conservative Party were exposed. Authoritative people here said  that as Major has no definite views of his own, his leading  position inside the party would certainly be challenged at the  party's annual conference next fall and would be in danger.  According to the result of an opinion poll conducted by THE  SUNDAY TIMES, one quarter of Conservative MP's agree that Major  should step down.    In fact, Major was facing unmentionable difficulties when  changing his position from strongly opposing the EU's voting  mechanism reform to making a compromise. Britain has always had  deep misgivings about the process of European integration, and  the skeptics have a strong influence. Although Major upheld the  point of ""returning to the center of Europe,"" he cannot but make  certain concessions to the skeptics from time to time;  otherwise, his cabinet would often run into snags in the  legislative process and his position would become more unstable.  However, while holding a tough attitude toward the European  Parliament, his foreign secretary demanded that concessions  should be made toward the EU, and this forced Major to make the  compromise he was not ready to make. Otherwise, Hurd would have  submitted his resignation, which would have led to a cabinet  crisis and would have also caused discontent in Germany and  France. Moreover, the four new members of the EU would have  been further pushed to Germany's side and Britain would have  made itself more isolated. Recently, Major indicated that he  had no intention of resigning from office; Secretary for Trade  and Industry Heseltine and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth  Clarke also put on a posture of safeguarding party unity. It  seems that Major has ridden out another crisis. However, as  some people in the ruling and opposition parties still call for  deposing Major, it is also an undisputed fact that Major's  leadership position has been further weakened.     "

President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the  restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure  to resume testing in response to China's test last October.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr Clinton was  concerned about the impact resumed US nuclear tests would have  on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January.    Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its  nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium  extension was not unexpected.    ""We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the  United  States' moratorium continues,"" said a Foreign Office spokesman.    ""And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with  energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear  test ban treaty.""    When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear  testing  in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three tests were  planned on Trident warheads ""for safety reasons"".    But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world  opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop  computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts.    The need for testing in any case has eased after the  Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic  nuclear missile.    Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles  fitted with single warheads.    Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the  Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be  fitted with the same warhead.    However, Britain is retaining its capability to design,  develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.     "

But his motion did not make it onto  the agenda of the session. The ""abortion"" of this proposal for  ""denouncing Britain"" greatly disappointed the forces from  various quarters who were eager to seize power.    One would seem to be blaming the pro-China people wrongly if  one thinks they have misjudged the situation and vied with each  other to ""step forward."" There is one ""encouraging"" factor in  all this, that is, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] has also  put forward proposals for ""denouncing Britain."" Because the  proposals were very sensitive, after the high-level CPC  personalities did some ""persuasive work,"" they were quietly  withdrawn.    Commanders of Three Military Regions Submit Proposals for  ""Denouncing Britain"" Signed by 88 People    It is learned that the undisclosed proposals were handed in  to the general meeting on 12 March, after they had been signed  by 88 members of the PLA delegation. The three initiators of  the proposal are powerful people. They are: Lieutenant General  Li Zhu, commander of Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant General  Gu Hui, commander of Nanjing Military Region; and Li Xilin,  commander of Guangzhou Military Region. They submitted two  proposals, the thrust of which was to condemn Britain for  confronting China and causing disturbances in Hong Kong, and  they demanded the termination of its colonial rule in Hong Kong.    According to some personalities who read the proposals, this  was tantamount to the military openly expressing their opinion  on the Hong Kong issue. Judged by the wording of the proposals,  they are very unhappy with the current policy toward Hong Kong,  thinking that it is weak and even smacks of capitulation.    The Military Decided for Themselves and Demanded the  Remaking of Hong Kong Policy    This is a very subtle mentality. One wonders if it is  because Deng Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on ""reflecting  sovereignty through the stationing of armed forces"" has  imperceptibly upgraded the status of the gun barrel. As things  stand now, the military is showing a tendency toward making  decisions for themselves on the issue of Hong Kong.    The proposals signed by 88 military personalities contain  the  following five major points:    1. To sternly condemn the British authorities for openly  violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and brazenly  tearing up the agreements between the governments of the two  countries.    2. To lodge a serious protest about the British authorities  blatantly putting forward the constitutional reform package that  interferes in China's internal affairs and attempts to extend  their colonial rule.    3. To issue a stern warning to the British authorities that  they should not try to turn Hong Kong, which is China's  territory, into a zone of international political dispute and a  base for opposing China and the communist party.    4. Asking the government to take firm and resolute measures  in the event of changed circumstances, especially when Hong Kong  is plunged into a trauma, and recover Hong Kong to end Britain's  colonial rule ahead of time.    5. Asking the government to give serious thought to  terminating high-level contact and withdrawing the Chinese  ambassador to Britain in view of Britain's change of position on  China and deliberate deterioration in bilateral relations.    A battery of such terms as ""solemnly"" and ""request"" sound as  if the military is above the CPC Central Committee. A point of  breakthrough seems to have been made in ""letting the gun command  the party.""    Jiang Zemin Personally Persuades Military Deputies    This situation immediately attracted the attention of the  CPC  high-level leadership. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin took  the matter up himself and visited the military deputation two  times to persuade them. Jiang Zemin said: The Central  Committee is following the principle of striking only after the  enemy has struck on the issue of Hong Kong, because the  initiative and timetable are both in our hands. As things stand  now, we can recover Hong Kong ahead of schedule according to  reason. Our stand has not changed, and it will not change.  Political cooperation between China and Britain is entirely  nonexistent. But we should watch how things develop so that we  can better handle the affair with justice on our side, to the  benefit of ourselves, and with restraint.    The current CPC policy toward Hong Kong seems to be pleasing  neither the people at home nor abroad. It cannot explain to its  people what is meant by ""striking after the enemy has struck,""  yet it cannot cut off all cooperation with the British Hong Kong  Government. This very policy of ""being strong in appearance but  weak inside"" has met with criticism at home and caused  ""ideological confusion"" among the loyal ""patriots"" in Hong Kong  in particular.    In order to reassure people, some political figures, such  as Qian Qichen, Wang Hanbin, and Lu Ping, had ""heart-to-heart""  talks with some NPC deputies and vice chairmen of the national  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] from Hong Kong and Macao during the recent  NPC and CPPCC sessions. They explained what the central  authorities have been doing to fulfill its ""obligation"" to the  people.    Qian Qichen Claims China Is Strong Enough To Deal With  Britain    Qian Qichen said: The Sino-British relations are now at rock  bottom and facing noncooperation or even confrontation. This is  a natural result of Britain changing its policy toward China and  confronting us on the issue of Hong Kong. This situation is not  something we wanted to see, because Hong Kong is, after all,  China's territory and the 5 million odd Hong Kong compatriots  are part of the big family of China. But Britain wants  confrontation, wants to extend its colonial rule beyond 1997,  and wants to turn Hong Kong from an international financial,  industrial, and commercial center into a city of international  political dispute. How can we let Britain's plot succeed! We  must be responsible to history, to the 1.2 billion Chinese  people, and to our 5 million odd compatriots in Hong Kong.  Also, we must be responsible to foreign businessmen who have  properties and investments in Hong Kong. Therefore, we will not  yield even a single inch or compromise even once to colonialism  on matters of sovereignty and principle. We have the confidence  and strength to deal with and defeat Britain's old political  tricks.    Deng Xiaoping Recently Instructs: Check the Dynamic From a  Point of Stillness, Overcome Disturbance With Substantial  Strength    Qian Qichen also emphasized: After putting up such  confrontations, Britain lost what it had been capitalizing on.  Now the initiative is entirely in our hands and so is the  timetable. A high degree of consensus among the party, the  government, the military, and the people nationwide is the basis  on which we make our decisions.    Qian Qichen also revealed the central authorities' latest  strategy for dealing with Britain, that is, to check the dynamic  from a point of stillness and overcome disturbance with  substantial strength. It is said that this was proposed by Deng  Xiaoping when he recently spoke to the central leading comrades.    Lu Ping put forward the policy of ""uniting with all those  who  love China and Hong Kong."" He said: ""With the exception of the  core members of the pro-Britain, anti-China ultra-right  organizations that attach themselves to foreign forces, we  should unite with all Hong Kong compatriots and expatriates in  Hong Kong who are willing to work for the smooth transition of  Hong Kong and who are willing to stay in Hong Kong and help  build a new Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two  systems, the Basic Law, and the leadership of the future Special  Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This is our policy.""    Wang Hanbin on ""Preparing for Both Eventualities""    Wang Hanbin was more specific when he talked about the  current preparatory work. He said: Now Sino-British relations  are in an abnormal state. It is impossible for China to take  the initiative to try relaxing and mending relations, because  the basis for doing so is not there. The Sino-British Joint  Declaration has been sabotaged by the British side, so its role  has been almost entirely taken away. We no longer have the  basis for Sino-British cooperation at this stage and such basis  will not be ready for some time. The Chinese side does not  place any unrealistic hope in the situation. The current work  is mainly to prepare for the following two things:    1. The Preliminary Working Committee's work should be  realistic and should be strengthened, increased, and  accelerated. The preparations for setting up the SAR should be  carried out and arranged earlier than scheduled.    2. The work of the relevant departments in the central  government has been more or less assigned and various  preparations made. Once Hong Kong is plunged into a political  trauma, the society lands in protracted turbulence, and foreign  countries meddle in Hong Kong affairs and try to change Hong  Kong's status, we will not have a second choice.    Wang Hanbin said: The initiative is entirely in our hands.  No violation of the integrity of national sovereignty and the  sacredness of our internal affairs is allowed, as they override  everything else at all times.    Ye Xuanping: China and Britain Will Not Have the Conditions  and Climate for Cooperation    CPPCC Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping disclosed a piece of  information to the NPC deputies from Guangdong Province: The  central authorities have made it clear that they will do  everything to ensure the stability and development of Hong Kong.  Naturally, they have various preparatory measures, including  full political, economic, and military considerations. They  will not let Britain control the destiny of Hong Kong beyond 30  June 1997. You and I can see that day when it comes. If things  change, it will not be in three years and a few months. China  and Britain will not possibly have the conditions and climate  for cooperation.    That ""restoring cordial relations with the British side is  impossible"" seems to have become a ""common understanding"" shared  by personalities at all levels in the CPC. But opinions on how  to deal with the ""British colonialism's plot in Hong Kong""  differ. What merits attention is that the CPC's Hong Kong  policy has been constantly challenged, which is bound to cause  the already ""left""- leaning policy to get out of control.     "

Mr Ashdown said: 'It is time for Britain's financial and business community to put pressure on the government for a more positive approach.' He said that the exclusion of sterling from a single European currency would damage the entire country and that the City would 'suffer most of all'. Speaking to members of the Corporation of London's policy and resources committee, he forecast that a 'core group' of the 12 member states would form a monetary union within six years. Mr Ashdown dismissed the demands of the Tory Euro-sceptics that Britain should reject such a development outright, and deplored the 'wait-and-see' attitude of the government and Labour leaders. He also rejected the view that because of its strength and worldwide reputation the City would maintain its dominant position even if Britain were outside a European monetary union. Mr Ashdown insisted that such opinions were a snare, a trap and a delusion. He said: 'A single currency is not an issue that we can put off indefinitely.' He reaffirmed that after the next general election the Liberal Democrats would use their influence to ensure that Britain was not excluded from a single currency. Mr Ashdown appealed to the City to adopt a more constructive role in tackling the 'short-termism' which had held back Britain's economic development. He suggested that a committee should be appointed to examine the long-term investment needs of business and recommend how the situation could be improved.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The inch-long spiders, which probably arrived in Britain concealed in fruit boats, are now common in Portsmouth and Worthing and have been spotted in Essex. Mr Rowley Snazell, zoologist at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, a government research agency, says their bite, which causes sweating, is 'fairly potent by British standards'. Slugs, aphids, rats and pigeons also thrived in the mild winters and hot summers between 1988 and 1990, causing considerable damage to crops, the report finds. In central England, the winter of 1988-89 was the warmest since 1659. The study explores the effects on animals and plants that Britain could expect if global warming occurs, although it says there is no evidence that the warm weather was due to the emission of 'greenhouse gases'. A vision of Britain with a Mediterranean climate emerges from the report's 150 pages of dense statistics. The grape and sunflower harvests in the south of England flourished during the abnormally warm weather, and gardens bloomed weeks early. But agrochemical companies were the real winners. Sales of insecticides for agriculture and horticulture rose by more than a third in 1989 to Pounds 39.4m, according to a British Agrochemicals Association survey. To fight off the invasion of pests, farmers sprayed cereal crops an average 1.3 times, nearly double the rate in the previous year, according to Produce Studies, the Newbury-based consultancy. The period also saw severe storms, with two damaging gales early in 1990.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2879 Agricultural Chemicals, NEC.

0,FT942-11141 ,"FT942-11141 _AN-EEFEDAGUFT 940506   FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (1): Step that meets the spirit of the age - The opening of the Channel Tunnel strengthens the argument that the destiny of Great Britain lies in and with Europe      By DAVID MARSH   One more barrier in Europe has fallen, of supreme importance, though neither the largest nor the last. In 1987, when Britain and France ratified the Channel Tunnel accord, few would have predicted that it would come to fruition seven years later with east and west Europe reunited by the end of the cold war. The tunnel to be opened today by Queen Elizabeth II and President Francois Mitterrand forges a further link in the chain of contact and cooperation across a continent that again is whole and free. 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' After months in which elation over the tunnel's prospective opening has been tempered by frustration at delays and financial overruns, Charles Dickens' classic line aptly describes the mood at Eurotunnel, the operator of the 32 mile (50km) link. Dickens' introduction to A Tale of Two Cities - now separated by a mere three hours' rail journey between London's Waterloo and the Gare du Nord in Paris - also sums up the state of Europe. The walls and the watchtowers of east-west division have disappeared. Yet the continent is beset by strains engendered by recession, deep-seated changes in economic structure, the break-up of the Soviet empire and German reunification. The continent must now manage an arduous transition. The momentous task of tunnelling beneath the Straits of Dover symbolises the challenges Europe faces and the trials it has yet to overcome. The stretch of water between Britain and France has a central place in the history and folklore of the two nations, both in peace and at war. During the past 200 years, the idea of joining Britain and France has sporadically occupied the minds of engineers and admirals, financiers and functionaries, schoolboys, prime ministers and madmen. The problems of constructing the world's longest undersea tunnel cannot be gainsaid. Accomplishing this ambitious infrastructure project without recourse to government funds has been more exacting than the optimists forecast. The tunnel's overall cost has grown to Pounds 10bn. This is more than double Eurotunnel's estimate when construction started six years ago, a time when buoyant economic conditions spurred wishful thinking. As a result of tortuous teething troubles, a full freight and passenger service will not start until October, causing a large financial loss in the first year of operation and exacerbating pressure on banks and shareholders. Yet when the overall assessment of the enterprise is drawn up, these burdens should not be allowed to weigh too heavily in the balance. If the skill, ingenuity and perserverance deployed in building the tunnel can be turned towards fashioning the new Europe, then the continent's salvation is assured. The historic rapprochement between the UK and the rest of Europe advances one more pace. Britain remains tied by formidable bonds of blood, heritage and shared experience to America and the Commonwealth. Yet the tunnel makes more evident and more acceptable the reality that Britain's destiny lies with and in Europe. The French President and the British Queen will today turn a new page in relations between two countries joined and separated by a rich vein of turbulent history. In 20 years, the chroniclers of the century's final decade may speak of a new heading. In 50 years, with luck, they may be able to point to a new chapter. In psychological and geographical terms, today's event is unquestionably of greater magnitude for the UK than for the French. Britain's land connection to the rest of the European Union has hitherto been limited to the troubled border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. France is already joined physically to Spain, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland,Luxembourg and Italy. From now on, all these countries will appear, to British hearts, a small but perceptible degree closer than before. Construction has marked an effort of colossal technical, financial and political complexity. Environmentalists' objections have had to be acted upon, politicians' egos massaged, bankers' nerves calmed, terrorists' ambitions (with luck) thwarted. The tunnel sets a milestone for many reasons. Achieving such a project without public sector funding has necessitated imaginative and controversial financing techniques. The venture has literally unearthed new ground in construction and civil engineering technology. It has spurred salutary competition on a much-travelled route on which sea operators up to now have enjoyed natural dominance, and has opened new perspectives for rail transport and freight haulage across Europe. The tunnel has intensified Anglo-French cooperation in areas ranging from handling equity flotations and harmonising railway signal equipment to commissioning boring machines and providing fences against rabies-carrying foxes. More than anything, it is a project both in line with and in advance of the spirit of the times. The two governments were able to reach agreement on a project embodying many of the concepts of economic policy that have come to dominate the agenda of the 1990s: competition, the primacy of private sector finance, the drive to complete the barrier-free single market. For all the commonly-held belief in the constancy of national characteristics, the tunnel illustrates what has changed in Europe. The British were once renowned as a race of railway-builders, the French - at least in the popular imagination of the English - as a people incorrigibly wedded to time-honoured preservation of their forefathers' paysage. In the latter part of the 20th century, these roles seem to have been reversed. Ludicrously yet endearingly, Britain has failed to construct a high-speed train link to join the tunnel to London. By contrast, the French engineers of the Polytechnique and the Ecole des Mines have unswervingly pressed new lines into service to ensure Eurostar trains race across the Nord-Pas-de-Calais plain before ambling through the hop groves of Kent. The tunnel, by itself, will make neither France less French, nor Britain less British. It represents a step towards European convergence, but also illustrates the continent's abiding diversity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TUNNEL'S TIMETABLE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept 11 1981:    UK, France announce studies of a fixed link across                  Channel.

Herr Jochen Borchert, German Agriculture Minister, told  journalists at an EC meeting in Luxembourg that he was now  seeking ""a European solution."" This appears to be a significant  climb-down, as Herr Horst Seehofer, the German Health Minister,  said last month that Germany would take unilateral action  against British beef imports.    The German position has found no sympathy in Brussels, where  Agriculture and Health Ministers have pronounced themselves  content with measures taken by Britain to ensure that meat from  infected cows does not enter the human food chain. The European  Commission has also warned Germany that unilateral restrictions  would be illegal.    The battle is not yet over. Herr Borchert will be pushing  the Commission to institute more screening procedures for beef,  but it appears that the threat of unilateral action has been  withdrawn.    However, Mrs Gillian Shephard, Britain's Agriculture  Minister, said: ""It is clearly a retreat by the Germans. I am  not prepared to tolerate any question of a unilateral ban on a  British product.""    She has accused Germany of scare-mongering by voicing fears  about British beef. These, she contended, were having a  devastating effect on an export business worth some 8 million  pounds a year, and were affecting other British products such as  lamb.    To encourage Germany to back down, the Commission has  announced measures that include a study of procedures for the  processing of meat-and-bone meal, considered the primary cause  of infection. Britain has already banned the feeding of cows on  meal from other ruminants, after recognition that meal from  diseased sheep was the most likely cause of cow infection.     "

President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the  restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure  to resume testing in response to China's test last October.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr. Clinton was  concerned about the impact resumed U.S. nuclear tests would have  on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January.    Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its  nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium  extension was not unexpected.    ""We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the  United  States' moratorium continues,"" said a Foreign Office spokesman.    ""And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with  energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear  test ban treaty.""    When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear  testing in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three  tests were planned on Trident warheads ""for safety reasons"".    But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world  opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop  computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts.    The need for testing in any case has eased after the  Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic  nuclear missile.    Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles  fitted with single warheads.    Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the  Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be  fitted with the same warhead.    However, Britain is retaining its capability to design,  develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.     "

0,FT921-16252 ,"FT921-16252 _AN-CAEAAADTFT 920104   FT  04 JAN 92 / West shelves threat of sanctions against Libya      By LIONEL BARBER and MARK NICHOLSON      WASHINGTON, LONDON   THE US, Britain and France have shelved plans to seek immediate United Nations sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing, western diplomats said yesterday. The tactical retreat, led by the US, follows soundings within the 15-member UN Security Council which revealed that several countries had reservations about supporting sanctions. A diplomat involved in the discussions said that no final decisions on future action had been made, but it was clear that 'sanctions are not going to move very quickly' within the Security Council. The US, Britain and France are instead preparing to draw up a resolution demanding that Libya hand over agents accused of planting bombs on both the Pan Am flight which exploded over Lockerbie in 1988 and a French UTA airliner which blew up over Niger the following year. Drafts circulating at the UN headquarters in New York yesterday reiterated previous demands for Libya to hand over the suspects, while condemning the mid-air bombings. Libya denies any part in the bombings, but has detained the two agents accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing and says it is holding its own inquiry into the case. It has also invited western judges to Libya for any trial of the two men. However, Britain and the US insist that the men be handed over to a 'competent court', either in Scotland or the US. If Libya fails to comply, the three allies are likely to seek further steps through the UN, including possible sanctions such as a halt to all international flights to and from Libya and banning the sale of commercial aircraft, spare parts and airline-related equipment. Tougher measures such as a boycott of Libyan oil are possibilities. Although Britain and the US have refused to rule out possible military action against Libya over the bombings, a British official yesterday conceded that the Security Council was unlikely to pass any resolution advocating force. British officials were yesterday at pains to play down the thrust of reports in the Washington Post and reported comments from diplomats in Cairo suggesting that sanctions against Libya had been ruled out absolutely. 'There is no weakening of resolve on this issue whatsoever,' said one. 'Britain, France and the USA are determined to bring this affair to a satisfactory conclusion.'

Azerbaijan President To Consult British ""Physicians""]    [Text] Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev arrived in  London on 19 February. The very fact of the visit is not being  made much of, but the president is known to have spent some two  days in the British capital. The reason bringing the Azeri  leader to the shores of misty Albion, the entire press in the  republic says in one voice, is the desire to ""restore his  health"" and ""consult English physicians."" But even if a visit  to physicians takes place after all, the real purpose of the  visit is obviously not that. The Azerbaijan president, one may  suppose, is to agree on terms of the contract with the  international oil concern led by British Petroleum  (KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote last on its terms on 17 Feb).    The republic's press, controlled by the authorities, also  spill the true aims of Aliyev's trip: Shortly before the visit,  the newspaper AZARLYK mulled over how successfully Aliyev would  be able ""to play the oil card."" Besides, the Great Britain  visit is a logical continuation of the Turkey voyage 10 days  earlier. Discussed in Ankara were the terms of the Turkish  side's participation in the international consortium and the  route for the projected pipeline along which oil will flow to  Turkish terminals bypassing Novorossiysk (Russia plans to export  oil across its own territory).    The other problem Aliyev intends to discuss in London is a  Karabakh settlement. Great Britain has lately been increasingly  active in this process (given the fact it is not a member of the  CSCE ""Minsk Group"" on Nagorno-Karabakh). This is welcomed by  Baku, which seeks independence from Moscow in this process.    Among the delicate questions Aliyev has to solve today is  foreign assistance for his army, in whose ranks are now fighting  1,000 Afghan mujahidin and an unknown number of mercenaries from  neighboring countries. Turkey has provided 300 military  advisers, some 100 of whom are with the units in the field).  True, Ankara denies this fact. The advisers are supposed to  train Azeris in the use of Western military hardware which is  being supplied through the two main channels -- from Afghanistan  (via Iran) and from Turkey. Baku has recently bought 50 tanks  from Kiev. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from Azeri diplomatic  sources that the question of sending British military advisers  to Azerbaijan may also be discussed in London. Those providing  this information specify, however, that advisers from Great  Britain would take no part in combat operations and would only  be doing ""teaching work.""    By internationalizing the situation around the war against  the Armenians, Aliyev is also solving the problems of  consolidating his own power. He is balancing between a big  number of international partners (including Russia) while trying  to firm up his shaken positions. Today, a whole series of  regions in the republic (not counting 20 percent of the  territory occupied by Armenians) are not controlled by the  president. For example, the sole master of Azerbaijan's west is  not Aliyev but his ""premier rival,"" Suret Guseynov, who has  armed formations, outside the national defense forces, including  armored vehicles. Thus, the Azeri press is quite right: Aliyev  is off to London to really ""restore his health."" Political  health, that is.     "

The Chancellor of the Exchequer was speaking at a  Westminster  press conference to launch the Conservative manifesto for the  elections to the European Parliament.    A Strong Britain in a Strong Europe. Mr Clarke made it clear  that Britain's enforced exit from the currency grid 20 months  ago and its emasculation last summer were no barrier to a single  currency and a central bank.    Eurosceptic Tories said that the Chancellor, who is on  record  as supporting the goal of economic and monetary union (EMU), had  let the cat out of the bag and confirmed their fears that the  Government is secretly planning to go for a single currency in  the late 1990s, assuming it can then also win Commons support.  But they declined to attack him publicly for fear of being  accused of rocking the boat now that campaigning for the June 9  poll is under way.    Mr Clarke said: ""It is highly unrealistic that in present  circumstances member states will go back to the narrow bands of  the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. I do not think that Britain  is likely to do so in the foreseeable future. If and when  economic and monetary union ever comes on to the agenda again --  and no doubt some time it will -- I don't believe the route will  be via the ERM.""    Most Conservative MPs have assumed that the turmoil that  struck the ERM last summer had dealt a fatal blow to the  three-stage Delors time-table, under which the first countries  could go ahead with a single currency in 1997.    John Major has said that the Delors timetable for EMU has  ""all the potency of a rain dance,"" and yesterday he was equally  dismissive, saying that there were almost no signs that  conditions for a single currency ""are likely remotely to be  established for a very long time indeed.""    Tory MPs have also been reassured by the British opt-out  from  stage 3 of monetary union, which means that Britain could not  join without the assent of Parliament.    However, the sceptics believe that, with stability returning  to Europe's foreign exchange markets and with inflation and  long-term interest rates low, some of the convergence criteria  for stage 3 and a move to a single currency by 1997 -- or the  later start of 1999 -- are being met.    A leading Tory sceptic said that Mr Clarke had realised that  returning to the ERM was out of the question and that he was now  considering leap-frogging the ERM and going straight to a single  currency.    Another leading sceptic said: ""We have known about this for  18 months. They are going for a big bang. Ken Clarke would be  very happy to see this happen and that's why Michael Portillo  has said he would not have a single currency. Clarke does have  a degree of candour. That's very refreshing but it does not  mean he is right.""     "
0,FT943-16718 ,"FT943-16718 _AN-EGCADAD7FT 940702   FT  02 JUL 94 / As They Say in Europe: Chaos is restored - What Britain should have been saying at Corfu      By JAMES MORGAN   Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, is fond of saying that things in the European Union are moving Britain's way. And last weekend's events on the island of Corfu proved it. Britain was able to eliminate the man - Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene - that most of the others wanted on the reasonable ground that they preferred him. Especially the Germans and the French. Many Europeans failed to see this as the blow for freedom it was represented as being in Britain but, rather, the result of an interplay of forces within the Conservative party and the British media. What happened had, in effect, been a coronary at the heart of Europe. The Dutch paper, Trouw, expressed the general view succinctly: 'Major cannot accept Dehaene. In the United Kingdom, it is the tabloids that rule.' The fact is that Dehaene was no more unacceptable to Britain than any other majority candidate might have been. But since he was depicted in the UK as a fanatical centraliser, that was that. Actually, he was a good deal more acceptable than the other leading contender, Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, whose colourful and scandal-ridden career in politics would have caused huge international interest had it happened anywhere but the Netherlands. Lubbers was also the architect of the Maastricht treaty, which could be regarded as a disqualification for most jobs. In Germany, and even in France, there was some sympathy for the British position. The Frankfurter Allgemeine shared a widely-held view that the way in which Dehaene had been presented to the nations of Europe left a lot to be desired. By implication, John Major was right to see this as some kind of Franco-German diktat. Yet, said the paper: 'Franco-German co-operation is indispensable for the evolution of Europe.' And it noted, menacingly: 'Only those who believed that the order of battle 'Britain against the rest of Europe' had been put to rest with Margaret Thatcher's overthrow can refuse to admit the existence of a fundamental British conflict with the Europeans.' In France, comment often followed similar lines. There was some recognition that the two allies would have to watch their step, however high-minded their motivation, alongside a belief that Britain could not really be 'dissolved in Europe', as La Tribune put it. Inevitably, Figaro produced a characteristic rant and quoted Joan of Arc's words about booting the English out of France - which, in the eyes of most sections of French society, is synonymous with Europe. (It ceases to be Europe when it disagrees with France.) But there was an implicit question that found an echo elsewhere: 'Can Europe progress with Britain as a member?' The next stage of the battle is to find another candidate, a freely accepted man-of-the-majority and yet one who is more acceptable to Britain than Dehaene. Liberation thought the affair could end up by leaving the British worse off (although conceding Major had done Europe a service by returning the EU to its normal state of chaos). And it pointed out that even though there might not be a revival of 'cohesion', this row could well result in more clarity about the respective roles of the commission and the member states. For the UK, though, an opportunity has been missed by rejecting Dehaene unconditionally. The British should have demanded that he and his sponsors agree to four priorities in the work of the commission as a condition for his succession. These are: A crackdown on the corrupt use of EU funds. At present, this is largely the responsibility of governments - and they have little interest in firm action because corruption offers gains to their people at the expense of others. That work should begin now on ensuring farm spending is reduced in preparation for the programme of subsidy reduction agreed in the Gatt world trade round. That each member should guarantee implementation of the single market directives to at least the level achieved in Britain. That the commission should complete its work on producing a binding definition of subsidiarity. These (apparently naive) proposals are thoroughly objectionable in the eyes of most governments although they could hardly admit it. Rejection would mean that any British veto had a sound moral base. Acceptance would give the British a huge stick to wave at every council meeting from now on. The great error of the British is the failure to recognise that the best way to screw up the EU is to ensure that every single rule, regulation, directive and agreement is implemented to the very letter.

""My country has always been pressing for the ban to be  lifted,"" Mr. Watt told a business luncheon.    On April 25, the United States said it has accepted a  Jordanian proposal on a new land-based system for verifying  compliance with the international sanctions, and His Majesty  King Husayn said the al-'Aqabah siege was being lifted, after  meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in  London.    Mr. Christopher told reporters at a joint press conference  with King Husayn that the U.S. had accepted the proposal to have  the London-based Lloyds Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo  once it is unloaded in the port instead of the sea-inspections,  which have caused the Kingdom enormous economic losses.    The American decision was followed by a French announcement  it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting the  al-'Aqabah-bound shipping.    The U.S. confirmation that the siege was being lifted came  on  May 9, when Washington officially informed Jordan of its  acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal.    ""We were never part of the inspection groups, and Britain  never supported the inspection from the beginning,"" Mr. Watt  said.    Addressing a group of business people, Mr. Watt said the new  process was a sign of optimism for the Jordanian economy, adding  that Jordan has become a market which all industries are looking  at.    ""We are beginning to see some signs of hope after the peace  process, and people are looking towards a bright future, making  Jordan a very attractive market,"" he added.

0,FT942-548 ,"FT942-548 _AN-EF2DYAAIFT 940629   FT  29 JUN 94 / Clarke launches fightback against Tory Euro-sceptics      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr Kenneth Clarke will launch a counter-offensive today against the Tory party's Euro-sceptics with a strong re-affirmation of the government's fundamental commitment to the European Union. Throwing his formidable political authority behind his party's beleaguered pro-Europeans, the chancellor will insist that disputes over the European Commission presidency and over beef trade will not undermine a basic identity of interest between Britain's Conservatives and Germany's Christian Democrats. His intervention will come in a speech to the Christian Democrat Konrad Adenauer foundation in Bonn - the audience chosen by Mr John Major more than three years ago to proclaim his determination to keep Britain at the 'heart of Europe'. Mr Clarke will repeat the phrase. Mr Clarke, one of the most powerful figures in the cabinet and the leading potential successor to Mr Major, is expected to enrage the Euro-sceptics by underlining his personal support for the eventual goal of economic and monetary union. Dismissing the notion that Britain will refuse to contemplate a single currency, he will urge EU governments to recreate the conditions for stable exchange rates by meeting the Maastricht Treaty's economic convergence criteria. Putting himself directly at odds with the minimalist vision of Europe offered earlier this week by Mr Michael Portillo, his Thatcherite deputy at the Treasury, the chancellor will reaffirm strong support for that Treaty. Few people, Mr Clarke will add, could seriously question that Britain's future lies in Europe. His speech marks a determined move against efforts by the Euro-sceptics to capitalise on the recent breaches between Britain and its European partners. The sceptics want to lock Mr Major permanently into a more overtly nationalistic stance. The speech is likely to be followed within the next few days with a similarly positive view of Britain's place in Europe from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Mr Clarke will emphasises that Britain must retain the right to disagree with its partners. He will tell his audience that other European governments must be sensitive to political realities in Britain. In a robust as well as unmistakably pro-European speech, he will defend strongly Mr Major's decision to veto Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the next president of the European Commission. He will emphasise that Britain's agenda of an enlarged, liberal and deregulated Europe should be shared by the German Christian Democrats and by other right-of-centre parties throughout the European Union. But both the substance and tone of the speech will be seen at Westminster as a deliberate attempt to reverse the recent tide flowing in favour of the Eurosceptics.

Addressing Conservatives in Poole last night, Mr Hurd said  there was no guarantee that Britain would reach agreement with  its EU partners on a new voting system when foreign ministers  resumed talks on the issue next week.    ""If we are to move forward as a Union of 16, it should be on  the basis of as widespread consent as possible,"" he said. ""That  is the best way to avoid conflict and bickering on a permanent  basis.""    He said that the British public wanted the government to  exercise judgment in the interests both of Britain and Europe.    EU member states propose that the threshold for the  ""blocking  minority"" should rise from 23 to 27 votes when four new  countries enter the Union next year. Britain and Spain are  opposing this, although both are being offered a compromise that  would allow a minority of states to see a two-month delay in  decisions.    Meanwhile, pressure intensified on the government yesterday  to accept that its citizens should have a continuing right to  initiate individual cases in the European Court of Human Rights.    Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, in a  Commons debate on the Council of Europe, warned that Britain's  reputation would be damaged if the government tried to insist  that it should remain a conditional right subject to review at  five-yearly intervals.    He said that Turkey, whose record on human rights would not  commend itself to the British people, was the only country to  have adopted a similar attitude.    Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office junior minister, said  the  UK government was still considering a suggestion that the right  should be made mandatory.     "
0,FT943-15899 ,"FT943-15899 _AN-EGGDZACEFT 940707   FT  07 JUL 94 / Blair spells out case for stronger EU      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the Labour leadership, yesterday cast himself in the role of the discriminating pro-European by calling for a different but positive vision of the European Union's future. In his first detailed statement on an issue likely to dominate politics in the run up to the next general election, Mr Blair said the economic and political case for enhanced European co-operation had become stronger, not weaker. His comments came as the shadow cabinet decided not to oppose or seek to amend legislation due next week to provide for the entry into the EU of Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway. Party officials said there was no question of the party joining with Tory Euro-sceptics in any attempt to wreck the bill. In a speech to the Foreign Press Association, Mr Blair flatly rejected the 'false choice between a sort of bureaucratic federalism and a retreat into isolation'. Accusing the government of a 'minority mentality' which had left Britain participating in Europe without influence, he said the country needed a new self-confidence about its role. The alternative to isolationism was not a headlong rush into a pan-European state but 'a movement towards greater European co-operation, measured by what is practically sensible and publicly acceptable but where public opinion is led as well as followed'. Mr Blair acknowledged the pre-occupations of the Maastricht treaty had been overtaken by events - above all by the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the resultant prospect of an EU of 20 or more states rather than 12 or 16. Britain should treat the intergovernmental conference in 1996 as an opportunity to move beyond Maastricht and 'shape and re-state the basic economic, social and strategic purposes of Europe'. But political and economic forces continued to point in the direction of a closer not looser association. 'The change in Europe as a result of the liberation of eastern Europe may alter the shape of European co-operation but it does not alter the reason for it.' Turning to the party's position on a single European currency, Mr Blair said that Britain must keep its options open to avoid the risk of exclusion from economic and monetary union. The timetable should be driven by economics and not by an artificial political timetable. While exclusion would damage Britain's long-term economic strength, the price of joining without genuine economic convergence might be too high. Britain should seek also to widen the focus of the economic policy debate in the EU to other leading issues such as employment, infrastructure, technology and education and training. The challenges to Europe's economic future had to be faced collectively as well as individually.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

Neither London nor Madrid appeared ready last night to  soften  their position at today's meeting of foreign ministers in  Brussels. The issue may force the EU to delay a decision on new  voting arrangements, jeopardising an already tight timetable for  the entry of Finland, Sweden Austria and Norway into the Union  by January 1, 1995.    The European Parliament further damped hopes of a solution  being reached today. The largest group in the Strasbourg  assembly, the Socialists, rejected the compromise being offered  to Britain and Spain.    Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said:  ""What is at stake is the whole concept of a future Europe.""    The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty  by May 4 to make it possible for the four newcomers to enter by  January. But the Strasbourg assembly has said it will withhold  assent if Britain and Spain win their demands to retain the  ""blocking minority"" at 23 votes in the Council of Ministers  allowing one small and two large member states to obstruct  decisions.    London and Madrid's 10 partners insist that the blocking  threshold should rise to 27, since the weighted votes in Council  will rise from 76 to 90. But as a compromise, they are prepared  to offer a two-month delay on decisions which are opposed by 23  votes, to try to get consensus.    Mr Cot said yesterday: ""There is no chance of having any  sort of mixed solution go through (the European) Parliament,  such as a two-month cooling-off period, which would only  exacerbate delays in decision-making.""    Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, repeated that Britain was  determined to keep the weight of voting power with the larger EU  states. ""The situation now, where two large and one small  country can block a decision, is perfectly satisfactory,"" he  said in Brussels. ""I am not prepared to see a situation develop  where a collection small states can vote down a collection of  bigger ones.""    Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was more conciliatory,  but indicated that it was unlike that a solution could be  reached today. The Union had to find a way through the voting  impasse he said, during a visit to Dublin. ""We may not do so in  Brussels tomorrow (Tuesday), but we will persevere until we do.""    In Paris, the French foreign ministry, quoted by Reuter,  said  France and Germany would still press for a solution at today's  meeting. ""There are ways to take account of some countries'  concerns.""    Mr Clarke said it was wrong to assume that enlargement  automatically meant changes to make decision-making easier at  the expense of the minority.    But an EU diplomat said all 12 member states, including  Britain, had agreed at the EU summit in Lisbon in June 1992 that  the admission of the four Nordic and Alpine countries would  require a ""mechanical"" adjustment in voting weights. A senior  Brussels diplomat played down speculation about a special summit  to break the impasse.     "

The debts include Republic of Estonia bond issues worth about Pounds 600,000 (Dollars 1.02m) held by British nationals before the Soviet annexation of the Baltic state. Representatives of the Estonian government and Bank of Estonia have met officials from the Bank of England, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Treasury in London to discuss outstanding financial claims between the two countries. Britain announced last week it has agreed to return gold deposits to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The gold was deposited with the Bank of England in 1940 at the time of the Soviet takeover, and was sold on the open market by the UK government in 1967 for Pounds 5.8m, much to the Baltic states' annoyance. However, it seems likely that following the resolution of the gold issue, Estonia and Britain will waive outstanding claims. According to Foreign Office documents, Estonia's debts to British nationals amount to Pounds 609,587, relating to a sterling bond issue and a dollar bond issue, while Estonian assets - excluding the gold - held in the UK amount to Pounds 492,907, including bank accounts and securities.

Patten said: Under  circumstances where China and Britain cannot reach full  agreement on the issue of the political system, the British side  can still strive to reach a partial agreement with the Chinese  side on the issue of the political system or reach an agreement  on issues other than the political system, which states that  each side goes its own way (agree to disagree).

While in  London, Patten will meet Robin McLaren, British ambassador to  China and negotiator at the Sino-British talks, who has  recovered from an illness, and will discuss the outlook for  talks with him.    Patten said: Now, the top priority of the British side is  still to strive to hold an 18th round of talks with the Chinese  side and to strive to reach an agreement on the issues of the  through train, the functional constituencies, and the electoral  committee before the Hong Kong Government submits the remaining  parts of its political reform bill to Legco. He pointed out  that if both sides cannot reach a full agreement, he welcomes  both sides trying to reach a partial agreement, for example,  both sides could reach an agreement on one to two of the three  large issues, namely, the through train, the functional  constituencies, and the electoral committee to narrow the gap  between both sides on the arrangements for the political system.  For the British side, this is the second option.    However, Patten stressed: Even if the partial through train  arrangement theoretically emerges, there has been hardly any  sign so far that the Chinese side intends to reach a partial  agreement. Besides, he said, a partial agreement must contain  factors which are reasonable and deserve to be upheld.    Vigorously Ensuring Other Kinds of Cooperation While Each  Side Goes Its Own Way    Patten acknowledged that if both sides could not hold  another  round of talks, the British side must decide on the electoral  arrangements on its own. The British side's third option is  that both sides admit that there are differences over the  political system, but that they can continue to cooperate with  each other on issues other than the political system and can  reach an agreement which states that each side is going its own  way. He said: Even if China and Britain cannot reach agreement  on political issues, it does not mean that both sides cannot  reach any agreement on other issues, and an agreement which  states that each side goes its own way, is, after all, better  than no agreement. He added: It is always better to confine  both sides' differences to a few political issues rather than  spreading the political impact to other fields.    When talking about the British side's final option, that is,  under a situation where there is no agreement, the Hong Kong  Government unilaterally submits the remainder of the political  reform bill to Legco for discussion, Patten said that it was his  duty to exercise effective rule over Hong Kong and that he  firmly believed that Legco members would not choose to do  something which they deem incorrect merely because the Chinese  side had threatened to cancel arrangements for the political  system. Patten added: The Chinese side has warned that in  1997, they will cancel any arrangements on the political system  with which Beijing does not agree, but different Chinese  officials give different meanings to ""cancellation."" Patten  said: The Hong Kong Government should not, at present, do  anything to the detriment of the interests of Hong Kong merely  because the Chinese side may do something to the detriment of  the interests of Hong Kong in an uncertain future.    In the interview, Patten also commented on the preliminary  work committee of the preparatory committee of the special  administrative region and analyzed the prospects of Sino-Hong  Kong cooperation and implementing a high degree of autonomy  after 1997. In addition, he also talked about China's  most-favored-nation status, Hong Kong's economic prospects, the  financial reserves, the overheated real estate market, and other  issues.     "

Merchants withdraw to Hong Kong harbour under naval protection. 1840 Britain sends expeditionary force to open Chinese ports to trade, demand apology and compensation for lost opium. Lord Palmerston, foreign secretary, demands 'satisfaction for the past and security for the future'. 1841 Agreement between British and Chinese officials, later rejected by both governments, cedes Hong Kong to Britain - which had not been demanded by London - but fails to open Chinese ports. Before rejection of deal is known, British naval force occupies Hong Kong island on January 26 and raises flag. Jardine Matheson begins building first warehouse. Sir Henry Pottinger sent to take charge of expeditionary force and secure full British demands. 1842 Lord Aberdeen, new foreign secretary, instructs that islands acquired in course of war are 'not to be regarded in the light of a permanent conquest'. Pottinger replies that 'this settlement (Hong Kong) has already advanced too far to admit of its being restored to the authority of the (Chinese) Emperor consistently with the honour ..of Her Majesty's Crown'. In Treaty of Nanjing, later ratified by both governments, Pottinger secures opening of ports of Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai, Dollars 21m compensation for the lost opium and cession of Hong Kong island in perpetuity because the British needed 'a port whereat they may careen and refit their ships'. Pottinger becomes first governor. 1860 Kowloon peninsula ceded to Britain under Convention of Beijing 1898 New Territories leased to Britain for 99 years. Lease expires June 30, 1997 * * * * 1979 China's leader Deng Xiaoping meets governor Sir Murray MacLehose, tells him investors in Hong Kong should 'set their hearts at ease'. Says China has sovereignty over Hong Kong but that Hong Kong would have a 'special position' as part of China. A negotiated settlement should be based on these principles. Hong Kong would continue to practise its capitalist system for a considerable time. 1982 Deng meets UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Beijing, rejects her proposal of continued British administration of Hong Kong after 1997 but agrees to begin negotiations. Says China will take back the whole area of Hong Kong in 1997 but will adopt special policies to ensure its continued prosperity. 1983 Thatcher, in message to Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, says in March she would accept transfer of sovereignty if an acceptable settlement was reached. In October, after four fruitless rounds of talks, Thatcher, UK ministers, governor Edward Youde and Hong Kong Executive Council members agree in London to shelve Britain's insistence on administering Hong Kong after 1997. Britain will explore China's blueprint for Hong Kong. 1984 China urges in February adoption of protocol giving it a substantial role in Hong Kong in the transition period before 1997. Jardine Matheson says in March it will move its domicile to Bermuda. In meetings with Deng in April and July, Sir Geoffrey Howe, UK foreign secretary, persuades him treaty should be detailed document and that the Joint Liaison Group proposed by China for pre-1997 period should play less prominent role. On September 26, after 22 rounds of formal talks, Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong is initialled. On December 19, Thatcher and Zhao sign Joint Declaration in the Great Hall of the People. Hong Kong is to become a Special Administrative Region of China in 1997, enjoying a 'high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs'. Hong Kong to keep its economic system, separate customs status and independent finances. Rights and freedoms, including those of speech, press and assembly, to be ensured by SAR's own laws.

UK Prime Minister John Major visits Beijing in September to sign memorandum of understanding on airport. Airport financing plans subsequently stalled again by Chinese refusal to endorse them. 1992 Governor Chris Patten announces in October plan to broaden franchise of indirectly-elected LegCo seats and make local government all directly elected. He seeks discussions with Beijing. China refuses and promises to reverse Patten reforms if enacted. 1993 After failure of 'talks about talks', Patten 'gazettes' reform bill in March but does not submit it to LegCo.

Within Britain there is a tendency to blame trade unions and their members for any decline in economic or industrial performance. High wage claims, inflexible workers and an over-generous benefit system are often quoted as undermining our ability to compete. A recent report by the Institute of Employment Rights argues that Britain will continue to decline while government and industry concentrate on policies designed simply to cut labour costs. Companies should concentrate on correcting their managerial and training failures while developing innovative marketing, design and technology policies. The government should reconsider its reforms of the tax and benefit systems and look to more egalitarian social insurance provisions. At the moment, the welfare state is failing to fulfil its original remit, particularly the elimination of the need to beg. Instead state benefits are being used as subsidies for inefficient firms dependent on low-wage workers to keep them afloat. Blaming the workers is all too easy. The government that honours, invests in and rewards workers for their efforts will be the government that begins to rebuild Britain.

The Government's followup to the Rio Earth Summit, an  environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four  documents--nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in the  surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall.    The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable  Development Strategy, on transport, says that ``costs of travel,  particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise to  reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future  demand for transport.''    Mr. Major, launching the strategy, said: ``Sometimes quite  painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental  objectives.'' He admitted he ``did not expect to see people  dancing in the street'' at the thought of road pricing.    He said that Britain's imposition of VAT [value-added tax]  on  heating and lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road  pricing had already gone further than most other countries, but  denied these would impose an intolerable burden on the economy.    An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet  future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the  overall environmental strategy, Major introduced the following  documents:    The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how  Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide  emissions by the year 2000.    The document shows for the first time that Britain will  achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global  warming--including methane and CFCs [chlorofluorocarbons]--of  five percent. It commits Britain to setting targets after 2000  but not what they will be.    The Biodiversity Action Plan--sets out 59 specific  commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness .    The Forestry Action Plan--shows how Britain will increase  forest cover.    Mr. Major announced a new panel of five ``wise men'' who  will  advise him and monitor progress on ``green issues,'' chaired by  Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an  unofficial adviser at Downing Street.    The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of  National  Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's  statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation  Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission  on Environmental Pollution and Dr. Anne Mclaren, vice-president  of the Royal Society    Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the  Government would be setting up a Round Table on Sustainable  Development which would bring together industry, local  authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental  policies.    The Government also intended to stimulate a new ``citizen's  environmental initiative'' in consultation with local  authorities, churches and community groups.    Mr. Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from  Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr. Chris Smith.  Labour spokesman for environmental protection, said the four  reports contained ``no vision and few firm commitments to  action.''

The treaty has  not produced a monolithic construction and particularist  interests continue to be represented. As for the granting of  special rights, Denmark and Great Britain occupy first place.  The FRG alone has accepted all the disadvantages that this  ""work"" entails.    With the Treaty of Rome -- which founded the EEC (25 March  1957) -- the participating countries only expressed their  determination to proceed with integration in a way that would  secure economic and social peace. Since 1973, the community has  expanded its membership from six to 12 in three stages. As the  number of countries increased, problems of coexistence began to  develop, something which was overlooked in what amounted to  integration euphoria..    Other countries are also seeking admission; East Europe also  harbors expectations. At the moment there is even talk of a  two-speed Europe. There is nothing that illustrates the  difference between desire and reality better. In the end, the  number of timetables [for admission] will be the same as the  number of members.    Sickness in the Head and in the Limbs    If we view the pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, that is,  the  Treaty of Rome with its expansion to include economic and  monetary union as well as social policy and environmental  protection, a future European foreign and security policy, as  well as cooperation in the field of domestic and legal policy,  then the only verdict is: With the definitive participation of  Kohl's government, a treaty has come into being that has finally  transformed our republic from being a sick state into an infirm  one.    The requirements for a common economic and monetary policy  --  in the form of high-level price and monetary stability, a public  finance situation that is tolerable in the long term, the  favorable development of markets, balance of payments positions  and labor unit costs -- cannot be realized in the long term too.  The imbalances between the economies are too great, and that is  reflected in frequent exchange rate adjustments, that is,  devaluations, since the fall of 1992. In addition, Italy and  Great Britain have left the exchange rate mechanism. This then  constitutes the path leading to a common currency.    The Structural Engineering Is Wrong    A further example of harmonization that exists only on paper  is that of developing common social standards. This is another  area in which Great Britain has accorded itself a special  status. This means the sanctioning of substantial differences  in social systems; Great Britain has obtained competitive  advantages for itself that further endanger Germany's position  as a center for industry. Companies are already transferring  production facilities to Scotland or England.    The conditions for cooperation in domestic policy and legal  policy as well as the explanations in the final act are a farce  from the German viewpoint. The FRG, which is subject to  enormous immigration pressures, has been left to cope by itself.  Of course, this changes nothing about the domestic political  failure of the established parties on this crucial issue.    The chancellor wants to be celebrated as Europe's architect.  It is poor master builder who erects a building without making  sure that the structural engineering is in order.     "

The spokesman pointed out: From April to November 1993,  representatives of the Chinese and the British Governments held  17 rounds of talks on the 1994-95 election arrangements in Hong  Kong. Prior to the talks, the two countries reached an  understanding of confidentiality of the contents of talks. Now  the British, without having consultation with China, have  unilaterally published the contents of the talks, distorting and  attacking the Chinese stance in an attempt to shift  responsibility for disruption of the talks. China is compelled  to make public relevant talks on this to ensure a correct  understanding of the facts.    The facts published by the spokesman concerning several  major  issues in the Sino-British talks consist of seven issues and a  postscript. The seven issues are: 1) Britain obstinately clings  to the ""three violations"" political system program during the  talks; 2) Britain attempts to interfere with affairs which fall  within the scope of Chinese sovereignty; 3) The agreement and  understanding reached between the two countries on the issue of  the Election Committee must be honored; 4) The original  intention of functional constituency elections must be upheld;  5) The issue of the ""through train"" can only be resolved within  the scope of the National People's Congress decision and the  relevant provisions of the Basic Law; 6) China has exerted great  efforts to reach agreement on the issue of election arrangements  of regional organizations; and 7) Britain has deliberately  disrupted the talks.    The spokesman pointed out: The essence of the dispute  between China and Britain on the issue of Hong Kong's political  system is not a question of whether or not we want to develop  democracy, but one of whether or not we should keep good faith  internationally and converge the Basic Law with the realization  of Hong Kong's smooth transition. The dispute has been started  by the changes in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong. Facts will  prove that such changes do not conform with Britain's interests  and will cause damage to Hong Kong.    The latest Sino-British talks have broken down because of  Britain's disruption. China deems it necessary to sternly  reiterated that in accordance with the stipulations of the Sino-  British Joint Declaration, British administration of Hong Kong  ends on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The  components of the political system structure of the British  administration of Hong Kong -- the last British Hong Kong  District Board, the two municipal councils, and the Legislative  Council -- must be dissolved along with the end of the British  administration period. From 1 July 1997, the political system  structure of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region will be  organized and established according to the NPC decision and the  relevant provisions of the Basic Law.    In conclusion, the spokesman emphatically pointed out:  Nobody can obstruct Hong Kong's forthcoming return to the  motherland's embrace. The Chinese Government and people are  entirely confident that they will be able to resume the exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and to implement the  principle of ""one country, two systems"" and the Basic Law to  preserve Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.

0,FT941-6953 ,"FT941-6953 _AN-EB0AFAFKFT 940226   FT  26 FEB 94 / As They Say In Europe: Life is exotic in the modern Sparta      By JAMES MORGAN   'Why are public services in Britain so bad compared with France?' asked Monique Villa, who runs the London bureau of Agence France Presse. 'Is the difference in taxation so great?' Such is the stuff of debate chez Morgan. (On the agenda was not only a comparative study of systems of public administration, there was also consideration of the development of the Florentine aesthetic and whether British MP's are worse than others at keeping their trousers on.) As a share of gross domestic product, the French government takes 25 per cent more in tax than does the British. Maybe things will change when the British are hit by April's rises. But will Britain's public services be as efficient as France's? Clearly not. That made me think. The efficiency of a public service is judged by the standard of service to the consumer. So British Rail is inferior. So Britain's health service is worse than the French, where waiting times are unknown and hospitals are fully staffed. But in Britain 94 per cent of all health bills are met by the state; in France the figure is 77 per cent, so the French pay extra as 'consumers.' And health spending absorbs a far lower share of national resources in Britain than it does in France. Among the results is a shorter life expectancy for the British - 1 per cent shorter. But maternal death rates are lower. British Rail may seem user-unfriendly but, in terms of exploiting its resources, it is a world leader. Track and rolling-stock use is something foreigners come to marvel at. It has not produced a catastrophe to compare with the computerised booking system for the French high-speed trains. What exists in Britain is a de facto utilitarianism. A basic service is provided at a marvellously low price, in tax terms. This is reflected in comparative UN criteria on the quality of life: Britain ranks only just below France and the Netherlands. What is missing is what Monique saw as those little touches that make people feel better. They do not appear in the utilitarian calculus but they are highly valued by ordinary people. The economic cost of late-running public transport systems, of a six-month wait for a hip replacement, of a shortage of nursery school places, may not be all that great. But full provision in such areas adds to national well-being. Britain is a sort of latter-day Sparta. The government does nothing to make people feel better, British public services are a form of hardship. But in economic terms they are amazingly cost-effective. As I pondered these conclusions, I saw the fifth in a series of articles in Le Monde on Europe's great cities. Last weekend the paper had a go at London. The concern was architecture (I can already feel English readers cringing in anticipation of the steady raining of superior Gallic blows on vulnerable Anglo-Saxon heads.) 'English architecture of the post-war years and up to the 1960s was of a singular quality compared with continental output,' began one paragraph menacingly. Surprisingly, what followed was not a stream of abuse, but an account of how things had improved in recent years. The writers liked Chelsea hospital and the new international terminal at Waterloo station. One observation ran: 'The Thatcher years, having opened the doors to the angels and demons of savage liberalism, everything which smacked of state intervention or of a strong local collectivity was banished.' But British experts stressed that this was always so, London always grew by private initiative. (By comparison Paris was destroyed by Haussmann more than 100 years ago in a grand project which uprooted and destroyed whole communities). The writers were intrigued at the way the government had eventually been forced to intervene in the case of bankrupt Canary Wharf and build a metro link to the beleaguered development to the east of the city. So it is that London offers 'no simple logic but rather an ensemble of minimalist characteristics.' There are no safeguards for zones of architectural interest, only for individual buildings. But on the other hand consultations with the people are 'far more extensive and demanding than on this side of the Channel,' said Le Monde's experts. The title of the piece was 'die-hard eclecticism' which really sums up Britain. Not only London, but the social and physical infrastructure of Britain grows incrementally. No grand projects, just tinkering with the system. France is created from the ground up. It works better, costs more but does it represent a better use of resources? As Monique tells young recruits, for all the above, and other, reasons: 'If you want to see a country that is very near and really exotic, go to England.'

The Government's followup to the Rio Earth Summit, an  environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four  documents -- nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in  the surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall.    The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable  Development Strategy, on transport, says that ""costs of travel,  particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise to  reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future  demand for transport.""    Mr Major, launching the strategy, said: ""Sometimes quite  painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental  objectives."" He admitted he ""did not expect to see people  dancing in the street"" at the thought of road pricing.    He said that Britain's imposition of VAT [value-added tax]  on  heating and lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road  pricing had already gone further than most other countries, but  denied these would impose an intolerable burden on the economy.    An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet  future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the  overall environmental strategy, Major introduced the following  documents:    The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how  Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide  emissions by the year 2000.    The document shows for the first time that Britain will  achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global warming --  including methane and CFCs [chlorofluorocarbons] -- of five  percent. It commits Britain to setting targets after 2000 but  not what they will be.    The Biodiversity Action Plan -- sets out 59 specific  commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness.    The Forestry Action Plan -- shows how Britain will increase  forest cover.    Mr Major announced a new panel of five ""wise men"" who will  advise him and monitor progress on ""green issues,"" chaired by  Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an  unofficial adviser at Downing Street.    The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of  National  Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's  statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation  Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission  on Environmental Pollution and Dr Anne Mclaren, vice president  of the Royal Society    Mr Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the  Government would be setting up a Roundtable on Sustainable  Development which would bring together industry, local  authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental  policies.    The Government also intended to stimulate a new ""citizen's  environmental initiative"" in consultation with local  authorities, churches and community groups.    Mr Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from  Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr Chris Smith, Labour  spokesman for environmental protection, said the four reports  contained ""no vision and few firm commitments to action.""    The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said  the key Strategy document was ""full of `coulds', `ifs' and  `maybes' when what the country needs is `whys', `whats' and  `whens.'""

The Foreign Office in London yesterday made public its decision to expel Mr Vahid Belourchi, a first secretary at the Iranian embassy, for allegedly distributing forged documents about British policy in Bosnia. Iran had been told of the British decision last week, when it was agreed that no publicity would be given to the expulsion in the hope of avoiding further repercussions. However, Tehran said yesterday it was retaliating by expelling Mr Hamish Cowell, the deputy head of the British mission in Tehran. No further official explanation was offered by the Iranian government, but Iranian newspapers linked the expulsion to 'extensive British propaganda against Iran, designed to please the US'. The latest downward turn in relations between the two countries began in April when Britain accused Iran of establishing links with the IRA, and of planning to provide weapons and training for Irish republican extremists. Iran denied that any contacts had taken place and suggested instead that a listening device had been found implanted in the wall of its refurbished embassy in London. The Foreign Office said the Iranian diplomat had been asked to leave 'because members of the Iranian embassy had been involved in attempting to distribute forged documents purporting to show that Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against the Moslems'. Iran has become frustrated at its inability to aid Moslems in Bosnia and the refusal by western powers to accept the deployment of Iranian peace-keeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. The regime in Tehran also believes that Britain is playing a key supporting role in the US policy of denying Iran access to international financial markets at a time of growing economic difficulties in the Islamic republic.

Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said that the week's turbulence should not be perceived as the end of Britain's move towards Europe. His remarks came as Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman, moved to place himself in the forefront of the Tory Euro-sceptics. In an article in The Daily Telegraph, followed by an interview on BBC Radio 4, Mr Baker made clear his opposition to the pound's early return to the exchange rate mechanism, making more likely a strong Tory backbench revolt in next week's emergency Commons debate on the economy. Mr Stephen Dorrell, a Treasury minister, last night emphasised that ERM membership was still seen as crucial to the government's long-term economic strategy. The policy of delivering low inflation and sound money remained 'precisely the same tonight as it was last Friday'. This desire for a stable long-term environment was why Britain joined the ERM and why the government had 'made clear its desire to resume active participation in the ERM as soon as conditions allow'. Mr Heseltine, during a visit to the north-east of England, said companies must not be deflected from urgently needed preparations for the single European market. 'We have to persuade the people who work in our companies to take the readjustment to the single European market seriously and urgently,' he said. Any misreading of Britain's approach to Europe might also affect inward investment, which the UK had success-fully attracted in the 1980s. 'They didn't come here because it was Britain, they came here because it was Britain in Europe,' Mr Heseltine said. 'If there were to be any doubt about that, then many of these companies who have positioned themselves in Europe by basing themselves in Britain would have to reconsider that strategic judgment.' Last night, in a speech to the Northern CBI, Mr Heseltine said: 'The underlying dynamic of our relationship with Europe is not the Maastricht treaty but the single European act. Nothing must deflect our attention from the significance of the changes in that market place.' Mr Baker said that conditions for sterling to re-enter the ERM would take 'a very long time to get right'. The UK 'should not be too keen to re-enter the ERM, even if it survives'. He added: 'The Maastricht concept of a single currency for the whole of the Community will not come about this century.' Mr Baker also urged Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to make further rapid cuts in interest rates  - down to 6 per cent. Conjuring up a vision of Britain  - untrammelled by the ERM  - buoyed by the fastest growth rate of any western economy, he said: 'Interest rates in Britain are now not determined by bankers in Frankfurt. The chancellor is a free man.' The government's position of a return to the ERM 'as soon as conditions allow' was criticised more forthrightly by other Euro-sceptics. Sir Teddy Taylor, secretary of the Conservative European Reform Group, described it as 'arrogant and bumptious'. Sir Rhodes Boyson, former Conservative Tory minister and another prominent Euro-sceptic, said that Britain needed to rejoin the ERM like it needed 'a hole in the head'. Support for the government, though, came from Mr Hugh Dykes, Tory MP for Harrow East and chairman of the European Movement, who said membership of the ERM was 'essential for this country's future prosperity'. The row over the ERM grew as the agenda for next month's Tory party conference was published. The motions on the agenda were submitted before July 13 but include a number of pleas for Britain to leave the ERM and several calls for a referendum on Maastricht. It also emerged that Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, will attend the Brighton conference, posing a delicate stage-management question for party organisers.

0,FT932-8535 ,"FT932-8535 _AN-DESCQAAFFT 930519   FT  19 MAY 93 / Britain will speed up ratification, says Major      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   MR JOHN MAJOR last night seized on Denmark's endorsement of Maastricht to signal that Britain would now press ahead quickly with ratification of a treaty that has threatened to split the Tory party. Amid undisguised jubilation in Whitehall, ministers said the government hoped to complete the tortuous ratification process before parliament's summer recess at the end of July. Mr Major, speaking to businessmen at the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry, said the government now intended to 'get on with doing business for Britain in Europe'. Emphasising that ratification was essential to ensure that Britain was not sidelined in Europe, the prime minister commented: 'The issue is British jobs, British sales, Britain's future . . . the sooner we put this debilitating business behind us, the better it will be for British business.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, added that the government's objective now was to 'get on with life after Maastricht'. The prime minister, who has seen his government's authority drained, said the Tory party should put behind it the 'incomprehensible and interminable' wrangling over Maastricht. Conservative Euro-sceptics acknowledged that the Danish result had severely dented their hopes of wrecking the agreement. But they vowed to continue to fight British ratification in the House of Lords and in the courts. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will lead another rebellion against the bill in the Lords but Mr Major is confident they will fail. Lord Tebbit, who intends to table amendments to the legislation calling for a British referendum, vowed last night that the 'fight' would go on. The prime minister expects to defeat a separate legal challenge from the Tory Euro-sceptics over the status of Britain's opt-out from the Treaty social chapter. The only remaining option for the sceptics would then be to join with the Labour party and vote for the scrapping of the social chapter opt-out. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the opposition would continue its campaign for the opt-out to be removed. He said: 'Unlike Britain, the people of Denmark were fortunate enough to be presented with a version of the Maastricht Treaty which contained the Social Chapter.' The Maastricht bill will complete its passage through the House of Commons tomorrow. In spite of the threat of a rebellion by 40 or more Conservative Euro-sceptics, the bill's move to the House of Lords is guaranteed because of Labour's decision to abstain on the crucial third reading vote. Senior ministers acknowledged that wounds in the Tory party from the bitter struggle over the treaty will take years to heal. The government has already been warned by its supporters that any move to take sterling back into the European exchange rate mechanism - as required under the treaty - would provoke an even bigger revolt.

0,FT941-501 ,"FT941-501 _AN-EC3DVABKFT 940330   FT  30 MAR 94 / Brussels denies social policy concessions      By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID GARDNER      LONDON, BRUSSELS   The government was facing further trouble over European Union enlargement last night after the European Commission rejected Britain's interpretation of 'assurances' on social policy. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said assurances given by the commission met Britain's concerns that the health and safety provisions of the Treaty of Rome were being used to circumvent Britain's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. But Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, said he had 'simply clarified the programme of the commission for the present year'. Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said there had been no concession on social policy. It also emerged that the assurances will cease to be valid at the of the year, when a new commission takes office. British officials said they believed the undertakings would be accepted by the next commission. Mr Major told the Commons that the assurances meant that the commission's use of the health and safety provisions would be restricted to measures 'directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work'. He said this meant there would be no repetition of the commission's attempt to use the health and safety provisions to impose a directive on working time, which Britain has challenged in the European Court. The commission had also accepted that the UK would be excluded completely from proposals under the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, he said. This would mean the proposals to set up works councils would not be imposed on the British operations of transnational companies. Earlier Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, told the cabinet that the assurances would also block the imposition in Britain of three directives expected to be brought forward shortly by Mr Flynn. The directives deal with discrimination in the workplace, employment conditions for part-time workers and parental-leave rights under the health and safety provisions. Downing Street officials said Britain would welcome the only two other directives - on factory inspection procedures and mine safety - expected to be tabled under the health and safety provisions. The British interpretation, however, was flatly rejected in Brussels. Officials said Britain had asked for a written assurance from Mr Delors, but received only a tart 'verbal reminder' that previously agreed procedures for social policy were written down in the EU treaty and in regulations - and remained so. Publicly, the commission merely restated three arcane references in the 'reminder', provided on Monday to Sir John Kerr, Britain's ambassador to the EU, by Mr Flynn and Mr Delors. But the UK's request was described privately by a commission official as 'simply intolerable. We are not going to let them imply that there is a trade-off in social policy,' he said. 'You can't negotiate concessions from the commission on social policy; there are 11 other member states.'

The Home Office confirmed that Mr Ahmed Gazmalhaliq Abdulla, whose tortuous journey from Sudan and then around Europe has brought wide attention, was sent back to Germany on May 12. This was after Mr Abdulla's lawyers, who claimed he risked persecution in Germany, failed to win permission for a court appeal to allow him to seek asylum in Britain. Mr Abdulla, who had spent almost a year in an asylum-seekers' hostel in Germany, travelled to Britain at the end of last year after his hostel had been attacked several times by rightwing extremists during violence against immigrants in Germany last autumn. UK authorities rejected Mr Abdulla's asylum request, but in January the Home Office gave him temporary approval to remain in Britain while lawyers prepared a case to back his claim that he would be under threat in Germany. By appearing to support the notion that immigrants faced the danger of racial persecution in Germany, the UK's decision raised controversy in Britain and Germany. The Home Office said the case had been 'blown up out of all proportion'. If Britain had given the refugee a permanent home it would almost certainly have affected political relations between London and Bonn, and could have led to similar departures of immigrants from Germany to the UK. This seems to have accounted for the government's rapid action to send Mr Abdulla back. His lawyers claim that the decision was taken in spite of only patchy evidence that violence against foreigners is abating in Germany. The number of cases, which totalled 2,427 last year, amounted to 809 in the first four months of this year. This was down by more than half from the final four months of last year, when there was a bulge in the number of cases recorded. But it was still four times the number of cases for the first four months of 1991.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

Calling on MPs to support the social provisions of the treaty, Mr Smith claimed that the debate was more about the 'tattered reputation of a discredited prime minister' than the national interest. This theme was taken up by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who told Mr Major that if the vote went against the government 'we expect him to obey it'. To Labour cheers Mr Smith insisted that Britain had no future as the 'sweatshop of Europe', and forecast accelerating economic decline if the policies of social devaluation which lay behind the attempt to opt out from the social chapter continued. Brushing aside suggestions from Conservative backbenchers that acceptance of the social chapter would mean a return to union domination he emphasised that it did not extend to pay the right of association and the right to strike. Mr Smith said Britain was alone among the 12 member states of the European Community in opposing a modest extension of its competence to such matters as the protection of health and safety of people at work and equality of opportunity between men and women. He accused the prime minister of increasingly inhabiting a 'Walter Mitty world' in which he alone suffered from the delusion that getting Britain excluded from a decision making process of considerable consequence constituted a triumph. Mr Smith said the members of the EC who embraced the social chapter had more impressive records of competitiveness and productivity than Britain. He added: 'What the Conservatives fail to understand is that low wages, inadequate skills, and persistent under investment are the real drag anchors on Britain's economic performance.' Denouncing the government for what he said was its 'crude' approach to international competition, Mr Smith said it sought to compete with Taiwan on wages rather than against Germany on skills. In the real world the new economic agenda required a new approach - a positive combination of skills development, decent and humane standards, and ever widening employment opportunities. Mr Ashdown denied earlier assertions by the prime minister that the Liberal Democrats would be opposing ratification of the treaty by joining with Labour MPs and voting against the government in both divisions at the end of the debate. Mr Ashdown insisted that the votes were about accepting the social chapter which his party believed could be improved through Britain being part of it and not outside it. He said: 'It is not the great new monster of socialism stalking across Europe which the government tries to persuade us to believe.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Addressing Conservatives in Poole last night, Mr Hurd said there was no guarantee that Britain would reach agreement with its EU partners on a new voting system when foreign ministers resumed talks on the issue next week. 'If we are to move forward as a Union of 16, it should be on the basis of as widespread consent as possible,' he said. 'That is the best way to avoid conflict and bickering on a permanent basis.' He said that the British public wanted the government to exercise judgment in the interests both of Britain and Europe. EU member states propose that the threshold for the 'blocking minority' should rise from 23 to 27 votes when four new countries enter the union next year. Britain and Spain are opposing this, although both are being offered a compromise that would allow a minority of states to see a two-month delay in decisions. Meanwhile, pressure intensified on the government yesterday to accept that its citizens should have a continuing right to initiate individual cases in the European Court of Human Rights. Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, in a Commons debate on the Council of Europe, warned that Britain's reputation would be damaged if the government tried to insist that it should remain a conditional right, subject to review at five-yearly intervals. He said that Turkey, whose record on human rights would not commend itself to the British people, was the only country to have adopted a similar attitude. Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office junior minister, said the UK government was still considering a suggestion that the right should be made mandatory.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

They want ministers to consider a  controversial scheme to allow all 25,000 registered drug addicts  to receive heroin and other drugs free on the national service.    They are also demanding a royal commission on drug control  and an American-style national drugs task force to spearhead a  new anti-drugs campaign.    ""We've won several battles but we've lost the war,"" Keith  Hellawell, chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs,  said yesterday. ""The current policy has not stopped young people  turning to drugs.    ""It has not stopped the violence and other crime related to  drugs. We need to win the hearts and minds of a generation and  turn them around.""    Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and the favourite to  become  Labour party leader, last night supported the police initiative.  ""It is desperately important that the government recognises the  scale and urgency of the drugs problem,"" he said. ""It must put  together a comprehensive programme which cuts demand as well as  supply.""    Police alarm at the rising drugs menace follows new evidence  that Britain is caught up in a drugs explosion. Chief constables  say existing policy has failed to stop the emergence of a ""drugs  generation"" made up of tens of thousands of youngsters who have  turned to crime to meet their drugs bills.    Hellawell will unveil fresh evidence of the crisis when he  chairs the chief constables' drugs conference at Wakefield next  week. ""It's extremely serious. It's not just confined to the big  cities. This affects every city and town in the country. It's  right across society, it's right across our youth. I will  guarantee your children have been offered drugs or at least know  about drugs in their school.    ""Headmasters are keeping it under wraps. This is a cancer in  our society that has to be excised. Otherwise I don't know where  it will lead.""    Richard Browne, Britain's chief customs drugs investigator,  told THE SUNDAY TIMES: ""I can stem the flow. I can make it more  difficult for them and restrict the amount that comes in. But we  can't link arms around the coastline and stop it. It's a  bottomless pit.""    Chief Superintendent Paul Cook, head of community affairs  and  drugs in Greater Manchester, admitted that police and Customs  had failed to halt the drugs explosion. ""The entire police  effort over the last 25 years has had no discernible effect on  the availability of drugs on the streets,"" he said. ""I've talked  to ministers until I'm blue in the bloody face. We have got to  address this problem.""    A cabinet sub-committee set up last year under Tony Newton,  leader of the Commons, is considering switching resources from  policing to reducing drugs demand among the young. The review,  due to report to John Major this summer, is likely to propose  giving the police a greater role in educating the public about  drugs.    Police chiefs warn, however, that Britain is facing a drugs  crisis matching the worst affected cities in the United States.  Philip Thomas, West Midlands assistant chief constable and head  of crime operations, said: ""Drug dealers are protecting a trade  which is causing more social disruption than anything else in  our society.""    ""There have been drug-related shootings in Liverpool,  Manchester and eight in Birmingham in the last 12 months,"" says  Thomas. Last year there were 31 drug-related murders and  attempted murders in London alone.    New research shows the black market in heroin, cocaine,  cannabis and other illegal drugs is now worth 5 billion a  year. Police, fearful of the ""knock-on"" effect on burglaries,  car thefts, credit card fraud and street robberies, point to new  figures showing that Britain has overtaken the United States in  car crime, previously the record holder.    Customs chiefs revealed last week that Britain is now the  most lucrative market in the world for heroin and cocaine  traffickers, giving international drugs syndicates a profits  ""premium"" of more than 30 percent.    Crack, the highly addictive cocaine derivative, is a growing  source of concern. ""We're seeing huge amounts being targeted at  Britain and Europe,"" said Browne.    Large quantities of pure cocaine are being shipped to ""crack  factories"" in the inner cities including Tottenham, Stoke  Newington and Brixton in London, Moss Side in Manchester and  parts of Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh.    Manchester police estimates that the average heroin addict  consumes nearly 30,000 worth of the drug each year, paying  for their habit by street dealing, prostitution and theft.

Mr. Major confirmed in the Commons last night that the  European summit in Brussels had agreed to repeal the 10-year-old  bathing and drinking water directives and replace them with less  intrusive regulations, enabling ``broad, general standards'' to  be applied at national level.    Seventeen EC directives have been withdrawn or amended in  the  purge of legislation, part of an Anglo-French initiative to  apply the principle of ``subsidiarity'' to laws which gave  Governments little flexibility.    Two key EC directives on water quality remain in force: one  aimed at reducing pollution from nitrates and another on urban  waste water treatment, which Mr. Clarke, Chancellor, said  recently would cost Britain 10 billion to implement  instead  of the original estimate of 2 billion.    According to Mr. Yeo, Environment Minister, water  bills--forecast to rise by up to 100 by the end of the  century in some areas--would now rise more slowly.    Mr. Major said other Governments were listing EC laws to  axe.  ``We are determined to maintain high standards, but we are  determined, too, to simplify European legislation, to make it  less intrusive and leave more room for national choice.''    However, officials stressed that the extent to which Britain  would be allowed to relax standards for drinking water was not  clear, as new directives had to be agreed in the spring.    ``We cannot repeal EC laws simply because we think the  standards are set too high,'' said one. ``The aim is to simplify  decision-making and meet the Maastricht Treaty requirements that  as much legislation as possible is conducted at national level  unless it can be shown that it would be more effective at EC  level.''    The cull of EC directives has been led by Mr. Major and Mr.  Clarke, against the advice of Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary,  who has said it would be politically unpopular to be seen  dismantling EC pollution controls.    Ministers argued yesterday that there would not be a fall in  Britain's standards.    Mr. Yeo said the Government would be using the new  flexibility to determine its own standards for drinking water,  incorporating the latest advice from the World Health  Organisation on relaxing the standard for some pesticides.  Britain provides water in excess of the present EC pesticides  standards to 14.5 million people. The WHO recommends, however, a  five-fold tightening of standards for lead, one of the most  toxic substances.    Mr. Yeo said: ``I see it as part of my job to protect  consumers against the extraordinary demands of some of the Green  lobbies, who have the Brussels bureaucrats totally in their  power and who are pressing ahead with demands for improvements  which have no scientific or medical basis at all.''    ``We do not want to waste money on things that have no  benefit to the consumer.''    Mr. Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, called the  legislative changes a disaster. ``This is a smokescreen for  saying the Government wants lower standards because they want  lower costs. What this represents is a major step away from the  fight against pollution.''    Mr. Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth,  said: ``The idea that the British Government can be trusted on  its own to ensure compliance with the highest standards to  protect the quality of our rivers or drinking water is a joke.''

The  Foreign Office said its order for ambassador Muhammad 'Uthman  Yasin to go was the ""inevitable consequence"" of Sudan's sticking  by its expulsion of British envoy Peter Streams.    Britain would not agree to the appointment of a successor to  Mr Yasin and there were no plans to choose a replacement for Mr  Streams. Sudan's decision to expel Mr Streams was sparked by  the Archbishop of Canterbury's visit to mainly Christian areas  in the rebel-controlled south of the country.    Today's response by the British Government followed a  meeting  between junior Foreign Office Minister Mark Lennox-Boyd and the  Sudanese Charge d'Affaires Abdurrahman Bakhit who was summoned  this morning. In a 15-minute showdown, Mr Lennox-Boyd asked the  Sudanese to reconsider their decision to expel Mr Streams, but  Mr Bakhit said his government had not altered its position.    A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Mr Lennox-Boyd said this  was a matter of considerable regret and disappointment. Under  the circumstances and in light of the wholly inadequate  explanation which the Sudanese had given for Mr Streams's  expulsion we decided to request the withdrawal of the Sudanese  ambassador, Mr Muhammad 'Uthman Yasin. Mr Yasin has 14 days  within which to leave the country.""    Mr Lennox-Boyd had concluded that the expulsion of Mr Yasin  was the ""inevitable consequence of the Sudanese government's  action,"" said the spokesman. But he added: ""The British  Government did not want, however, to see the situation  deteriorate further."" [passage omitted]    Britain had given Sudan until today to reverse its decision  to expel Mr Streams. But Abdullahi al-Azret, of Sudan's  embassy in Kenya, said today that the ambassador's expulsion  ""will not be reconsidered by Khartoum as the presence of such a  man in Khartoum cannot help our bilateral relations.""    Khartoum's move had followed Dr Carey's refusal to go to the  east African state as a guest of its government, saying it would  have restricted his freedom of movement. [passage omitted]     "

Mr Hurd also told the Scottish Conservative conference in Perth the government was determined to push ahead with its plan for a United Nations police force to protect Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. He dismissed Baghdad's objections to the UN proposal and added that it was 'difficult to imagine' that the government of Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, could fulfil all the conditions for the removal of sanctions. 'Only a new government will enable Iraq to be re-admitted to the community of nations,' he said. Mr Hurd's decision to focus on the three British hostages still held in Lebanon showed his concern to emphasise that the Foreign Office had not given up hope of securing their release. Britain looked to Iran to use its 'potentially decisive' influence to secure their release, Mr Hurd added. 'Relations between Britain and Iran have great potential, but will remain stunted for as long as Britons are held in Lebanon.' Diplomatic relations between London and Tehran were restored in 1990 after a two-year break. The two governments have not yet exchanged ambassadors, and Mr Hurd's comments yesterday suggested that Britain could not until the hostage issue was resolved. The foreign secretary said he was also demanding the re-lease of two Britons held in Iraqi jails.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT924-9761 ,"FT924-9761 _AN-CKEBPABIFT 921104   FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Boardrooms back strong links with Europe      By MICHAEL CASSELL   IF BRITAIN'S biggest companies had a vote in the Commons tonight, the endorsement of Mr John Major's pro-Maastricht motion would be beyond question. Although some of them have reservations about aspects of the treaty and look to the Edinburgh summit for clarification, any doubts are overcome by what is seen as the need for Britain to be in the mainstream of European political and economic development. Judging by the reaction of more than 50 of Britain's largest corporations, the blueprint for continuing development enshrined in the Maastricht treaty is not a cause for wild enthusiasm. But the consequences of being left on the sidelines are considered too bleak to contemplate. Many companies also believe that, whatever the difficulties, a Britain at the heart of Europe has a better chance of resolving them. Few businessmen share the apparent disinterest of Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive of Rank Organisation. He said he had not read the treaty and had no view on it, adding: 'I have no view about what they do in the Commons. I just get on with minding the store, if you don't mind.' Elsewhere, there may be confusion over the full implications of a treaty on which Mr John Major is staking so much but there is a recognition that the outcome of the debate will have a profound impact on Britain's prospects. Its ability to continue to act as a bridgehead for investment by non-EC companies operating in Europe is a particular source of concern. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, said that a 'stand-aside' Britain would risk losing its excellent record on inward investment. His view was shared by Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive of Rentokil. He said: 'Inward investment, particularly by the Japanese, would not be nearly so attractive if Britain was seen to be dragging its feet over Maastricht.' Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive of RTZ Corporation, said it was important to protect the UK's role as a magnet for inward investment. An anti-Maastricht vote would damage that reputation. Many companies also emphasise that the successful operation of the single market and of the subsequent initiatives contained in the treaty Maastricht are indivisible. The idea that Britain could continue as a successful trading partner while remaining outside the later stages of political and monetary union is widely dismissed. BAT Industries, the financial-services-to-tobacco group, said Britain would encounter serious difficulties in the single market if it failed to ratify the treaty. The company said: 'The treaty is a vital part of completing the single market. A single currency is the glue that will keep the single market together.' Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman of Pilkington, said Britain's industrial and commercial future demanded a Yes vote. 'Within the treaty, we can begin to address some of the problems resulting from uneven enforcement of directives and the occasionally erratic approach of the commission,' he said. Cadbury Schweppes said the completion of the single market was the most important aspect of EC development, but the Maastricht treaty had to be ratified if Britain was to extract maximum benefit from that market. One dissenting voice came from Willis Corroon, the insurance group, which backed full British participation in a common market but said that failure to back the Maastricht treaty would not necessarily lead to isolation from the rest of Europe. The company said that there was 'probably more than one way of going about' continuing to develop the EC. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, said a vote against the government would help to leave Britain 'isolated within Europe on an unknown course' which would harm its trading prospects. That view was echoed by Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames Water, which has ambitions to expand in Europe. He said: 'Not everything in Maastricht is ideal, but we do not want the country or our company to be isolated from the rest of the community.' Mr Richard Everitt, a director of BAA, the airports operator, said that if Maastricht was a code word for the UK playing a leading role in Europe, it had to be supported. He said: 'The vote is really on the role that Britain should play in Europe. Should we be in the centre of things or should we be sitting on the sidelines? We think it is very important that we are at the centre.' Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto, Cathy Milton, John Griffiths, Philip Rawstorne, Richard Evans and Richard Donkin.

Frustrated British officials admitted yesterday that India  was no nearer a decision, despite reports that the deal-worth up  to 1bn [trillion] pounds -- might be finalised during the visit  of Narasimha Rao. ""Would that it were true,"" said one official.  ""We'd like to say that it is true. But the evaluation process  in India is some way from completion.""    Indian sources made clear that Britain could not take for  granted a deal -- expected to be for 66 aircraft -- because of  any loyalty India might feel towards its former colonial rulers.  They said Britain was desperate to win the contract because  thousands of jobs depended on it and because of the Pergau dam  trade-for-arms debacle, which led Malaysia to scrap defence  purchases. But, one Indian source added: ""Pressure won't work.""    British officials insisted that they had not realistically  expected the deal to be finalised during the Rao visit. New  Delhi's slow and deliberate approach was both an expression of  Mr Rao's natural reluctance to be rushed into any decision and  of the ""new and mature"" Anglo-Indian relationship, whereby India  would make an objective choice about the best aircraft at the  lowest price.    On a visit to India 14 months ago John Major took a  representative of British Aerospace [BAe] to lobby for the deal.  As one Indian source said: ""Pressure did not work then and it  will not work now.""    An order would help to safeguard jobs at BAe's plants at  Brough, Humberside and Warton, Lancashire, and provide business  for suppliers such as Rolls-Royce. The rival French bid is for  Alpha jets, made by Dassault-Dornier. One official said the  problem was largely that the Indians were faced with almost  ""identical products at the same price.""    Indian press reports say the Hawk deal has already been  recommended by Indian Air Force experts. Some sources suggested  New Delhi was spinning out the contest because of what it  perceived as lack of political support from Britain over issues  such as Kashmir. ""If India gives them this contract there is  nothing left in its armoury,"" said one.    The Indian decision-making process goes back a number of  years. ""First there was the technical problem of whether they  could design and build their own planes,"" said one British  official. ""They decided not to. Then there was the decision as  to what kind of plane to buy from abroad. Then there was the  question of whether there is enough money in the budget. And  Manmohan Singh (the Finance Minister) cares a lot about the  budget deficit.""    British officials admit Mr Singh is ""an effective operator""  and say their faith in the successful liberalisation of the  Indian economy rests largely on his competence.    During Mr Rao's visit, General Electric signed a memorandum  of understanding on a 1bn [trillion] pound deal to build a power  station in Maharashtra state. British officials brushed aside  any parallels with the Pergau dam: ""You'd be hard pressed to  get Pergau into this,"" one said. ""It is not a dam; and the aid  budget for India has been stable for a number of years. We'd  dearly love to sell arms to the Indians, but it is not a case of  aid for trade.""     "

It  was reported that the ""Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48"" had  originally decided to send a total of 24 economic and trade  delegations to China this year with the aforementioned  high-level delegation comprising the chief executives of some  100 major British firms being the most important. The delegation  was originally scheduled to visit China in late September of  this year to promote the sale of UK-made technology and  equipment to China and was scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai,  the Three Gorges of the Chang Jiang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou,  and Shenzhen, as well as some other places in China. As Hong  Kong Governor Chris Patten has submitted the first part and  plans to submit the second and last part of his political reform  package to the Legislative Council in early March [as received]  and have them ratified for official enforcement this coming  July, the Chinese side is expected to react strongly to the  governor's decision. Thus, it would be inappropriate for  British business leaders to visit China under such an  ""atmosphere.""    Not long before, Bailiren [4101 4409 0088], president of the  ""Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48,"" had publicly accused John  Major's government of ignoring the views and jeopardizing the  interests of the UK business community, saying that the way in  which the government had handled the Hong Kong question had  undermined Anglo- Chinese trade relations, that the government  had failed to see the adverse effects of Chris Patten's  political reform package, and that it is not worthwhile for the  government to risk everything on Chris Patten's political reform  package. He also made it clear that the UK business community  would not give its support to Chris Patten, stating: ""We want  to see him removed from office; the sooner, the better.""    In the meantime, many of Britain's industrial associations  and chambers of commerce have also started demanding that John  Major's government take measures to remove the obstacles  hampering Anglo- Chinese relations and to explore ways to enter  the China market. At an annual meeting of the Birmingham  Chamber of Commerce held on 28 January, 1994, Mr. Carter,  chairman of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, told British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, one of his distinguished guests  at the occasion, that diplomats should make redoubled efforts to  promote foreign trade and support businessmen in expanding  exports to China. As the British Government's position on the  question of Hong Kong has already undermined Anglo-Chinese  relations, he added, some of the Anglo-Chinese economic  cooperation projects previously agreed upon by the two sides  were now in danger of being frozen or scrapped. Moreover, he  said, the UK business community will inevitably lose business  opportunities in China. Mr. Carter stressed that China is now  the biggest market in the world. [sentence as received] It  would be terribly wrong for Britain to shoot itself in the foot  and undercut its own competitiveness at this moment. Therefore,  he noted, the British Government should reexamine its policies.    At a large exhibition, entitled ""Hong Kong's Achievements,""  which was held two months ago, John Major was asked by more than  300 influential businessmen from all over the world how he  would, in his capacity as prime minister, try to protect the  interests of the British business community in Hong Kong and  China, as well as in Asia as a whole.    What merits attention is that China has repeatedly expressed  welcome to British businessmen and has invited them to invest in  and discuss trade. In fact, the total volume of Sino-British  trade reached $3.59 billion in 1993, up 86 percent over the  previous year, only slightly lower than the increases registered  in Sino-German trade and in the volume of trade between China  and some West European countries. Nonetheless, since Britain  has adopted an unfriendly and noncooperative attitude toward  China on the question of Hong Kong, Sino-British economic and  trade relations are bound to be adversely affected in the long  run. Beijing officials have already stated that the Chinese  side is unwilling to see this and should not be held responsible  for such a scenario.    UK officials and the business community concede that China  has thus far shown no signs of discriminating against the UK  business community. However, any country or region will try to  select firms from a friendly country as its business partners so  long as it can offer prices which are not higher and possesses  technology which is not inferior to those offered by firms from  other countries in the bidding process. Some UK newspapers,  including ""THE OBSERVER,"" ""THE DAILY TELEGRAPH,"" and ""THE SUN,""  have published commentaries, saying that Britain has  underestimated the indignation of China's local governments on  the question of Hong Kong, and the majority of China's imports,  worth about $700 billion in all, will be purchased by local  governments over the next seven years. Should Britain try to  encroach upon Chinese sovereignty and violate agreements reached  with China in the past on the question of Hong Kong, they asked,  how could Britain expect the Chinese to be friendly to it? They  argued that as Germany has entered the China market and France  has stopped arms sales to Taiwan in an attempt to restore  friendly relations with China and increase exports to China,  there is no reason for Britain not to do the same.

It argues that the country is 'not out of line' with other advanced western economies which have 'similar standards of living in terms of the stock of skills in the population'. The comparative study was carried out by Mr Peter Robinson. He found that only 35 per cent of the population lack recognised basic qualifications, which is much better than the average of 45 per cent for industrialised economies. The study shows, however, that Britain has a below-average proportion of the population who have been through higher education (16 per cent compared with an average of 19 per cent). But if non-university higher education is excluded, the proportion of the British population with university higher education, at 10 per cent, is similar to the average of member countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The report's findings appear to conflict with the widely-held view at the end of the 1980s that Britain had too few 16- and 17-year-olds in training or full-time education. But Mr Robinson argues that a 'transformation' has taken place since 1988. In the current academic year, 73 per cent of 16-year-olds were still in full-time education in the January after their exit from compulsory schooling. This compares with only 45 per cent in 1986-87. The report also points out that only an estimated 6 per cent to 8 per cent of 16-year-olds and 18 per cent to 19 per cent of 17-year-olds were in regular full-time jobs in 1993-94 with 12 per cent of both age groups in government-funded Youth Training. A 'worrying residual' were however, unemployed or inactive. Supply of Skills in Britain. Centre for Economic Performance Working Paper 618. London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2.

Foreign Minister Velayati referred to the dispute only indirectly and refused  to answer questions about Rushdie.

With the first stage of Maastricht's ""Europol"" due to be  formally opened in The Hague on Feb 16, disagreements have  broken out over the detail of the body's convention, due to be  signed this October.    But as the new, powerful and secretive K4 committee of  national interior ministry officials meets in Brussels, Britain  is preparing to enter vehement reservations.    Mr Anthony Langdon, Britain's representative, will tell his  colleagues Europol should remain strictly an  intelligence-swapping operation, similar to Interpol.    The prospect of ""federal agents"" from Germany or France  being  deployed in Britain is likely to cause uproar among Tory  Eurosceptics .    British sources last night said they did not want ""people in  uniforms"" being attached to Europol, let alone sent on missions.    Since its home was agreed at last October's Brussels summit,  the organisation has consisted of about 40 officers of different  EC nationalities, occupying rooms in the Dutch information  ministry. The total will rise to about 70 by the end of the year.    At present, Europol's sole task is to pool intelligence on  drug traffickers. Each of the seconded police and customs  officers remains primarily loyal to his own government, with  full discretion over whether to give out data to colleagues from  other EC countries.    The question now is whether to create a more fully federal  body, allowing all Europol operatives equal access to all  national data.    This would especially enrage the Danish government, which  has  strong secrecy laws, and almost certainly the British as well.    But the Germans and the EC Commission want to go further,  drafting the convention so that it allows for more direct action  by Europol.    ""If you are operating in a world where the police are not  stopped at the frontier, the best way to do it is to have a  Europolice force,"" said an EC source last night.     "

The American A4M Skyhawks would replace aircraft Argentina lost in 1982. On Friday, Brigadier Jose Julia, air force commander, announced his 'absolute conviction that before the end of the year we will see in our skies more, and better combat aircraft, which will replace those that remain forever in the South Atlantic.' US officials played down the importance of the proposed sale. First, they note the Skyhawks are obsolete, although the models being offered Argentina are the 'Cadillac' of the Skyhawk line. Secondly, they will not be supplied with weapons systems. Thirdly, Argentina would have to pay for them. Previous deliveries of non-lethal American military equipment were either financed or given away. There is no agreement on the number of Skyhawks Argentina would buy. American officials would only say Brig Julia's figure of 40 aircraft was exaggerated. One official added that Washington wanted to encourage the air force to reduce its 'mishmash' of French, Israeli and American aircraft in favour of US aircraft. The Argentines already fly Skyhawks, which played an important role in the Falklands. Britain reacted with equanimity, emphasising that Washington had discussed a possible sale with London. An official explained that the time was coming when Britain would have to accept that Argentina would upgrade its severely depleted arsenal. Resisting this would feed resentment and instability in the armed forces. Still, he doubted the underfunded air force could afford the aircraft, which would cost about Dollars 1.75m (Pounds 980,000) each.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, told other EC ministers in Brussels that he was against proposals to extend majority voting - as opposed to unanimous voting - to labour and social issues. Majority voting would prevent Britain, or any member state, from vetoing parts of the social policy programme and allow the EC a greater say in labour and social issues. 'It would be foolish to commit the community to policies in the social and employment field which involve potentially enormous costs without regard to growth,' Mr Hurd said. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said: 'I feel like someone who at the start of this century heard people say that the abolition of child labour would cause the general collapse of the economy.' The foreign secretary said Britain had dispelled the cloud of bad industrial relations that had long hung over it. 'We do not want any pretext for leading industry back into that situation,' he said. The UK has been the only opponent of the EC Social Charter but it appeared to come to terms with some of the legislation, such as written proof of contracts. On Monday, Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said in an interview with the Financial Times that Britain now supported most elements of the social char-ter. Mr Delors countered Mr Hurd's complaint that social matters would be subject to over-centralised regulation by saying that the commission was relying heavily on dialogue between European employers and trade union organisations. Other EC ministers re-sponded angrily to Mr Hurd's remarks. Mr Gianni De Michelis, the Italian foreign minister, warned that Britain could not hope to get away with vetoing the whole EC political union on social policy grounds alone. Mr Mark Eyskens, Belgian foreign minister, suggested that the UK might be left out of EC social policy-making. It is unlikely such a compromise would be acceptable to other member states which might complain that UK industry was escaping the costs of labour regulation. The Luxembourg presidency was proposing to extend majority voting to issues of contractual conditions of employment and management consultation of workers. Majority votes now apply only to measures to improve workers' health and safety, which generally have UK support. Under the Luxembourg plan, unanimous voting would only be retained for social security issues.

This conclusion emerges from the annual report of the governors of the 12 European central banks. It says interest payments as a proportion of income rose threefold in the UK during the 1980s, significantly more than in other major EC nations. In 1990 interest payments were at least twice as high in the UK, relative to income, as in other large European nations. 'It appears that efforts by households in the UK to strengthen their balance sheets by restraining expenditures and reducing debt have contributed to the weakness of (recent UK economic) activity,' the report says. According to the report, people's interest payments as a proportion of income in the UK came to about 10.5 per cent in 1990, up from 3.5 per cent in 1979. Ireland showed the next biggest rise in such payments, which rose from about 1 per cent to 2 per cent of income. In Germany, the equivalent ratio rose from 2 per cent to 3 per cent during the same period, while in France it went up from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. In Italy the ratio came down from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The EC nation with the next highest payments level after Britain in 1990 was Spain with a ratio of personal sector interest payments to income of about 4 per cent. The level of indebtedness by UK citizens, together with the prevalence in Britain of lending according to variable rather than fixed interest rates, 'suggests that household expenditures are likely to be relatively more responsive in the UK to changes in (official) interest rates,' the governors say.

He refused to speculate about the government's response to such an eventuality when agreeing that MPs should have a separate vote on the principle of the social chapter before the bill enacting the treaty in UK law takes effect. Mr George Robertson, Labour's spokesman on Europe, hailed the acceptance of a new clause providing for the separate vote as marking another 'government surrender' during the passage of the Maastricht legislation. He claimed that as a result a 'time-bomb was ticking away' under the government. Mr Robertson explained that Labour would use the opportunity provided by the separate vote to ask the House to instruct the government not to ratify the Maastricht treaty unless it agreed to accept the social chapter. He said the government would not be able to 'wriggle away' from such a challenge, and that those Conservative Euro-sceptics who had argued that the Maastricht treaty was unacceptable with or without the social chapter, would find themselves on the spot. Mr Hurd said the government had agreed to the separate vote on the principle of the social chapter because it believed its view would prevail. Refusing to answer hypothetical questions about the government's attitude in the event of the result going the other way he said 'we will take one step at a time'. In the course of a series of clashes with Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr Hurd repudiated the view of Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East, that Britain could be forced by her EC partners to adopt burdensome health and safety and other provisions even if it remained outside the social chapter. The foreign secretary insisted that Britain would resist such attempts and, if necessary, challenge them in the European Court of Justice. He stressed that the social chapter would 'substantially enlarge the risks' and by adding to the costs of commerce and industry make it still more difficult for Britain to compete with overseas countries, particularly Taiwan and South Korea. Mr Hurd maintained that acceptance of the social chapter would be like a householder who had already been burgled deciding to opt for an open door with a welcome mat. Mr Robertson said the people of Britain were entitled to the rights and protection which the social chapter provided. In the final speech from the Labour front bench Ms Joyce Quin complained that the foreign secretary had 'skated over' the implications of a government defeat on the social chapter. The committee stage, which occupied 163 hours extended over 23 days and included contributions by 161 MPs, was concluded.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

At the end of a two-day emergency debate, the House of Commons supported  government policy by a vote of 437 to 35, far higher than the 100-seat majority  Thatcher's Conservatives normally command in the 650-member chamber.

Shahidi: ""The Juggling of the Methuselah  of Imperialism""]    [Excerpts] In the wake of the diplomatic battles that began  between Iran and Britain with the summons of our charge  d'affaires to the British Foreign Office on Thursday [28 April],  the British mass media initiated a heavy political onslaught  against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [passage omitted]    One cannot know with certainty what diplomatic or propaganda  objectives are being pursued by the British, but certain issues  that could be considered close to the truth can be mentioned  regarding the current British-Iranian relations. The following  points may help in shedding light on the latest act of  politico-propagandistic blackmail by Britain:    1. Washington encountered defeat in disrupting financial  dealings between Iran and Japan as well as the European  countries, which resulted in its losing face on the  international level. Therefore, Britain in its capacity as the  European political pillar of the United States resorted to this  new politico-propagandistic blackmail to unite the Western front  against Iran. [passage omitted]    2. The contempt that Whitehall is sustaining in view of the  categorical stance of the Iranian leadership and government and  the British Government's pressure, which it tried to exert by  various means, has not been able to have the slightest effect on  Iran's stance on the Rushdie issue. [passage omitted]    3. The fact that the latest British propaganda coincided  with the session of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO]  contact group, especially on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  cannot be considered incidental.    It is no secret that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the  foremost proclaimer of the oppression of the Bosnian Muslims,  while the British Government is considered among those directly  to blame among the so-called civilized Western countries for  this situation. So far all the efforts to lift the embargo  against the Bosnian Muslims have been foiled by the government  of Great Britain! [passage omitted]    4. Despite our categorical denial of these accusations, and  while we consider ourselves innocent of any connection with the  internal crisis in Britain that stems from its domineering  policies, we cannot refrain from being amazed at the  double-standard approach of the West in general and Britain in  particular toward the same matter. How is it that the British  Government actively supports Iranian terrorist organizations  whose hands are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent  Iranian people and officials and there are overt contacts  between the leaders of these terrorist organizations and the  British officials? London endorses these meetings and contacts  without any qualms and considers them symbols of democracy, but  raises a hue and cry over the ""possibility"" of Iran's links with  the IRA. [passage omitted]    In our opinion, the latest British ploy stems from the  weakness and impotence of the Methuselah of 19th-century  colonialism in resolving its domestic crises and its sheer  helplessness in the face of the decisive stances of Iran, and it  is doomed to failure from the outset.    Thus, the Islamic Republic of Iran should adopt a more  aggressive politico-propagandistic policy and should rub the  nose of the British into the dust and show that country that  pursuing the policies of the arch-Satan will not benefit it.  Therefore, it is necessary that this old Methuselah of  colonialism should relinquish its melancholia [malikhowlia] and  learn that the protection of the boundaries of countries and  reciprocal respect in political relations is the primary  principle of wholesome diplomatic relations and the adoption of  a policy without dignity that resorts to political machinations  and false accusations cannot pressure a capable government to  change its stance.

British officials said they were confident that a resolution to impose sanctions, including a ban on air links and arms sales, would pass by a comfortable majority in the 15-member council. Mr Diego Arria, of Venezuela, president of the Council, said he proposed that there would be a formal debate on the issue tomorrow morning with private consultations taking place today. However, diplomats said the vote may await the initial stage of proceedings brought by Libya against the US and Britain at the International Court of Justice which open today at the Hague. Libya is where the two Lockerbie suspects should stand trial, and an injunction barring the US and Britain from pressing it to surrender the pair. The court's decision could take weeks, but the US, Britain and France have said they would not await its verdict before putting the sanctions resolution before the Security Council. The three had deferred pressing for such a vote after an Arab League mission visited Tripoli on Tuesday. There were suggestions Libya was prepared to hand the two suspects to the League, which would in turn make them available for trial in the US or Scotland. But the delegation reported on its return to Cairo that Libya was prepared to turn them over only under conditions unacceptable to Britain and the US. Arab diplomats said that Col Gadaffi and Mr Abdel Salam Jalloud, his number two, told the delegation that statements by Libya's ambassador to the UN suggesting an unconditional handover of the Lockerbie suspects were 'inaccurate'. Security Council members reacted with disappointment and even anger to the repudiation of the deal, with UK officials branding it 'obfuscation and prevarication'. Libya would be given 'a few days' to hand over the two men. The US last night accused Libya of 'perfidy' in reneging on its offer to surrender the alleged bombers. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate at the UN, said it was clear the Libyans were not about to hand over the accused men to Britain or the US. ABC news of the US, a television news service, and journalist Mr Pierre Salinger were ordered yesterday by the High Court in London to hand over to British police video footage and sound recordings of interviews with the two Libyans charged in connection with the Lockerbie bombing, PA reports. Two judges dismissed their challenge to a production order made at Middlesex Crown Court under anti-terrorist laws earlier this month and gave them until noon today to hand over the tapes. ABC and Mr Salinger, its London-based chief foreign correspondent, had asked the judges to quash the 'unlawful and unreasonable' order made by Judge Clarkson on the grounds that it was too wide-ranging and they had not been told the reasons relied on by Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch for obtaining it. Mr Salinger visited the two Lockerbie suspects, Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, in Libya shortly after they were indicted in the US last November for an alleged conspiracy to blow up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie. Mr Salinger warned the ruling could change ABC's policy on keeping material.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Today Britain takes over as president of the Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page pull-out FT writers assess the prospects BRITISH diplomats may have long lost an empire to run, but every few years they get a superpower, albeit a rather odd one, to manage for six months. Britain has always been the great enthusiast for foreign policy co-ordination among the Twelve. The reasons are simple. Britain, like France, tends to see EC foreign policy as an extension of its own. The overriding British interest has been to keep foreign policy co-ordination an informal affair between consenting foreign ministries, as far as possible out of the clutches of EC institutions like the Commission and the parliament. Feeling comfortably closeted over the past 20 years within this inter-governmental system, known as European Political Co-operation (EPC), Britain has pushed for maximum co-ordination. In 1980 it urged extending EPC to security issues. In 1984 it got EPC to list the areas in which diplomats of the Twelve and of the EC based in third countries should pool information. In 1985 Britain championed a tightening of foreign policy co-ordination, an initiative which snowballed into the Single European Act. There is an irony to some of these initiatives. Britain is suspected by its partners of refusing to put sensitive information on the Coreu telex network which links the foreign ministries of the Twelve. It also has a reputation for not freely pooling information with EC partners in some capitals. But, in general, Britain is keen to stretch inter-governmental co-operation in foreign policy to the utmost, so as to avoid demands by some of its partners for action through Community machinery. Such demands were largely fended off in the Maastricht treaty, with one exception. Although the treaty's 'pillar' on a common EC foreign and security policy is firmly inter-governmental, it provides for the (very communautaire) possibility that implementing measures can be decided by majority verdict. The Foreign Office - from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, on down - firmly believes this to be a nonsense. Thus, for example, one should expect no real UK presidency pressure for Greece to be outvoted on the issue of recognising Macedonia. The Maastricht treaty has led to certain changes which may live on even if the pact fails to be ratified. The EPC co-ordinating unit in Brussels is to be expanded from six to 23, and merged with the Council of Ministers secretariat. The UK also plans that political directors of the Twelve should start from this November holding their monthly meetings in Brussels, rather than in the capital of the presidency country. The idea is that political directors (senior foreign ministry officials from each member country) should have more input into foreign ministers' meetings. Mr Hurd also intends these meetings to be more businesslike. At present, general foreign policy issues tend to be discussed over lunch, with no papers prepared or officials present; confusion often results. Of course, most of the EC's impact on the outside world is still in the arena of the Community's trade and economic business. In so far as the deadlock in the Gatt talks is the result of the EC's failure to translate the price and subsidy cuts in its farm reform speedily into concessions in Gatt, the UK presidency has almost certainly come too late. For, President George Bush has no time for anything from now until polling day in November but to lock electoral horns with Messrs Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. But there will still be plenty else to test British diplomatic skills this autumn - the negotiation of the pan-European energy charter, getting the new Europe accords with central European states off to a good start, and, of course, paving the way for a beginning to entry negotiations for Efta countries.

0,FT931-11190 ,"FT931-11190 _AN-DBDCDAC9FT 930204   FT  04 FEB 93 / Social dumping - hardly an open and shut case: The arguments about switching jobs between countries are not so simple      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor   THOMSON Consumer Electronics, the state-owned French group, last year rationalised its European operations by closing its Ferguson television plant in Gosport, southern England, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs. The event scarcely merited a mention at the time on either side of the Channel. But some British trade unionists are now recalling it, as the acrimonious dispute over the transfer of work from Hoover's plant in eastern France to Scotland rumbles on. This sort of cross-channel sniping reflects how completely relations between British and French unions have broken down. But it also illustrates the difficulty facing unions in dealing with the ebb and flow of jobs across the European Community as a wave of recession-induced restructuring begins. Following the British opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter, and the subsequent devaluation of sterling, many continental European workers and politicians fear that capital will be sucked into the 'Hong-Kong of Europe' at their expense. The propaganda material of Britain's inward investment agencies certainly stresses the relative freedom of Britain's 'hire and fire' workplace culture and the relatively low labour costs. But the reality is that neither the opt-out nor the devaluation were factors in Hoover's decision to shift some jobs to Scotland. Britain has always had a relatively unregulated labour market which used to be qualified by strong trade unions, now considerably weakened. British wages are also low by EC standards, but the real advantage enjoyed by the UK is low non-wage labour costs. These are usually about 15 per cent of wage costs compared with more than 50 per cent in many other EC countries. That is partly because the UK pays for health care through general taxation while employers have to bear a large part of health care costs in several continental countries. This clearly was just one factor in Hoover's decision but it is not something that the social chapter directly affects. Mr William Foust, president of Hoover Europe, said yesterday that non-wage labour costs of only 10 per cent in Scotland, compared with 45 per cent in France, was a factor in the company's decision. But the decision was also influenced by the fact that the Scottish plant had spare capacity. Hoover's decision is unlikely to herald any significant increase in Britain's comparative advantage. It is based on long-established factors which Hoover, a particularly footloose US investor in Europe, has often found attractive in the past. Britain has always been the most popular destination for new international investment within the EC (see chart) and that has not changed markedly in recent years. Until German car workers started to worry about the Japanese car industry investing in Britain, new international investment had not been the source of much tension, and is unlikely to be much of an issue over coming years as that new investment will not be plentiful. On 'beggar-my-neighbour' industrial restructuring within the EC, where one country loses jobs and another gains them, things are more complex. But as the Thomson Electronics case illustrates, Britain has often lost out in such restructuring precisely because it is easier and cheaper to close plants in Britain than in most EC countries. In the Thomson case at Gosport the average redundancy payment was Pounds 7,000 compared with Pounds 47,000 in Spain. In Holland, Spain, and Germany agreement on a redundancy package has to be reached with workplace representatives before closure is allowed. If, for example, British Leyland Daf decides to keep open its Belgian and Dutch plants and close only its British plant, as seemed possible yesterday, that differential cost of redundancy is likely to be a factor. Britain also loses out from its relatively low skill base and poor educational standards, one reason behind Ford's decision to switch more of its RD work to Germany. The 'social dumping' theory that capital will flow to areas where labour is cheapest and least protected, dragging down labour standards elsewhere, has scarcely materialised in the EC because low wages are usually cancelled out by low productivity.

The 15-point declaration, to be converted into a treaty later this year and including an agreement by Britain to give extra economic assistance to Russia, was signed in Downing Street by Mr John Major, the in, the Russian president. Mr Yeltsin was making a stopover in Britain on his way to New York for today's United Nations Security Council summit. Mr Major, during four hours of 'warm and friendly' talks, made it clear to Mr Yeltsin that Britain would not cancel or reduce its Trident nuclear weapons programme, which represented a minimum 'credible deterrent'. Although it had been suggested previously that Mr Yeltsin would put pressure on Britain to reduce its nuclear weapons in line with the latest US and Russian proposals to cut strategic arms, the Russian leader proved to be surprisingly accommodating. Mr Yeltsin said he respected the British government's decision, adding: 'The number of nuclear weapons at the disposal of the UK is not comparable with ours and therefore the matter is not really worth any discussion.' In spite of Mr Major's declared intention to go ahead with the Trident programme, the Russian leader announced on the steps of Downing Street that Russian missiles would no longer be targeted at Britain, echoing a similar undertaking he has already given to the US. Mr Major said in a toast at a working lunch in Downing Street that the visit, the first to Britain by Mr Yeltsin as Russian leader, had turned 'a new page in history'. The joint declaration, 'Partnership in the Nineties', was an indication that co-operation had replaced confrontation in Europe, 'we hope for ever'. The extra UK economic assistance for Russia and other members of the new Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) pledged in the declaration is in addition to financial and food aid it has already provided. The UK would make available Pounds 280m in new export credits and investment insurance for Russia and the other CIS republics, in the context of an International Monetary Fund programme, Mr Major said. The UK, the first country to propose Russian membership of the IMF, would also press for Russia to be admitted to the organisation by April. It would also make an improved European Community trade and co-operation agreement with Russia one of the priorities of the next UK presidency of the EC, which starts in July this year. In the defence field, the UK has agreed to co-operate with the Russians in handling surplus former Soviet nuclear weapons and safeguarding nuclear materials. Britain has also agreed to help in the restructuring of the former Soviet armed forces and Mr Major announced that Ministry of Defence officials might be sent on secondment to Russia's defence ministry. Mr Major said he and Mr Yeltsin had agreed on further discussions on how the UK could help Russia 'to use the talents of their scientists in the cause of peaceful development'. The two leaders had agreed to set up a 'hot line' between their offices to facilitate their new relationship and agreed on the opening of new British and Russian consulates in St Petersburg and Edinburgh. Mr Yeltsin said he had accepted an invitation to make an official visit to Britain in the first half of this year and Mr Major is to visit Moscow in the second half.

According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS  [expansion unknown], on Saturday 26 March, 90 tons of toxic  chemical waste were loaded from the U.S. Incirlik Air Base in  Turkey. The chemicals were loaded in five large containers and  a smaller one and were taken to the port of Mersin escorted by  three vehicles, two American and one of the Turkish police.    The travelling documents say ""toxic chemical waste destined  for Britain for processing and destruction.""    According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS (SOS  Akedeniz), at the Mersin port the containers were loaded aboard  the Europetrader, flying the Bahamas flag, which sailed at 2000  on Saturday for Izmir. The ship was expected to reach Izmir  last night.    SOS Akedeniz asked to inspect the cargo before the ship  sailed from Mersin. However, the authorities refused on the  grounds that ""Turkey did not have the necessary uniforms and  equipment to open and check the containers,"" which do not have  any information about the material inside them.    The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS contacted the Turkish  chapter and was informed that ""the cargo could be radioactive  waste that will not reach Britain but will possibly be dumped  somewhere in the Mediterranean.""    This view is enforced by the path of Europetrader, which  instead of sailing for Britain left for Izmir. The above was  told to ELEVTHEROTIPIA by the Greek chapter of Mediterranean  SOS, which asked the Ministry of Merchant Marine to continuously  follow the ship's path to prevent it from dumping the dangerous  waste in the sea.    The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS also asked the  Ministry of Merchant Marine to be in continuous contact with  authorities of other Mediterranean countries, as is required by  the international accords on the transportation of dangerous  waste.    Nikolaos Khrisoyelos, member of the Greek chapter of  Mediterranean SOS, said that now that Greece is presiding over  the European Union it should act decisively to prevent the  transfer of dangerous waste, ""especially under conditions that  do not provide for inspection and clarity in the transportation  of these dangerous wastes.""

In a hard-hitting speech to the development committee of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank he also said Britain would only be prepared to give assistance to east European countries that maintained democratic institutions and respect for human rights. He said the IMF and World Bank should put more pressure on countries they were helping with economic reform programmes to avoid excessive spending on arms. Mr Lamont said that EC farm support was 'spiralling upwards' in the wake of rising production and surplus stocks. The CAP was again imposing severe strains on Community finances and taxpayers in addition to the substantial costs borne by EC consumers through high food prices. He said the dumping of European farm surpluses on foreign markets was damaging many agricultural producers in the developing world. It was 'nonsensical' that richer nations should give financial aid to eastern Europe and third world nations at the same time as frustrating their efforts to export the goods and agricultural products which the aid had helped them to produce. Mr Lamont called on fellow finance ministers to back Britain's proposals to ease the debt burden of the poorest developing nations. He said he hoped the Paris Club of creditor nations would develop a practical package of measures incorporating the main elements of the so-called Trinidad terms. These terms, first proposed by Britain last autumn, envisage creditor countries writing off two thirds of the official debt owed by very poor and insolvent developing nations that are implementing economic reforms and stretched out repayment terms for the debt that would remain.

0,FT924-12684 ,"FT924-12684 _AN-CJTB8ABVFT 921020   FT  20 OCT 92 / Twelve in accord on minimum VAT rates      By ANDREW HILL   EC FINANCE ministers last night formally agreed to bring in legally binding minimum rates of value added tax and excise duties across the Community, ending four years of negotiation. Britain, which holds the EC presidency, and the European Commission hailed the long-awaited agreement as a large step towards the establishment of an efficient barrier-free European market after January 1 1993. Ministers came close to a formal accord in July, when they agreed in principle to fix a legally binding minimum EC-wide VAT rate of 15 per cent until 1996 and minimum duties on a range of other products including tobacco, alcohol and heating oils. But the package of eight directives had been held up since then by some member states' objections to specific parts of the deal. The agreement will leave VAT rates unchanged in most EC countries. In Britain it is 17.5 per cent. But without an accord, EC members might have been tempted to keep border controls as security against unilateral changes in VAT rates by neighbouring states, aimed at attracting cross-border shoppers. Unanimous agreement on the package was in the balance until late last night, as Britain and Spain argued for three hours about the tax treatment of sherry in the UK. Spain was unhappy about differing excise duties applied to Spanish and British sherry. The UK product has a lower alcohol content and consequently a lower duty. But Britain last night agreed to narrow the differential between the two products from 43 per cent to 25 per cent by 1996.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year. Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However, the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to be invited to London soon. The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries. Mr Di Tella will sign a new one-year fishing agreement.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     ARZ  Argentina, South America.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT934-7147 ,"FT934-7147 _AN-DKUAIAFJFT 931120   FT  20 NOV 93 / As They Say in Europe: Strange days for Social Chapter      By JAMES MORGAN      THE ROLE of Britain in Europe   I bet that puts you off - could be changing. From enfant terrible to bete noire, it may now be on its way to eminence grise. These thoughts were inspired, if that is the word, by this week's annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry and the reflections of the London correspondent of Liberation, Julien Lefranc. 'Not European, the British? The cliche has to be adjusted,' he wrote. Now, the CBI has not usually been regarded as one of great engines of change that drives British society and Lefranc took care not to let anybody think it was. He just took, as a symbol of British reality, the marked preference for a single currency in the European Union which was expressed by business leaders in a CBI survey. Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, spoke of wanting to avoid a situation 'where there was a single currency over there and Ukrainian coupons here.' That, said Lefranc, was a demonstration of pragmatism: the CBI recognised that it could export more if it operated in a single currency area. This was contrasted, not with the views of the government, but with those of the City of London. For the City 'Black Wednesday,' when sterling had been ejected from the ERM, 'had been regarded as a personal victory by many London financiers and investors.' The event had saved a vast foreign exchange market which brought them large profits. But in fact, the paper concluded, these were marginal matters. The City was not really against industry on matters European; it was firmly in the European camp, for the Community provides a 'plus for Britain.' So, rather disappointingly, the paper concluded, there was no real debate in Britain about Europe. Any differences today are mere nuances. And Jacques Delors should rejoice. So much for an article that started out with such promise. But you can see why the situation in Britain might be regarded as somewhat more placid than we had suspected. So maybe the British are more European than they think. If one removes the theatrical, even hysterical, element which plays such a large part in domestic political debate, the basis of that debate is hardly different from anything in France or Germany: the role of the nation in a wider union, the problems of achieving a single currency and whether it can be done at all. But there is still the Social Chapter, a classic example of the divide between Britain and the rest, and of how things can get out of hand. The British take this component of the Maastricht treaty at more than its face value. But Article 1 consists of banalities about improved living and working conditions, with a nod at their diverse meanings in different member countries. Article 2 says the Council of Ministers can agree on what might be done to further those aims. In Europe this is all symbols and horse-trading, as well as a reflection of certain aspects of industrial management that have proved quite successful. But the British government, and in this it has the full support of employers, refuses to have anything to do with any of this. The Social Chapter is meaningful and it means higher costs. So no British minister of civil servant will play any role in its development and implementation. But the Labour Party supports it. One day maybe a Labour government may sign up to the social chapter; by that time it will have taken on a character that may be contrary to Britain's interests. Undoubtedly, whatever happens, Britain will follow the iron rule that has guided all post-war policy towards Europe: whatever the organisation, whatever the system, the British must join at the wrong time. However, there is just one curious difference in the present situation. When it comes to discussing and voting on the implementation of the Social Chapter, British members of the European Parliament will not be excluded. They can therefore vote on matters from which British ministers are excluded. This fact is only now starting to sink in Europe and has caused alarm in Paris. It should not for, as it happens, Labour has, and presumably will continue to have, a majority among MEPs and will vote with other 'socialists.' So the Social Chapter will benefit from the input of the official opposition in Britain but not from that of the British government. Now that is what makes the British different, not real Europeans. No other government hands its opponents free gifts like that. When others press for a ban on British Euro-MPs participating in votes on the Social Chapter, will the British government show its Euro-credentials by taking the lead in that campaign? No, I was wrong, the British are not eminences grises, but wise fools, idiots savants. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Aliyev is  currently on an official visit to Great Britain at the  invitation of the British Government.    Aliyev said that on Tuesday, he had talks with  representatives of different British companies and British  entrepreneurs. On Wednesday, Aliyev met with British Prime  Minister John Major. ""The talks were held in a friendly  atmosphere and I believe that they were a success,"" Aliyev said.    During the talks the sides signed a number of bilateral  documents, and the most important is a declaration on friendship  and cooperation between the two countries.    Aliyev pointed out that it was the first visit of the Azeri  president to Great Britain. ""We attach great importance to the  visit since we look upon Great Britain as a country which has a  great political weight on in the international arena,  long-standing traditions and which plays an important role in  the world economy,"" Aliyev said.    The Azeri president called upon British and international  companies to develop mutually advantageous cooperation with  Azerbaijan, which possesses not only oil, but other valuable  mineral resources.    The Azeri president promised to give investment guarantees  from the Azeri Government and the president. Aliyev pointed out  that Azerbaijan had given up Communist ideology, socialist  economy adding that there would be no return to the past.    The Azeri president said that it is ready to develop  relations of equality with all countries, attaching special  importance to relations with neighboring countries. ""We have  normal relations with Russia, Turkey, Iran, Georgia,"" the Azeri  president said.    Aliyev paid particular attention to the armed conflict  around  Nagorno-Karabakh. He accused Armenia of aggressive intentions.  ""However, we have not taken an aggressive and intolerant stand  and believes that the two neighboring countries can live in  peace and accord as it was in the recent past. Azerbaijan  firmly abides by the principle of the peaceful solution of the  conflict and believes that the United Nations and the U.N.

0,FT934-11804 ,"FT934-11804 _AN-DJ2DCADTFT 931029   FT  29 OCT 93 / It will not go away: Major must satisfy two audiences      By PHILIP STEPHENS   It is a summit that Mr John Major would rather do without. Maastricht is not a treaty that his battered government has any cause to celebrate. Instead, in the words of one senior minister, the UK prime minister would like Europe simply 'to go away for a while'. He has problems enough at home without reopening the raw wounds in the Conservative party over European integration. So as foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd put it this week, Britain will be seeking to persuade its European partners not to treat as a 'passport to paradise' the creation of the European union enshrined in Maastricht. In the familiar language of British pragmatism, Mr Major and Mr Hurd will urge their counterparts to refocus the Community's gaze on the realities facing its citizens: jobs, economic growth and the need for a new world trade agreement. Mr Major has found it difficult to disguise his understandable satisfaction at the roadblocks placed on the road to European union by economic recession and disarray in the European exchange rate mechanism. In Number 10 Downing Street yesterday, senior officials were speaking with open contempt at the notion that Britain's more federally minded partners should seek today to reinstate the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union. The prime minister himself has dismissed the hope of a single currency by the end of the century as one having 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency'. He can claim that the debate in Europe has started to go Britain's way. Of the UK's priorities, enlargement is seen as inevitable, competitiveness treated as a serious issue, and the Gatt trade deal has the support of all member states bar France. But the confident Euro-scepticism that has crept into Mr Major's rhetoric as Germany, France and the other more federalist EC states have scaled down their integrationist aspirations is far from universally shared in Whitehall. Appeasing the anti-Brussels right of the Conservative party will not win the prime minister friends in Europe. Nor will it further his aim of keeping Britain at the centre of the debate over Europe's post-Maastricht future. Mr Hurd has set out the UK's aims in a less triumphalist tone. Acutely aware of the price paid by Britain for isolation during much of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's premiership, the foreign secretary said this week: 'There was a time when we didn't find it easy to have a running, continuous dialogue with our partners. Now it's easier and that's an important gain.' But he was in no doubt that the greater 'realism' displayed by other EC governments after the traumas of Maastricht ratification and the near break-up of the ERM would not curb, in the long-term, their ambitions to make a reality of economic and political union. By tonight Mr Major may well have been forced to concede that the European Monetary Institute, the first step towards economic union, should be set up alongside the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. So the government is aware that its disdain for Emu must be accompanied by a determined effort to give substance to the intergovernmental pillars of co-operation - in foreign and judicial policy - enshrined in Maastricht. If Britain is to press the case for a Europe of nation states, co-operation between governments must be seen to work. Mr Major's problem is that he remains perched uncomfortably between two audiences. The recalcitrant right in the Conservative party demands the impossible: that the government turn back the clock of European integration to a golden age that never was, when Britain decided its own destiny. The UK's partners insist that, if their immediate ambitions have been curbed by the chill wind of economic reality, their federalist dreams have not. Sadly for Mr Major, Europe will not go away.

LONDON'S MESSAGE TO  IRAQ'S HUSSEIN: HE WILL LOSE.      By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LONDON      In its largest deployment of tanks and artillery since World War II, Britain  announced Friday that it is sending a full armored brigade to Saudi Arabia as a  message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that ""one way or the other he will  lose.""    ""Iraq's evil aggression must be reversed,"" Defense Secretary Tom King said in  announcing the decision to deploy the famed 7th Armored Brigade.    It includes 120 Challenger main battle tanks, more than 6,000 ground troops, a  field artillery regiment with 155-millimeter self-propelled guns, an armored  infantry battalion equipped with scores of armored cars and tanks, and  accompanying squadrons of attack and patrol helicopters.    The move is the largest single military contribution to the multinational force  opposing Iraq after that of the United States. King told reporters he hoped it  would lead other Western European countries to consider making a similar  commitment.    King emphasized that Britain, while it favors a peaceful settlement of the  crisis, is fully prepared to join in an allied military operation against Iraq  if the U.N. sanctions fail to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.    Britain decided to increase its military commitment, he said, because ""now,  clearly, there is a case for reinforcement.""    The armored brigade will join three squadrons of jet fighters, 12 warships and  3,000 ground personnel that Britain already has in the gulf region. King said  it is meant ""to make it quite clear to Saddam Hussein . . . that one way or  another they will have to leave Kuwait, and that they better do it sooner than  later.""    King made it clear that deployment of the 7th Brigade, the ""Desert Rats"" of the  North African campaign in World War II, will take weeks or months to complete.  Just the voyage out to Saudi Arabia will take three weeks, he said.    The logistics are further complicated by the fact that the Royal Navy does not  have the ships to transport the brigade. King said the government will hire  ships, but defense analysts in London said that many such vessels have already  been hired by the U.S. military.    ""I just can't answer that at the moment,"" the defense secretary said when asked  to be more specific about the timing of the operation. He appealed to the media  ""to appreciate the scale of the operation.""    King was questioned closely about the cost of Britain's commitment to the gulf  campaign. Last week he told the House of Commons that Britain was spending $2  million a day, in addition to an initial outlay of $150 million for deployment,  on its fighter and naval squadrons and limited ground forces. The new force, he  said, will raise the maintenance cost to at least $4 million a day.    So far, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's firm stand against Iraq's conquest  of Kuwait has received strong public and political support. Opinion polls have  shown a steady increase in the popularity of both the prime minister and her  Conservative Party.    Even the opposition Labor Party has given Thatcher its backing in the gulf  crisis. Labor leader Neil Kinnock said Thursday that ""we now have a noose  around Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and that noose must stay tight.""    The gulf crisis has become a highly emotional issue here.

It will also embarrass the Labour Party which, a spokesman  said, favoured adopting the constitution as a basis for  discussion but did not endorse all its provisions.    The document, if adopted, would commit Britain to abandoning  border controls; accepting majority voting on foreign policy;  ending the system of rotating EC presidencies, and accepting  vast increases in the power of the European Parliament -- where  Britain holds only 15 percent of the seats.    The constitution was proposed by Mr Fernand Herman, a member  of Belgium's Centre-Right Social Christian Party, and draws  support from much of the European People's Party (EPP), the  loose grouping to which Tory Euro-MPs belong.    Mr Leo Tindemans, the Belgian leader of the EPP, said  yesterday that he favoured adopting the constitution as a basis  for discussion.    But all 32 Conservative Euro-MPs are committed to voting  against it, in the latest rift between the pro-federalist  parties of Europe and the British contingent, whose future in  the EPP group is far from secure.    A vote on a resolution which ""approves this constitution as  a  basis for wider discussions"" and commits Parliament to circulate  it among EC officials and member governments is expected to take  place later today. It is likely to go through. But the chances  of the constitution ever being adopted are remote.    The details are, however, a good guide to thinking among the  Christian Democrat partners of the Conservative Party.    Many of the ideas are likely to surface in the run-up to  1996, when government heads are due to decide the next stages in  the integration of Europe.    Enthusiasts for federalism pointed out yesterday that the  Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty both had their  genesis in a similar kite-flying exercise by the Euro-Parliament  10 years ago.    British Conservative Euro-MPs and officials have reacted in  horror to some of the constitution's provisions. The proposals  that most offend Britain's notions of sovereignty are:    The EC's unelected and barely accountable bureaucracy would  have the sole right to suggest foreign and security policy  initiatives to the European Commission. These would then go to  an EC vote and need only be adopted by a majority. At the  moment, votes must be unanimous, giving Britain an effective  veto, which would disappear.    The European Parliament would have the sole right to elect  the Commission president, a job which M Jacques Delors, the  incumbent, has shown to be perhaps the most powerful in Europe.  That decision currently rests with member states.    The Euro-Parliament would have the right to initiate  constitutional reforms.    It would compel Britain to elect its Euro-MPs by a ""common""  European system -- inevitably a form of proportional  representation.    It would replace the rotating EC presidency with a system of  renewable one-year appointments, which would go to a vote by  member states. This could lead to indefinite exclusion for some  countries.    It would give the Parliament the right to veto any treaty  concluded by the EC.    Meanwhile, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC's information  commissioner, revealed details of the Commission's new freedom  of information policy, whose produres, he claimed, will allow  the release of 99 percent of documents placed before the  Commission.    The procedures will be in place by the end of the month.  However, sceptics doubt that they will work well in practice,  noting that last year the Commission adopted a code of practice  which allows it almost unlimited discretion to refuse disclosure  of internal documents.

Mr Henning Christophersen, Commission vice president, said  that after leading Europe in 1994 Britain was likely to  underperform its main Continental rivals in 1995.    The commission has raised its expectations for Europe and is  now looking for overall growth of 16 per cent this year and 2.5  per cent in 1995. The new forecasts came as the German  Bundesbank announced an unexpected half point cut -- to 4 per  cent -- in its key discount rate, thereby underpinning the  optimism about European growth.    The forecast for the British economy is being cut to 2.3 per  cent next year, down from an original 2.7 per cent and below  Government projection for this year of 2.5 per cent growth.    However, the commission's pessimism is not shared by the  majority of independent economists in Britain. They believe  that as consumer spending slows, the momentum of the economy  will be maintained through higher exports and rising levels of  investment.    This view is supported by a Confederation of British  Industry  survey which yesterday revealed that exports have become a key  factor in the revival of industry.    All eleven regions of the country are now benefiting from  higher order levels, the first time this has happened for five  years, the survey reveals.    A slowdown in consumption would not be unwelcome to the  authorities. Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of  England, said last night that steady and sustained growth would  be preferable to the kind of booms of the past which would lead  to an inevitable bust.    Speaking in the City, Mr George said: ""If we are patient, we  now have the best opportunity that I can recall to achieve  continuing, steady expansion that can be sustained through much  of the rest of the decade. Now I know that some people say,  `That's all very well, but it still doesn't feel much like a  recovery. Demand is not like it was in the boom; house prices  are not going up much; and I still don't feel much better off.'    ""But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid the  excesses of the late 1980s, which felt wonderfully good in the  short-term, but which were the root cause of the misery that  followed.""    A survey from the Institute of Directors, due out today,  will  also report the most significant increase in orders, business  volume and profits since the start of the recovery. The picture  of an economy which is still gathering momentum was underlined  yesterday by figures showing an increase in manufacturing output  of 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year -- the fastest  quarterly growth rate since 1989.    Recovery in Europe would be welcomed by British businesses  which have been struggling to increase sales on the Continent  despite a competitive pound. Surveys suggest that the  improvement in the European economy has already had a beneficial  impact on export orders in Britain.    The commission's forecasts are not all negative. Britain's  borrowing requirement is expected to go on falling, to well  below the EC average next year, as will its unemployment rate.  It calculates that unemployment in Britain will fall to 9.3 per  cent in 1995, compared to 9.5 per cent in Germany, 11.4 per cent  in France and 11.7 per cent in Italy.    Mr Christophersen said: ""The recovery in all EC countries is  stronger than we had thought... the only exception is the UK.""     "

But ought is a big word. Today, tickets go on sale for Britain's first national lottery since 1826: a world-class tombola (the first draw is on Saturday) which is likely to gush geysers of cash for various good causes and to spread happiness throughout the land. And today, by coincidence, the first fare-paying passengers are due to step aboard high-speed Eurostar trains for the start of services linking Britain to continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel. Two grand projects. Fun and cheer for all. A lottery which is expected to become one of the world's biggest, and a macro-engineering coup that will anchor Britain a little more securely to its European neighbours at a time when Europe's centre of gravity is drifting eastward. Yet in Britain there is only tepid celebration. Instead, a fit of mockery is waiting to burst forth if either of these great projects fluffs its debut. In theory, accidents or cock-ups are unlikely to afflict the lottery. Lotteries are easy to establish, simple to operate. You turn on the tap; out comes the money. But the Channel Tunnel represents state-of-the-art macro-construction at the tail-end of the 20th century  - complex, sophisticated and a devourer, to date, of mountains of investors' money. In Britain, the approach to today's start of commercial Eurostar services has been signalled by an escalation of chortling and whingeing  - scare stories about safety; further criticisms of the financial predicament of Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French private-sector company which designed, financed, built and will operate the tunnel; and gleeful accounts of 'embarrassing' breakdowns and faults. However, most of this will have been water off a duck's back to Sir Alastair Morton, 56, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and the man who has carried the weight of Eurotunnel controversies since 1987. He was born in Johannesburg, educated in South Africa and at Oxford University (law), and then joined De Beers, the diamond monopoly. After that his career included the World Bank, the British National Oil Corporation and financial group Guinness Peat. Morton has always been renowned for his toughness and 'frightening belligerence' - qualities no doubt essential when dealing with governments, banks, contractors and rail companies while breathing life into a project like the tunnel, but ones that do not reveal themselves across the lunch-table. He exudes forcefulness and confidence - not a man to interrupt  -though he can be curiously softly-spoken, so that you have to lean forward. I met him at Luigi's, an Italian restaurant he likes because he can walk there from his central London office. He was late. He apologised. I said it was not a problem; his secretary had rung the restaurant. He had been delayed, he explained, by the media. There had been a leak about something in Paris which was causing movement in the share price. 'I had to calm things down.' I asked him whether he had had his fill of journalists. He smiled through bared teeth. 'Yes,' he said, 'you could say I was pretty fed up with the press. Not that I take it personally. It's the tunnel, of course. It's big and it's assertive and it satisfies the need in Britain - in fact it's an English thing - to mock, a need to express contrariness. 'It has always been that way. England's national motto is: 'There'll be trouble if you do that'. The exception was North Sea oil, but that was because it involved American oilmen. The ability of Eurotunnel to make money has always been questioned, but only by the City of London. 'I have got used to the fact that adverse or negative news affecting Eurotunnel is seized upon, whereas what might prove to be good news - such as improved traffic forecasts - gets virtually no attention.' I asked Morton what was special about the Channel Tunnel that attracted this treatment. 'Well,' he said, 'first, it's a tunnel - not a bridge, which is glamorous, romantic and liberating. Second, it's a fixed link between England and the continent. Third, there's its size. The feeling is that it's a big project that will come to no good. It has a few fans in Britain: businessmen, for example, who can see five years ahead, and engineers. But the tunnel has to contend with a great deal of bias. 'In France it's different. The French like their big projects, their rockets, the Airbus, their motorways, their grande vitesse trains and nuclear power. The difference is this: in France, the man in the street believes that as a result of big projects his grandchildren will lead a better life.' Did he regret taking on the tunnel? 'No, I knew it would be large, complicated and organisational. I saw it as a major economic development that was very necessary. The great thing I didn't bargain for was a voyage through the English psyche.' I had read, I said, that history's grandest macro-engineering projects, such as the pyramids, had always depended on absolute political support at the very top. Was that true of the tunnel? Would history see Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterand as its heroes? 'For Mitterand,' said Morton, 'the tunnel was a means to an end: the resurrection of derelict northern France. Conversely, Mrs Thatcher said at the outset that the tunnel would be done by private enterprise or not at all  -and after that said nothing.' The Eurotunnel boss seems surprised - even now - at the frigidity of Britain's attitude towards the rest of Europe. 'There is no sense I can detect of people in Britain saying that because they have joined Europe economically they should be doing things like the tunnel to integrate themselves more fully. Britain backs into the future grumbling and grudgingly. On the other hand, the genius of Britain is the way it copes with adverse circumstances. 'The British are reactive, not creative, whereas the French plan. A French engineer will tell you that he cannot start work without a plan. But plans can fail. There is no one better than the British at sorting out the resultant chaos.' On that basis, perhaps the best thing for the Channel Tunnel and for the national lottery would be a few spectacular cock-ups, preferably this week. There would be dancing in the streets - and then a brilliant British rescue. For all anyone knows, that may even be the plan. (See Leader page)   Companies:-  Eurotunnel.

MINISTERS FAIL TO AGREE ON  AID FOR TURKEY, JORDAN, EGYPT.      By JOEL HAVEMANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BRUSSELS      The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European Community agreed Monday  to expel military personnel from the Iraqi embassies in their capitals and to  limit the freedom of other Iraqi diplomats to travel within their borders.    But the foreign ministers, in their second such joint effort, again fell short  of consensus on financial aid to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, which have lost  substantial export markets because of the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq  and Kuwait.    In a statement citing last week's Iraqi incursions against the French, Belgian  and Dutch embassies in Kuwait, the ministers said they ""have decided jointly to  expel military personnel based in Iraqi embassies and to limit the freedom of  movement of personnel in those embassies.""    In addition to the three European diplomatic compounds, Iraqi troops also  raided the Canadian Embassy in Kuwait last week.    Even before the joint announcement, Britain expelled six Iraqi Embassy staff  members in London and ordered 23 more Iraqi nationals in Britain to return  home, while Belgium restricted the movement of Iraqi diplomats to a small area  around Brussels. Italy had announced similar action Sunday.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said his government was expelling the  Iraqis, among them two defense attaches and four staff members in the embassy's  military section, as an expression of solidarity with European allies.    Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and has ordered all foreign diplomats out of  Kuwait on grounds that it is no longer an independent country. Iraqi troops  ring the many embassies where diplomats have refused to leave.    The European foreign ministers also considered but postponed action on a  proposal by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community, that the  EC dedicate about $2 billion to assisting Turkey, Jordan and Egypt. Half the  money would come from the EC budget and half from the 12 member nations.    Britain's Hurd argued that any such aid formula should take into account the  substantial contributions that some European nations, including Britain, have  already made to the U.S.-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf area to  prevent further Iraqi aggression, particularly against Saudi Arabia.    Just 10 days earlier, the European foreign ministers, meeting in Rome, had  agreed in principle on an aid package to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, although  they did not set an amount. The finance ministers of the 12 nations, meeting  the next day, cautioned that any aid should be approved only after a thorough  study of the recipients' needs and the donors' abilities to pay.    The United States, which dominates the multinational military force arrayed in  the gulf after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, had asked the European nations to  help defray the cost of the buildup, or, short of that, to help the nations  suffering from the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq and Kuwait.    Despite the reluctance of the 12 nations to act jointly, at least seven of them  have contributed in one way or another to the multinational military presence  in the gulf.    West Germany, which has constitutional restrictions on what it can do  militarily, has contributed minesweepers and vehicles capable of detecting and  analyzing the presence of poison gases. Iraq has chemical weapons and,  according to the U.S. mission to the European Community, West Germany is ahead  of the United States in the development of chemical weapons survey vehicles.    Also, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday pledged $2 billion, about  half to defray the costs of the military buildup in the gulf and half to assist  Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.    France, provoked by the Iraqi raid on its embassy in Kuwait, announced Saturday  that it would send 4,000 ground troops to Saudi Arabia as well as aircraft and  tanks, to bolster the three warships it had already dispatched.    Britain has sent 6,000 troops and seven warships, as well as fighter aircraft.  Italy has dispatched five warships.    Among the other EC nations, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain have made  smaller contributions to the force in the gulf region. Beyond that, according  to a U.S. survey, Greece has offered three vessels for sea-lift purposes, and  Portugal has turned away an Iraqi merchant vessel that had been scheduled for  repairs at a Portuguese shipyard.    Hurd told reporters that Britain ordered the Iraqi expulsions because of a  conviction ""that we've got to act in solidarity with the French and the other  countries whose embassies have been invaded and people taken out during the  last few days.""    Home Secretary David Waddington, who announced the details of the expulsion in  London, said that he considered their presence ""not to be conducive to the  public good for reasons of national security."" He provided no names of the  civilians involved, but most are believed to include students and, possibly,  business people.    Iraq's ambassador to Britain said the expulsions are unfair.

In a statement of barely disguised fury, the Chinese government said Britain had 'completely' closed the door to further talks on the colony's political development. But Beijing stopped short of issuing any threats to Hong Kong's economy. China was responding to the passage through Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) yesterday of a bill enshrining the first stage of Governor Chris Patten's plans for more democracy. Mr Patten said a second bill would be published today and submitted to LegCo on March 9. It contains proposals to broaden the franchise, which China claims break past Sino-British agreements and understanding. In an attempt to contain the row, Mr Patten said: 'Let us try to draw a line under this dispute, and co-operate together in other areas in the interests of the people of Hong Kong.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said the UK looked forward to co-operation with the Chinese, 'in particular . . . to early agreement on financing arrangements for the new airport and on Hong Kong's ninth container terminal'. Instead, however, China is likely to step up its preparations for assuming control of Hong Kong. Beijing's Preparatory Work Committee, an authority-in-waiting comprising senior Chinese officials and leading figures in Hong Kong, is due to meet today. After Mr Patten spoke in Legco, the Hong Kong government took the unusual step of releasing its version of why the talks have floundered without agreement, charting the course of the negotiations and setting out the compromises tendered by Britain in a bid to reach a deal. Some 200,000 copies of the 36-page white paper were printed, 60,000 in English and 140,000 in Chinese. The white paper, entitled Representative Government in Hong Kong, underlines the gulf between the two sides, although Mr Hurd notes in his introductory comments: 'Our door has been open all along for discussion with the Chinese government. It will remain so.' Accepting the Chinese stance as it stood at the end of eight months and 17 rounds of negotiations would have been to embrace an electoral system that restricted choice and left elections open to manipulation, increasing the possibility of corruption and vote rigging, Mr Hurd said. The three main sticking points to agreement between the two sides on the first stage agreement are China's insistence on reinstating appointed members to municipal councils and district boards after 1997; China's refusal to include the voting method for Legco within the initial agreement; and China's view that the Hong Kong government should not legislate unilaterally on any matter which had not been resolved in the talks. 'This time the choice was between sticking to our position or total surrender,' said one British official. Key to this were Chinese proposals which, according to the British account, had sought to slash the original intention to open up the franchise to 2.7m down to around 840,000 voters.

The Government's follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit, an  environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four  documents -- nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in  the surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall.    The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable  Development Strategy, on transport, says that ``costs of  travel, particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise  to reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future  demand for transport.''    Mr. Major, launching the strategy, said: ``Sometimes quite  painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental  objectives.''    He admitted he ``did not expect to see people dancing in the  street'' at the thought of road pricing.    He said that Britain's imposition of VAT on heating and  lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road pricing had  already gone further than most other countries, but denied these  would impose an intolerable burden on the economy.    An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet  future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the  overall environmental strategy, Mr. Major introduced the  following documents:    -- The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how  Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide  emissions by the year 2000.    The document shows for the first time that Britain will  achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global warming --  including methane and CFCs -- of five percent. It commits  Britain to setting targets after 2000 but not what they will be.    -- The Biodiversity Action Plan -- sets out 59 specific  commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness.    -- The Forestry Action Plan -- shows how Britain will  increase forest cover.    Mr. Major announced a new panel of five ``wise men'' who  will  advise him and monitor progress on ``green issues,'' chaired by  Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an  unofficial adviser at Downing Street.    The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of  National  Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's  statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation  Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission  on Environmental Pollution, and Dr. Anne Mclaren, vice-president  of the Royal Society.    Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the  Government would be setting up a Round Table on Sustainable  Development which would bring together industry, local  authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental  policies.    The Government also intended to stimulate a new ``citizen's  environmental initiative'' in consultation with local  authorities, churches and community groups.    Mr. Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from  Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr. Chris Smith, Labour  spokesman for environmental protection, said the four reports  contained ``no vision and few firm commitments to action.''    The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said  the key Strategy document was ``full of `coulds,' `ifs' and  `maybes' when what the country needs is `whys,'`whats' and  `whens.'''    The Green Party complained the Government ``lacked the  courage of its convictions'' and the World Wide Fund for Nature  described the announcement as ``a lost opportunity.''    -- An entire protected meadow famous for butterflies will be  destroyed as part of a project by British Coal to extract three  million tons of coal from an open-cast site.    West Glamorgan county council yesterday approved an  application to develop open-cast mining on 800 acres of hillside  above Glynneath, West Glamorgan, over nine years which will  create about 140 jobs.

The Treasury signalled that it would be prepared to face a clash with the Commission over the issue. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC commissioner responsible for fiscal policy, warned that Britain would face a 'hard time' unless it agreed a compromise with its EC partners before the end of this month. She was speaking after meeting Mr Lamont in London about preparations for the next EC finance ministers' meeting to be held in a week's time. Mr Lamont used yesterday's talks to reaffirm Britain's firm line not only on VAT but also on excise duties on spirits sold throughout the EC. The UK wants to protect the Scotch whisky industry from possible increased duties in some EC states under plans to harmonise indirect taxes. Underlining a toughening of the sparring over indirect taxation, Mrs Scrivener hinted that Britain might put into jeopardy its hard-won right to maintain zero VAT on a range of everyday goods unless it backed down over the minimum rates question. 'We want the UK to realise that the situation is very serious,' she said. The Treasury flatly contradicted Mrs Scrivener's implicit threat that the zero-rate exemption might be at risk. Britain's zero VAT rates were guaranteed under the EC's sixth VAT directive, which could be changed only by unanimous decision of finance ministers, the Treasury said. The VAT tussle goes to the heart of Britain's desire to maintain maximum fiscal policy freedom in spite of growing economic integration. Mrs Scrivener said she was hopeful that a solution could be found before Britain took over the Community presidency in a month's time. Britain has agreed Commission plans for a Community-wide minimum VAT level of 15 per cent, to come into effect on January 1 next year with the establishment of the single market. But the UK has refused to enshrine the measure in a legally binding EC directive, on the ground that it would restrict the Treasury's freedom of manoeuvre. Mrs Scrivener said that other EC countries that had already decided to align their national VAT rates with the new rules were growing increasingly angry about Britain's VAT obduracy.

0,FT924-15515 ,"FT924-15515 _AN-CJDAFADKFT 921003   FT  03 OCT 92 / Why small is no longer beautiful: Recession is wreaking havoc on entrepreneurs who prospered in the 1980s      By JOHN PLENDER   It is one thing for the government to re-draw the lines of economic policy; quite another to restrain the inexorable rise in the immediate costs of the recession. This week it emerged that the rate of business failures in Britain had accelerated sharply in the third quarter, with a jump of more than 50 per cent over the comparable period last year. The pain has been particularly acute in the small business sector, where a new generation of entrepreneurs that prospered in the boom of the 1980s is being systematically wiped out. It is a tragedy not only for them, but for the wider economy. A striking feature of the labour markets of the developed world over the past decade is the disproportionate contribution that small business has made to the growth in employment. Britain and the US serve to illustrate the point. Between 1985 and 1989, according to a study by Professor Colin Gallagher of Newcastle University, more than 1m additional jobs were created in the British economy by companies employing fewer than 20 people - twice as many as those created by larger companies. In the US the Bureau of Labour Statistics estimates that new companies generated 12m jobs in the 1980s out of a total of 18.5m. The weakness of the US economic recovery is largely explained by the collapse in the job creating capability of small business: between 1990 and 1991 the additional jobs created by new companies dropped from 1.5m to 144,000. It is not difficult to see why small business should have been such a conspicuous victim of the recession in the English-speaking economies. The potent combination of loose monetary policy and financial deregulation in the 1980s ensured a supply of plentiful, but increasingly expensive, credit. In Britain rising house prices provided ballooning collateral for small business loans. Today in Britain house prices are down in nominal terms and real rates of interest are still at their highest level since the 1930s. Unlike the early 1980s when an overvalued exchange rate was chiefly responsible for rising unemployment, interest rates are now the key. Since a high proportion of small businesses are in the non-tradeable sector of the economy, they enjoyed a degree of protection in the earlier recession. Today they have nowhere to hide. Credit, whether cheap, as in the US, or expensive, as in Britain, is now scarce. Small companies are not only vulnerable because of their greater indebtedness; they are, as David Hale of Kemper Financial Services points out, more dependent on a shell-shocked banking system than large companies because they lack access to stock and bond markets and to commercial paper markets. As banks seek to rebuild their capital and profits, small business suffers disproportionately from the banks' urge to widen margins. In the US the credit crunch has been exacerbated by bank failures and conservative lending policies arising from new federal regulations that severely penalise bank directors who adopt risky lending policies. Small businesses there have also been hit by a sharp rise in health insurance costs. And the heavy weighting towards the non-tradeable sector means that they are less well placed to take advantage of a weak dollar than large companies - a point that now applies with equal force to post-ERM Britain. If the balance of advantage has shifted somewhat towards the larger companies in economies that have seen significant devaluations, does this mean that corporations will generate jobs in the 1990s on a scale to rival the performance of small business in the 1980s? The answer may well hinge on structural changes at work in the global labour market, the impact of which can best be seen in the US. Between 1979 and 1991 the level of employment in the Fortune 500 companies - a reasonable proxy for big business - fell from 16.2m to just under 12m. As a share of total (non-farm) employment that represents a spectacular fall from 18 per cent to less than 11 per cent. The most important factor behind the decline is the emergence in the 1970s and 1980s of a global labour market. Business decisions about where to produce mainstream industrial products came to be made increasingly on the basis of global cost comparisons. In effect, the newly industrialising countries were embarking on a process of wage equalization with the developed world similar to the one that Europe embarked on with the US after 1945. Until the process of convergence in wages is complete, a tight cost discipline is imposed on companies in the developed world. Labour markets tend to polarise between skilled workers, who maintain or increase living standards, and less skilled workers who see a decline in real wages. This cost discipline has been reinforced by other micro-economic trends such as the liberalisation of markets, technological innovation and the development of Japanese-style 'lean' production methods. The results of this explosive cocktail are reflected in the accompanying chart, extracted from Prosperity or Decline, a thoughtful piece of futurology by Giles Keating and Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB). The chart shows an attempt by the rating agency Moody's to construct a long-run set of figures to show the pattern of business defaults back to 1900. The striking feature of the chart is the discontinuity in the decades that followed the second world war. The end of the Bretton Woods era of fixed exchange rates appears to have marked a shift to a less stable world in which corporations felt unable to offer the same degree of job security. The growth in self-employment and small business employment is, up to a point, the obverse side of that coin. In a world where corporations sub-contract more activity to turn as many fixed costs as possible into variable costs, both the sub-contractors and the corporations can be better off thanks to efficiency gains. But as CSFB's Jonathan Wilmot points out, employment is less secure and the labour market is subject to 19th century-style booms and busts. If this thesis is correct the recent rise in the household savings ratio in Britain is more than a temporary hangover after the 1980s debt party. It is a longer-term structural change, reflecting the growing propensity of nominal incomes to go down as well as up. And the trend will be strengthened, as the fall of communism and the spread of liberal economics propels more than 3bn people back into the global market for goods and capital. Against that background, falling interest rates will not do much to stimulate new jobs. Fiscal policy will have to play a bigger part. Yet it cannot do so in countries such as Britain and the US, which face the 1990s from a position of budgetary weakness. The stimulus will have to come from Japan and continental Europe; to some extent it is already doing so. The structural, as well as short-term, factors thus suggest that the focus of job creation may be in the tradeable goods sector in Britain and the US - good for big business, but not such a favourable environment for job creation.  ----------------------------------------------------         JOB GENERATION BY COMPANY SIZE  ----------------------------------------------------                                         As %                      Net job         of 1987 Size                creation      employment  ---------------------------------------------------- 1-4                    357           29.4 5-9                    166           10.7 10-19                   92            4.7 20-49                   76            5.8 50-99                   85            7.4 100-499                123            6.2 500-999                 55            9.8 1000-4999               36            3.4 5000-9999               14            2.8 10000+                 125            3.7 TOTAL                1,127            7.7  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Job Creation 1987-89, Employment Gazette  ----------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

HER SUSPICIONS OF  EUROPEANS AS WOOLY, DEVIOUS -- OR BOTH -- IS NOT THE PREVAILING ENGLISH VIEW.      By Michael Elliott, Michael Elliott is political editor of the Economist.      LONDON      Like political reporters everywhere, those who live in the press gallery of  Britain's House of Commons are a cynical lot -- and cynical, above all, about  the Commons itself. It may proudly call itself the mother of parliaments, but  usually the place is as ill-informed and predictable as you would expect when  650 politicians are gathered together. Only occasionally does the House live up  to its billing -- and it did so the afternoon of Halloween.    At 5:26, Nigel Lawson who, until five days before, had been Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's chancellor of the Exchequer (or chief finance minister),  rose to tell his colleagues why he had resigned. Lawson is a proud, some would  say, arrogant man -- and not usually a good orator. But his 10-minute speech  (heard, unusually for the Commons, in total silence) was delivered with none of  the pompous attitudes he often adopts, and it was electrifying. For he did  nothing less than explain why Thatcher's government may be falling apart at the  seams.    Lawson had been chancellor since Thatcher's second election victory in 1983 but  he was much more than that. Almost alone among the entourage, he had the  ability to make the intellectual case for Thatcherism with a politician's  instinct for what would play in the British equivalent of Peoria. He had cut  taxes, privatized industries and deregulated the economy. From 1986 to 1988,  when Britain grew faster than any other Western economy, he presided over the  closest thing to a boom the country had seen for 30 years. If anyone deserved  Thatcher's unstinting support, he did. But he did not get it. To understand  why, you have to understand both Margaret Thatcher and Britain's current  economic difficulties.    Ten years of power have not diminished one of Thatcher's central traits. She  thinks of herself as an outsider, enjoying the advice and company of other  outsiders. In large measure, her perception of her own position is cracked. No  woman before Thatcher had quite managed to snake her way into the charmed world  of Britain's Conservative Party; and on her way to the top, she was patronized  and dismissed by many of the smooth men who run it -- and who run Britain's  Civil Service. She is not smooth. She is a provincial, suspicious of  metropolitan charms. Her whole political life has been dedicated to bucking the  conventional wisdom, and she revels in it. She is one of those infuriating  people who, when they find themselves in a minority of one, are convinced they  are right.    Most of the British economic Establishment -- and Nigel Lawson -- think  exchange-rate stability is a desirable goal in itself, and an invaluable weapon  in the battle against inflation. They believe, moreover, that the best way for  Britain to secure such stability would be for the pound to become a member of  the European exchange-rate mechanism (or ERM) which, within narrow limits, sets  rates for the currencies of members within the European community.    Since most Establishment economists think the ERM is beneficial, it is not  surprising that Thatcher does not -- even though she is nationally committed to  joining it ""when the time is right."" She has long believed that attempts to  manage the currency markets are futile; yet that was Lawson's policy. When  currency dealers were selling the pound (which makes Britain's imports more  expensive, and hence raises domestic inflation) he would raise interest rates  to maintain the value of the currency. British rates are now at 15%. This, be  it noted, is in a country where almost all home loans are floating rate, which  means that interest-rate hikes hurt -- and since most home owners vote  Conservative, it is Thatcher's people who feel the pinch.    Hence the prime minister had some political grounds for feeling annoyed with  Lawson, and she was much supported by the views of one of her unsmooth,  provincial chums -- Sir Alan Walters, a British economist who has long spent  most of his time in America (at the World Bank or Johns Hopkins University).  Walters has offered Thatcher economic advice for most of the 1980s, and this  year was scheduled to spend half his time in her employ. His views on  exchange-rate management are robust; he thinks it stinks. The ERM, he said in  an article published only last week, is ""half-baked."" In Lawson's view, ""No  case can be made for seeming confusion or vacillation between the two  positions""; Walters' article was ""the tip of a singularly ill-concealed  iceberg, with all the destructive potential that icebergs possess."" When it  became clear to Lawson that the prime minister would not settle the confusion  by sacking Walters, he resigned. Walters himself followed suit.    In one interpretation, Lawson's going does no more than confirm that Thatcher  is autocratic, intensely loyal to supporters and incapable of admitting that  she is wrong -- characteristics we have all recognized for years. But there is  far more to it than that.    Though she is still only 64, Thatcher is the last of her generation of British  politicians. Her political outlook was shaped by World War II and its  aftermath. She came of age at a time when the countries of Western Europe were  either in ruins or the enemies of Britain, but when American troops were its  savior. She grew up, not so incidentally, in the part of Britain where most  Americans were stationed; I like to think that as an impressionable  Lincolnshire school girl, she bicycled down the lanes with some firm-jawed GI  from Iowa.    For Margaret Thatcher, commitment to the Atlantic Alliance is a deeply  emotional thing, one that long predates her relationship with Ronald Reagan.  America is steadfast, or at least, it always has been for her. Europeans, she  thinks, are not to be trusted; they are devious when not woolly, but usually  both.    No other prominent British politician thinks like this any more. They are fond  of America, or most of them are, but they regard themselves as Europeans.  Thatcher's ministers find that more and more of their business -- whether  fighting terrorism, stopping drugs, cleaning up the environment or managing the  economy -- is easier done if done with their colleagues in European  governments.    Nigel Lawson was, and is, firmly of this view. He is not a romantic dreaming  about the United States of Europe, but he believes that Britain's destiny lies  in a ""Europe of nation states."" If it did not join the ERM, he said, Britain  would find its influence in Europe sorely diminished.    Here lies the true significance of Lawson's departure. Even those calling  themselves Thatcherites no longer follow her line on Europe. One young minister  to whom she is quite close told me this week, ""There simply are no votes to be  won in being anti-European now."" Yet given the chance to set her face against  Europe -- and ERM is the most potent symbol of European cooperation -- she took  it.    If Thatcher took it in the knowledge that Britain had somewhere to go other  than Europe, her action would at least have been understandable. But that is  not the case. For all of this year, the State Department has been signaling  that the Reagan years are over, that relations with West Germany are more  important for America than relations with Britain and that Britain must start  playing an ungrudging part in the building of a stronger, more integrated  European Community. Like Adm. Nelson, the British hero who clapped a telescope  to his blind eye when he saw the flags ordering retreat, the prime minister has  ignored everything that has come out of Washington. Sometimes -- more often  than her enemies admit -- her gut instincts have been those of most of the  British people. But on Europe, she has lost touch with those who -- like Nigel  Lawson -- have supported her for so long, and as they withdraw their support,  so the final departure of this remarkable 20th-Century leader slides quietly  into view.

The  country's most celebrated rocket designer is so angry and  disillusioned that he is poised to take his expertise overseas.    Alan Bond, the inventor of the revolutionary air breathing  engines for Hotol (Horizontal Take Off and Landing), Britain's  first -- abandoned -- space plane project, has been struggling  for three years to raise the cash needed to develop a new plane,  Skylon. He had pinned his hopes on Britain's participation in a  European programme named FESTIP (Future European Space  Transportation Investigations Programme).    FESTIP is to review the technology for space launchers and,  in about two years, recommend which should be developed for the  21st century.    Skylon would take off and land on a runway. Its new Sabre  engines are designed to work in air and space and to cut the  trip from London to Sydney to an hour.    But spending cuts by the Department of Trade and Industry  have left Britain's dwindling space budget too small to join  Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Spain in FESTIP, it was  disclosed yesterday. A spokesman for the British National Space  Centre in London said the overall budget to the European Space  Agency [ESA] had been cut from 124 million pounds to 114 million  pounds. ""The space budget is already committed so we would be  looking at an extra spend which we are not going to get.""    Germany, which has a space plane design called Sanger, has  put up 8 million pounds despite budgetary pressures.    Mr Bond, whose attempts to develop the engines for British  Aerospace's [BAe] Hotol space plane were frustrated when the  Ministry of Defence classified the patents, said yesterday that  the Government was yet again throwing away a world lead in  technology. ""It is a disaster. Among the whole of Europe we are  the only country without a space plane programme and we bloody  well started it all,"" he said.    Private financiers in Britain had told him that without  government backing they were not prepared to fund the  development of Skylon. Mr Bond, 49, said he was now planning to  go overseas with Reaction Engines, the company he founded with  two former members of the Hotol team. Among those showing  interest were the Japanese.    Mr Bond, whose firm is based at Stanford in the Vale,  Oxfordshire, said: ""We, including British Aerospace, have a  technological lead, but the head of the British National Space  Centre and ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry  simply do not care.""    He said British Aerospace Space Systems in Stevenage,  Hertfordshire, which had also hoped to join the ESA programme  with a revised version of Hotol, had spent millions of pounds of  its own and taxpayers' money.    Paul Down, business development director at BAe, said  yesterday: ""We have gathered a vast amount of expertise working  with Rolls-Royce and Alan Bond and we have been working with the  Russians and Deutsche Aerospace.... We will be distressed  beyond measure if we are not able to play our part.""    Derek Davis, director general of the British National Space  Centre, said yesterday: ""My heart goes out to Mr Bond...we are  trying to find ways which would allow these companies to get  involved.""    Britain's participation in FESTIP seemed assured last year,  30 years after it pulled out of the Blue Streak project.    Edward Leigh, the former industry minister responsible for  space, believed Britain could not be left behind. About 3  million pounds over three years was believed to be enough to  assure British entry into FESTIP and the involvement of Skylon  and the revised Hotol.     "

However, he added, it is a pity that this cooperative  relationship has been ruined by Chris Patten.    Zhang Junsheng made the above statement to reporters  yesterday evening when attending the founding ceremony of the  Hong Kong Society of Creative Photographic Art. He was asked by  reporters to comment on remarks by the British Foreign Office  minister Alastair Goodlad that Sino-British relations at present  are not too bad.    Zhang Junsheng said: ""I wish it were true. However, now the  problem is that the very important part of Sino-British  relations, that is, the cooperative relationship between China  and Britain on the Hong Kong issue, has been ruined by the  British side, and by Chris Patten in particular. The Chinese  side, of course, hopes China and Britain can maintain a good  cooperative relationship between them, but for the moment  Sino-British relations have actually been greatly impaired.""    Zhang Junsheng said: China and Britain should cooperate more  closely in this late transitional period to ensure prosperity,  stability, and a steady transition, which is the goal clearly  laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Now, the  problem is that the British side has ruined cooperation despite  the Chinese side's wish for cooperation. In this case, what can  we do on our part? Now that the British side refuses to  cooperate, the Chinese side cannot stand by idly doing nothing  but waiting for the British side to return to cooperation.    A reporter mentioned that a couple of days ago Chris Patten  had accused the economic subgroup of the Preliminary Work  Committee [PWC] of nursing ulterior motives in inviting Hong  Kong Government officials to visit Beijing to explain a bill on  the Airport Corporation's articles of association. Zhang  Junsheng asked: Then what is the motive? Chris Patten did not  specify it at all. A few days ago, Chris Patten said he would  not restrain British Hong Kong Government officials from  contacting members of the PWC. But now he has categorically  rejected an official invitation from the PWC. In fact, the PWC  economic subgroup's letter of invitation very expressly states  that the PWC needed to study the issue, and its purpose in  studying this is to give advice to the Chinese representatives  on the Airport Committee before further negotiations with their  British counterparts. What is wrong with doing this?    Zhang Junsheng said: Some members of the PWC, when studying  the case, have found that they do not understand or are not  quite clear about some articles in the bill; therefore, they  have asked Hong Kong Government officials to explain the bill to  them. The purpose is very clear, and it has been stated very  clearly in the invitation letter. Should there be any doubts  about this?    A reporter said to Zhang Junsheng: Referring to the  reorganization of the three-tier assemblies in 1997, some PWC  members have suggested that the nonpolitical assemblies be  allowed to switch over by means of endorsement and reappointment  rather than reelection. The reporter asked Zhang whether he  agreed with this idea. Zhang Junsheng said: In principle, all  assemblies should be dismissed and reestablished. However,  before a final decision is made, everybody is welcome to air his  views on the reorganization of these assemblies. Now that PWC  members are voicing their opinions on this issue and are  discussing it, this shows that they are very seriously and  responsibly considering the case of Hong Kong's transition.  With a smile he said to the reporters: ""You may express your  opinions as well!""     "
0,FT932-13044 ,"FT932-13044 _AN-DDZBRAAIFT 930426   FT  26 APR 93 / Britain set on closer EC ties      By LIONEL BARBER and PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   BRITAIN yesterday signalled that it intends to join its EC partners in closer European political and economic co-operation if Denmark rejects the Maastricht treaty in next month's referendum. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, made clear that there was no question of Britain joining Denmark outside the EC in the event of a second Danish 'No'. Speaking in Denmark at the end of a two-day meeting of EC foreign ministers, Mr Hurd said if the Danes rejected Maastricht next month, the treaty would not proceed. But he added: 'Of course, I am not saying we would not take part in further arrangements.' Mr Hurd's position echoed the UK government's recent enthusiastic pro-European line, which matches a growing confidence that the Tory Euro-sceptics are on the run and that the treaty is likely to be ratified at Westminster by the end of the summer. Mr Hurd made clear yesterday that he expected the Danes to support the treaty in the May 18 referendum - a view supported by recent opinion polls showing a clear lead for the Yes campaign. At the Edinburgh summit last December, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain all warned the UK and Denmark that failure to ratify Maastricht would prompt other countries to launch new treaty arrangements. Mr Hurd's explicit commitment to closer European co-operation contrasts with a much more guarded approach to future EC treaty arrangements last year, when the UK suggested that it might not take part in a future EC effort to recreate or expand on Maastricht in the event of a Danish or British rejection. Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: Mr John Major has made it clear that there could be no question of Britain pressing ahead with ratification of Maastricht if the Danes vote 'no' on May 18. But Mr Hurd's comments will nonetheless inflame the anger of the Tory Euro-sceptics. In the past the government has sought to limit the size of the Conservative rebellion against Maastricht by insisting that it would not allow the rest of the Community to leave Denmark behind.

The following  is the essence of his speech.    Lu Ping said: On 1 July 1997, the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] will move into Hong Kong to be stationed there -- this is  laid down by both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law. However,  first, it will be small in size and symbolic. As Mr Deng  Xiaoping said, it symbolizes our sovereignty. Second, the PLA  will not interfere the internal affairs of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It will merely be  responsible for SAR defense affairs. Normal public order work,  including border patrols, will be carried out by the Hong Kong  SAR's own police force; the PLA has no duties in this area.  This has been written into the Basic Law which stipulates that,  in case of a disaster or under special circumstances, the PLA  can assist in rescue operations or maintaining Hong Kong public  order at the request of the SAR chief executive. However, this  will only be under very special circumstances. As soon as these  special and extraordinary circumstances disappear, Hong Kong  will once again be under the rule of the SAR authorities. The  PLA has strict provisions in its mandate. Moreover, the PLA  will be directed to strictly observe the law of Hong Kong. If,  for example, a PLA vehicle is involved in a traffic accident  with a Hong Kong person, the whole thing will be handled  according to the law of Hong Kong and the case will be tried by  a Hong Kong judge. The PLA party will do whatever is required  by Hong Kong law. There will be strict legal provisions on this  and other related issues in the future.    On the current state of Hong Kong real estate and the  problem  of the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar link, Lu Ping said: The problems  with Hong Kong real estate are rather complicated. There are  many causes of high property prices, one of which is inflation,  though there are also many other factors behind it. For  example, the fact that Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S.  dollar. As we all know, the American economy has been  performing very badly over the last few years and interest rates  have had to be lowered, whereas Hong Kong's economy has been  vibrant. But, because of the linkage, Hong Kong could only  follow the United States and lower its interest rates. People  find their bank deposits are suffering from negative interest  rates when compared with inflation. To keep the real value of  their money, people invest in stocks and the property market.    Lu Ping thinks the current property situation in Hong Kong  is  highly abnormal. He said: Our view is that the property and  land prices should be brought down. To do that we need to solve  the problems from different angles. Increasing land supply is  one way but not the only way. The problem of property prices  cannot be solved by solely increasing land supply. Expanding  public housing and the home ownership scheme is another way.  The Hong Kong government is organizing manpower to study this  problem. Our view is that current property prices are indeed  too high and are affecting people's livelihood and Hong Kong's  position as an international financial and trade center. If  property prices continue to rise, the cost of investing in Hong  Kong will become increasingly higher. Rent for offices in  Central now is the highest in the world. This is not going to  help Hong Kong. Why would foreign companies establish their  Asia offices in Hong Kong when rent and wages there keep going  up? It is better for them to move somewhere else. One very  important factor contributing to Hong Kong's past success was  its relatively low costs, wages, and prices. Whatever happens,  Hong Kong must not lose this advantage. Only thus can it  maintain its competitiveness.    Lu Ping stated: The property market is now a key sector  for Hong Kong. A very large number of listed companies are  property developers and a very large proportion of bank loans  are property-related. If the property market slumps, the stock  and financial markets will be affected. So, we must handle this  problem with great care and caution and adopt a step-by-step  approach in cooling off the market. Moreover, we cannot depress  the market too much but must keep a basic equilibrium and  prevent the market from rising indefinitely. This is better for  Hong Kong's economy.    When asked how Hong Kong can now achieve a smooth transition  given the present status between China and Britain, Lu Ping  said: The position of the Chinese Government has been  consistent: It hopes to secure Britain's cooperation in efforts  to achieve a smooth transition for Hong Kong. This was, is, and  will be our position. Unfortunately, Britain changed its  policies toward Hong Kong and China. You all have read the  report released earlier by the British House of Commons Foreign  Affairs Committee (FAC) which pointed out explicitly the  fundamental change in Britain's policy toward China and Hong  Kong since 1989, namely from the previous policy of cooperation  with China into one of noncooperation or even confrontation. It  can be said that there was very good cooperation between China  and Britain following the signing of the Joint Declaration in  1984 and, in general, the two sides were able to iron out  contradictions and differences through consultations. Some  people dubbed this the honeymoon period for China and Britain.  By 1989, however, things were different. By that time Britain  had chosen to be very uncooperative with China. All in all, it  is very unfortunate. Lu Ping said: Our position on the airport  problem is the same -- it is very clear. The Memorandum of  Understanding [MOU] was in place by then, and it was very clear.  In principle, we do not want to leave the SAR government with  any financial burdens and inputs should be kept low while  returns must be high. Also, a minimum $25 billion must be in  place for the SAR government to use as financial reserves and  the debt to be taken over by the SAR government must not exceed  5 billion. We had thought that with the signing of the MOU,  these problems were resolved. Go ahead and build the airport if  you want to. We, the Chinese government, have made it clear  that we support the construction of the new airport. So here we  have a case of flying off at a tangent: The financial  arrangements tabled by Britain would leave the SAR government  with a debt far exceeding the 5 billion allowed in the MOU.  Despite this, we were still willing to talk to Britain and we  did not limit the debt to 5 billion either. It just cannot  exceed the amount by too big a margin. We hope that we can  first achieve some progress on the airport financial  arrangements in the coming Airport Committee meeting so that  there will be a new airport earlier rather than later. We would  like to see Mr Chris Patten leave Hong Kong in 1997 via the Chek  Lap Kok Airport on the Lantau Island and not from Kai Tak  Airport.    When asked if it was possible for him to meet Chris Patten,  Lu Ping said: As I have said earlier, this calls for  cooperation from both sides and a good atmosphere. Without a  good atmosphere, there would not be any result even if the two  of us sat down and talked for days on end. Very simple problems  can become quite complicated if the atmosphere is not good; and  very complicated problems, if the atmosphere is good, can become  very simple and can be solved very quickly.

Downing Street officials indicated ahead of today's meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels that Britain might not veto a proposal to raise from 23 to 27 the number of votes needed to block legislation. Britain wants to avoid being blamed for jeopardising the Community's enlargement. Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, who have been opposing the proposal to increase the number of votes required to block decisions, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next January. European officials said British ministers had appeared to support a Spanish proposal which would allow the blocking vote to rise to 27 once the new members join the EU, while maintaining a further blocking vote at 23 provided a maximum of three countries made up the 23 votes. That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one small one - with a combined population of at least 100m - to block decisions by the EU Council of Ministers, possibly until an EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 when voting weights could be renegotiated. Agreement by Britain to compromise would allow successful negotiations on the entry of Sweden, Finland and Austria to be approved by the European Parliament and help smooth remaining obstacles to Norway's entry. However, UK government business managers are worried about possible backbench rebellions by Euro-sceptic Tory MPs and have warned ministers of the difficulty of getting legislation through the House of Commons if they agree to compromise. Their fears were highlighted last night when some backbench MPs voiced their opposition to any compromise at a meeting of the Conservative European Affairs committee. At present, the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76, distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement, with the entry of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, it is proposed that the blocking minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90. But as Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to finalise Britain's negotiating position, leading Conservative Euro-sceptics said they would oppose any 'climbdown'. Mr William Cash, one of the leading Euro-sceptics, said the Commons would not put up with 'more erosion' of its powers. Some Euro-sceptics said last night that they expected Mr Major to 'prevent the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from making any compromise in the interests of party unity'. Faced with the choice of another dispute with its European partners or its Euro-sceptics, Whitehall officials predicted the government would only pick the latter if it was confident of limiting any backbench rebellion. Mr Major's officials said he was determined to defend British interests in an enlarged Community 'and get enlargement'. The Foreign Office last night said it had not received any acceptable offer over the size of the blocking veto, but underlined its commitment to enlarging the union. Another official predicted that 'a compromise of some sort will emerge'. Senior British officials in Brussels signalled more than two weeks ago that they could accept the Spanish formula, although, formally, they were yesterday insisting there was no change in London's position. Nevertheless, Spanish negotiators are depending on UK support, and any likely compromise may take the form of a 'declaration' by the 12.

As France and Germany tabled a joint initiative to give substance to the European union established on November 1, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said it was time for EC governments to refocus on the concerns of their citizens. Speaking to British MPs ahead of tomorrow's summit in Brussels, the foreign secretary insisted that Britain was winning the argument for a more flexible, decentralised Europe. 'Those who want to go down the old road to greater centralisation have learned something in the last two years,' the foreign secretary said. Mr Hurd did little to disguise Britain's view that the summit, called by Bonn to celebrate Maastricht, was unnecessary. But since it was taking place the leaders should spend the time discussing European competitiveness and employment rather than issuing 'blasts of trumpets' to usher in European union. Mr Hurd added that the summit should recommit the EC to the conclusion by December 15 of the Uruguay round of the Gatt world trade talks. However, he indicated that Britain would not seek to 'corner' France in Brussels over its refusal to accept the EC-US deal over farm subsidies. Looking ahead to the next inter-governmental conference in 1996, the foreign secretary said that the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway would involve further changes in the Community's institutions. He said present arrangements, under which two large and one small countries constitute a 'blocking' minority, must be preserved when the Community's membership increases from 12 to 16. That result would allow a proportionately smaller group of states to veto decisions of the majority. The British government also wanted to reduce the number of commissioners once the Community was enlarged. Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the Commission, had agreed that the 21 commissioners at present implied by the entry of four new members was impracticable. But Britain was so far alone among the large EC countries in voicing willingness to reduce its representation from two to one.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-3072 ,"FT942-3072 _AN-EFPDDAD6FT 940616   FT  16 JUN 94 / China signals thaw in dispute with Britain over Hong Kong      By SIMON HOLBERTON      HONG KONG   China has signalled an easing of its dispute with Britain over Hong Kong's political development, which has hindered commercial negotiations between the two countries and clouded the future of the colony. It emerged yesterday that Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, had told a group of Hong Kong trade unionists that the dispute with Britain was 'past' and that relations between the UK and China should be 'corrected and improved'. Mr Qian's remarks, made on Tuesday, come at a time when both governments are making efforts to repair relations after a bruising two-year dispute about Hong Kong's political development. The row culminated late last year with Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, pushing ahead with his blueprint for political reform. Mr Qian repeated on Tuesday Beijing's threat to call fresh elections after it resumes sovereignty in 1997. The apparent thaw in relations will face a test at the end of this month when Hong Kong's legislature votes on Mr Patten's democracy plans. Most of the proposals are expected to be accepted. Since the spring, Chinese officials have indicated a willingness to proceed with practical matters concerning the transfer of Hong Kong. However, some Hong Kong government officials suspect Beijing has started a charm offensive of little substance. Another sign that a thaw in relations is under way is an invitation China extended last week to Mr Alastair Goodlad, a foreign office minister, who will visit Beijing next month. This is the first British ministerial visit to the Chinese capital for a year. In September a top British business delegation will go to China to improve trade relations. In a related move, it was announced yesterday that the Sino-British joint liaison group (JLG) would meet from June 21 to June 23. The JLG - which oversees the transfer of Hong Kong to China and should have met last in March but failed to do so - has a large backlog of technical work to complete. The forthcoming meeting is expected to seal the terms of a deal whereby the Hong Kong government will refit some military sites in the colony for the use of China's armed forces in exchange for the release of surplus military land for civilian development.

They outlined a strategy which some hope could lead to the UK opening a nuclear plant every three years from 2002. Lord Weir, chairman of Weir Group, who was helping to launch the British Nuclear Industry Forum's submission to the government, said the most important practical decision was when and on what basis Britain would build more nuclear power plants. Mr Roy Broadhead, chairman of Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering, said the privatisation of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two generating companies, was a matter between them and the government. 'What we are talking about is industry's request that the government has a balanced energy strategy,' he said. Their remarks reflect concern among many of the 72 companies represented by the forum that the two generating companies' decision to concentrate on privatisation has diverted attention from plant construction. Lord Weir said that the government had to ensure that nuclear power maintained a presence in the electricity market. One possibility was reserving a share of the market for nuclear power. The forum says in its submission that, given a clear commitment to further nuclear construction at home, British companies will be well placed to exploit opportunities of a potential world nuclear market of Pounds 500bn. The submission says: 'As things stand the nuclear industry is set to earn Britain Pounds 1bn a year by 2000, but with the government's backing for more power stations in Britain the export earnings could grow much larger.' The nuclear industry provided direct and indirect employment for about 100,000 people, many highly skilled, working in companies at the heart of manufacturing. The forum pointed out yesterday that building a new nuclear power plant every two to three years from 2002 would merely maintain capacity. Lord Weir said the industry justified itself financially and economically and added that, although nuclear power would need state support, this did not necessarily mean subsidies. 'It will not be acceptable for the Treasury simply to say that the requirements for financing Sizewell C are too complex or too different to fit in with their normal way of handling such things,' he said.

Mr Major warned that if the controversial draft directive requiring such companies to set up elected works councils were revived, Britain would prevent any unanimous agreement needed for approval. Britain insisted last week that the plan be taken off the agenda for the meeting of labour and social affairs ministers. It now hopes the threat of a veto will head off any plans to press ahead with the move during the Belgian presidency which begins next month. Speaking at the Conservative women's national conference, Mr Major was unequivocal in his message to the other 11 EC countries. 'Let me spare them some trouble, let me tell them now: they are wasting their time. We have a veto on this issue, and I intend that we will use it,' he said. While Britain can block the directive under existing EC procedures, once Maastricht has been ratified and the social protocol comes into effect, the other 11 countries can introduce it. Even though the UK has 'opted out' of the social chapter, British companies could still be affected by the plans, since many have operations in continental Europe large enough to require them to introduce the new procedures for their operations outside Britain. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, used his speech at the same conference to highlight the UK's concern that the EC was making itself uncompetitive. He also underlined Britain's continued opposition to the working time directive passed by the social affairs council. He told the conference that he was taking over responsibility for women's issues within the government, but sounded slightly defensive when he emphasised he would work closely with his predecessor, Mrs Gillian Shephard. Last month's reshuffle left Mr Major with the dilemma of putting Mr Hunt in charge of women's issues or leaving those responsibilities to Miss Ann Widdecombe, a junior employment minister.

0,FT931-8926 ,"FT931-8926 _AN-DBQC0ACFFT 930217   FT  17 FEB 93 / Personal View: First step to blocking a two-tier Europe      By PADDY ASHDOWN   The shambles of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's legal about-turn on the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty on Monday should not be allowed to confuse the issues that are at stake. Labour's amendment 27, by seeking to remove the opt-out, could only ever be the first step on the road towards the social chapter's inclusion in the treaty. Parliament should vote in favour, for two reasons. First, the arrangement negotiated at Maastricht by John Major, the prime minister, is a legal and political mess. The opt-out creates a two-tier Europe in the social dimension which many Community experts believe to be unworkable. Mr Major has left Britain, in this vital area, with reduced influence, diminished status and, once again, without the ability to shape the institutions that will guide the Continent. At Maastricht, the prime minister had the opportunity to negotiate a social chapter which conformed more clearly with British desires for decentralised decision-making and a free-market approach. He passed up that chance and chose isolation instead. Mr Major's tactics may have given him something to show his sceptical backbenchers when he returned from the negotiations. He was determined to prove that he had not abandoned his predecessor's legacy. But he has robbed his country of the ability to steer the social legislation of the Community. Second, the British public needs to understand and support the process of European integration. A single market, leading to a single European currency, will oblige British companies and employees to face up to competitive stresses and strains. Why should those same British men and women be denied the benefits of the minimum social and employment legislation that is agreed at a European level, and which will be upheld in every other member state? And has Britain not something to learn from those of its neighbours who have shown that co-operation and partnership can lead to economic success? All of the other member states understand that Europe must have a social face. A specific clause has already been inserted which requires legislation to respect 'national practices'. Another protects the position of 'small and medium-sized undertakings'. The chapter specifically excludes pay, the right of association and the right to strike. All of the legislation so far proposed has arisen not from the Maastricht treaty but from the Single European Act, passed by a Conservative government in the 1980s. Liberal Democrats do have concerns about the corporatist nature of some of the procedures for decision-making within the chapter which could by-pass the elected European Parliament. But the British government has shown no interest in improving the democratic accountability of the Community. In any case, such concerns should not outweigh the desire to see Britain 'at the heart' of the Community, able to participate in all of its deliberations and to shape its institutions. Amendment 27 does not by itself insert the social chapter in the UK's version of the treaty. It is a necessary step towards that end, but it is not in itself sufficient. Even so, the government was claiming until Monday afternoon that the amendment, if carried, would 'wreck' the treaty. Douglas Hurd attempted to raise the stakes further by threatening to ditch the treaty. He sounded petulant and bullying, unsure of his case. Now that the government's case has been blown apart, it is clear that its problems are not technical, but political. On this occasion, Britain would be moving towards its European partners, who would welcome the end of an opt-out. The UK should take further steps to make this possible. With the French elections now upon us, and with a heightened political atmosphere at Westminster, much nonsense will be spoken over the next few weeks about the social chapter on both sides of the Channel. Some will allege 'social dumping'. Conservatives will claim that an opt-out is Britain's only route to prosperity. Labour has persuaded itself that the chapter could return Britain to the days of collectivist industrial relations. The truth is more mundane, but none the less important to Britain. It is in British interests for the Community to move together as 12. Yes, there are problems with the chapter. But these will only be solved with Britain inside a more democratic Community. Last November, Liberal Democrats voted to support the Maastricht treaty in the 'paving' debate. Next month, we shall vote to improve the treaty by supporting the social chapter.

By JEAN MARBELLA, THE BALTIMORE SUN      Why can't a woman be more like a man?"" Prof. Henry Higgins woefully warbled in  puzzlement over his fair lady.    If she were, she would be more aggressive, less communicative and die earlier.  And surely even the irascible professor was not calling for that kind of  equality of the sexes.    Beyond the obvious differences -- and vive la difference many would agree with  the French -- the unique qualities that characterize each of the sexes have  long fascinated everyone from poets to scientists, from women who wonder why  men do not share their feelings to men who grumble about women drivers.    Gender differences in such areas as skills, temperament and life span have been  documented but in many cases disputed. What is inborn and what is learned? How  much is biological and how much is societal?    ""This is the whole story of nature vs. nurture,"" says Dr. Claude Migeon, who  heads the pediatric endocrinology clinic at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.  ""You cannot always tease out one from the other.""    While endlessly fascinating, gender differences also have proven troublesome.  Feminists, for example, naturally are leery of the biology-is-destiny  implications that in the past have prevented women from pursuing ""men's"" work.  And others have argued that the focus should not be on what boys and girls are  born with, but on how their upbringing may lead them to fall into the  stereotypical male or female roles.    ""What people do with their ability is what's important,"" says Camilla Benbow,  an Iowa State University psychologist and researcher in gender differences.  ""Maybe boys and girls come out with slightly different potentials, but how that  potential is expressed is due to their environment.""    What follows is a look at what is known -- and what is not known -- about the  gender gap, from the moment of conception to death.    In the Womb    The genetic die is cast at conception, but it takes a couple of months before  the net result becomes apparent.    At fertilization, the sperm carries either an X or a Y chromosome, which  determines whether the fetus will be female (X) or male (Y). Until the eighth  to 10th week of gestation, however, the fetus looks female, says Migeon.    In a reverse of the Biblical creation of Adam first and Eve second from one of  his ribs, males really spring from females, in the genetic sense.    ""A man is really a female with testosterone,"" Migeon says.    At eight to 10 weeks, gender differentiation begins as the fetus develops  either male or female sex organs.    If the fetus inherited a Y chromosome, it will begin producing testosterone,  the male hormone that, later in life, is responsible for the physical -- and  some believe emotional -- characteristics of males, such as larger skeletons,  facial and body hair.    Babies and toddlers are, of course, much more complicated than fetuses, and  more susceptible to expectations from parents and others. So it gets trickier  to identify genetic differences, and say where they come from -- biology or  environment.    But, experts say, the differences are there.    ""Somewhere around 11 to 12 months, when the mother leaves the room, or puts the  baby to bed, the girl baby becomes kind of withdrawn into herself; she seems  sad,"" says Dr. Taghi Modarressi, a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland.  ""But the boy baby becomes hyperactive, thrashing around.""    At 17 to 18 months, another difference becomes apparent: Girls begin exhibiting  a greater facility with language.    ""Most girls by that age are able to put two words together,"" says Modarressi,  while boys develop that skill a couple of months later. He says girls also  develop other language skills, such as accumulating a vocabulary and making  complete sentences, earlier than boys.    Spatial Skills    Boys, by contrast, develop a better perception of space, he says.    ""If you leave children in an ambiguous situation, with ambiguous markers on  directions,"" says Modarressi, ""the chances for a boy to find the direction out  is better, as early as 2 or 2 1/2 years of age.""    Still, he adds, with the variability of infants and their environments, it is  hard to pin down the differences or locate their origins.

The seemingly incessant testing that goes on in a child's school life has  produced a wealth of data for gender researchers. But interpretations of that  data can prove controversial.    In the past, and in very general terms, males performed better than females on  math tests while the reverse was true on verbal tests.

While hormones are usually viewed in reference to adolescence, when they turn  boys into men and girls into women, they have a lifelong effect.

Besides allowing women to reproduce, estrogen has the added effect of  stimulating the liver to produce more of the ""good"" cholesterol, the  high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs.

By JEAN MARBELLA, THE BALTIMORE SUN      Why can't a woman be more like a man?"" Prof. Henry Higgins woefully warbled in  puzzlement over his fair lady.    If she were, she would be more aggressive, less communicative and die earlier.  And surely even the irascible professor was not calling for that kind of  equality of the sexes.    Beyond the obvious differences -- and vive la difference many would agree with  the French -- the unique qualities that characterize each of the sexes have  long fascinated everyone from poets to scientists, from women who wonder why  men do not share their feelings to men who grumble about women drivers.    Gender differences in such areas as skills, temperament and life span have been  documented but in many cases disputed. What is inborn and what is learned? How  much is biological and how much is societal?    ""This is the whole story of nature vs. nurture,"" says Dr. Claude Migeon, who  heads the pediatric endocrinology clinic at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.  ""You cannot always tease out one from the other.""    While endlessly fascinating, gender differences also have proven troublesome.  Feminists, for example, naturally are leery of the biology-is-destiny  implications that in the past have prevented women from pursuing ""men's"" work.  And others have argued that the focus should not be on what boys and girls are  born with, but on how their upbringing may lead them to fall into the  stereotypical male or female roles.    ""What people do with their ability is what's important,"" says Camilla Benbow,  an Iowa State University psychologist and researcher in gender differences.  ""Maybe boys and girls come out with slightly different potentials, but how that  potential is expressed is due to their environment.""    What follows is a look at what is known -- and what is not known -- about the  gender gap, from the moment of conception to death.    In the Womb    The genetic die is cast at conception, but it takes a couple of months before  the net result becomes apparent.    At fertilization, the sperm carries either an X or a Y chromosome, which  determines whether the fetus will be female (X) or male (Y). Until the eighth  to 10th week of gestation, however, the fetus looks female, says Migeon.    In a reverse of the Biblical creation of Adam first and Eve second from one of  his ribs, males really spring from females, in the genetic sense.    ""A man is really a female with testosterone,"" Migeon says.    At eight to 10 weeks, gender differentiation begins as the fetus develops  either male or female sex organs.    If the fetus inherited a Y chromosome, it will begin producing testosterone,  the male hormone that, later in life, is responsible for the physical -- and  some believe emotional -- characteristics of males, such as larger skeletons,  facial and body hair.    Babies and toddlers are, of course, much more complicated than fetuses, and  more susceptible to expectations from parents and others. So it gets trickier  to identify genetic differences, and say where they come from -- biology or  environment.    But, experts say, the differences are there.    ""Somewhere around 11 to 12 months, when the mother leaves the room, or puts the  baby to bed, the girl baby becomes kind of withdrawn into herself; she seems  sad,"" says Dr. Taghi Modarressi, a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland.  ""But the boy baby becomes hyperactive, thrashing around.""    At 17 to 18 months, another difference becomes apparent: Girls begin exhibiting  a greater facility with language.    ""Most girls by that age are able to put two words together,"" says Modarressi,  while boys develop that skill a couple of months later. He says girls also  develop other language skills, such as accumulating a vocabulary and making  complete sentences, earlier than boys.    Spatial Skills    Boys, by contrast, develop a better perception of space, he says.    ""If you leave children in an ambiguous situation, with ambiguous markers on  directions,"" says Modarressi, ""the chances for a boy to find the direction out  is better, as early as 2 or 2 1/2 years of age.""    Still, he adds, with the variability of infants and their environments, it is  hard to pin down the differences or locate their origins.    ""Nobody can really swear by these things,"" Modarressi says. ""It's so subtle;  it's hard to say. When we talk about inborn, intrinsic maleness and femaleness,  we really don't know what we're talking about.""

Publication of Deng's Hong Kong policy comes a week before the foreign ministers of Britain and China meet in New York to review the progress of bilateral talks about the colony's constitutional development. The 12th round of talks starts in Beijing tomorrow. The meeting comes as hopes are fading in Hong Kong for a Sino-British deal. China has failed to respond to a compromise offered by the UK, and Hong Kong government officials say the two may be weeks away from breaking off dialogue unless Beijing relents. Most observers saw the publication of Deng's thoughts in the context of next week's meeting rather than as China's response to losing its bid to host the Olympics in 2000, although China was angered by Britain publicly opposing the award of the Olympics to Beijing. Publication was carefully co-ordinated, suggesting that China planned it before it knew at 2.30am Beijing time that it has lost its bid. Deng's instructions were splashed across the front pages of the main Communist party newspapers throughout China. Hong Kong's two pro-Beijing newspapers also gave them front page treatment. Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, sought to play down the significance of Deng's instructions. He said they predated by two years the Sino-British Joint Declaration 'which guarantees Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after 1997.' Yesterday was 11 years to the day when Deng met Mrs Thatcher, the former prime minister, to discuss the transfer of the colony to China. His instructions, titled 'Our basic position on the Hong Kong problem', were the record of the conversation he had with her on September 24, 1982. He told Mrs Thatcher that China was interested only in three issues: the question of sovereignty, how China was to administer Hong Kong after 1997, and ways of co-operating with Britain to prevent 'upheavals' in the colony before its return to China. Deng said that in the event of 'serious upheavals' China would make other arrangements for the early recovery of the colony.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.     HKZ  Hong Kong, Asia.

0,FT922-981 ,"FT922-981 _AN-CFYA4ABGFT 920625   FT  25 JUN 92 / Pace of democracy splits Hong Kong legislature      By SIMON HOLBERTON      HONG KONG   HONG KONG'S legislature last night split over the pace of democratisation in the colony, bringing to an end an almost three-year pact which sought more popularly elected seats for the colony's 1995 elections. The members of the legislature voted 25 to 23 against a motion by liberal legislator Mr James McGregor which asked for the Legislative Council's reaffirmation of the October 1989 'Omelco consensus' struck by members of both the Legislative and Executive (cabinet) councils. The Omelco consensus called for a much faster introduction of elective democracy in the colony than Britain and China had previously agreed. For the 1995 elections it proposed that 30, or half, the legislature should be directly elected, instead of the 18 earlier agreed by Beijing and London and the 20 subsequently achieved by the UK through negotiation. The vote underlines the clear divisions over how best to deal with China ahead of the colony's transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Those who voted against Mr McGregor - all of whom were either appointed members or elected to the legislature through a limited franchise - said they saw no possibility of China agreeing to more elective democracy before 1997. It was, therefore, better to work with China rather than unnecessarily angering it, they said. Mr McGregor's supporters - who included all popularly elected politicians - said that only through an increase in representative democracy could the people's rights be safeguarded and Hong Kong be assured of the 'high degree of autonomy' it was promised in 1984 when Britain and China agreed the terms of the transfer of sovereignty. The vote highlights the difficulties facing Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's incoming governor. He will be one of the British government's key advisers on how to deal with China on a range of political issues in the lead up to 1997. But he will have to tender that advice in the full knowledge that he represents a divided community. The decision by the legislature also weakens the position of Britain which has, since early 1990, said it would raise the issue of faster democratisation with the Chinese government. On a visit to the colony in May, Mr Alastair Goodlad, a junior foreign office minister responsible for Hong Kong, said Britain would take up the issue with China soon. In early 1990 the UK had achieved an increase to 18 from 10 popularly elected seats for the 1991 elections and an undertaking from China that no fewer than 20 members would be popularly elected in the 1995 elections. The spirit of this agreement was incorporated into the Beijing-drafted Basic Law  -the colony's post-1997 constitution - and passed by the Chinese parliament in April 1990. China has said repeatedly that it will not change the Basic Law before 1997 and has denounced those who want its amendment as 'subversive'.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

0,FT924-6931 ,"FT924-6931 _AN-CKSC7AAHFT 921119   FT  19 NOV 92 / Brussels in conflict with UK on border controls      By ANDREW HILL      STRASBOURG   BRITAIN and the European Commission have 'not yet found common ground' on the vexed political issue of lifting the UK's border controls on people, according to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner. Mr Bangemann said yesterday the nine continental European members of the Schengen free travel zone were unhappy with a compromise which would allow EC visitors to Britain simply to wave their passports at immigration control after January 1 1993. After meeting Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, in September, Mr Bangemann was widely understood to have agreed British compromise proposals. But in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, the commissioner said he had been misinterpreted and discussions were continuing. 'What I'm interested in is having a practical situation at the borders which shows (member states) are taking on board what we believe is essential, and that is: no regular controls at internal borders.' He believes the Commission position has a strong foundation in EC law, although he said yesterday he did not want a legal dispute with member states on the issue. Britain disagrees with the Commission's legal interpretation and has always argued that controls are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. British officials yesterday agreed that the question of how to resolve the dispute was still open. Mr Bangemann hopes to continue discussions with Mr Clarke when EC immigration ministers meet in London at the end of this month. 'What I need is a declaration that these regular controls will not be exercised (after January 1 1993) and a practical situation demonstrating willingness not to exercise them,' he said yesterday. Britain is not alone in its reluctance to lift border controls on people. Denmark and Ireland also have specific problems, and even the nine Schengen countries are worried that controls on external EC frontiers may not be strong enough to justify lifting border checks so soon.

For good measure, he also rapped Britain's ally over the knuckles for not paying its UN dues. Stressing that Britain had 3,700 troops on UN service, in six different operations, Mr Hurd added pointedly: 'We pay our bills on time (whereas) others who carry a heavy burden of international responsibility do not'. He was sure 'the new US administration will find a remedy for past delays'. Mr Hurd, addressing the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, avoided any direct criticism of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who had said this week that it was 'time for some reorganisation of the UN', including permanent membership of the Security Council for Germany and Japan. Pointing out that Mr Christopher had also acknowledged 'the complexity of that decision', Mr Hurd added: 'You can say that again'. Such a change, he said, would require amendment of the UN Charter and therefore a wide degree of consensus. 'It can't be solved simply by adding Germany and Japan.' Candidates for permanent membership would be very numerous, and the outcome would be 'hard to predict and slow to reach'. Meanwhile, 'the Security Council has to get on with its job'. Mr Hurd also complimented France, a fellow permanent member whose position, like Britain's, might be challenged in any reform. Pointing out that France had more than 6,000 troops on UN service, many of them alongside British soldiers, he remarked: 'In this new world, the interests of Britain and France are increasingly similar and intertwined'. The foreign secretary's main theme, in a wide-ranging address, was that an international effort, 'comparable to those of 1815, 1919 and the years after 1945', was needed 'to avert a continuing slide into disorder', and that Britain wished to play 'a worthy part'. But he stressed that British troops in the former Yugoslavia had 'a humanitarian not an enforcing role', arguing that 'no democracy could justify to its people' the forces and risks that would be required to 'impose and guarantee order' there. Mr Hurd reiterated British support for the Geneva conference on Yugoslavia.   Companies:-  United Nations Security Council.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT911-3345 ,"FT911-3345 _AN-BDYBFACBFT 910425   FT  25 APR 91 / IMF urges cut-off point for benefit      By PETER NORMAN, LISA WOOD and RALPH ATKINS      WASHINGTON, LONDON   A CUT in the length of time during which unemployment benefit is paid in Britain is urged by the International Monetary Fund, which also warns that the UK is facing the deepest recession of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The IMF's suggestion of the benefits limit is a part of a package of measures intended to curb the UK's high level of wage increases. In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that action is needed to increase the responsiveness of British wages to market conditions and to promote labour mobility. It also suggests 'increasing training programmes and improving the functioning of labour exchanges' to prevent a rise in unemployment in the recession similar to the sharp increase witnessed in the early 1980s. Britain must maintain monetary and fiscal policies 'conducive to a substantial downward adjustment in the growth of wages,' the IMF says. While warning of the depth of the recession, the IMF says there is 'little scope for a significant reduction in UK interest rates' unless this is fully justified by sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and clear signs that underlying inflation is falling. IMF projections point to a sharp 2.1 per cent drop in UK gross domestic product this year. Growth next year is forecast at around 1.9 per cent. However, unemployment will keep on rising in 1992 and is expected to average 8.5 per cent of the labour force next year compared to 7.5 per cent this year and just 6 per cent in 1990. Britain faces several years of slow growth, it indicates. Between now and 1996 the IMF expects GDP growth in the UK will lag slightly behind the average annual increase of 2.1 per cent which was seen in the 1980s. The IMF did not elaborate on its suggestion for a cut-off point on unemployment benefit. The government said yesterday that it was keeping the impact of the benefit system on the labour market under review but insisted that it was not considering any proposals to cut the duration of unemployment benefit payments. Basic unemployment benefit, currently Pounds 41.40 a week, is paid in Britain for up to a year, but after that individuals who have no savings can claim indefinite income support at only a slightly lower weekly rate. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'It would be wrong to think that a cut in the period of unemployment benefit would, of itself, bring lower unemployment.' Mr Blair endorsed other comments in the report, saying: 'I would agree with the IMF in the importance of better training, a better employment service and, in particular, we believe it is right now to adopt a temporary work programme to prevent the unemployed becoming long-term unemployed.'

Of course it was bread and circuses, an astoundingly expensive show choreographed and paid for by some of the top brains on Earth - Washington, the CIA, Peking, Kodak, Coca-Cola, Reebok - so as to keep our minds off the woes that wrack our planet. But I am a sucker for a circus. 'Look at this, Miss Lee,' I shouted as my executive assistant entered from the garden where she is supervising the erection of a small Greek temple. 'The Spaniards have done us proud. This is mankind at his finest - 21 goosebumps-per-minute in a show costing millions and beamed out to all of us, billions of us little people, sitting in our homes. They are worshipping the old gods. We are reverting to our roots. The planet is going pagan.' Miss Lee was non-committal, but the energy and oomph of the opening ceremony were still paramount in my mind on Thursday when I was summoned to Barcelona by the UK sports minister, who is lurking in a villa high in the hills to the west of the Olympic city. I did not catch his name, but I was sure it was the sports minister because the topic of our meeting was how to handle the Manchester Olympic Games eight years from now, assuming that Manchester, which is somewhere north of London, succeeds in its bid to stage them. The minister was wearing a variety of sports equipment, including streamlined pixie shoes borrowed from the British cycling squad. 'Hurry up, Julian,' he shouted at his secretary as Julian served mineral water. Julian is a taekwondo black belt and a member of the Young Conservatives. 'Right, Michael,' said the sports minister from behind his fencing mask. 'Chop-chop, quickie-lickie. Tell me, in 200 words, how Manchester can trump Barcelona when Britain stages the millennial Olympics in 2000. Forget the tedious sport. What about the opening ceremony? John Major is giving me untold millions to secure the Games for Manchester. He'll want his money's worth. Do you think this drugs business will foul Britain's chances?' 'Certainly not,' I said. 'Drugs are complicated. Who is to say what's what. As for Manchester's opening ceremony, you Tories can score a massive PR coup, for yourselves and for Britain. 'Take sports technology. Britain leads the world. This week's jubilation over Chris Boardman's superbike was not a flash or fluke. I have been talking to the manufacturers. Britain is poised for a golden breakthrough in all Olympic sports. Have you heard about our Stealth javelin? It flies out of the stadium. Or our breakthrough discus? Our leading-edge archery bow or our carbopolyphilla-333 arrows? Our 21st century yachting keels? Our hush-hush rifle with antigrav sights in which Nato is sorely interested? The new British volleyball? Handball? Tennis ball? Boxing glove? Sabre? Swimwear? Hockey stick?' The minister was scribbling furiously; Julian had started to whoop. 'Some of these British inventions are still in pre-production, but others are set to roll. At the Seoul Olympics four years ago, minister, Britain finished 12th out of 160 nations on the medal table. But my projections show that by the time of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Britain will be equipped to win 78 per cent of all available medals. Four years after that: 96 per cent. 'This technological majesty must star in the Manchester show. And it is not just sports equipment. There is plenty more to make a fuss about - Britain's achievements down the ages as well as our current renaissance. 'It was Britain that smashed the atom, invented the egg-timer and the roulette wheel. Also the double-boiler. We invented almost everything. Britain leads the space race. We are discovering miracle processes faster than the Japanese. Our wine makers are peerless, our fashion better than Paris's, our film industry eclipsing Hollywood. And what about our songs?

During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten repeatedly  advocated that Hong Kong was an ""international asset,"" and such  a concept gravely violates the most fundamental principle laid  down in the Joint Declaration. The most basic principle in the  Joint Declaration is that the recovery of Hong Kong is the  common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, the Chinese  Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong effective 1 July 1997, and the Government of the  United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to the  PRC effective 1 July 1997. This basic principle in the Joint  Declaration shows that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of  China's sacred territory, and by no means is it an  ""international asset."" Chris Patten said that the Chinese  side's criticism of his visit to Australia shows it is ""playing  the international card"" and ""has a lack of understanding of Hong  Kong's role and importance in the world."" According to Chris  Patten's logic, all cities that have an important role in the  world are inevitably ""international assets."" However, no one  would fail to see the important role of such cities as London  and New York in the world, can we say that those cities are  ""international assets"" too? Does it follow that all countries  may possess them and share their assets? Obviously, Britain  would not agree with that point, nor would the United States  tolerate it. Chris Patten's wicked motive lies in instigating  all countries to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs, thus impeding  China's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  by relying on international political forces.    During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also said:  ""Britain has a moral obligation to Hong Kong after 1997,"" ""the  idea that the Joint Declaration means to say that Britain will  no longer have moral obligations and interests in Hong Kong is  entirely contradictory."" This is a distortion and vilification  of the Joint Declaration, which stipulates that British rule in  Hong Kong will terminate in 1997: where do British ""moral  obligations"" come in after 1997? Chris Patten's big lie can  fool no one. One has only to read the article, entitled, ""Our  Basic Position on the Issue of Hong Kong,"" and its annotations  in volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  to have a clear picture that, in the course of the Sino-British  talks on the future of Hong Kong, the British side repeatedly  insisted on its position of prolonging its right to rule over  Hong Kong and maintaining British influence over Hong Kong after  1997. Nevertheless, the British side's stubborn position  deservedly met with the Chinese side's firm opposition. It was  under such circumstances that the British side had to sign the  Joint Declaration. On this point, Mrs. Thatcher recorded  clearly in her memoirs, ""The Downing Street Years,"" in which she  said that on 14 October 1983, she sent a letter to the Chinese  side: ""At this point, I have to make the decision that we shall  return sovereignty to China as well as the right to rule,"" ""this  shows that we do not expect that power links between Britain and  Hong Kong will continue to exist after 1997, and Britain will no  longer have any obligations toward Hong Kong."" Related  annotations in the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  also indicate that in the wake of the British Prime Minister's  letter of October 1983, ""the British side has ascertained that  it would no longer insist on British rule nor would it plan for  any form of condominium, and has the understanding that China's  plan is founded on the prerequisite that sovereignty and right  of rule of Hong Kong in their entirety should be returned to  China after 1997. Thus, the removal of the main hurdle to  Sino-British talks began."" Therefore, we can see that Chris  Patten's remarks that ""the idea that the Joint Declaration means  to say Britain has no moral obligations and interests in Hong  Kong after 1997 is entirely contradictory"" runs counter to the  true meaning of the Joint Declaration as well as historical  facts.    During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also threatened:  ""If we think the Chinese are violating the solemn commitments  they have made in the Joint Declaration, we are sure to raise  this question in the international community...I am sure Britain  will inevitably make some choices."" The truth is that the  British side has violated the Joint Declaration and its  commitment to converge with the Basic Law and the Sino-British  diplomatic understanding and accords, but Chris Patten went to  the Australia and made false countercharges against the Chinese  side in an attempt to confuse public opinion and shift the  responsibility to the Chinese side; at the same time, he  presented the British ""choices"" characterized by the ""three  violations"" to the international community to dupe people the  world over and fool them into giving their support. However,  all this is in vain. During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten  made many remarks which obviously violate the Joint Declaration;  in actual fact, he has only revealed the evil plots of the  British side in its attempts to thoroughly break faith with the  Joint Declaration. It would be helpful to the international  community and public opinion to have a clear picture of the  truth, and see through his hypocrisy. This being the case, the  ""international card"" Chris Patten played during his visit to  Australia can only help the British side in the opposite  direction.    As the Hong Kong governor who must be responsible for  maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and realizing a  stable transition in the last few years of the transition period  according to the stipulations of the Joint Declaration, should  Chris Patten have gone to another country to distort and trample  on the Joint Declaration, should he have stirred up trouble;  this shows that Chris Patten has not the slightest intention to  maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and to insure the  smooth transfer of government according to the stipulations of  the Joint Declaration. Whereas the British Government has given  a free hand to Chris Patten to talk a lot of nonsense in the  international community and spread remarks that obviously  violate the Joint Declaration. This also exposed the British  Government in its attempts to openly express its position of  refusing to implement the Joint Declaration to the international  community. Such a practice is rare in the history of  international relations and is amazing. Regarding this, we must  show grave concern. However, China's position of resolutely  safeguarding its sovereignty and implementing the Joint  Declaration will not move a bit. The British Government should  rein in from the brink of the precipice and should take  responsibility to publicly clarify Chris Patten's absurd remarks.     "
0,FT943-2156 ,"FT943-2156 _AN-EIUDKAA0FT 940921   FT  21 SEP 94 / UK calls for African peacekeeping body      By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent      CAPE TOWN   Britain yesterday called for a fresh international effort to bring peace to Africa through a regional peace-keeping organisation based on the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the UK wanted to work with South Africa and other African countries to 'turn the tide' against violence and war on the continent. Mr Major announced the initiative during an historic address to an informal joint sitting of parliament at the beginning of the first official visit to South Africa by a British prime minister since 1960. Earlier, he met South African President Nelson Mandela for talks on rebuilding the two countries' traditionally close relationship, which was weakened during South Africa's international isolation under the former whites-only government. Officials said the talks were conducted in 'an atmosphere of great warmth', suggesting that the ANC-led government of national unity has forgiven Britain for its less than enthusiastic endorsement of sanctions against the former regime. Mr Major urged South Africa to join the international community in bringing prosperity to the whole of Africa by helping to pre-empt outbreaks of violence, rather than trying to limit trouble after it had started. 'An entirely new effort at preventive diplomacy is long overdue. With our friends in Africa . . . Britain wants to develop new mechanisms to head off conflicts before they become unstoppable,' he said. 'We have in mind, for example, setting up regional peacekeeping cells. We need more people trained to mediate and act as peace brokers. We would not need a cumbersome bureaucracy, but a tight and properly resourced infrastructure in Africa.' The British proposals will be spelled out in more detail to the United Nations next week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has long sought a bigger role for pre-emptive mediation in international peacekeeping efforts. However, officials said the plan was intended to build on a recent resolution by the Organisation of African Unity calling for better conflict resolution procedures on the continent. They said the initiative was not intended to involve large numbers of troops, although the final shape of the peacekeeping force was likely to be determined by the UN and the OAU.

0,FT942-7833 ,"FT942-7833 _AN-EEYBKACFFT 940524   FT  24 MAY 94 / Conservatives enter the fray with a balancing act      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The balancing act is encapsulated in the manifesto's title: A strong Britain in a strong Europe. The Conservatives will be positive about Europe before the June 9 poll for the Strasbourg assembly. But the party will be more positive still about its determination to get Britain's way in Europe. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and author of the manifesto, has managed to exclude from the text the more extreme demands of colleagues on the anti-European right of the party. The doors are not slammed completely on the possibility of an eventual return to the European exchange rate mechanism - or of participation in a single European currency. There is no promise of the referendum sought by the Euro-sceptics on the next stage of European integration. As Mr John Major says in the document's foreword, the argument it advances is not framed in terms of Europe Right or Wrong but Europe Right or Left. It is the ambitions of the socialist centralisers for Europe's institutions that the government abhors, not the institutions themselves. But the manifesto's tone reflects the mood of a party willing to accept, even embrace, Europe if that can be done on Britain's terms; but quick to reject it if anyone else threatens to set the agenda. It is as defensive as it is positive. First the positive. Mr Major dismisses at the outset the idea floated by some on the Conservative right that Britain might in the next few years have to reassess whether it should belong to the EU. Its opening words state baldly: 'Our membership of the European Union is vital to Britain.' Mr Major reinforced that point at yesterday's launch when he ridiculed the notion of a repeat of the 1975 referendum on membership. A lengthy section on the European economy makes the same point. Britain's trade, its inward investment and its employment prospects are all linked inextricably to the EU. The manifesto argues that the government is winning the debate over the need for a new focus on competitiveness, flexible labour markets and de-regulation. Pledging the government's determination to promote free trade and the completion of the single market, it adds: 'Open markets are the Oxygen of Growth.' To that end Britain will press for further liberalisation of the telecommunications, transport and energy sectors. The manifesto is replete with examples of where the government has set the agenda for the rest of Europe: in the push for subsidiarity; in the promotion of intergovernmental co-operation at Maastricht; and in the acceleration of enlargement. But for every positive idea there is a plan or ambition that the Conservatives will thwart - and a charge that Labour and the Liberal Democrats would sell Britain's interests short. Conservatives will resist any move to increase the present limits on EU spending or any threat to the rebate Britain receives on its contribution to Brussels. The government will defend implacably the British veto. As Mr Major puts it in his foreword: 'We want less interference from Brussels not more.' The prime minister has been told by opinion pollsters that this negative message has the best hope of persuading disgruntled supporters to vote Conservative on June 9. The odds are that it will quickly drown out the positive.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

But the proposal being aired at the Lisbon European Community Summit to return many environmental powers to nation states are, quite frankly, bonkers. Take the example of bathing water quality. Your article on the Summit outcome ('A state of limbo in Lisbon', June 29) suggested that Chancellor Kohl of Germany viewed bathing water quality as a prime candidate for return to nation states. He is ignoring the simple fact that pollution and environmental degradation are no respecters of national boundaries nor coastlines. The toxic waste which Britain still dumps in the North Sea does not necessarily stay in British territorial waters, but could well end up blackening beaches of other EC nations. Mr Kohl should have learnt that lesson from the decades of unchecked pollution that the old West Germany suffered from its East German neighbours. As Britain takes up the presidency of the Council of Ministers one of the key tasks of the Community in the next few years will be to bring together nations to protect and promote the environment. If Britain cannot break the diplomatic deadlock over the setting up and siting of the proposed European Environmental Bureau then the environment secretary, Michael Howard, should push forward with his idea of an environmental inspectorate. It is better compliance with EC law that is needed - not a retreat from Community-wide laws to protect one country from the pollution of others.

Although he is not coming to discuss the issue of Hong Kong,  he should be coming to improve Sino-British relations and resume  friendship and cooperation. Otherwise, the visit will be  meaningless.    Some newspapers in Hong Kong have expressed a welcome for  Goodlad's upcoming visit to China and have held that this is a  sign of improvement in Sino-British relations.    In the past few years, Britain has erroneously estimated the  situation in China and has changed its policy toward China, thus  harming the friendship and cooperation between China and  Britain. China has not developed in the direction of the  illusions cherished by Britain but instead, has become more  open, more prosperous, and stronger. Practice has proved that  the British Government's confrontation with China goes against  the global tide, does harm to its own interests, and does not  have the support of the people. China is a vast market with an  extremely large potential and is a country that holds the  balance of the world. Whoever ignores her or even has trouble  with her will come to grief. Not long ago, the Clinton  administration was uncompromising in insisting on linking human  rights with trade and claimed that it would not extend China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status if China did not ""improve  its human rights"" situation according to their instructions.  The Clinton administration had no alternative but to succumb to  the reality of China's extraordinary development and finally  extended China's MFN status without any conditions attached,  expressing its willingness to strengthen trade and economic  cooperation with China. At present, some economically large  countries in the world are trying to have closer ties and  cooperation with China. Can the British people think of why  their government wants to have confrontation with China instead  of taking an approach in the interests of the people? Recently,  the Conservative Party of the British Prime Minister John Major  suffered a total defeat in the parliamentary elections, losing  all five seats; this was followed by bitter defeat in the  European Council elections in which nearly half of the original  32 seats were lost mainly to the opposition, the Labor Party.  This has evidently shown the voters' dissatisfaction with the  British Government and John Major's position is in danger.  Under such circumstances, the Major administration has no  alternative but to look for some way out. Trying to improve  relations with China and to resume cooperation is one of the way  out.    The key to improving Sino-British relations is that Britain  must abandon its erroneous policy of confrontation with China.  A report issued recently by the Foreign Affairs Select  Committee of the British Parliament discloses the situation of  changes in the policy toward China by the British Government in  recent years and also counsels the British Government about  continuing its confrontation with China, thus adding fuel to the  fire. If the British Government really wants to resume  Sino-British cooperation, it must make an open statement on its  stance toward that report.    People will judge whether or not Britain has the sincerity  to  improve its relations with China by its actions. Although  Alastair Goodlad's visit to China is not for discussing the Hong  Kong issue, he cannot avoid touching upon the Hong Kong issue  and his visit cannot have any impact on how to handle the issue  of Hong Kong. What Chris Patten practices in Hong Kong will be  an important expression of the change in the British  Government's policy toward China. If Alastair Goodlad really  comes to improve relations and to resume cooperation, he should  urge the British side to create an atmosphere of cooperation on  the issue of Hong Kong and to negotiate and solve together with  the Chinese side, some pressing problems such as those  concerning the new airport, the military use of land, and so on.    Regarding the political structure, it is impossible to have  Sino- British cooperation because the basis for such cooperation  has been completely destroyed by the British side. Qian Qichen,  State Council Vice premier and concurrently Foreign Minister,  reaffirmed yesterday: ""It does not matter whatever plan the  1994 and 1995 elections are carried out, the terms of office of  those elected will only last till 30 June 1997 and after that,  the councils concerned will be reorganized"". However, China and  Britain can cooperate in issues other than the issue of  political structure, such as economic and social issues and  issues concerning the people's livelihood. The Chinese side has  always been sincere in such cooperation. So long as the  proposals conform with the principle of state sovereignty and  smooth transition and are in the interests of the economic and  social development of Hong Kong and of the peaceful and  contented lives and work of the residents, the Chinese side will  adopt a positive attitude to negotiate with the British side and  to solve all the problems in a fair and reasonable manner. Vice  Premier Qian Qichen said that the breaking down of talks on the  elections in 1994 and 1995 was something of the past and at  present, the two sides should seek opportunities for cooperation  on other issues.    Regarding solutions to problems of the new airport and land  for military use, Qian Qichen, State Council Vice Premier and  concurrently Foreign Minister, Lu Ping, director of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Chen Zuoer, representative of  the Chinese side on the Defense and Social Order Subcommittee,  have in the past few days adopted optimistic attitudes. They  all believe that progress has been made in the talks and hope  that agreements can be reached earlier rather than later. This  shows that the Chinese side sincerely hopes to cooperate with  the British side.    It seems the British side has been put to the test. If the  British side shows a cooperative attitude at meetings of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and is willing to listen to  fair and reasonable views from the Chinese side, the two sides  will be able to reach agreements on the new airport and land for  military use and this will show Alastair Goodlad's sincerity to  improve relations and resume cooperation in his visit to China.    In short, since Alastair Goodlad wants to seek cooperation  in  Beijing, he should create a favorable atmosphere for cooperation  before he starts his trip. This should be shown not only in  words but also in deeds. Talking about Alastair Goodlad's visit  to China, British Ambassador to China Robin McClaren said that  the British side hoped to resume better relations but denied  that the British side hoped to readjust the policy for  Sino-British relations during the visit. We can only ask: Can  China and Britain resume ""better relations"" if the policy toward  China is not readjusted? What is the meaning of the remarks by  the ambassador?     "

Thomas Norman, Royal Marines, who was fatally wounded in  the epic battle off Trafalgar in 1805, lie in a tiny cemetery at the foot of  Main Street. Nearby, the Barbary Ape Take Away advertises fast food: breaded  haddock and Spanish omelets. The apes themselves still gambol, under government  subsidy, on the limestone cliffs thrusting, defiantly British, out of the blue  Mediterranean Sea.    Gibraltar's fortress image lingers, but the Rock is shifting.      Bankbooks in Fashion    Bankbooks are more fashionable now than gun ports on an outpost long prized as  an impregnable sentry at the western entrance to the Mediterranean. Residents,  recognizing that forts are as passe as dreadnoughts, predict a profitable role  for themselves as an offshore adjunct to the new Europe.    ""We're transforming ourselves from a fortress to a city,"" J. H. Bautista, an  adviser to the Gibraltar government's ambitious attempt to transform the Rock  into a major financial center, said recently.    Amid economic ferment, a feisty hometown spirit is growing in Europe's last  colony. After three centuries, the people who live here are demanding a piece  of their Rock.    If there is no room for nationalism on 2 1/4 square miles of precipitate  limestone, then call it village-ism. What it means is that the 22,000 polyglot  people want a controlling say in their future.    This late-blooming assertion of local fervor may ultimately aggravate the  British, who have controlled Gibraltar since 1704, as much as it irritates the  Spanish, who for nearly as long have demanded the Rock's return.    ""What's wrong with our being prosperous?"" said Joe Garcia, editor of a weekly  newspaper here. ""How can 22,000 souls be so threatening to two such big  countries? This is our homeland. There is no other. We've never been Spanish,  and although we identify with the British, I don't think we've ever trusted  their governments.""      New Socialist Government    Change on the Rock is being accelerated by a labor-based Socialist majority  elected a year ago in the first philosophical change of local government since  World War II.    ""The Gibraltar people are a free European community entitled to exercise  freedom of choice,"" said Gibraltar's new chief minister, 48-year-old Joe  Bossano, a union man.    Bossano and his allies argue that there must be room for Gibraltar in the  frontier-free Europe promised in 1992, just as there is for other ""Euroquirks""  like Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Liechtenstein.    Down the road, Bossano and many of his constituents envision some sort of free  association with Britain, or with a united Europe, that would make Gibraltar  master of its own rock.    ""The right to our land is at the bottom of our position,"" said acting Chief  Minister Joe Pilcher, filling in for Bossano, who was traveling. ""We agree that  we are a very small country, but we have as much right of existence as anybody  else. Gibraltar wants to become self-sufficent. Only that would assure our  independence.""    The British government says it will respect the wishes of the people of  Gibraltar in any political rejiggering.    ""We have an absolute commitment that Gibraltar will not pass to anybody else's  sovereignty against its wishes,"" Deputy Gov. William Quantrill, a British  diplomat, said. ""We are not going to sell out Gibraltar for the sake of our  relations with Spain.""      Garrison Cutback    But a recently announced cutback in the size of the British garrison has made  some people nervous and will certainly have an economic impact on a colony  where military spending has always been an economic mainstay.    ""We accept the cutback without liking it,"" said Michael Feetham, minister of  trade and industry in the new government. ""At the same time, while we are  deeply bonded with Great Britain and have full faith in our long-term  relationship, we must plan to use our own resources without help from Britain.  We're on our own. That's a challenge we accept.""    In all, about 31,000 people live on the Rock. There are 5,000 British military  and 26,000 civilians, of whom 22,000 can claim a relative living on the Rock in  1925. That makes them officially Gibraltarian.    So it is that Britain's rock is patrolled by dressed-for-Piccadilly bobbies  who, like their brethren Gibraltarenos, are equally at home in both English and  Spanish, often in the same sentence. This is a Gibraltar tradition. Another is  a dish called calentita, a chickpea pie brought to the Rock by fishermen from  Genoa.    Along with the Genoese in the years after Britain wrested Gibraltar from Spain  came Maltese, Portuguese, Spaniards and Sephardic Jews from Morocco, a group  whose 600 descendants here wield great economic influence today. Recent  immigrants include about 2,000 Moroccan workers. The mix is leavened by former  British servicemen who never went home.    ""The Rock has molded a people who are different,"" said Peter Montegriffo, a  young lawyer who is a leader of the opposition to Bossano. ""Gibraltar is a  unique Mediterranean community. Spanish? My God, I'm not Spanish! (He said this  in Spanish.) But I'm not British either. (In English.) When we go to school in  England we realize how different we are ethnically and culturally. They drink  beer, play rugby, have all that bad weather. . . .""      Scandinavians and Arabs    On a recent day at Gibraltar's Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned, the marriage  banns of Brian Consigliero and Helen Martinez were posted. The Rock is  overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, but while Bishop Bernard Patrick Devlin said  noonday Mass, the Main Street throng in front of his church included  Scandinavian tourists in shorts, shopping Spaniards, off-duty British  servicemen (a sprinkling of them black), Arab women muffled from toes to nose  and a gray-suited Jewish businessman in a yarmulke.    ""Until the border was closed, we were just a bunch of people who lived on a  rock,"" said Devlin, who came from County Cork four decades ago to preach.    To press Spanish claims, dictator Francisco Franco closed the land border in  1969, forcing Gibraltarians to look inward. The frontier was not fully reopened  until 1985 and is still subject to the caprice of Spanish immigration and  customs inspectors.    ""None of us will ever forget it,"" recalled Clive Cooms, the 46-year-old clerk  of Gibraltar's Parliament. ""Nothing moved. Franco stopped even the oxygen for  the hospitals and the Communion wine. As a result, my kids -- the whole younger  generation -- want nothing to do with Spain. The Spanish say we're more British  than the British, and, well, if we do paint the town red, white and blue now  and again, it's because we know it annoys them. If Mongolia plays Spain in  soccer, the Rock roots for Mongolia.""    Visiting Spanish tourists encounter no visible tension, but scratch a  Gibraltarian and you'll find a Rock patriot with no love for Spain.    ""Franco gave identity to this place,"" said Sam Benzaquen, a Main Street  merchant whose Sephardic family came to Gibraltar from Morocco in about 1750.  ""He fused us into one people. We're pro-British but not English. We're  anti-Spanish. The British now seek a modus vivendi with Spain. Will they try to  divorce us?""    The last time Britain asked Gibraltarians if they wanted to align with Spain,  in 1967, the answer was no by a vote of 12,138 to 44.    Tensions with Spain have eased in the democratic years since Franco's death,  and particularly since Spain joined the European Community in 1986. Under Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Spain maintains its case for the recovery of  territory ceded to Britain in perpetuity under a 1713 treaty, but not at a  level that would sour relations between Spain and its British partners in a new  Europe.    Under its 1969 constitution, Gibraltar is internally self-governing; Britain  retains responsibility for foreign affairs and defense. The Rock remains an  important base for British forces, but the economy, once tied to military  spending, is now linked more closely to private enterprise.      Tourism, Financial Services    Tourism and offshore financial services, both growing, are bigger moneymakers  than the old Royal Navy shipyard, which is now administered by the Gibraltar  government.    With no taxes levied on non-residents, the number of banks in Gibraltar has  grown from five to 23 since 1985, according to financial adviser Bautista. One  of the banks opened 10,000 new accounts in the first six months of last year,  when the Rock's economy grew by 6%. About 9,000 offshore companies are  registered here, four times as many as when the land border with Spain was  reopened in 1985.    Tourism has increased to 3.5 million visitors a year, most of them day-trippers  from Spain.    Gibraltar has become an important banking and shopping annex for several  hundred thousand British and Northern European snowbirds who have settled along  the Costa del Sol between Gibraltar and Malaga. Supermarkets that stock British  goods are popular; so are cheap electronics and so, for reasons Gibraltarians  cannot fathom, are umbrellas.    At present, Spain and Britain are both frustrated by Gibraltarian  intransigence. The 15-member Gibraltar House of Assembly is balking, 15 to 0,  at an attempt by Britain and Spain to ease their historic enmity over the Rock  by allowing joint commercial use of the Gibraltar airport.    A bilateral agreement would allow travelers bound for Spain to have a separate  exit and clear Spanish immigration and customs without reference to Gibraltar  authorities. Gibraltar's approval is required, though, and in the assembly the  concept is regarded unanimously as an unacceptable surrender of Gibraltarian  sovereignty.      Few Direct Flights    Until there is an airport agreement, one of Gibraltar's peculiarities will  continue to be that you can't get there from here. The only direct flights are  from Britain or Tangier, Morocco. Otherwise, a visitor must fly to Malaga and  then drive three hours along what little the developers have left of the Costa  del Sol. En route, the Spanish disgust with England's Rock is manifest: There  is not a single road sign mentioning Gibraltar.    Gibraltarians are betting that the prospect of a unified, frontier-free Europe  will make historic antagonisms seem out of step and old fashioned. Even if they  are wrong, the Gibraltarenos say, they are by now as wed to their Rock as to  the Barbary apes, who have survived 15 sieges and two world wars.    Britain, legend says, will remain on the Rock as long as the apes are here.  During World War II, Winston Churchill took that lore seriously enough to send  a secret mission into the Atlas Mountains of North Africa for reinforcements  when the ape population dwindled.    By tradition, the apes figured on the muster list of the British army garrison.  Now, in a sign of the changing times, the apes, all 67 of them, are on the  rolls of the locally raised Gibraltar Regiment.    There are even fresh breezes blowing at Ape's Den, according to Cpl. Ernest  Asques, who commands there. Michael, longtime boss of the ape pack that  tourists see, seems to be on his way out. An interloper named David, a newcomer  from the wild pack of apes that roam the north end of the Rock, appears to be  ready to take over, Asques says.    GIBRALTAR: 'THE ROCK'    The 2 1/4-square-mile island has been controlled by Britain since 1704.    About 31,000 people live on the Rock: 5,000 British military personnel and  26,000 civilians.

0,FT911-60 ,"FT911-60 _AN-BENBQAE4FT 910514   FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Delors overture fails to unite Conservatives - European Union      By RALPH ATKINS   EUROPEAN Commission suggestions for compromise on economic and monetary union showed little sign yesterday of uniting the Conservatives on Europe - or of tapping undiscovered goodwill among Tory MPs to Mr Jacques Delors, the commission's president. Suggestions at the weekend that Britain be allowed to sign a treaty without agreeing on the final goals did nothing to alter the well-rehearsed convictions of Tories at Westminster. The anti-federalists, with the Bruges Group in the vanguard, remained opposed to any deal by which Britain would accept, even tacitly, a single currency. The most 'pro-Europe' Tories were anxious for Britain to react positively. Those in the middle remained sceptical of Mr Delors' vision for Europe and anxious to avoid being 'bounced' into a treaty the UK might regret. Not even an opportunity to defer awkward decisions beyond the election swayed firmly-entrenched views. Words of encouragement were qualified by warnings that the small print had to be examined carefully. The government's reaction was also cautious. If a decision was to be deferred for a future parliament, all options had to be kept open. The 'hard Ecu' remained on the table. But officials admitted the European Commission had at least show 'an appreciation of the UK's concerns'. For some MPs who strongly opposed a single European currency, Mr Delors' suggestion was acceptable only if it was clear Britain was defering the decision on whether to accept such a move - not just the timing. And there was no deadline for a decision. One right-wing minister said: 'If we can dither indefinitely, it's fine. If there is a cut-off point to the dithering, it's a fraud,' Mr Patrick Robertson, secretary of the Bruges Group, said: 'Any compromise which makes Britain accept a single European currency in principle would be completely unacceptable. At present there is not enough information anywhere to be clear exactly what the form of words would be.' Mr Teddy Taylor, secretary of the European Reform Group, went as far as saying: 'If the government could negotiate an arrangement 'without commitment' we feel that this would be a very major advance in the battle to preserve our freedom and to safeguard the nation against socialist control and bureaucracy.' But Mr William Cash, the prominent anti-Federal Europe MP for Stafford, said it was 'unrealistic' to expect what amounted to a two-tier Europe to work in practice. Among the middle ground of the party, there was anxiety, to be seen as pro-European, like Mr John Major. But there was suspicion about Mr Delors' blueprint for Emu. Mr Terence Higgins, chairman of the Commons' Treasury select committee, said Mr Delors, 'thinks he is losing the argument' and so was trying to get British agreement for allowing other EC members to proceed on a pre-determined timetable. For most on the pro-European wing, however, the plan was another opportunity the UK appeared set to rebuff. Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, said: 'How crazy it is that even when the commission president proposes a helpful compromise, meeting specific British hesitations, it is denounced by a small number of hysterical anti-marketeers.'

0,FT932-5879 ,"FT932-5879 _AN-DFBBWAADFT 930602   FT  02 JUN 93 / UK will challenge EC rule on 48-hour week      By DAVID GARDNER and ROBERT TAYLOR      LUXEMBOURG, LONDON   THE UK for the first time faces having to legislate to guarantee British workers' mandatory time off, after its 11 EC partners yesterday voted through the Community's working time directive, the so-called 48-hour-week law. But Britain said it would challenge the directive at the European Court of Justice and would not start putting it on the UK statute book until that ruling came through. After blocking the measure for nearly three years, Britain abstained yesterday, in the face of its partners' determination to force through what they regard as a much-needed gesture towards reinforcing workers' rights. The UK is challenging the legal basis of the directive, proposed by the European Commission as a health and safety measure and thus requiring a majority vote rather than unanimity. This deprived the UK of its national veto. But over the past 15 months, Britain has negotiated assiduously to dilute the impact of the measure, while making light of its possible impact, which would be mostly in the UK. Both British and Brussels officials privately concur that the UK's legal challenge is unlikely to succeed. Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, claimed the Commission had abused its treaty powers and said: 'I am confident we will win' in the court. But he was keen at the same time to emphasise that 'we have drawn most of the teeth from this directive', which in its original form would have been 'inflexible, extremely damaging, and placed enormous burdens on British industry'. The UK secured a 10-year grace period before it might have to introduce the 48-hour week, which its partners must implement within three years. After the additional seven years, there will be a 'review' of the derogation, leaving open the possibility that it may be extended. British workers who want to work more than 48 hours a week will be able to do so; those who do not will have the protection of the law. Employers will have to keep records of both categories, for inspection by national health and safety authorities whose job it will be to ensure no discrimination. But workers in the UK will for the first time have the legal right to: A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours. Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours. At least one day a week off. No more than eight hours a shift on average for night work. Four weeks' annual paid holiday, although the UK would have to guarantee only three weeks for the six years after the directive is formally adopted, probably in seven months' time. There are exemptions on the working week rules for transport, agriculture, fisheries, all work at sea such as the offshore oil industry, and - at UK insistence - for doctors in training. Ireland and Denmark are the only other countries affected by the 48-hour week limit. Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal will have to extend guaranteed paid leave; and these countries, plus Greece and the Netherlands, will have to modify laws on time off. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the government's undertaking not to implement the directive in the UK until its legality was determined by the European Court. But Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'Once again Britain is the odd one out in Europe. It will send the signal to potential investors that it is less committed to Europe than our competitors.' Observer, Page 17   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

What will  be the next step taken by China then, and how will Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability be maintained through ""self-reliance""?  These are not only questions for which people overseas are  showing great concern, but also questions raised by many people  in China.    In Beijing, some democratic personages whom I know very well  have raised the following questions in private talks as if by  prior agreement:    ""Have violent changes taken place in Hong Kong?""    ""Has Chris Patten put Hong Kong in a wretched state?""    ""Has the Sino-British Joint Declaration been unilaterally  abandoned by the British side?""    ""If we had known it would come to this, we would have acted  differently. Since China and Britain are sharing the same bed  but dreaming different dreams, we should not have suggested  cooperation in the transitional period long ago. Could we not  see the `sequel' now?""    These people did not pay much attention to the Hong Kong  issue before, but how do they appear to be experts now? After  making inquiries, I learned that, recently, the CPC has in  various relevant units whipped up opinion about and made great  efforts to expose Britain's ""schemes and intrigues"" on the Hong  Kong issue. Apart from the need to speak along the same lines  externally, the practice is also aimed at unifying people's  thinking within the country.    To the executors of the CPC's policies on Hong Kong and  Macao, turning against the British is both a bad thing and a  good thing. If Hong Kong's transition is smooth and anything  unexpected happens in Hong Kong after 1997, the responsibility  will rest on the Chinese side. Now that the British side has  put forth Chris Patten's package and the Chinese side has  thoroughly criticized it, once anything bad happens in Hong Kong  in the future, the responsibility will rest on the side of the  British colonialists.    Lu Ping: Seeds of Trouble Buried by the British Side Will  Be Intolerable    On 15 December, on behalf of the State Council, Lu Ping,  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Jiang  Enzhu, representative of the Chinese side in the Sino-British  talks, held a special meeting in the Guangdong Hall of the Great  Hall of the People to brief the leaders of various democratic  parties and mass organizations on the situation of the  Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political system. They also  answered questions raised by the participants.    Lu Ping spoke first. He said: The British authorities have  made use of Hong Kong's transitional period and have  intentionally raised a political challenge against the Chinese  Government. Judging from its usual practice before withdrawing  from its colonies, it is by no means a new strategy. Before the  signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese  Government and relevant departments had already made certain  ideological preparations. In the spring of 1990, we made  several concrete preparations. Now, in our preparatory work, we  must grasp the work firmly and substantively on the one hand  and, on the other, pay close attention to violent changes in  Hong Kong's political and economic fields created by the British  side and the development of trends. We must be prepared to deal  with such changes. Now, work concerning arrangements for this  has already been completed. China will not allow and will not  tolerate Britain willfully creating and burying seeds of  political disturbance and economic collapse in Hong Kong during  the transitional period.    ""Six Basic Factors Concerning Britain's Challenge Against  the Chinese Government""    What are the ""seeds of political disturbance and economic  collapse""? Lu Ping made a detailed analysis of this. He  believes that Britain changed its China policy and presented a  challenge to the Chinese Government for the following basic  reasons:    1. Mistakes in analyzing and assessing China's political  situation.    2. Mistakes in understanding China's resolution and  timetable for taking back Hong Kong's sovereignty and  administrative power.    3. An erroneous estimation of the ability of the Chinese  Government and Chinese people, including patriotic compatriots  in Hong Kong, to administer Hong Kong.    4. An attempt to make use of the changes in the  international political climate, the disintegration of the  Soviet Union, and the changes in eastern Europe to change its  policy and strategy on China.    5. A belief that since China and Hong Kong maintain close  economic relations at present, China will not take over Hong  Kong earlier even if Britain violates the three documents.    6. A belief that since Hong Kong's economy plays a  positive role in the Chinese economy, and the United States,  Japan, and other countries have investments in Hong Kong, China  will tolerate Britain extending its colonialist rule under the  economic card.    Lu Ping Indirectly Admits That Sino-British Joint  Declaration Has Become Ineffective    Judging from the six factors summed up by Lu Ping, in the  eyes of the Chinese side, Britain has attempted to ""go its own  way"" in Hong Kong because it has made a wrong appraisal of the  situation and has thus buried ""seeds of trouble"" there, which  may lead to political disturbances and economic collapse. But  many participants in the meeting asked for an explanation of  these anti-British remarks. One of the questions raised by the  participants, with which people were showing the greatest  concerns for, was whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as  an international agreement, would continue to be effective.    Lu Ping gave the following answer to this delicate question:  As the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been repeatedly  damaged and undermined, its existence and binding force have  lost their legitimate significance and it cannot play its due  role. This is common knowledge in international relations.  Britain has brazenly gone against to the written agreement and  understandings between the two governments. This is a rare  practice in international contacts. Therefore, we will make a  resolute decision in light of the development of the trend. The  timetable is in our hands. All independent countries put their  sovereignty and overall interests of the state above everything  else.    These remarks show that Lu Ping has indirectly admitted that  the Sino-British Joint Declaration has already become  ineffective and the Chinese side, with sovereignty in its hands,  may even take preemptive measures rather than striking only  after the other side has struck.    From this, people can see that the Chinese side has made  certain tactical changes in its Hong Kong policy. It has  emphasized that ""the timetable is in our hands."" This is not  merely intimidation. With the breakdown of Sino-British talks  and its hypocritical face unveiled, the Chinese side can do  whatever it wants to do ""with perfect assurance.""    ""Correcting the Right Deviationist Policy Toward Britain""    In this stage, while China is ""calmly waiting for change,""  the military is still adopting a very active attitude. In  mid-October, soon after the conclusion of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, eight generals,  including Zhang Aiping, a former defense minister and currently  a member of the Central Military Commission's consultative  committee, Xiao Ke, Hong Xuezhi, Li Desheng, Wang Ping, Yang  Dezhi, Qin Jiwei, and Zhao Nanqi stated their views to the  Central Committee and the State Council, saying ""it is time to  end the colonialist rule now and to sum up and rectify the right  deviationist policy of cherishing unrealistic illusions toward  the British Government""!    This is what the servicemen of the older generation are  thinking, but they have just expressed their views with slogans.  Top military officers in charge of concrete work have even more  concrete ideas. At the beginning of December, Zhang Wannian,  chief of the general staff, Yu Yongbo, director of the General  Political Department, and Fu Quanyou, director of the General  Logistics Department, together with Defense Minister Chi  Haotian, Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming, and Navy Commander  Zhang Lianzhong, submitted a statement of their views to the CPC  Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission, entitled ""We must safeguard national sovereignty and  end colonialist rule."" In the statement, they put forth the  following five proposals:    Five Proposals Made by the Military Have Strong Smell of  Gunpowder    1. The so-called dispute over the political system at  present is a favorite trick of the British colonialists before  withdrawing from their colonies and is a deliberate political  challenge after the British authorities changed their strategy  toward China. It is necessary to expose it and fight back.    2. It is necessary to make preparations for taking resolute  measures against Britain if it brings disasters in economic  affairs, supports pro-British and anti-China hostile forces in  the political field, and, internationally, creates an  international political city.    3. Since the British authorities have abandoned the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements reached  between the Chinese and British governments and have caused the  situation to deteriorate further, it is necessary to adopt  measures immediately and make a resolute decision: Take back  Hong Kong immediately and implement the policy of one country,  two systems under the leadership of the government of the PRC.    4. The Chinese Government should warn the British  authorities sternly once again through diplomatic channels that  it should immediately stop playing political tricks, rein in  from the brink of the precipice, return to the basis of carrying  out the Sino-British Joint Declaration and agreements reached  between the two governments, and stop interfering with China's  sovereignty and internal affairs, otherwise colonialist rule  will be ended immediately without hesitation and further  tolerance.    5. At the current stage, China should recall its ambassador  to Britain and terminate ministerial contacts and intercourse  with Britain.    Liu Huaqing Predicts British Colonialism Will Be Eradicated  Very Soon    Judging from this written statement, which has a strong  smell  of gunpowder, the military has not only been well prepared all  the time to take ""resolute measures,"" but has also asked for the  downgrading of Sino-British diplomatic relations. Such ""over  reactive"" remarks have never been seen before. People are  speculating that this may have something to do with  encouragement by Liu Huaqing, a member of the CPC's Political  Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.  Talking about Hong Kong's situation during a recent meeting  with the officers in charge of military regions, Liu Huaqing  said: To resolve the Hong Kong issue is nothing complicated and  difficult. The central authorities have policies and principles  ready. We just want to see what antics the British authorities  will go on to play. How can Hong Kong's future and Hong Kong's  destiny be decided by British colonialists? We have no right to  oppose the antics they are playing, but we absolutely have the  right to end British colonialist rule and eradicate  British-style colonialism early. Judging from current  developments, this day will come very soon.    ""This day will come very soon."" This is an important view.  However, at present, there are no signs of disturbances in Hong  Kong's society and people are seizing the current opportunities  and making use of the limited time to make money. Just as  people are saying: ""When you have money, you can do anything,  but if you have no money, you can just follow the Basic Law.""  Under such a situation, how can man-made ""political  disturbances"" and ""economic collapse"" be created so that guns  can be used to take over Hong Kong ahead of time? It seems that  it will be difficult for the CPC to make its next move. ""Moving  the wrong piece on the chess board may lose the whole game....""     "

The two leaders were meeting in  Indianapolis, where Mr Clinton was unveiling a monument to  assassination victims John Kennedy and Martin Luther King.    Mr Reynolds was expected to discuss with the President a  list  of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein, the political arm of the  IRA, about the Downing Street peace declaration. Sinn Fein  submitted the list to Mr Reynolds earlier this week and it was  then in turn relayed to London.    Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he  will publish the list soon -- together with Britain's response.  However, Ulster Unionists are suspicious of the Sinn Fein move,  fearing it is another attempt at persuading Britain to clarify  the declaration -- something John Major and Sir Patrick have  consistently refused to do.    A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said Sir Patrick had not  ruled out answering specific questions about the declaration,  but still insisted it was not up for negotiation.    Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic  Unionist Party, today warned that any answering of the questions  by Britain would amount to clarification. He added: ""Here once  again we have a Government that lies and deceives, a Government  that tells us one thing and does another. It is a Government  that cannot be trusted.    ""Rewarding gunmen and bombers is not a proper way for a  Government, especially Her Majesty's Government, to be behaving.""    Mr Robinson, MP for Belfast East, also criticised the Irish  Government for acting as ""postmen by appointment to the  Provisional IRA"".    Sinn Fein's questions are believed to centre on the precise  way forward proposed by the Britain and Ireland if the IRA ends  its campaign of violence. Mr Reynolds has made it clear he sees  the Sinn Fein approach as offering new hope of success for the  declaration he and Mr Major signed in Downing Street last  December.    For his part, Mr Clinton, who requested today's talks, is  anxious to be fully briefed on the latest Northern Ireland  position ahead of an imminent visit to Britain. Mr Reynolds,  who is due back in Dublin on Monday, is planning to deal with  the Ulster issue in a speech in Indiana tomorrow when he is due  to receive an an honourary degree from Notre Dame university.  He said on his arrival in the US that Sinn Fein's questions  should be dealt with ""as soon as possible"" to permit the peace  process to move ahead.     "

It also warned Britons living in Lebanon to leave, saying they are under  increased threat following Iran's severing of diplomatic ties with Britain on  Tuesday.

Britain also ordered the closing of the Iranian Consulate in Hong  Kong, a British colony, and gave the staff two weeks to leave, Howe said.    His comments came after an Iranian newspaper today said the break in  British-Iranian ties will adversely affect the British hostages in Lebanon.    Howe, noting that Iran has refused to revoke its death sentence against  Rushdie, said: ""We have therefore decided on security grounds a number of  Iranians must be required to leave this country.

It also warned Britons living in Lebanon to leave, saying they are under  increased threat following Iran's severing of diplomatic ties with Britain on  Tuesday. Three Britons are held hostage in Lebanon.    The foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, announced the expulsions in the House  of Commons. Britain also ordered the closing of the Iranian Consulate in Hong  Kong, a British colony, and gave the staff two weeks to leave, Howe said.    His comments came after an Iranian newspaper today said the break in  British-Iranian ties will adversely affect the British hostages in Lebanon.    Howe, noting that Iran has refused to revoke its death sentence against  Rushdie, said: ""We have therefore decided on security grounds a number of  Iranians must be required to leave this country.    ""We are keeping the activities of other Iranians under very close review,"" he  added. He said the expulsion orders would be issued shortly. There are about  25,000 Iranians in Britain.

Resolution of this crisis is not predictable owing to  British leaders' lack of political independence. [passage  omitted]    From the viewpoint of domestic and foreign experts the  critical situation prevalent in Britain is closely linked with  London's fresh charge against the Islamic Republic of Iran. It  is also construed as a preplanned political and propaganda  offensive in order to divert the attention of the people of  Britain from the failures suffered by its Conservative  government in its domestic and foreign policies. [passage  omitted]    Albert Reynolds, the president of the Irish Republic, too,  in  implicitly dismissing the British Government claim on alleged  cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRA,  has pointed out that so far no firm documents or evidence have  been presented to him concerning such cooperation.    This statement of the Irish president, and also a clear-cut  assertion by the Irish Foreign Ministry spokesman to the effect  that Ireland is continuing its efforts to boost economic ties  and also a current trend on understanding and exchange between  Tehran and Dublin and that Ireland is not inclined at all to  undermine this reciprocal understanding, all point to just one  thing. They show the reality that British statesmen have failed  in a new round of their efforts to pressure Iran. Hence they  must, once again, face the undesirable result of their  counselling with the U.S. policies against the Islamic  revolution.    In a reference to the U.S. Administration's reaction to  Britain's baseless claim on Iran's alleged cooperation with the  IRA would clearly show the collusion between Washington and  London. [sentence as heard] Last week, or few days before the  start of this fresh clamor by the government of John Major, U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher paid a visit to London,  and when this political and propaganda offensive was initiated  by Britain against Iran the head of the U.S. diplomacy was in  Cairo. While in the Egyptian capital, Christopher, just moments  after the assertion of this British claim against Iran, and even  quicker than the procedure prevalent in diplomatic norms, said  the issue shows that Iran must remain isolated and not get any  share of economic aid from the West. This posturing was very  controversial in the opinion of many analysts and experts in  political affairs. It added to the notion that Christopher,  prior to the start of this abortive offensive, had been briefed  on the matter in the course of his British visit and had already  made the necessary coordinations with the British leaders.  [passage omitted] At any rate, in respect of the fact that the  recent British claim against Iran points to London's political  defeat in Northern Ireland, it also brings to memory yet another  reality. Britain under the U.S. pressure has repeatedly acted  against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and on each occasion has  experienced the unfavorable outcome of this conflict more than  any other country. Undoubtedly, this time too, it will gain  nothing.    Early last autumn Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary,  prior to meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar  Velayati, on the sidelines of the 48th UN General Assembly  session had said: The agenda of my talks with Dr. Velayati will  be difficult. Now, apparently, Mr. Hurd should respond to this  question as to why the agenda of talks between Tehran and other  political representatives of European capitals has never been  that difficult. The response is quite evident. In the event,  British statesmen, while disregarding the U.S. pressures,  reassess their stands concerning bilateral ties and view the  existing issues realistically. They will not find any major  obstacle on the way of the expansion of Tehran-London relations.  If this does not happen, then the vicious circle will continue  indefinitely.     "

Hopes rest on Britain and Spain offering 'a goodwill gesture' which would avoid a breakdown in negotiations and coax their 10 EU partners into reciprocal movement at the two-day meeting at Ioannioa, Greece. 'I don't think people are ready psychologically for a deal,' a senior EU official said yesterday. The best outcome was likely to be an informal understanding offering the prospect of a settlement before Easter, possibly at a fifth meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday. Britain and Spain are insisting on maintaining voting rules allowing two large Union member states and one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The impasse risks delaying the admission of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union next year. The rotating Greek presidency of the EU, backed by Germany, remains adamant that the Anglo-Spanish axis must accept an increase in the so-called blocking minority to take account of the four new members. Hopes of a compromise rest on a trade-off in which the UK and Spain concede that the blocking minority must rise from 23 to 27 votes. In return, countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes would obtain an automatic right to delay decisions for at least two months. Britain is pressing for a legally binding protocol allowing it to delay decisions on contentious matters such as social policy. But senior EU officials said a commitment was 'out of the question' because it would be rejected by the European Parliament, which must ratify the accession treaties. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, raised hopes of an eventual deal with an explicit declaration yesterday that he was prepared to reach a compromise on the issue. 'We are flexible. We are willing to accommodate. But others have to be so also,' he said. Mr Hurd said the UK cabinet had allowed him 'some flexibility' to strike a deal, but he was uncertain whether an agreement would be reached at the weekend talks. The voting rights row will dominate the two days of informal talks, with little time to address pressing matters such as instability in the Ukraine and Algeria and prospects for a peace settlement in former Yugoslavia.

Speaking at a rally in Blackburn, Lancashire, on the penultimate day of campaigning, Mr Kinnock called on the electorate to vote to reject a government which he said had no plan to rescue Britain from recession and which was placing the NHS in 'mortal danger'. The Labour leader said that, after 13 years in power, the government had proved beyond doubt that it had 'no ambition to make Britain better and no conscience about making Britain worse'. With Labour anxious to ensure that supporters turn out in force tomorrow in what promises to be a close contest, Mr Kinnock urged voters to use their hard-earned right to choose between two parties offering starkly different options for the future. Voters, he said, could choose between the Tory approach of letting the future take care of itself, with continuing recession and further privatisation, or Labour's proposals for economic recovery and modernisation. He said that the government, in asking to be re-elected for the third time, was expecting the voters to forget two recessions, millions of unemployed people, thousands of bankruptcies and mounting home repossessions. He added: 'They are asking the people to treat what they have done as a success. After all they have done, they simply do not deserve to be elected. 'These architects of recession, these engineers of run-down, cannot be called upon to build the future.' Mr Kinnock said ministers were 'tired, washed up, like door-to-door salesmen, blue with cold, desperate to find a customer, unable to think of a new angle'. He accused the government of throwing away Pounds 100bn of oil revenues that could have rebuilt the country's schools, the National Health Service, and the transport system. Instead it had been given away in tax cuts. Keeping the NHS at the forefront of the closing stages of the campaign, Mr Kinnock said it represented 'part of the bedrock of Britain' and was the most practical expression of a civilised society. But he said the health service was in danger of being broken up under the Tories and voters had to choose at the polls to prevent it from being 'split from top to bottom'. He added: 'They are breaking it apart and in another five years they will all but have finished the job.' Labour, he claimed, had policies for pulling Britain out of recession and building a recovery that would last.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

Twelve days of talks here among the 39 Antarctic Treaty nations, discussions  dominated by the mining issue, broke up Friday night with a wide division  between the pro- and anti-mining nations.

0,FT933-1926 ,"FT933-1926 _AN-DIVB9AAAFT 930922   FT  22 SEP 93 / Mahathir attacks UK over Bosnia      By KEVIN BROWN      KUALA LUMPUR   A TWO-DAY visit to Malaysia by Mr John Major, the prime minister, was jarred last night when Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, accused Britain of standing by while Bosnian Moslems were 'wiped out'. Mr Major was clearly surprised by Dr Mahathir's attack, which soured the atmosphere at a ceremonial banquet in Kuala Lumpur, the first official function of the visit. The Malaysian prime minister appealed to Britain to influence the European Community to put an end to 'ethnic cleansing' before Bosnia was 'forever cemented in history as the blackest catastrophe of the modern world'. Taking hurried notes of Dr Mahathir's comments, Mr Major inserted a long passage defending Britain's Bosnian role into his planned speech on Commonwealth friendship. He said he felt 'as strongly as anyone else about the wickedness and intolerance we see daily in Bosnia,' and claimed that British action had saved hundreds of thousands of Bosnian lives. The impact of Dr Mahathir's speech was, however, blunted by his reputation as a frequent critic of Britain's role as a former colonial power. Observers also suggested that Dr Mahathir was keen to demonstrate his concerns about Bosnia to Malaysia's Moslem majority and to Moslem leaders elsewhere. He said Malaysia's 'hearts cry out to the tragedy of an entire race being wiped out in total disregard for even elementary decency', and warned that 'we cannot accept that it is right and just and democratic to sit by and watch while such brutish acts are committed'. Dr Mahathir said he understood Britain's concerns for the safety of its peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and the continuation of humanitarian aid. But he said the European powers had repeatedly backed down from the threat of air strikes after the threats had been 'arrogantly ignored' by Serb forces. He called for 'resolute and credible action' against the Serbs, and told Mr Major that European inaction risked igniting a widespread Balkan war. 'You are sending the wrong signals to certain countries east of Yugoslavia - countries with a past history of violent acquisition of other people's territories.' Dr Mahathir was visited recently by Lady Thatcher, Mr Major's predecessor, who has also called for stronger European action against the Bosnian Serbs. Ironically, Lady Thatcher was at the centre of the last row with Malaysia in the early 1980s, when Dr Mahathir launched a 'Buy British Last' campaign in protest against British policies on trade.

0,FT932-646 ,"FT932-646 _AN-DF1B2ABCFT 930628   FT  28 JUN 93 / Transatlantic prices are an ocean apart / A look at why many items cost less in the US      By GUY DE JONQUIERES      FEW BRITISH visitors return from the US without wondering why   even after sterling's devaluation last autumn - so many things cost less over there than at home. Late last year McKinsey, the international management consultancy, set out to answer the question by analysing the main factors which determine retail prices on either side of the Atlantic. Armed with a shopping list of 268 similar products, McKinsey compared prices at outlets in the London and Chicago areas. It found that on average prices were 31.7 per cent higher after tax in Britain than in the US. The difference was calculated when the pound was worth Dollars 1.60, and would be nearer 22 per cent at today's exchange rate. Even so, some individual examples remain striking. Frozen chickens cost four times more per pound in Britain than in the US, while some DIY items were three times dearer. About 50 products were cheaper in the UK. Many of these were British or other European brands, such as Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Benetton and Jaeger. But Heinz baked beans, of which Britain is traditionally world champion consumer, also cost 35 per cent less than in the US, where Heinz has its headquarters. An analysis of retailers' cost structures identified four main reasons why prices were often higher in Britain than in the US - although their relative importance varied widely between products. The four factors are tax, property costs, productivity and trade prices. Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax, charged on most products except food, baby clothes and a few other items, is more than double the 7.25 per cent sales tax in the Chicago area. The study found tax accounted for half of the 24 per cent difference in the price of a pair of cotton briefs and for more than a third of the 29 per cent difference in the price of a Walkman compact disc player. However, tax was responsible for as little as one sixth of the price differentials for doughnuts, ice-cream and hamburgers sold in fast-food outlets. Yet these were found to cost between 48 per cent and 112 per cent more in Britain than in the US. Prime retail selling space cost only a third as much in the US as in Britain. That was one of the main reasons for the higher UK prices of fast food and clothing and was particularly important for department stores. However, it accounted for a smaller proportion of the price differentials on electrical and DIY goods. Dearer space costs explained only a quarter of the 63 per cent difference in the retail price of a standard 16ft ladder. On average, retailers' productivity was 23 per cent higher in the US than in Britain, reflecting lower wage costs and higher sales per employee. US stores generally were more advanced in their use of automation, although in many sectors sales per square foot of store space were comparable with the UK. Profitability varied widely across sectors, but was often higher at the level of the individual store in the US than in Britain. The main exception was grocery retailing, where UK supermarkets had higher returns on sales and capital than US chains, as well as bigger sales per square foot and per employee. However, the study says these advantages would not be large enough to safeguard UK supermarkets' profitability if their prices fell to US levels. If that happened, they would show an average 20 per cent negative return on capital, compared with a recent average 27 per cent positive return. The prices at which US retailers purchased many products were found to be lower than in Britain. The study found particularly big differences in DIY products, electrical goods and food. The Common Agricultural Policy helps to hold up the price of food in the UK. The ingredients for one mass-market line of grocery products cost 37 per cent more in Britain than in the US, where manufacturing costs were also lower. Together, these two factors contributed to a UK trade price 23 per cent higher than in the US. McKinsey also believes that the prices of some products, such as camcorders, home computers and software for video games, are higher in Britain because a less mature market has enabled manufacturers to earn fatter profit margins. Other reasons for transatlantic price differentials are American consumers' traditionally greater emphasis on price and comparative shopping, and the greater diversity of retail outlets in the US, where the industry is less concentrated than in Britain. The study found prices of the same products varied much more widely around Chicago than London but McKinsey says that when comparing UK and US prices it was careful to ensure that the types of store surveyed in each country were similar. Some reasons for transatlantic price differentials, such as tax levels and the cost of prime retail space, are deep-rooted and unlikely to change quickly. However, the study argues that Britain will be increasingly influenced by competitive trends from across the Atlantic, notably the growth of discount stores and greater price sensitivity among consumers. That could require big adjustments by established chains. The study says: 'UK retailers will have to bring their costs and productivity more into line with those of their US counterparts to avoid a sharp decline in profitability.'

0,FT932-6182 ,"FT932-6182 _AN-DE3ARAB1FT 930529   FT  29 MAY 93 / Springtime in Paris: David Buchan examines signs of a thaw in the traditionally uneasy Anglo-French relationship      By DAVID BUCHAN   It would perhaps be going too far to say that in the two months since the new French government came to power, Britain's relations with its cross-Channel neighbour have become better than at any point in the past two decades. But there was no mistaking the reciprocated warmth in Mr John Major's second meeting with his new French counterpart, Mr Edouard Balladur, in Paris yesterday. Speaking in general terms about their two-hour chat, the UK prime minister said he could not recall a time when Anglo-French relations were 'in better shape'. Mr Balladur was more concrete in citing the Gatt trade negotiations as an example of where the two leaders had decided to make a fresh effort to bridge their countries' real differences. The French prime minister even volunteered his 'gratitude' for the 'help' of Mr John Gummer, then the UK agriculture minister, in reaching an EC farm agreement this week. (Mr Gummer was given the environment portfolio in Thursday's cabinet reshuffle.) In fact, Britain was not trying particularly to advance French interests this wek in Brussels, though it and others among France's partners clearly hope that Paris has now been sufficiently buttered up to accept the politically awkward oilseeds deal with the US in the next two weeks. But the very fact that he exaggerated the extent of British help shows Mr Balladur's desire to put the best face on his relationship with the UK. The Gatt endeavour is, in a sense, the key to understanding the new cross-Channel link. It is weaker than Paris's relationship with Bonn, where 30 years of formalised co-operation virtually commit the two partners reach agreement on divisive issues. Paris and London have only committed themselves to try to reach agreement. Nonetheless, this could lead to a vast improvement in a relationship whose uneasiness dates back, as Mr Major quipped yesterday, to 'William the Conqueror's coming over to Britain with a certain degree of malice aforethought and Henry II's coming to France to conquer half the country and marry the rest'. Why the sudden springtime in Anglo-French relations? It must first be said that there was never a permafrost over Britain's relations with the previous Socialist government. The two countries, for instance, have continued practical military co-operation, despite the abstract arguments about the future of European defence and Nato which were part of the Maastricht treaty negotiations. But for nearly five years France had focused on reaching agreement with Germany on an agenda - including economic and monetary union (Emu) and social policy - which was largely inimical to Britain's ruling Conservatives. The change in the ideology governing France has helped, but not radically. This is because conservatism differs on either side of the Channel. Under Mr Balladur, France is no longer accusing Britain of social dumping, but that is because UK or UK-based companies (such as Hoover Europe) are no longer the only foreign firms laying off workers in France. Mr Major reiterated his view in Paris yesterday that the EC's social charter was a recipe for 'job destruction' - a stance which no French government could publicly support, even though Mr Balladur clearly shares much of Mr Major's concern about Europe's growing lack of competitiveness. France is now pursuing privatisation - aping techniques used in British state sell-offs - such as 'le partly paid' equity and 'le golden share' from Britain - but stopping short of selling state-owned utilities as the UK government has done. But the question of who owns French industry is of less relevance to the UK than its desire for the government to reduce aid to French companies. But the nature of the French government is important in another way. Within the Gaullist RPR party, Mr Balladur himself comes from the stable of Georges Pompidou, the man who let Britain into the EC as a kind of counterweight to Germany. Within today's RPR party, too, are some deputies - nearly half its parliamentary strength - who voted against Maastricht in last September's referendum. Mr Balladur, who as finance minister in late 1987 was the first to propose to his EC colleagues a European central bank, therefore has Euro-sceptics whom he cannot ignore, just as Mr Major has. And the French prime minister cannot wholly rely on his pro-European coalition partner, the UDF, because its leader, ex-President Giscard d'Estaing, still harbours ambitions for a return to the Elysee. This has pushed the RPR towards Mr Major's views on the need within the EC for subsidiarity, decentralised decision-making and a closer check on the European Commission. Separately, too, the RPR's right-wing pressure for a crackdown on crime and illegal immigration has led the Balladur government to delay abolition of frontier controls, as forseen in the Schengen free-travel convention shunned by Britain. But it is foreign policy, and above all their diplomatic and military involvement in the Bosnian crisis, which has brought the two governments into constant contact. This was true last year, too. But the Balladur government's arrival coincided with Washington's first initiatives. And both London and Paris have reacted allergically to US ideas of bombing Serbs or arming the Moslems. France and Britain are both solidly behind a patient strategy of sanctions. The lengthy nature of such a strategy will only serve to ingrain the growing habit of Anglo-French diplomatic co-ordination, underlined once again by yesterday's announcement that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will be in Paris for another Bosnian session with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart. The latter has said he sees Britain, as France's fellow United Nations Security Council member and holder of nuclear weapons, playing a key security role in the post-Maastricht EC. Any such Anglo-French rapprochement on external policy can, however, easily founder on the two governments' fundamental disagreement on economic policy. Not so much on Gatt where Paris may now be able to finesse the agricultural issue with some help from its EC partners. Mr Major yesterday expressed 'understanding' for France's farm problems, but stressed 'we must find a way through the Gatt tangle this year'. The future flashpoint lies more in monetary policy, where almost no one in France, for all the country's current doldrums, wants to follow Britain out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But Paris is reconciled to Mr Major taking a longish time to return sterling to the ERM. Luckily, too, for Mr Major, Mr Balladur shows absolutely no sign of traditional Gallic impatience with the long Maastricht timetable for Emu. The French prime minister scoffs at any post-Maastricht ratification bid to accelerate this timetable, by pointing to the budgetary problems of France and others. After his lunch with President Mitterrand yesterday, Mr Major paid tribute 'to France's longest-serving president for more than a century, who is listened to with great respect', knowing full well that much of the real authority in Paris now lies with Mr Balladur. But the likelihood of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, winning the 1995 presidential election will return undivided power to the Elysee, and perhaps rock the new-found relationship with Mr Balladur. If it does not, then Britain stands a chance of having a real say in the 1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty. Instead of shouting from the sidelines, as it did in much of the run-up to Maastricht, it might even join France, and perforce Germany, in setting the agenda. That, Mr Major knows, could put Britain at the centre of Europe.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     FRZ  France, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

0,FT942-6845 ,"FT942-6845 _AN-EE0DLAHPFT 940527   FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (8): The showcase of Europe / A look at an extremely competitive telecoms market      By ANDREW ADONIS   Britain is Europe's telecommunications showcase. Its government has pushed liberalisation and privatisation farther and faster than anywhere else on the continent. Not just in law or theory. In practice, the UK telecoms market is more competitive than any other in the EU, or arguably in the world. More than 40 operators hold govern- ment telecoms licences, and at least a dozen are currently operating services in all or part of the UK. At the national level, BT faces stiff competition from Mercury, a subsidiary of Cable  Wireless, an experienced international telecoms oper- ator. Mercury offers a nationwide service - including ISDN - to the business and residential markets. Launched a decade ago at the privatisation of British Telecommunications - then the monopoly operator - Mer- cury has won 11 per cent of the national market. Most of its custom comes from the bus- iness sector, especially in the City of London, where it has about two-thirds of outgoing long-distance traffic secured through cheaper tariff pack- ages than those offered by BT. A recent survey by Analysys, a UK consultancy, shows the UK to be cheaper than France, Germany and Italy for tele- coms for all users except residential customers and some one-line businesses, where France comes out better. The City is the focus of the most intense competition in the UK. Apart from BT and Mercury, three other operators are competing for business with dedicated networks - US operators MFS and Colt, and Videotron, a Canadian operator which also has licences to provide combined cable television and telephone services elsewhere in London. A third operator with a dedicated long-distance network - and facilities for direct connections to large City institutions - is also about to join the fray. Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid, is about to launch a network erected on the UK's long-distance electricity pylons. It is likely to engage in a price war with BT and Mercury - putting Mercury on the defensive for the first time. All of which is good news for business. As is the competition in urban areas across Britain between BT and the cable companies - mostly US-owned - building combined television and telephone networks. Over the next five years the cable companies are investing Pounds 6bn in new networks and already boast nearly 400,000 lines - 40,000 of them business lines. The cable companies claim that their ability to harness three revenue streams - telephony, television and the new world of inter-active 'multimedia' services - from one network will enable them to slash the cost of telecommunications. If so, Britain will enjoy the fruits before most of Europe, where cable networks are either undeveloped or utilised exclusively for television. However, for most telecoms users the benefits of competition and privatisation are measured in better service from BT itself. At privatisation BT had an unenviable reputation for inefficiency. Spurred on by competition, the company has made itself responsive and user-friendly to a degree unmatched across much of Europe, where state-owned monopoly operators continue to reign supreme - albeit, in most of the EU, with an obligation to open their markets to competition by 1998. However, beware of the hype. A recent benchmarking survey by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry concluded that Britain's telecoms services were, all-round 'a good second' - towards the top of the international league on most scores, but heading it on practically none. No other European country occupied a more commanding position overall, but the US was ahead on many scores. On pricing, for instance, a very different picture emerges if one looks at leased lines - essential for large businesses constructing their own national or international 'virtual private networks' - rather than public network charges. For leased lines, while the benchmarking survey found the cost of similar high-capacity leased lines markedly lower in Britain than in most of continental Europe, the prices were far lower in the US than in Britain. Reuters, which has the largest private telecoms network in the world, claims that it would save 90 per cent of its outgoings for leased lines in Europe if the equivalent network were in the US. As the DTI notes, 'such high costs not only increase the costs for business, they also suppress business activity by making it uneconomic to offer certain types of service or to carry out some business activities.' There is another moral. Britain may be an island, but its competitive position in telecoms depends critically on high-quality services and low tariffs across its continent. Services are improving and tariffs falling - but overall, Europe lags behind the US on both scores. However, on the same regional dimension Europe is well ahead of Asia-Pacific  -the other great regional magnet for relocating companies - where a few islands of first-world telecoms subsist in a sea of inefficiency and antiquated networks.

It says that is a lower percentage than women receive in eight other European Community countries, Catherine Milton writes. The figures also put Britain second from bottom in a league of 11 countries for average female manual industrial earnings as a proportion of men's earnings per hour. Only Luxembourg is lower. The figure for industry is the more accurate because a comparison of average monthly earnings tends to widen the difference between men's and women's earnings because women work shorter hours.

The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It found that 'at the level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979. 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989,' it added. The report said that in 1989, 23 industries had higher productivity levels in Germany than in Britain, whereas in 1960 Germany had an advantage in only 17 industries. German manufacturing productivity peaked in superiority in 1979, when only three industries performed better in Britain - leather and footwear; drink and tobacco production. In 1960 labour productivity was only 4 percentage points higher in Germany than in Britain; by 1973 the gap had widened to 19.4 and six years later to 40 per cent. But by 1989 the difference had narrowed to 16.5 percentage points. The study calculates that aggregate labour productivity growth in Germany from 1960 to 1989 was 'a little less than half a percentage point higher per year than in Britain'. However, only six out of the 30 industries covered had a lower productivity performance in Germany than in Britain in 1989. These were mineral products; iron and steel; office machinery; electrical engineering; drink and tobacco production. In 1960, 13 out of the 30 industries had a better level of labour productivity in Britain. The largest productivity gap in 1989 was in the printing, publishing and paper industries where Germany was more than 50 per cent more productive. German dominance was also clear in ceramic goods manufacture; mechanical engineering; vehicle production and instrument engineering. The report attributes the better UK performance in the 1980s to the labour market freeing itself 'from the worst forms of restrictive practices'. The report adds that Britain still lags in the number of manufacturing workers with skills; in the volume of resources devoted to research and development; and in investment in new plant and machinery. The study found that in 1989 Germany had 30 per cent more physical capital per worker-hour in manufacturing than Britain. Changing Fortunes. NIESR No7. Pounds 11.50.

The United Nations appeal for up to  3,000 more troops will be high on the agenda when the Cabinet  meets tomorrow. And a ministerial announcement could be made as  early as tomorrow afternoon in the House of Commons. The  Government has been deeply reluctant to be sucked in even more  into the bloody Bosnian civil war. It has emphasised Britain's  already heavy commitment with 2,400 troops on the ground  together with major contributions to the air and naval  operations. And it has been urging other UN countries to  provide forces and share the load.    But there was reluctant recognition in Whitehall tonight  that  Britain cannot be seen to fail when success appears so close,  particularly as the man behind the six-day Sarajevo ceasefire --  Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose -- is British.    ""We would be lepers in the world community if we failed to  reinforce what is a tremendous success,"" said one official.    ""Here is a man creating some success for the first time in  two years and he is a Brit to boot. It would be very difficult  to hold up our heads if we did not send more forces.""    It is understood the Government is seriously considering the  deployment of an infantry battalion equipped with Saxon wheeled  armoured personnel carriers and mortar locating radar  specialists. Sources said troops from the Coldstream Guards  based at Vitez in central Bosnia could be moved initially to  Sarajevo to help the peacekeeping operation until new forces  arrive.    The most likely infantry unit to be deployed is the Green  Howards, based at Catterick in North Yorkshire and the old  regiment of the current Chief of the General Staff, General Sir  Peter Inge. The regiment, whose origins date back to 1689, is  equipped with Saxon, a lightly armoured, manoeuvrable vehicle  that is best described as a battlefield taxi. But the Army must  decide whether the lightly armoured vehicles would be suitable  for operations in Sarajevo.    The Royal Artillery's 94 Locating Radar based at Larkhill,  Wiltshire, is also likely to be deployed along with some other  artillery units. It is equipped with the Cymbeline mortar  locating radar, which detects the flight of a mortar bomb at two  points in the trajectory as it passes through radar beams.  Rapid computing produces a grid reference to identify the  firing point. However, it is 1970's technology and uses a large  radar dish, that is very vulnerable to sniper and other attacks.  It is also heavily manpower intensive because, as there is no  automatic alert system, it must be manned continuously 24 hours  a day.    However, there are grave doubts among a number of Tory MPs  about Britain becoming even more embroiled in the Balkans  bloodbath. Party officials believe they will have a lot of work  to do to win all-round support for further deployments.    But Labour's shadow defence Secretary, Dr David Clark,  strongly urged the Government to make extra troops available.  ""Labour believes that UN military commanders on the ground in  Bosnia should be provided with very rapid reinforcements of  ground troops if they believe these are required,"" he said.    UN officials said the extra troops were needed to buttress  the truce, to try to demilitarise Sarajevo and even extend the  process elsewhere in Bosnia.    Meanwhile, NATO and UN forces are continuing to prepare for  possible airstrikes once the deadline for the Serbs to pull back  or hand over their heavy weapons expires at midnight Sunday [20  February].    UN officials formally confirmed for the first time that  allied forward air controllers were in Sarajevo. They will use  a variety of sophisticated equipment, including  laser-designators to pinpoint targets for allied warplanes.  NATO ambassadors in Brussels said they would not extend the  weapons deadline on the Bosnian Serbs who have been besieging  Sarajevo for 22 months. There was still optimism among UN  officials that the early stages of demilitarisation of the  battered city was progressing well.    But the calm was briefly broken when a Serb sniper shot dead  a Muslim civilian in the most serious violation of the ceasefire.     "

An epidemic of the disease has caused a run on supplies, and  yesterday Regent Laboratories, the sole importers, said it would  have no more before October. A combined tetanus and diphtheria  vaccine has been available from Merieux UK, but has also run out.    Cases of diphtheria in Russia rose from 1,876 in 1991 to  3,897 in 1992.

This is his ninth trip to London in the two years since he took  office in Hong Kong in July 1992; on average, once every three  months or so.    There has been much talk about Chris Patten's frequent  return  to Britain recently in the British media. For example, Chris  Patten's frequent return to Britain reflects ""his obvious  restlessness with his office as Hong Kong governor,"" he ""still  cannot forget about the British political arena,"" ""his strong  love for Westminster (the British Parliament) has not faded,""  ""he no longer brags about having no intention to return to the  British political arena,"" ""he is picking up the topic that under  whatever circumstances it is impossible for him to return to the  British political arena,"" and ""loves to talk about British  politics and how to govern the country with British reporters.""    As usual, Chris Patten has denied these rumors about  himself.  Some political analysts in London also believe that there is  little chance of Chris Patten returning to the British political  arena at the present stage, because ""he really cannot find any  way which is honorable and helpful to return to the British  political arena.""    Then, how should we account for his frequent trips to  Britain? Is it really true that ""he has nothing else to do in  Hong Kong,"" and is thus returning to Britain ""to enjoy a  leisurely and carefree excursion,"" as some British media have  put it?    That obviously does not conform to Chris Patten's  inclination, which is unwilling to be lonely.    People notice that Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in July  1992 to take office, but by mid-September, he had already taken  his first trip back to London for consultations; on his return  he delivered his government address on 6 October, in which he  presented a constitutional reform package for Hong Kong, which  consequentially sparked Sino-British polemics.    In its wake, every time Chris Patten returns to Britain,  there is some new action upon his return to Hong Kong. For  example, the gazettal of his constitutional reform package, the  termination of the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for  Hong Kong 1994/1995 elections, the tabling of his constitutional  reform package to the Legislative Council...and so forth, and  every action has caused shock and has added a great obstacle to  a stable transition for Hong Kong.    Chris Patten's last trip to London was on 30 March this  year.  Shortly after his return to Hong Kong, the British Parliament's  Select Committee on Foreign Affairs produced a report on  Sino-British relations, which ""proposes"" that the British Hong  Kong Government set up a ""human rights commission"" and an  ""organization to supervise human rights"" which would continue  after 1997, and the British Government and the UN Human Rights  Commission would ""jointly supervise the conditions and  development of human rights in Hong Kong after 1997.""    Indeed, there may be some truth in Chris Patten planning to  sound out political conditions in Britain in an attempt to find  a way to promote himself during his current trip to London as is  being speculated, but the focus of his activities is likely to  be on consulting officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office on the issue of ""setting up a human rights commission in  Hong Kong.""    Noteworthy is the fact that a high-ranking Chinese official  in charge of Hong Kong affairs indicated that, just like ""a  drinker's heart is not in the cup,"" the person who made the  proposal to set up a human rights commission in Hong Kong aims  to jeopardize the power framework established in the Basic Law,  and the proposal ""will consequently form `a weird embryo'.""    Under such circumstances, people wish that Chris Patten  would  really confine himself to ""enjoying an increasingly leisurely  and carefree excursion with each passing day."" However,  experience tells us that a storm is likely to be conjured up in  London, which will eventually attack Hong Kong again.     "

Britain and Ireland led attacks by nearly all EU fisheries ministers against European Commission proposals, notably the allocation of 'standard vessel days' for fishing, as complex and unworkable. 'It's not a runner . . . We have seen off that particular proposal,' British fisheries minister Michael Jack said after a meeting of EU fisheries ministers. Jack said Britain would present special controls to protect fish stocks in sensitive zones. British fishermen are concerned that the Spanish fishing fleet, the largest in the EU, will destroy fragile stocks in waters off western Britain. Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said it was clear many countries had problems with the approach and details of the proposals from the commission, the EU's executive agency. Spain has warned it will block Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria joining the EU if terms for Spanish fishermen are not agreed by the end of the year.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.

But while his party's Euro-sceptics acknowledged that the forecast Danish result had severely dented their hopes of wrecking the agreement, they vowed to continue to fight British ratification in the House of Lords and in the courts. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will lead another rebellion against the bill in the Lords but Mr Major is confident they will be unsuccessful. The prime minister also expects to defeat a legal challenge from the Tory Euro-sceptics over Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. Amid jubilation in Whitehall, ministers said the government now hoped to complete the tortuous and bitter ratification process before the summer parliamentary recess at the end of July. The prime minister, who has seen his government's authority drained by the bitter struggle over the treaty, voiced the hope that the Tory party would now put its differences behind it. Speaking to businessmen, Mr Major said the the ending of the uncertainty surrounding Maastricht would provide a boost to economic recovery in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The Community could now go forward as 12 into the next intergovernmental conference in 1996. The Maastricht bill will complete its passage through the House of Commons tomorrow. Despite the threat of a rebellion by 40 or more Conservative Euro-sceptics, the bill's passage to the House of Lords is guaranteed because of the Labour party's decision to abstain on the crucial third reading vote. Senior ministers acknowledged last night that the wounds in the Tory party from the bitter struggle over the treaty will take years to heal. The government has already been warned by its supporters that any move to take sterling back into the European exchange rate mechanism - as required under the Maastricht treaty - would trigger an even bigger revolt among its supporters. Even if Mr Major manages to complete the ratification process by the end of July, Britain now looks likely to be the last of the 12 formally to endorse the treaty. But colleagues were claiming last night that without the concessions for Denmark negotiated by the prime minister at last December's Edinburgh summit, Maastricht would have collapsed entirely.

The Commission declared Mr Goodwin's application admissible, meaning Britain will have to defend itself before the European Court of Human Rights unless the two sides reach a settlement. It was the second time in two days that Britain had been ordered to face the Strasbourg court. On Monday the Commission accepted a suit by relatives of three unarmed IRA terrorists shot dead by British commandos in Gibraltar in 1988.

0,FT941-5827 ,"FT941-5827 _AN-ECDC4ADZFT 940304   FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Block votes and Brussels   British support for EU enlargement often appears self-serving in the eyes of Britain's present partners, who suspect that Britain's real objective is to dilute the Union, making it more like a free trade area and less like a federation. Yet Britain has good arguments on its side: the EU will be strengthened by the entry of new Nordic and Alpine members, and it has strong reasons of both morality and self-interest for not turning its back on the newly free countries of central Europe. It is perverse, therefore, of the British government to risk torpedoing the agreement on admission of Efta countries by insisting that the 'blocking minority' in the EU council under the qualified majority voting system (QMV), should remain unchanged even in a larger Union. The larger the number of member states, the more difficult it will be to achieve consensus, and the greater the danger of paralysis. To insist that the same number of states should be able to block a decision means that a larger number will have to be lined up in favour before a decision can pass. By taking this line, the UK courts the accusation that paralysis has been its true objective in backing enlargement. British ministers claim they need to keep the blocking minority at 23 votes, which can be mustered by two large states and one small voting together, in order to preserve the open and competitive character of the Union against 'the protectionist majority'. Only Germany and the Netherlands, it seems, can be relied on to vote with Britain on many such issues. This seems just the kind of negative and defeatist approach which has so often isolated the UK from its European partners - including Germany and the Netherlands, both of which, as it happens, support raising the threshold to 27 votes in order to keep it constant as a proportion (30 per cent). One reason why Britain has supported the entry of its former Efta partners is that they generally share Britain's commitment to free trade. Enlargement, therefore, so far from inciting Britain to cling to a veto, should strengthen its confidence that it can win important arguments in the council on their merits. Nor should this issue be confused with the question of subsidiarity. There are strong grounds for wishing to limit the competences of an enlarged Union, leaving more issues to be resolved at national level or below; but where it does have competence, it must have the capacity to decide and to act. The UK should not feel comfortable to find itself allied on this issue with Spain, which hopes to use the blocking minority to defend a pattern of EU spending that is neither in British interests nor in those of the new members. Spain has other demands that are more reasonable, such as an increase in its own voting weight to equal that of the other big countries, and a right for Spanish fishermen to fish in Norwegian waters when Norway joins. It is on these points, rather than the blocking minority, that Mr Felipe Gonzalez should be placated.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Four such applications are in prospect, so Britain would thereby have transformed the EU into a virtual free trade area, an outcome our partners know is the present government's real aim when it speaks of being at the heart of Europe.

In spite of the welcome given by Mr Major, the prime minister, to the result of the French referendum, the narrowness of the vote in favour of the treaty will serve only to stoke up problems among Conservative backbenchers now convinced that they have it in their power to ditch the accord. The weekend also saw new tensions within the government on the timing of re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. Some pro-European ministers warned that Mr Major could not risk consigning Britain to the 'slow lane' of Europe by remaining outside indefinitely. Tory Euro-sceptics are determined to fill the vacuum left by last week's retreat from the ERM. Lady Thatcher's sharp criticism of Mr Major in a weekend speech in Washington was echoed by several acolytes in London yesterday, who demanded that Britain quit the ERM completely. Mr Major, speaking last night outside Admiralty House in London, where he has a temporary office, said there was no prospect that Britain would ratify the Treaty until Denmark, which rejected it in a June referendum, had clarified its position. In a reference to sterling's ignominious departure last week from the ERM, the prime minister said the EC leaders would have to consider the 'shortcomings' in the system. Mr Major then added to suspicion that he remains unconvinced that Maastricht is now back on course by warning that the special summit of European leaders called for early next month would have to respond to the concerns of European electorates about the pace of integrations. 'I think we do have to take account in public debate of the many concerns that have been raised throughout the Community over recent weeks,' he said. Responding to questions, Mr Major reaffirmed his support for the treaty but in terms which acknowledged the growing confidence of the Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party by saying that there was 'much' of value. One backbencher, Mr John Townend MP, chairman of the party's finance committee, was one among many said British voters should be allowed to express their views. Mr John Smith, leader of the Labour party, welcomed the outcome, saying: 'It is positive for the future of Europe.' However the result will also fuel difficulties for the Labour leadership which is beset with mounting resistance to the pro-Maastricht position adopted by the former leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, and taken up by Mr Smith.

But Mr John Major, the prime minister, insisted that British ratification of the accord was contingent on a Yes vote in the second Danish referendum. As he won praise from colleagues over his handling of the summit, he said the crucial third reading of the Maastricht bill in the Commons would be held after the Danish vote in late April or early May. Senior aides said he was confident the Danish electorate would support the accord agreed by its government in Edinburgh, thus rescuing the treaty. But Mr Major, who successfully resisted pressure at the summit to set a rigid timetable for ratification, signalled that if Denmark again voted No, Britain would also abandon ratification. British ministers said the agreements struck on Denmark's exemptions, on enlargement and subsidiarity, would prove a turning point in efforts to isolate Tory Euro-sceptics opposed to the treaty. In a statement to MPs today, the prime minister is expected to characterise the summit as a decisive turning point in Europe's fortunes - ending recent paralysis and setting the stage for an outward-looking and decentralised Community. For their part, Tory Euro-sceptics said last night that they would step up their efforts to wreck the legislation with lengthy Commons debate of the hundreds of amendments already tabled. The government also faced a warning from the opposition parties. The Liberal Democrats, firm supporters of Maastricht, said their backing for the government would depend on a 'speedy' third reading. Labour indicated that it intended to keep Mr Major guessing on whether it would again oppose the bill. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, described summit proposals for European economic recovery as 'woefully inadequate', and said a deal had only been struck at the expense of increased UK contributions to the EC. The direct link between Danish and British ratification - set out in detail by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - added a note of uncertainty to what was widely judged to have been a considerable diplomatic success for the prime minister. Mr Hurd, speaking on BBC television, acknowledged that, if Denmark and Britain rejected the treaty, some or all of the remaining 10 governments might sign a new agreement. Britain would not leave Denmark isolated by joining them, he said. Mr Hurd acknowledged the risks by warning of the danger of Britain being left outside any grouping which could take decisions affecting UK 'jobs, prosperity and security'. Downing Street said the comments underlined its commitment that the Community's 12 nations should move forward together.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "
0,FT941-4466 ,"FT941-4466 _AN-ECKD9AA5FT 940311   FT  11 MAR 94 / Confusion reigns in UK-Malaysian row: British businessmen are standing on the sidelines in a quandary      By KIERAN COOKE   There are plenty of confused people about in Kuala Lumpur these days. Confused British business people wondering if they are ever going to win another contract in Malaysia; confused diplomats trying to analyse every Malaysian government move; confused locals wondering why Britain has been turned suddenly from friend to enemy. Two weeks ago, Malaysia proclaimed its disgust about what it called the patronising attitude and innuendoes of the British media. Dr Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysia's prime minister, was particularly upset about a report in the London Sunday Times alleging he had been involved in seeking payments from a British company. The dark clouds of Dr Mahathir's anger burst on British business. The Malaysians said that until the British media mended its ways, no government contracts would be awarded to British companies: a potential loss, said the Malaysians, of Pounds 4bn to those companies. In the latest move, Najib Tun Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, has said Malaysia wants the British government to make a clear statement dissociating itself from the 'baseless allegations in the British press'. Like two not very distinguished actors, both Malaysia and Britain have stumbled round the issue over the past two weeks. At this stage, few are predicting an early end to what has become a messy political and commercial quarrel. The initial Malaysian government statement reflected not only intense anger with the British media but also a Malaysian desire to have its considerable economic achievements recognised. 'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their own affairs successfully' the Malaysian statement said. What Dr Mahathir and his cabinet did not say was precisely what was required. 'I don't want an apology either from the British government or the British media,' said Dr Mahathir. 'All I want is the truth. But then the British media is incapable of telling the truth.' London's reaction has only added to the confusion. On one hand, Prime Minister John Major called the Malaysian action shortsighted and not remotely justified. On the other, one of Mr Major's ministers launched a stinging attack on what he called the bombast of the British media, and said Dr Mahathir's government was entitled to fair and accurate reporting. Meanwhile, business people have stood on the sidelines, in a quandary about what to do. The stridency of the initial statement from Kuala Lumpur encouraged officials and local business, anxious to show their loyalty to Dr Mahathir, to talk of severing all contacts with Britain. The Malaysian government became alarmed; its international image might suffer if the situation got out of control. Britain could claim that the Malaysians' actions infringed Gatt regulations. There could be retaliatory action by the European Union. Kuala Lumpur issued a statement clarifying matters: Malaysian students, contrary to announcements by senior officials, would still go to Britain. Private-sector business contacts would carry on as before. Dr Mahathir uses the term Malaysia Inc and the line between public and private business is very blurred. A big British power company, in partnership with a Malaysian concern, is tendering for multi-million-pound contracts with Tenaga Nasional, the semi-privatised electricity utility. 'We really don't know where we are,' the company's regional head declared. 'Is Tenaga considered public or private? We're confused and so are our partners. We've received no official notification of what we should do. It's all very frustrating.' There have been signs of the fog clearing around the issue. A delegation of British business leaders, including Lord Prior, chairman of the British GEC group and a former cabinet minister, was in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week seeing Dr Mahathir. Various formulas for an end to the Malaysian ban are being discussed. Reports in Kuala Lumpur suggest Dr Mahathir wants Mr Major's government to make a formal statement distancing itself from the British media reports on Malaysia. But Mr Major might not wish to take such a stand and risk being accused of giving in to what some in Britain see as Dr Mahathir's unreasonable demands. Mr Major also does not have the relationship with Dr Mahathir built up by Lady Thatcher, his predecessor. Much media attention in Britain is now focused on a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that aid to Malaysia was linked to the sale of Pounds 1.3bn-worth of British arms. The present row might be patched up by some deft diplomatic footwork. But whether the British media will in future report what Dr Mahathir considers to be the truth is another question.

0,FT931-9644 ,"FT931-9644 _AN-DBLB0AE7FT 930212   FT  12 FEB 93 / The way out for Major      By JOE ROGALY   If all else fails, trim your sails. Mr John Major's cabinet is guided by the thought expressed in that little couplet. It is what gets the prime minister through the night. But how to trim? It is easy to commandeer taxpayers' money to pay for wasteful but politically popular hospitals, coal mines or army regiments. It is not so easy when what is at stake is a matter of principle, as with the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Yet as I shall suggest in a moment, there is always something. Consider. Parliament has been told that it must accept or reject the totality of what was agreed by the 12 European Community governments in December 1991. That includes the bit regarded by the prime minister as his personal triumph - the protocol on social policy. According to that celebrated excuse-note, 11 of the member states - but not Britain  - are anxious to adopt the no doubt admirable but costly employment practices laid down in the 1989 'social charter', which gives various rights to employees and imposes numerous obligations on employers. An agreement on this social policy, applicable only to the 11 countries that want to implement it, is appended. Labour says that it wants the terms of that agreement to apply in Britain, so it has put down an amendment that would write the protocol out. The Liberal Democrats concur. Both parties appear to imagine that what will follow if Labour's amendment is carried will be a brief recall of the 12 EC governments, upon which Mr Major will shrug his shoulders, say 'that is what parliament wants' and sign a new treaty that commits Britain to a Continental-style social policy. There is a certain inconsistency here. Under Mr John Smith's guidance Labour is distancing itself from the more expensive forms of social democracy practised in northern Europe. Labour's leader may one day find the social charter a shade too far to the left for the image that he is trying to project. The Conservative Euro-sceptics have a different problem. They see the social charter as a characteristic manifestation of the kind of socialism that would be imposed on Britain by a European super-state. Yet they are suggesting that they will vote for the Labour amendment, on the ground that there is no danger of the prime minister renegotiating the treaty to include the social policy. Some believe the consequence would be that the whole enterprise would be scuppered. This interpretation has been endorsed by Mr Douglas Hurd, who has intimated that if the ratification bill is not passed in its original form, social opt-out included, the treaty will be dead. All of these players are bluffing. Labour and the Liberal Democrats will have trouble keeping their most enthusiastic pro-Europeans in line if it looks as if a vote for the social policy amendment will kill the bill. Mr Smith himself does not want to become known as the man who sank the treaty. The Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons are ducking and weaving in order to keep their opponents - their fellow Conservatives on the government benches  -guessing. Mr Hurd cannot seriously contemplate walking away from the Maastricht treaty. In short you could say that what we have seen this week has been nothing more than a round of parliamentary games. When the vote on Labour's amendment comes, next month or in April, the number of Conservative rebels will be kept below the 11 needed to defeat the government if all opposition MPs turn up and vote the same way. Alternatively, there may be more rebels but the opposition ranks will not hold firm. There is nothing to worry about. This is probably true, but nobody can be sure. A good trimmer always has a contingency plan, as Mr Major demonstrated on November 4. That was the night on which he survived by three votes, bought by a promise to put off the third reading of the Maastricht bill until after the Danish referendum. Better a postponed ratification than no treaty, the foreign secretary explained afterwards, blushing slightly. What Mr Hurd meant was, better a positive vote than no European strategy, no economic strategy, no prime minister and no Conservative government. The same equation will apply if there is a similarly close final vote on the social charter amendment. The prime minister cannot afford to lose. If he did suffer such a calamity he would become Mr John Nothing. His talk of placing Britain at the heart of Europe would sound empty. He would be adrift on the economy, adrift on sterling, adrift on Europe, adrift before the electorate. It is here that my suggestion comes in. The Euro-sceptics would trade their loyalty for a referendum. It is true that Mr Major cannot decently give them the kind of immediate popular veto over ratification that they are asking for. To do so he would have to eat more words than he has been accustomed to consuming at a single sitting. He might choke. So no referendum now. A referendum later, much later, might be easier to swallow. Mr Major could say that the contents of the treaty are too complicated to be expressed as a single question, and that anyhow no serious constitutional issue arises from accepting the treaty as it stands. He would be right. The political arrangements settled at Maastricht do not constitute a step towards a European super-state. The move to economic union is, however, another matter. If Britain does exchange sterling for a single European currency, managed by a single central bank, it will have handed important responsibilities to an outside authority. Maastricht allows Britain to opt in or out of such an arrangement. There is a case for a referendum on that. The vote need not come much before 1996 at the earliest and, the sceptical side of Mr Major may tell himself, it may not happen at all, at least not in the present century. The prime minister would have to say that he could not bind future parliaments, but that his government would recommend a popular vote if the question was whether Britain should enter a single-currency union. If the proposition was put to him this morning, he would reject it. His natural hope must be that there will never again be as close a vote on a European matter as there was on November 4. But suppose there is, and suppose that the clock stands at a few minutes to midnight?   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

British officials said it was unlikely that all members of the group would want to expand the club. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said it was too soon for Russia to become a member of the annual economic summit group. On Thursday night, President Bush said he was prepared to discuss admitting Russia at next week's G7 summit in Munich. The president did not commit himself to supporting the inclusion of Russia, whose president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, will confer with the Group of Seven leaders on the summit's last day. But he said: 'I will be prepared to discuss this, making it a G8 if you will.' This did not seem, however, to be a considered policy statement. He was responding to a question at a press conference by a Russian journalist and answered, off-the-cuff, that the Russian economy was of sufficient size for the issue at least to be debated. UK officials said yesterday that Russian entry would be premature, adding that Japan was likely to oppose such a move. Japan has outstanding territorial disputes with Russia and the two countries still have not signed a peace treaty to mark the end of hostilities in the Second World War. Mr Vogel said: 'Russia has not yet met the economic conditions, and probably not the political conditions either, quickly to become a member of the G8, or a member of what has been the G7 up to now.' The G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will therefore meet Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, for three hours of talks on Wednesday on a 'G7 plus one' basis. The same procedure was adopted last year when the G7 leaders held talks with President Mikhail Gorbachev of the former Soviet Union. Next week's G7 summit is likely to give a strong message of support for Mr Yeltsin and his efforts to push ahead with economic reform in Russia. It is expected to support a rescheduling of Russia's official debts and the release of a first tranche of Dollars 1bn of International Monetary Fund credits for Russia on condition that the government in Moscow puts forward clear plans for reducing its budget deficit and inflation. Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in Britain yesterday on a three-day visit ahead of the summit. Mr Miyazawa, on his first official visit to Britain as premier, will meet Britain's Prime Minister John Major, European Commission President Jacques Delors and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney during his stay in London. In the light of a swelling trade surplus with European Community members, Mr Miyazawa is expected to explain his plans to spur a flagging economy to create markets for more foreign goods. He will also seek European support for Japan's demand that Russia returns four islands off northern Japan seized in 1945.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Plaza officials joined members of the British government, local arts luminaries  and civic leaders Tuesday in kicking off the Festival of Britain, a four-month  celebration of British culture and commerce that culminates in October with  three weeks of festivities at the Costa Mesa shopping mall.

""Originally the idea was for a retail promotion based in South Coast Plaza, but  the festival has grown to something bigger,"" Holloway said. ""It seemed to  blossom on its own. It was a festival waiting to happen.""    A succession of speakers wearing understated Festival of Britain lapel pins  spoke to reporters and guests. Among the guests were Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F.

The big announcement of the day was that a member of the British royal family  -- probably Princess Alexandria, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II -- will visit  at some time during the festival.    As part of the festival, Saks Fifth Avenue is planning an invitation-only  cocktail party and fashion show. Great Britain's Chelsea Crafts and Flower Show  will be re-created at the shopping center. A display of coronation robes  spanning 300 years is planned, as is an exhibition of more than 150 art and  design objects dating from 1790 to the present from London's Victoria &  Albert Museum.    In mid-October, the shopping center will host a Renaissance Faire with court  jesters and musicians celebrating old England, and a British classic car show.    British fashion designer Zandra Rhodes and hologram photographer Alexander are  expected to make appearances at the shopping center.    Brochures, banners, flags and hang tags for merchandise imported from Great  Britain are being designed for the event.    Peter Devin, store manager of Nordstrom and co-chairman of the retail section  of the festival, said 1.6 million people are expected during the three weeks of  the festival.    South Coast Plaza general manager Jim Henwood said it is too early to tell how  much business the festival will generate for the mall, which holds eight anchor  stores and more than 200 smaller outlets.    Among the groups performing in the festival are Britain's D'Oyly Carte Opera  Company and the London Classical Players. Local participants include South  Coast Repertory, Pacific Symphony, Grove Shakespeare Festival and the Laguna  Art Museum.    Seminars about technology exchange and investing in the European Community, an  economic cooperative of European states to be formed in 1992, will be held at  UC Irvine and at Chapman College.    On the arts and community side, the festival committee is contributing about $1  million to the events, and various arts groups are contributing another $1  million, Houlton said.

Sergeyev pointed out that non-targeting of Russian missiles  is being implemented in accordance with the Declaration on  Organization of Daily Activity of Strategic Nuclear Forces with  Non-Targeted Missiles signed by Russian and American Presidents  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on January 14, 1994 in Moscow.  On February 14 Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John  Major signed a joined statement on joining this Declaration.

0,FT922-6842 ,"FT922-6842 _AN-CEUBBAEUFT 920521   FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM resists Tory Euro-sceptics      By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent   ASSURANCES by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the Maastricht treaty marked the beginning of a reversal of the 'centralising trend' in the European Community failed to satisfy prominent Conservative backbench critics in the Commons last night. Mr William Cash, MP for Stafford and one of seven Tory backbenchers who called for the rejection of the Bill implementing the treaty, insisted that it was a 'very centralising measure'. A former cabinet minister, Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North) also expressed 'considerable reservations' about the treaty. He contended that it contained a great deal of senseless commitment to centralism. In a confident speech opening the two-day debate on the Bill, the prime minister maintained that the treaty marked 'an important change in direction' by enabling agreements to be reached by the member states of the European Community outside the confines of the Treaty of Rome which established it. Dealing with another issue that has caused considerable concern on the government back benches, he strongly reaffirmed Britain's determination to maintain frontier controls to guard against illegal immigration from non-EC countries, and to combat terrorism, crime and the traffic in drugs. Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, argued that the issue of immigration controls was one on which Britain could afford to make no concessions and should fight in the courts if necessary. Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), a leading critic of the EC, and Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney), a prominent opponent of the Maastricht treaty, warned that the government's position on frontier controls may be subject to legal challenge. The prime minister promised Britain would 'fiercely' contest such proceedings, citing the 1987 single European Act. He said Britain would co-operate within the framework of international law, but outside the framework of EC law. Emphasising the significance of the distinction, Mr Major said: 'Any dispute would go to the International Court of Justice, not the European Court of Justice.' The prime minister said the Maastricht treaty provided for those to be dealt with either under the Rome treaty or through intergovernmental co-operation. It also recognised that there might be circumstances in which 'the member states can act better on their own'. Underlining the negotiating objectives he achieved at the Maastricht summit, Mr Major said the treaty set 'exactly the framework' Britain wanted for economic and monetary union. It ensured 'an absolute right' for the UK parliament to decide later, at a time of its own choosing, whether Britain should move to the third stage of economic and monetary union. The prime minister hit out at Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, for his condemnation of the carefully negotiated provision giving Britain the right to decide whether or not to join a single currency. Those who supported Mr Kinnock's view, he said, were commiting themselves to 'enter a single currency now in unknown economic circumstances in the future, with the Community at an unknown size and with economic convergence at an unknown level'. Mr Major dismissed Labour's denunciation of the government's refusal to accept the social chapter. He said signing the chapter would have removed from British employers and their employees the right to determine working conditions. Mr Ray Whitney (C Wycombe) argued that the tenor of the debate was out of tune with the mood of the country. He said people outside the House were more disposed to accept the reality of Britain's relationship with Europe. In a maiden speech, Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (C Chingford) warned that the treaty kept the door open to federalist centralisation and an uncompetitive Europe which was clearly moving in the wrong direction from the rest of the world. Sir George Gardiner (C Reigate), who described himself as a 'Euro-pragmatist', said his support for the European ideal had never embraced a federalist structure. He deplored the efforts being made by some to force the EC step by step into a 'federal centralised straitjacket'.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

Are you happy with it?    [Mock] I am satisfied because it was the right step in the  right direction for the first time in three weeks. One must not  forget that there has not been any progress at all during the  past three weeks. Today we had the possibility of really  holding discussions with individual colleagues. I was able to  talk to my three colleagues from the Scandinavian countries.  Then we met Foreign Secretary Hurd and the Spanish foreign  minister. I would say there is a fair chance that a solution  will be found this week or next week. Hurd advocated the  British position, but he indicated clearly that he wants a  solution, even in the form of a compromise.    [Broukal] Mr. Foreign Minister, this is precisely what we  have tried to find out here all afternoon -- namely where is the  compromise? As far as we understand the matter, it is said that  in the future Great Britain cannot prevent anything, unless it  says that it wants to prevent something. That means, how long  will this period be during which Great Britain can say: No, we  are not satisfied, we must still hold discussions? Is there a  day as of which this objection is no longer valid, because only  this would be progress?    [Mock] This will certainly be discussed in Brussels tomorrow  or the day after tomorrow -- whether or not there will be a  specific point in time. However, I may give you a positive  example. In Austria's social partnership [talks between  representatives of employers and employees] there is no specific  period for negotiations and, nevertheless, negotiations are  always held until a result has been achieved with the agreement  of all four parties. This is a system of which the world is  envious.    [Broukal] This means -- if I try to translate what you just  said -- with its resistance Great Britain has achieved  [recognition] that its objections cannot simply be ignored.    [Mock] Correct. I believe that this must be granted, if  there is not more behind it.    [Broukal] If I ask you to take a bet now: What are the  prospects that Austria can continue with its schedule for  membership in the European Union as planned?    [Mock] The working hypothesis still remains that we will be  able to stick to our schedule and hope become a member of the  European Union on 1 January 1995.    [Broukal] Thank you for your visit to the studio, Mr.  Minister.     "
0,FT933-10602 ,"FT933-10602 _AN-DHCCXAD8FT 930803   FT  03 AUG 93 / ERM crisis vindicates UK monetary policy, says Major      By DAVID OWEN   THE MAASTRICHT timetable for European monetary union is now 'totally unrealistic', Mr John Major said yesterday, as he claimed that the emergency steps taken to salvage the exchange rate mechanism vindicated his decision to suspend sterling's membership last September. As government loyalists and Euro-sceptics alike sought to draw comfort from the day's events, which also saw Britain become the eleventh European Community state to ratify Maastricht, the prime minister said he hoped the decision to allow wider fluctuation of currencies within the ERM would promote economic recovery in Europe. In the timetable, if a commencement date for stage three of monetary union has not been set by the end of 1997, then Emu must in any case go ahead by January 1999. In a remark later played down by Downing Street, Mr Major appeared to hold out the prospect that the changes could herald lower domestic interest rates. There remained 'no prospect' of Britain returning to the ERM 'in the near future', he said. The government would continue to set monetary policy by 'what's right for the United Kingdom'. But as senior ministers trumpeted the message that recent developments justified the government's European policy, their thunder was partly stolen by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who predicted there would be no single European currency and described Maastricht as 'a bit of a fossil'. Tory Euro-sceptics, meanwhile, pointed to the 'supreme irony' of Britain ratifying Maastricht on the day the ERM collapsed. Downing Street emphasised that 'relative currency stability' remained a desirable objective and looked ahead to a process of examining why the old system did not work and how existing fault-lines could be eradicated. It pinned the blame for the system's difficulties squarely on the strains resulting from German reunification. It indicated that an autumn summit of member states to discuss possible solutions was likely. In his forthright reaction to the decision to create a 15 per cent fluctuation band for all ERM currencies except the D-Mark and the guilder, Mr Lamont said: 'This does mean the end of a single currency, the end of monetary union in Europe. This makes the Maastricht treaty redundant.' It was 'extraordinary that we have spent so much time constructing this artificial creation and, frankly, it has gone out of the window', he said.

The meeting mainly discussed the  issue of the All Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Chinese  Patriotic Prodemocracy Movement [AHKASCPPM].    The backbone of AHKASCPPM was made up by radical democrats  in  Hong Kong, and AHKASCPPM was led by Szeto Wah and Martin Lee.  They had seized the opportunity provided by the activities of  people of all sectors in Hong Kong in support of the patriotic  student movement at Tiananmen, and had established AHKASCPPM,  which had achieved unprecedented development. This was a united  front-type organization which was mainly based on center-right  forces, while including also people of the left, the center, and  the right. The leadership of the organization was in the hands  of radical democrats. At that time AHKASCPPM incorporated almost  all the democracy- and autonomy-seeking organizations of various  tendencies in Hong Kong as well as many of those centrist  associations which had been rather politically apathetic before  or even some leftist organizations. During the 4 June Incident,  they had adopted exceptionally radical strategies in fighting  Beijing, shouting the slogans, ""down with Deng, Li, and Yang""  and ""down with fascism""; they had declared that they would not  recognize the legitimacy of the ""Li Peng regime,"" and had vowed  not to have any contact with the ""Li Peng regime.""    At the meeting Beijing argued that this was an organization  attempting to subvert the Chinese Government and a tool used by  some Western countries and local anti-Communist forces in their  joint effort to turn Hong Kong into an anti-Communist base, and  demanded that Britain ""outlaw"" it. Ji Pengfei agreed to the view  expressed by Li Hou [2621 0683] that ""we should take up the  matter of the British Government's tolerating AHKASCPPM with the  British Government and demand that the British Government  nullify the registration of AHKASCPPM and outlaw AHKASCPPM.""    The CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee's view was  somewhat different. According to our intelligence units, we  argued at the meeting, there really are a small number of people  in AHKASCPPM who are using this organization in carrying out  activities of fighting the Chinese Government, and among those  few people there are representatives of foreign and outside  forces who are attempting to turn Hong Kong into an open or  semiopen anti-Communist subversive base; but as for the broad  masses who participated in activities and shouted radical  slogans because of their indignation, we should adopt a policy  of dividing and winning over people--winning over the majority  and isolating and striking at a small minority. We are in favor  of having the British outlaw AHKASCPPM in accordance with the  law of Hong Kong. The law of Britain prohibits activities to  subvert the British sovereign. With regard to openly calling for  the subversion of the Chinese Government and shouting the  slogan, down with the Chinese Government, we may take up the  matter with the British Government, but we estimate that the  chance of Britain's accommodating us is not great; therefore it  is still necessary to mainly rely on our own work in the future.    As for some people's attempt to turn Hong Kong into an  anti-Communist base, we believe that such a situation has  existed all along and that the only difference is that some  people want to change from operating secretly as in the past  into operating openly or semiopenly by exploiting the current  movement. The intelligence units have discovered in a  preliminary manner that in fleeing the country some of those who  participated in the democracy movement in the hinterland have  depended on the help from AHKASCPPM which has not only provided  money but has also specially assigned people to do the job. Some  of those who have fled the country first stayed at the home of  that ""specially assigned person,"" and then got foreign visas and  left Hong Kong. Those few people are the main targets of  struggle.    The meeting did not further discuss the analysis made by the  CPC Work Committee. The conclusion was that it would be  necessary to take up the matter with the British Government in  an effort ""to outlaw AHKASCPPM,"" and that it was also necessary  to work on others so as to gradually weaken or even eliminate  the organization, thereby eliminating the tool used by some  forces in their effort to use Hong Kong as a base for subverting  the Chinese Government.    The meeting also listened to Li Hou's speech on the  resumption of the activities of drafting the Basic Law. In view  of Hong Kong's performance during the 4 June Incident, Li Hou  suggested that clauses on deterring subversive activities and  imposing marshal law in time of emergency should be added to the  draft Basic Law. As no participant expressed any disagreement,  the suggestion was also passed.    After the meeting the Foreign Ministry and the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY took up the matter of outlawing  AHKASCPPM with the British Foreign Ministry and the British Hong  Kong government, respectively. We also carried out supporting  media actions in Hong Kong. The British Government rejected  China's demand on the ground that AHKASCPPM was registered in  Hong Kong and was not in violation of the law of Hong Kong. In  addition we also persuaded some leftist and centrist  organizations which had joined AHKASCPPM to leave AHKASCPPM.  Some centrist organizations left AHKASCPPM for their own  reasons. But all this only ""weakened"" AHKASCPPM slightly.    On 21 July RENMIN RIBAO published an article by Ai Zhong,  entitled ""No Attempts to Disrupt the One Country, Two Systems'  Arrangement Is Allowed."" We had had no prior knowledge about it,  and felt surprised. After some inquiry we learned that the  article had been drafted by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office. Hong Kong society reacted strongly to the article. I  felt that the article were flawed in two aspects. First, it  revealed the internal analysis that a small number of people  were attempting to turn Hong Kong into an open or semiopen  anti-Communist base, and the language of the article would lead  people to think that all those people in Hong Kong who had  participated in the activities supporting the student's  patriotic movement were trying to turn Hong Kong into an  anti-Communist base, thereby striking at a very large number of  people and creating many enemies. The article not only failed to  square with the facts but was also very unwise in a tactical  sense.    Second, it almost openly named the names of Martin Lee and  Szeto Wah. I felt that the article constituted openly treating  those two persons as ""enemies,"" and that nevertheless the  article would not only fail to isolate those two persons but  also increase their name recognition in the political arena and  their political capital. On the other hand the article would  create a situation where there would be no way of making contact  with those two persons in the future and where work could not be  carried out. We had already known the stands of those two  persons. In dealing with them who would be our adversaries in  future political struggles, we should conduct both struggle and  cooperation. After the 4 June Incident they misread the  situation in China and adopted a radical strategy. Now struggle  with them was the dominant aspect of the matter. But openly  naming names in this way now would in fact leave no room and was  thus a radical move which was unwise in a tactical sense.    I thought that it was necessary first of all to clarify the  first issue and to make explanation to Hong Kong society so as  to moderate the strong reactions against the RENMIN RIBAO  article, through making a distinction between the majority and a  small minority and making clear that the ""anti-Communist base""  had nothing to do with the majority. I immediately arranged for  others to write an article expounding this view in a focused  manner. After it was written I sent it to Beijing, hoping that  it would be published in RENMIN RIBAO. However, later Li Hou  told us that approval was only given to publishing it in the  magazine LIAOWANG. Surely the basic stand of this article was in  support of that RENMIN RIBAO article and therefore its impact  was not large.    After the 4 June Incident I made direct and indirect contact  with Szeto Wah and Martin Lee privately. The purpose then was to  preserve some room for restoring cooperation in the future. But  Beijing did not know the activity. They would not have given  approval, but would probably have tried to stop the activity;  and if they would not criticize the activity immediately, they  would probably have kept ""a record"" afterward.    The policy and strategy of the Communist Party of China and  the Chinese Government of trying to get AHKASCPPM ""outlawed"" and  ""eliminated"" were wrong and would not work. This wrong strategy  not only will not work before 1997 but is also very unlikely to  work after 1997. If they at that time adopt tough ""outlawing""  measures, not only will the Communist Party of China and the  Chinese Government continue to pay a political price, but the  government of the special administrative region will also be put  in a very difficult position, resulting in damages to Hong Kong  people's confidence in the government of the special  administrative region. The wise approach would be to show  ""tolerance,"" trying to win over the majority and gradually  changing their attitude toward China. With the continuous reform  and opening up on the mainland itself and with the increasing  closeness in the relations between Hong Kong and the hinterland  as 1997 is drawing near, it is entirely possible that such a  policy and strategy will work.    I participated in the formulating of the erroneous policy  and  strategy and approved of the policy and strategy; therefore I  was responsible in this respect.

On Two Occasions David Wilson Took the Initiative in  Inviting Me To Have ""Afternoon Tea"" at the Governor's Residence.    After the 4 June Incident China's relations with the entire  Western world deteriorated, and the relations between China and  Britain also deteriorated. Clashes between China and Britain  occurred continually, and the relations between China and  Britain ebbed, thereby ending the short period of cooperation  which had existed after the signing of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration.    Britain and the entire Western world together adopted a  tough  policy of imposing sanctions on China. Britain suspended  diplomatic contact with China and also unilaterally suspended  the meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. All  negotiations between China and Britain on the question of Hong  Kong came to an almost complete halt. The British Government  adopted the strategy of supporting the patriotic mass movement  in society. In this way it could not only make a good impression  on people at large but also make China's image even worse and  weaken people's confidence in China. On the other hand they also  worried that the development of the patriotic mass movement  would affect public safety in Hong Kong, resulting in a loss of  control which could cause China to take up the matter with them  and intervene. After the 4 June Incident their way of handling  workers' strikes, shopkeepers' strikes, and students' strikes  across the city contained contradictory elements but was wise.    The British Hong Kong government took actions to facilitate  people's patriotic activities, such as allowing the masses to  hold rallies at the racecourse, an unprecedented move. On the  other hand they also enhanced protection for the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and Chinese-owned institutions.  At that time there were constant mass activities such as  marches, petitioning, round-the-clock sit-ins, hunger strikes,  and demonstrations in front of the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY BUILDING. The walls opposite the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were completely covered with  posters and cartoons. There were many onlookers. The situation  was tense. In addition to increasing police patrol, the British  Hong Kong government also had several dozen additional police  personnel posted at the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY all the time. We vacated the first floor of the building  to give them a place to stay. They set up such things telephones  and monitoring television devices, applying rather elaborate  security measures. In the past, during the Kowloon riots, there  had been attacks on China's institutions in Hong Kong. At that  time the British Hong Kong government had not taken preventive  measures beforehand. This time they took the initiative, and  solicited advice from us beforehand. Only after securing our  consent did they do those things as described. They treated  Chinese-owned banks and newspapers and other institutions  belonging to China in the same way.    After the 4 June Incident the CPC Work Committee also made  preparations for dealing with the most serious situation. We  divided the CPC Work Committee's responsible persons into two  groups. One group stayed at the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY Building, ready to deal with any serious situation;  the other group retreated to the Stanley guest-house, getting  prepared to continue necessary activities in case the Hong Kong  Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY should be unable to make  contact with the outside world. I decided to stay in the Hong  Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY BUILDING, and Zheng Hua  and Qiao Zongzhun went to Stanley.    Before the 4 June Incident, once David Wilson, governor of  Hong Kong, by his own initiative, invited me to have ""afternoon  tea"" at the governor's residence. After the foreign affairs  department secured approval from the Foreign Ministry, I went  there. David Wilson asked me about my opinion of what had  happened in Beijing. Could I tell him my personnel opinion? I  used the diplomatic approach in a unique way: ""Your Excellency,  I have been instructed to inform you that the activities at  Tiananmen in Beijing are an instance of turmoil."" David Wilson  expressed his understanding.    When discussing local activities in Hong Kong society in  support of the student movement in Beijing, David Wilson told me  that according to the statistics of the police department of the  British Hong Kong government, approximately 500,000 people  participated in the 21 April march, which had been claimed to be  a million-man march. They had devoted all their resources to  making sure that no accidents would happen during the march. He  also told me that they would do everything possible to safeguard  the security of China's institutions in Hong Kong, and he  expressed his appreciation of the cooperation given by the Hong  Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in this regard. I also  expressed my appreciation of the measures taken by the British  Hong Kong government to safeguard the security of China's  institutions in Hong Kong.    After the formal talk with David Wilson, I chatted casually  with him as he walked out of the front room to see me out. He  said that it was very difficult to handle things under the  current circumstances, thereby demonstrating that he felt that  he was in a difficult position. I immediately said in a  sympathetic manner: ""I understand."" He was moved by my words and  said: ""You assumed heavy responsibilities when being the leader  of a big province. You are experienced and know what may happen  under such circumstances."" I replied in a sympathetic manner: ""I  understand your difficulties. We are similar to each other.""  David Wilson spoke standard putonghua. We talked to  each other directly in putonghua. (Installment No.127)    [9 Sep 93 p 2]    [Text] One ""Incident"" After Another (Part Two of  Four): The Issue of the Right of Abode in Britain Caused  Disputes Between China and Britain; There Was a Strong Statement  Accusing Britain of Violating the Joint Declaration    My second meeting with David Wilson was similar to the first  in that this time David Wilson again invited me to have  ""afternoon tea"" by his own initiative. The relations between  China and Britain was then already rather tense. At that time,  in accordance with Beijing's instruction, the foreign affairs  department of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY was  negotiating with the political counsel of the Hong Kong  government on the issue of outlawing AHKASCPPM. Our side  demanded that the British Hong Kong government nullify the  registration of AHKASCPPM. The British side said that the  registration had been handled according to the law of Hong Kong.  We then argued that according to the law of Hong Kong an  organization would not be allowed to try to subvert the British  sovereign, and that therefore the registration of AHKASCPPM  should still be nullified. The British side retorted: that  according to the law of Hong Kong AHKASCPPM should be allowed to  exist and operate. Either side was willing to make concessions,  resulting in a stalemate. However, when I met with David Wilson,  neither of us touched upon this issue. What he was concerned  with seemed to be the situation of the top leadership in  Beijing. I could not satisfy his desire, and, like friends, we  chatted for a while.    I talked to David Wilson about the issue of ""the right of  abode in Britain"" raised by some people in Hong Kong. This issue  had first been raised by the manager of a conglomerate in Hong  Kong in the name of an organization. The point of departure was  that after the 4 June Incident too many of Hong Kong's elites  had emigrated, thereby affecting the functioning of Hong Kong  enterprises. This was true. As too large a portion of the  managerial personnel of the business world had emigrated, those  who had not emigrated were also unsettled, and were planning to  emigrate, resulting in a serious brain drain. In Hong Kong  society there was a widespread feeling of a lack of enterprise  management personnel. High salaries were used to retain the  management personnel planning to emigrate. There were two salary  increases in one year, or even three increases in some cases.  Under such circumstances some people put forward the idea of  ""the right of abode in Britain,"" the idea that the right of  abode in Britain should be given now while those granted the  right would not emigrate to Britain right away, that after 1997  they would not necessarily emigrate if China's policies should  be enlightened and if Hong Kong should remain in the same  condition as before, and that they would emigrate if they should  consider the situation to be bad. People in Hong Kong said that  under the current immigration procedures, there was a need to  stay in an ""immigration prison."" That is, they could return to  Hong Kong only after they had lived in the foreign country and  had acquired residence status there. ""The right of abode in  Britain"" could eliminate the need to stay in the ""immigration  prison."" As a result there would be no adverse effects on their  service at enterprises. They publicized this idea in newspapers,  and carried out activities privately, applying pressure on the  British Government and demanding that the British Government  grant this right. It seemed that the British Government had  adopted this idea and was using it for resolving the issue of  civil servants in the British Hong Kong government, in an effort  to change their mood characterized by a lack of confidence and a  desire to emigrate.    I told David Wilson my personal opinion as Beijing had not  yet given any instructions on this issue. With regard to the  issue of ""the right of abode in Britain,"" I said to David  Wilson, my personal opinion is that the putting forward of this  idea is understandable, but that some problems will be difficult  to resolve, and may lead to serious consequences. If ""the right  of abode in Britain"" is applied to civil servants, then there  will be great difficulties in the continued functioning of the  government of the special administrative region after 1997. For  with the departure of a large part of those civil servants  granted ""the right of abode in Britain"" who have no confidence  in the future special administrative region, there will be a  lack of knowledgeable people in the government of the special  administrative region. If the situation in Hong Kong is good at  that time and if most of the civil servants have confidence,  decide not to emigrate while still having the right of abode in  Britain, and stay here to serve the government of the special  administrative region, then will they be loyal to the British  sovereign or to the government of the special administrative  region? They will experience such conflicts both psychologically  and in real life. I hope you will consider the issue carefully.  In this way, I in fact described in advance the position which  China would find it difficult to accept, despite the fact that  at that time I did not know Beijing's attitude. Because I spoke  in a discussion tone, David Wilson just nodded and did not  indicate his attitude after listening to me.    Shortly afterward, at the Hong Kong and Macao work  conference  gathered by Ji Pengfei, Zhou Nan [0719 0589] presented the  written protest concerning ""the right of abode in Britain"" that  the Foreign Ministry intended to deliver to the British Foreign  Ministry, and asked the participants to discuss it. The draft  raised the importance of the issue to the level of violating and  damaging the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and stated that the  British Government would be held responsible.    I suggested that such wording might be too strong. According  to my information, I argued, the issue was not raised by Britain  but has been ""taken up"" by Britain which has then expanded the  issue to encompass the civil servants; at least such has been  the case on the surface. Many upper- and middle-strata people in  Hong Kong are in favor of Britain's adopting this policy and  hope that Britain will adopt this policy. It is necessary to  reconsider whether to raise the importance of the issue to the  level of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration. If we are  being too harsh, those people's mood will be affected; as a  result the work of winning those people over will be adversely  affected. If there is to be a written public protest, might it  not be advisable to make the wording milder and not to raise the  importance of the issue to such a level? Ji Pengfei approved of  my view, and immediately asked Zhou Nan to make some changes.  Nevertheless the protest which was made public later still  exhibited a harsh attitude, effectively accusing the other side  of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

He complained that Mr John Major had given no indication in his speech to MPs about the future direction of UK economic policy. There was also a 'vacuum of leadership' in the UK over ratification of the Maastricht treaty which would only strengthen the hands of Euro-sceptics. Mr Ashdown argued that sterling's difficulties last week could have been avoided if measures had been taken earlier to tackle weaknesses in Britain's economy. It was 'nonsense' to suggest that a peculiar bout of speculation meant that 'in a single day, the central planks of the government's economic policy and of its foreign policy were obliterated'. Mr Major had wanted Britain at the heart of Europe, 'but last week he put this country at the periphery of Europe', the Liberal Democrat leader said. It had been a tactical mistake for the government to blame Germany for the crisis, 'for which we will pay a very heavy price in the future'. Britain was now in danger of being condemned to 'a second tier' within the EC. Responding to Tory jibes that Liberal Democrat policy had been to put sterling in the narrow bands of the ERM in order to boost the currency's credibility, Mr Ashdown insisted that such a move would have increased the financial markets' confidence in the UK's commitment to Europe. Confidence in the pound could now be boosted by a move to an independent central bank, investment in infrastructure and by Britain spurning its 'opt-out' from a single currency in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Ashdown said. The lesson of last week was that moves towards a single currency would help European countries co-operate in exchange rate management.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Sir, The British government might take the opportunity of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's visit to London last week to think again about one aspect of its European policy. Spain has put high on its list of priorities for the current intergovernmental conferences a change in the EC's financing arrangements to ensure that the Community budget brings about adequate transfers from the richer to the poorer member states. Such a concept has not endeared itself to those in Britain who fear that it will only inflate EC spending still further and that such transfers are unnecessary and wasteful. No doubt much can and should be done to see that EC monies on regional and social projects are properly used, but problems on this account do not invalidate the argument for having a Community budget, whatever its size, which is consciously redistributive. At present there are serious anomalies with some of the richer EC member states being net beneficiaries. If there was an override mechanism to make sure that the overall effect of Community budget flows was as it ought to be - according to need and ability to pay - there would be less need to distort the Community's individual policies. In particular, countries both rich and poor which currently benefit from the excessive expenditure on agricultural price support might be less resistant to sensible reform of the Cap. This in itself should commend the Spanish proposal to Britain. But there are two other reasons. Since our GDP per head is around the EC average, we should come out of a redistributive budget at least as well as under the present arrangements. Second, since the present arrangements depend on a special corrective mechanism negotiated with difficulty for Britain alone, we should be much less exposed if they were replaced by something which was really communautaire.

Mr Ashworth, spokesman for the Save Britain's Fish campaign, believes this is the thin end of the wedge. It will lead to the European Union's largest fleet winning entry to all EU waters, including the North Sea, by 2003, he says. 'At the end of the day, it means that Britain has handed over her greatest renewable resource. It will mean the end of our industry.' The campaign group wants Britain to renounce the principle enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy of equal access for all member states to a common resource. As this is the policy's cornerstone, they say the logical step is for Britain to withdraw from the CFP. Next week, EU fisheries ministers must resolve the prickly question of how to integrate Spain and Portugal into the western waters off the UK, France and north-west Spain, and in particular into the 'Irish Box'  - the waters surrounding Ireland. While having restricted access to most of the western waters, the two countries have been barred from the Irish Box  - where fish stocks are particularly fragile  - since they joined the community. This ban is to be lifted at the end of next year, but the UK and Ireland are anxious to protect their fishermen's rights and minimise the Iberian presence. The British House of Commons will tonight debate an opposition Labour party amendment to keep Iberian fishermen out of the Irish Box. It could win backing from anti-European Conservatives, leaving the government facing another defeat. Spain has threatened to block the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden in January unless a deal is worked out by the end of this year. The UK government has been at pains this week to deny rumours spreading through the fishing community that Spain has already been granted new rights to these waters under a secret deal. Mr Michael Jack, the fisheries minister, says the only agreement at last weekend's EU summit in Essen was that a fishing deal should be clear and unbureaucratic. Mr Ashworth acknowledges that Spain and Portugal are fully justified in their claims to greater access. But he cannot see how the European Commission can square this with an agreement that Iberian integration into the CFP should not entail any overall increase in fishing effort. 'I don't think they know how to do it,' he says. 'They're in a shambles.' Integration, originally due by 2003, was brought forward to 1996 as part of the deal on accession for the Efta countries. British fishermen are deeply concerned that the 17,000-strong Spanish fishing fleet will ignore quotas and other conservation measures in western waters. They also fear the Spaniards will catch immature fish, which are much appreciated on their domestic market, depriving shoals of their replacement stocks. Mr John Thomson, vice-chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers, says fishermen are already hard-pressed. 'Fishing is the life-blood of Scottish communities. For every man at sea there may be 10 people employed on shore. We're very frightened this could be devastated.' At the very least, he wants Britain to regulate EU vessels entering its western waters, a proposal taken up by the UK government. Mr Geoff Bullus, a Cornish fishermen's leader, is bitter about what he sees as double standards. 'Stocks are overfished at the moment and the scientists are recommending reductions in all stocks in the western approaches. At the same time the Commission is telling us we must make room for the Spanish fleet. That's very difficult to stomach.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-6893 ,"FT941-6893 _AN-EB1DPAAZFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / Malaysia's fury may scare investors: The UK ban could rebound on Kuala Lumpur      By KIERAN COOKE   Since Friday's official announcement that Malaysia would no longer give contracts to British companies, the Malaysian government and the local media have been emphasising the serious consequences of the move for British business. If the Malaysian government carries through its threat - and there is little at this stage to indicate any softening of Kuala Lumpur's position - many hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of contracts for British companies will be lost. Some companies could be forced to lay off workers in Britain. But Malaysian businessmen privately admit that the move could also have serious consequences for Malaysia. On the broader side of things it could give the impression, already held in some quarters, that Malaysia is a difficult country to do business with. Malaysia, for all its recent economic success, is still dependent on foreign investment, especially in areas of high technology. Last year foreign investments in Malaysia fell by 66 per cent to MDollars 6bn (Pounds 1.5bn). British fund managers have been among the largest foreign investors in Kuala Lumpur's booming stock market, but no one is as yet suggesting a wholesale retreat from investing in what is one of the world's fast growing economies and one of the best performing of the emerging markets. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has always put himself forward as an economic pragmatist. 'I'm sometimes nasty to governments, never to businesspeople' he said recently. But last week's action will undoubtedly provoke some cautious thoughts among investors and companies contemplating doing business in the country. Malaysia's leaders have been insisting that the country can do without British companies. In the long term this may well be true. But over the past six years British companies have built up very close relationships with partners in Malaysia and, in many areas, Malaysia has come to rely on British expertise. In the power sector, for example, British companies have been heavily involved in both the supply of equipment and consultancy work for Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially privatised electricity utility. The UK's National Grid company was instrumental in drawing up plans to rectify serious shortcomings in the power supply system following a countrywide blackout in late 1992. It was also reported to be considering taking a 20 per cent stake in a new Malaysian company to install vital transmission lines. All that work will now be undone; future maintenance and supply contracts involving British equipment will be withdrawn. This could cause serious complications in a sector vital to Malaysia's onward economic growth. In the defence sector, Dr Mahathir recently announced that Malaysia was embarking on a comprehensive programme to build up its aerospace industry. The growth of this will come, in the first instance, mainly from 'offset' agreements reached with suppliers to Malaysia's civil and military aviation sectors. Under the 1988 memorandum of understanding between Britain and Malaysia on British defence sales, Malaysia bought 28 British Aerospace Hawk trainers and fighters. The first of those was only recently delivered to Malaysia. Part of the Hawk purchase agreement was a MDollars 400m 'offset' programme involving the transfer of British technology to Malaysia and extensive maintenance and training agreements. Such programmes are central to Malaysia's aerospace industry plans. Malaysia says it will stand by existing contracts, including the Hawk purchase. But given the prevailing atmosphere, further complex defence agreements involving vital maintenace work and training for millions of dollars worth of equipment already purchased might prove difficult to reach. In the present circumstances, virtually anything or anyone British is liable to be treated with some suspicion, if not hostility. Firms like Schroders, the London merchant bankers, which has been advising the Malaysian government on its privatisation programme and other projects, might now find life rather difficult. Malaysian companies involved in trading with Britain might also be a little nervous. Malaysia runs a healthy trade surplus with Britain. No one has as yet suggested retaliatory action by Britain against Malaysia. But if the present argument escalates then Proton, the Malaysian car maker, could suffer. The UK is by far the biggest export market for Proton: it sold just under 15,000 cars in Britain in 1992 and more than 16,000 last year. Britain is also the launching pad for Proton's plans to capture a share of the market elsewhere in Europe. Malaysia, intent on making a political point, seems to be unconcerned about any adverse reaction arising from its move against British business. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said at the weekend that the move 'does not involve two-way trade, business relationships and investment.' Many British companies would beg to disagree. See Press Review below, and Editorial Comment, Page 17   Countries:-  MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Foreign Secretary was under attack from all sides in  Brussels as EU [European Union] ministers argued over how voting  arrangements should be adjusted when four new countries join the  union. Only Spain lined up with Britain in opposing the changes  and the talks broke up last night without agreement; they will  resume next Tuesday [22 March].    Denmark had warned Mr Hurd that he could be triggering a  serious political crisis, since failure to settle the issue  could put the enlargement of the community at risk. Niels  Helveg Petersen, the Danish Foreign Minister, said the British  position was untenable: ""They cannot say throughout their  presidency that they are in favour of enlargement and then come  here and try to block it.""    Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, put more pressure on  Britain with a telephone call to the Prime Minister expressing  concern about the danger of the enlargement talks breaking down.    But the Foreign Office said last night that nothing had been  put forward that met Britain's basic requirements. Mr Hurd  would return home this morning for talks with Mr Major, and  officials hoped that he would bring with him ""something that  moves in the right direction."" British officials said that some  progress had been made, but the French European Affairs Minister  Alain Lamassoure said positions had hardened rather than moved  closer together and some diplomats thought an emergency summit  might be needed to decide the issue.    At the heart of the dispute is a proposal to raise from 23  votes to 27 the so-called blocking minority that can veto some  community legislation. Britain, which has ten votes wants to  keep the figure at 23. Spain is also against the change, but  has put forward a compromise combining the two positions.    Mr Hurd had been warned before leaving for Brussels that  Conservative MPs would not accept a climbdown, yet  Euro-enthusiasts insisted that he must not jeopardise the  expansion of the community that he and Mr Major advocate. Mr  Major told the Commons yesterday that he was ""very much in  favour"" of enlargement, but Britain wanted to ensure ""democratic  legitimacy"" and the rights of minorities in the EU.    Sweden, Finland and Austria have all agreed the terms under  which they will join and ministers were last night close to a  final agreement with Norway. But a failure to settle the voting  dispute would put their accession in doubt because the European  Parliament might not have time to ratify the relevant treaty  before the June elections. Referendums planned for the autumn  might also have to be delayed, making it more difficult for the  four countries' governments to maintain the momentum of popular  support for EU membership.    Acutely aware of the dangers, Hans van den Broek, the EU  foreign affairs commissioner, appealed to Mr Major to put the  community's interests ahead of his own domestic troubles, while  the German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met Mr Hurd twice  yesterday to try to find a way through the impasse.    Tory divisions over the ""blocking minority"" are less  clearcut  than during the Maastricht saga, because at least some  Euro-enthusiasts are dubious about the voting proposals. John  Townend chairman of the party's backbench finance committee,  said opposition was spread right across the party. ""This is a  case of blackmail. The commission is proposing watering down  voting rights to have enlargement of the community."" The  community had a vested interest in enlargement because the  incoming countries were rich.    Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory MP for Chingford, said: ""There is no  need to move on this. There is no real threat. We should just  call their bluff and stand firm."" Lord Parkinson agreed. He  said Mr Hurd should stand firm, ""not out of bloody-mindedness,  but because what we have demonstrated since the Maastricht vote  is that Britain has been right in resisting the move to a single  currency and an evertighter ERM.""    But Hugh Dykes, chairman of the European Movement, denounced  his Euro-sceptic colleagues as ""neurotic TV chat-show ogres,""  and Ray Whitney, MP for Wycombe, said: ""We should not lose  sight -- and we should not allow those opposed to Britains  membership of Europe to allow us to lose sight -- of the real  objective of getting enlargement in the national interest.""

Yet a transfer of ownership overseas would in this case amount to little more than repatriation. At the date of the last published balance sheet, less than a fifth of Lancer Boss's Pounds 192m turnover was generated in the UK. Of the 70 per cent or so that came from continental Europe, a majority was from Steinbock Boss, the third-largest German lift truck manufacturer which was acquired by Lancer Boss in 1983. The foreign tail has clearly been wagging the British bulldog. More interesting than the ownership question is the reason for the failure to turn a domestic industrial success story into a durable international operation. The fork-lift truck industry is, after all, a post-war phenomenon. It has been more open than traditional areas of engineering to new entrepreneurial entrants. Companies like Lancer Boss and Lansing Bagnall, which was earlier taken over by the biggest German lift truckmaker Linde, performed well in the earlier stages of the industry life cycle but failed to establish themselves as robust independent entities in a period when global capacity was being rationalised. The strength of German mechanical engineering, the size of its domestic market and the stability of the German economy are no doubt part of the explanation for British  - along with French and Italian  - ineffectiveness. Equally striking is that Lancer Boss, in order to make the transition to a powerful internationally-based manufacturer, felt obliged to take a huge risk by buying a troubled German company much bigger than itself. Against the background of a less stable British economic environment it was transforming the scale of its operations and magnifying the potential financial consequences of any managerial weakness. The risks were heightened by banking arrangements which appear to have left maximum room for misunderstanding in a financial crisis. A national approach to receivership in a pan-European group is a formula for preventing the full value of the business being realised, given that the subsidiaries in Britain and Germany were fairly closely integrated. Yet in a single market where countries compete over the relative flexibility of closure arrangements to attract inward investment, the politics of Euro-receivership look hopeless. The story should nonetheless be seen in context. If stability in Germany is a boon to mechanical engineers, Britain derives comparative advantage from precisely the opposite phenomenon. Its overwhelming success in international financial services stems partly from the need to deal with growing financial instability. And that, of course, is a source of constant hand-wringing in Germany.   Companies:-  Lancer Boss Group.     Steinbock Boss Logistik Systems.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Aitken used a Commons debate on the Navy to defend lower staffing on the grounds that new equipment was generally less labour intensive than what it replaced. Application rates to leave the Navy were at a 10-year low, he added. Under its Options for Change review the government planned to reduce the Navy staff to 55,000 by the mid 1990s. But it was announced last month that a further cut of 5,000 was to be effected by the end of the century. Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East, criticised government ministers for announcing these further cuts in manpower requirements 'on the eve of the Easter recess'. Mr Winston Churchill, the MP for Davyhulme, called for an assurance that staffing would not fall short of that set out in the review. If it did, it would be 'a matter of the gravest concern'. Mr John Wilkinson (C Ruislip-Northwood) warned: 'Unless our party reverts more clearly to its traditional attachment to the importance of national defence, I think we will lose much of the trust that has rightfully been ours on the part of those who care about the security of our country.' Mr Mark Wolfson (C Sevenoaks) said Britain had returned to a world role, but with a smaller Navy and that there was 'a serious danger of overstretch'. Mr Aitken told MPs during the debate last night that the government expects to announce 'within the next few weeks' whether the long-awaited contract for Trident nuclear submarine refitting work will be awarded to Devonport or Rosyth. Mr Aitken used the Royal Navy debate to announce one new order, worth an estimated Pounds 30m, for five Type 23 frigate command systems to be placed with British Aerospace Sema. Britain is extending its maritime jurisdiction to protect fishing stocks within a 200-mile radius of South Georgia, in the Falklands, and the South Sandwich Islands, the government announced last night.

[Petrella] I believe that during the past few years, we have  witnessed more dramatic changes in the world than actual  possibilities that Great Britain will transfer the Malvinas  Islands' sovereignty to Argentina. We have the examples of  South Africa, the Middle East, the changes taking place in  Russia, in the former Yugoslavia. The changes the world is  experiencing are so unpredictable and fast that something like  that could happen.    Argentina does not want to rush things, however. Since 1983  and 1990, when relations with Great Britain were restored and,  especially, with President Carlos Menem's administration and the  implementation of Domingo Cavallo and Guido Di Tella's foreign  policy, what has changed is our concern over the islanders'  interests. In the past, this aspect was not taken into account  as much as it is now.    [Carvallo] In what sense?    [Petrella] Democratic Argentina realizes that the islanders  have their own identity, that the islands' society is no longer  the pastoral nor isolated society it was before 1982. To a  certain degree, the war, with all its terrible aspects, brought  an economic well-being the islanders did not enjoy before.  These facts must be taken into account in a negotiation. In  fact, during all our meetings with the British and the  islanders, we have fully respected their interests. We believe  the islands will gradually grow closer to us through dialogue  and the fact that Argentina continues to grow and is predictable  from the political viewpoint. In addition, the Southern Cone  offers a climate of harmony, cooperation, friendship, and  firmness regarding our claim.    [Carvallo] But are the islanders aware of that?    [Petrella] There are concrete signs that lead us to believe  that our policy has prompted a debate on the islands. If you  read the PENGUIN NEWS (local daily) as carefully as we do, you  will notice that the islanders discuss a relationship with  Argentina. Naturally, it is not always fully positive. They  argue and say rude things about us, but at least we are again a  subject of their discussions on the future of the islands, in  which Argentina is always mentioned. [passage omitted]    [Carvallo] Can you assure that Argentine will never again  resort to the use of force?    [Petrella] Definitely. First, because it is not ethical;  Second, because it does not generate solutions; and third,  because we appreciate and need our relationship with Great  Britain and Europe, which is almost the same thing. These are  three very pragmatic and clear reasons that are by no means  idealistic. When we talk about ethics we are not talking about  idealism. We are talking about something very sound and very  special: force does not yield solutions. It is a `boomerang'  because in the long run it would affect our relationship with  Great Britain and Europe. Only recently, Argentina overcame the  U.S. and European embargo that followed the war. This problem  has still not been solved with Great Britain who still refuses  to sell us spare parts and military equipment. This is very  complicated because most of Argentina's military equipment,  traditionally was British. [passage omitted]    [Carvallo] It has been said that the islands have about 50  percent more oil than what Great Britain can extract from the  North Sea...    [Petrella] The two companies that have prospected for oil,  with the purpose of finding someone interested in buying their  study, might say that. No one has bought that study although  the British say a phantom Argentine enterprise did but I do not  know for sure.    Argentina does not want to hasten a debate that not only has  an ecological aspect but also a very important personal aspect.  Everyone knows that it takes a lot of people to exploit a single  oil well and this will definitely change the islanders way of  life which we consider sacred and something that must be  preserved. [passage omitted]    [Carvallo] It is quite surprising that Argentina, through  you, should say that it is not particularly interested in any  oil there might be on the islands...    [Petrella] I am not making an official statement. It is a  comment to a journalist who works for EL MERCURIO, from Chile, a  friendly country... I am telling a friend that Argentina could  not care less about the oil on the Malvinas because it has  plenty of its own and because the oil price is not going to  increase. When Russia floods the world with its oil, a very  strict cartel will have to be created to prevent prices from  dropping.    [Carvallo] Some believed oil could cause new tensions in the  South Atlantic.    [Petrella] Between 1971 and 1982 we gave oil to the islands.  Therefore, oil is not the problem, the problem has to do with  the jurisdictional and legal aspects of the UK's unilateral  exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas. This territory is  in dispute and we cannot remain indifferent to unilateral  actions. This is why we are seeking cooperation.    [Carvallo] To define sovereignty?    [Petrella] That is the question. We must generate a common  space. We have already made a clear proposal regarding the oil  to a high-ranking official. We proposed creating a joint  authority to assign exploitation areas according to a practical  criteria. All this must be done under the sovereignty  ""umbrella"" that was created to enable these moves without either  of the two parties acquiring better accumulated rights.    [Carvallo] In the meantime, Argentina is telling oil  companies that it will oppose oil exploitation without its  approval.    [Petrella] Of course. We have told them that any investment  will encounter legal problems..., but I cannot say what we are  going to do. We are warning the companies that this territory  is in dispute, when there are so many other places in the  world... We cannot or should not approve the exploration and  exploitation of resources in these areas until that dispute has  been settled or until the involved parties have agreed to  tolerate each other. [passage omitted]    [Carvallo] Islands Governor David Tatham said to me: Why so  much interest in a joint oil exploitation with Argentina when  there is also Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil. What would your  ministry say about this?    [Petrella] The dispute is with Argentina. Brazil, Chile, and  Uruguay, as well as the rest of the countries of the hemisphere,  have recognized our rights. The UK could, obviously, contact  whichever country it wished if a dispute, recognized by the  United Nations, did not exist.    [Carvallo] What do you expect from Chile then?    [Petrella] Solidarity. That contact with the islands be made  considering Argentine interests in any negotiation. That Chile  maintain the magnificent commitment undertaken by President  Patricio Aylwin to back our rights. We regard this as one of  Chile's greatest acts of friendship throughout our common  history.    One of the main objectives of President Menem's foreign  policy, implemented by Foreign Minister Di Tella, has been to  maintain the best and most cordial relationship with Chile. And  this not only because of cultural reasons but for economic and  strategic reasons.    [Carvallo] Chile, however, is in the uncomfortable position  that whatever it does may affect its optimum relationship with  the two countries in dispute.    [Petrella] Argentina's stance on the UK has been to say that  it must play a constructive role in the Southern Cone. In other  words, it can no longer speculate on differences between  Argentina and Chile, as in the past when some were more obvious  than others, because there was usually mutual distrust. This  must no longer exist. Argentine-Chilean integration must  progress.    This is why any British Government gesture that may affect  the Argentine-Chilean relationship is considered discouraging in  Argentina. We have told the British this many times and we are  certain we have the support of the Chilean Government.    [Carvallo] What has Great Britain done lately regarding  Chile  that may discourage Argentina?    [Petrella] There were three episodes. One was the British  Government invitation to Chilean legislators to visit the  Malvinas. This, in itself is not especially sensitive but the  second episode -- proposing that they set up a Chilean consulate  on the islands -- is. That would really be complicated. The  third -- the donation of an aircraft -- is obviously a symbol of  the conflict. Since Argentina overcame the conflict, it caused  no more problems but many believe the British should have known  the effect this could have caused. Anyway, the  Argentine-Chilean friendship is very strong now. [passage  omitted]    [Carvallo] Argentina and Chile also have their own  territorial conflicts. What outcome due you expect from the  controversy over Laguna del Desierto?    [Petrella] We hope our representatives will be able to  convince the arbitrators of our rights. I believe, with all due  respect for Chile and the arbitrators, that our attorneys have  good grounds and are eloquent enough to explain them.    [Carvallo] Chile has grounds, probably even better ones.  Therefore, how sure can Chileans be that Argentina will not  declare any ruling on Laguna del Desierto not in its favor null?    [Petrella] Today's Argentina is not the Argentina of the  past. Nor is the current relationship between Chile and  Argentina the same as in the past. I think this answers your  question.     "

Their vision of an EU of 'variable geometry' would be centred on only five of the original founding members - France and Germany, as well as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. However, the reformers say their plan does not imply abandoning hopes that Great Britain will assume its role 'in the heart of Europe', as Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said in Bonn three years ago. Rather, they hope that by forcing the pace of European integration, Britain will in turn be forced to 'clarify its relationship' with the rest of the EU. The five-nation future core would be expected to co-ordinate ever more closely not only on monetary policy, in keeping with the plans for economic and monetary union, but also on fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The future structure of an expanding EU, to include not only the Scandinavian countries, but also the emerging democracies of central Europe, was spelt out yesterday by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats, and the second most powerful man in Germany's ruling party after Chancellor Helmut Kohl. For the first time, they have openly stated their view that Italy can no longer qualify to be a member of the inner core if the EU inevitably moves to multiple speeds, or variable geometry. The expressions mean that different groups of the member states will co-ordinate their policies in different ways, depending on the subject concerned: some will opt for monetary union, others for a common foreign and security policy, and yet a third combination for a common social policy, for example. 'For the formation of European policy this is a period of many crises but also of many chances,' Mr Schauble said. 'Variable geometry . . . gives us better chances to complete this process, given the different, sometimes competing views. We must accept that not every member can accept every step at the same time.' Along with the CDU's sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU), Mr Schauble presented a comprehensive five-point programme for the next phase of radical reform of the EU, intended to reconcile the conflicting demands of ever closer integration with continuing enlargement towards eastern Europe. This includes the overhaul of all the main EU institutions, granting still more democratic control to the European parliament, while limiting the authority of the Council of Ministers, in which the governments of the member states are represented. Apart from the reinforcement of the 'hard core', it also involves ever closer co-ordination between France and Germany, 'raising the quality of relations to a new level'. 'Germany and France form the core of the hard core,' the document, called Reflections on European Policy, says. 'Their special relationship faces a stiff test because it too is beginning to show signs of differentiation of interests and perceptions, which might cause them to drift apart.' It suggests that the two must overcome their differences of opinion on 'fundamental issues of economic policy', including industrial policy and competition, as well as, by implication, trade protectionism. There must also be a debate on the long-term objectives of the common agricultural policy, and on basic features of the future financial system. The other key points in the plan are the reinforcement of the EU's common foreign and security policy, and its enlargement to the east. On foreign and security policy, it stresses the priority needs for a common policy on stabilising central and eastern Europe, development of relations with Russia, and a common policy towards the Mediterranean region, including north Africa. It also singles out development of 'a strategic partnership' with Turkey.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

The current assessment for UK membership is Pounds 10.6m a year, which will be reduced to Pounds 8m when the US rejoins. Modest as this is for what we get back (employment, sales of equipment, benefits of scientific research, etc), it has, since 1964, come out of our overseas aid budget, which Baroness Chalker is naturally reluctant to cut. But Unesco is not primarily an aid agency; its field of activity encompasses science, education, environment, culture and communications. If the office of public service and science and the education, environment and national heritage departments were to share the load with the Overseas Development Administration, each would be required to pay only Pounds 2.13m a year and would be getting an excellent bargain. And Britain would once again be in a position to influence international policy on matters of great concern.

The British Government has agreed to the  establishment of networks to guide the terroristic operations of  the Monafeqin [hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq  Organization, MKO] on its soil. While revealing this, a source  in the British House of Commons stressed that London has issued  a permit for the Monafeqin to direct their terroristic  operations from British soil after Paris had refused their  request. Thus, Britain has been transformed into a base for the  Monafeqin terrorists, who will henceforth receive their orders  directly from London and will embark on crimes and killings.  [passage omitted]    The oppressed Kurds of Iraq have not forgotten that at the  height of their struggle against the Baghdad regime, the  Monafeqin terrorists entered the fray suddenly on the side of  the ""executioner of Baghdad"" and began massacring and torturing  the revolutionaries. However, the Monafeqin did not reap any  benefits from all this mercenary service and crime on behalf of  Saddam. They incurred the ire of the Kurdish combatants and a  short while later the Monafeqin's installations were the targets  of the fury and vengeance of the combatant Kurds and their stay  in Iraq was terminated.    Now that these Monafeqin have entered into London's service  and have committed themselves to the British Intelligence  organization, there is a strong likelihood that they will become  the targets of the hatred and anger of the IRA and the IRA's  revenge squads will be the nemesis of the remnant elements of  the Monafeqin.    It is interesting to note that the mischief-mongering  British  seem helpless before the Irish combatants and will try to use  the mercenary Monafeqin as their sandbags in their efforts to  crush the IRA. If all the lackey Monafeqin are killed in the  process, the mischief-mongering British will have lost nothing.  [passage omitted]    Britain should seriously reply to these questions: Is it  prepared to accept the consequences of this ill-fated investment  in the Monafeqin? Does it realize the consequences of such a  foolish policy and does it take direct responsibility for its  latest decisions? There is a strong possibility that the  explosion on Sa'di Avenue in Tehran recently, which resulted in  human and material losses, was actually directed by Britain.    It is not yet clear how London will face the unpleasant  consequences of its decisions and whether it comprehends what  the reaction to this unwise step will be. It is difficult to  predict what the reaction of the families of those martyred by  the crimes of the Monafeqin will be when they hear of this.    It is essential for the Islamic Republic of Iran to stress  the seriousness of the matter to London; and before London's  malice provokes a severe and irrevocable reaction, Iran should  ask the trouble-making British to rectify their deliberate  mistakes and apologize to the Iranian nation. Otherwise Britain  will have to take responsibility for its indiscreet decisions.     "

Standing on the steps above the terrace of Seabourne Villa, a large colonial house built in 1905, Mr Hugh Davies, the UK's representative to the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which deals with the details of Hong Kong's 1997 transfer to China, proclaimed that 'excellent progress' had been made on the first day of the three-day meeting. Mr Davies said a top bilateral group would meet on Friday to discuss financing Hong Kong's HKDollars 159bn (Pounds 13.5bn) airport project. Government officials later said China's previous concerns about financing the airport and its connecting railway, including the issues of land sales and debt, appeared to have been met. Short of fresh demands, officials could think of no reason why the financial plan could not be agreed on Friday. Over the past few months China has signalled a desire to repair relations with Britain and get back to work on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty. But in terms of what Britain and China need to do by 1997 the airport is like the visible part of an iceberg - largely hidden from public view is a vast amount of work which remains to be done. Awaiting the attention of the JLG is, among other things, the regularisation of Hong Kong's law, sorting out the colony's air services agreements, the extension of the colony's container port, and determining what sort of travel documents Hong Kong citizens will use after 1997. At Seabourne Villa, Mr Davies and Mr Guo Fengmin, his Chinese counterpart both acknowledged the tightness of the timetable ahead. Mr Guo noted at yesterday's photocall: 'There are only three years until 1997 and there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss if a smooth transition is to be guaranteed.' The need for a 'smooth transition' may well be the motive propelling China toward agreement. But some Hong Kong government officials will only believe Beijing has had a change of heart when they see concrete evidence of it. The Chinese walked away from a deal on military land and are busily trying to extract further concessions from the UK. At Friday's meeting of the Airport Committee, Beijing may decide on one further turn of the screw to see if more can be extracted from a colonial government keen to show the world that its relations with China are returning to normal.

0,FT934-2667 ,"FT934-2667 _AN-DLMDEABJFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Drugs RD is at risk, says Pfizer      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   The UK is becoming increas-ingly unattractive to drugs groups, according to the largest foreign-based employer of pharmaceuticals scientists in Britain. Pfizer, the US drugs group, says the collapse of the science base, increasing government interference in National Health Service drugs spending and growing violence from animal rights activists are undermining Britain as a base for pharmaceuticals companies. Dr Peter Ringrose, senior vice-president of medicine RD at Pfizer Europe, warned that the UK's pre-eminence in medicines research was under threat. He said: 'Six of the world's top 20 selling drugs were discovered in the UK. Britain has the highest per capita number of Nobel prizes of any country in the world. But there are now rising concerns about the UK as a site for pharmaceuticals research in the future.' Pfizer's RD centre at Sandwich, Kent, employs 1,250 research staff and is the largest investment by a US drugs group anywhere in the world. The facilities, which have received Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) of investment over the past five years, have doubled in size since 1987. But Dr Ringrose said such investment could be threatened by government controls on prices and demand for drugs. These included a 2.5 per cent price cut last month and the introduction earlier this year of lists of products that NHS doctors could no longer prescribe. In effect the NHS would only allow doctors to prescribe new products whose prices had been cut to the same level as older products. He said: 'When the price of a new product is determined by a basket of old generic products, what is the point of developing the new drug?' Dr Ringrose said the attractiveness of the UK for drugs research was also being undermined by the dire state of the academic infrastructure. The government's white paper on science, engineering and technology was encouraging, 'but so much damage was done to British universities during the 1980s that what is required is more than platitudinous comments from ministers'. However, Dr Ringrose said that animal rights violence was becoming the UK drugs industry's biggest concern. 'If you stop the use of animals you can shut down most of UK pharmaceuticals research. Ironically, Britain has among the tightest regulations on the use of animals.' Mr Hugh O'Connor, chairman and managing director of Pfizer UK, said: 'Throughout Europe there will have to be rationalisation. What does not make sense is to manufacture on eight sites.' The company now manufactures in the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy. It recently sold its Greek manufacturing operations. The increasingly difficult environment for drugs groups could encourage them to cut manufacturing, endangering the UK's Pounds 1.3bn trade surplus in pharmaceuticals last year.

0,FT932-5882 ,"FT932-5882 _AN-DFBBWAAAFT 930602   FT  02 JUN 93 / UK to challenge EC's 48-hour working week      By DAVID GARDNER and ROBERT TAYLOR      LUXEMBOURG, LONDON   THE UK for the first time faces having to legislate to guarantee British workers mandatory time off, after its 11 EC partners yesterday voted through the Community's working time directive, the so-called 48-hour-week law. But Britain said it would challenge the directive at the European Court of Justice and would not start putting it on the UK statute book until that ruling came through. After blocking the measure for nearly three years, Britain abstained yesterday, in the face of its partners' determination to force through what they regard as a much-needed gesture towards reinforcing workers' rights. The UK is challenging the legal basis of the directive, proposed by the European Commission as a health and safety measure and thus requiring a majority vote rather than unanimity. This deprived the UK of its national veto. But over the past 15 months, Britain has negotiated assiduously to dilute the impact of the measure, while making light of its possible impact, which would be mostly in the UK. Both British and Brussels officials privately concur that the UK's legal challenge is unlikely to succeed. Mr David Hunt, the UK's new employment secretary, claimed the Commission had abused its treaty powers and said: 'I am confident we will win' in the court. But in the same breath he was keen to emphasise that 'we have drawn most of the teeth from this directive,' which in its original form would have been 'inflexible, extremely damaging, and placed enormous burdens on British industry.' The UK secured a 10-year grace period before it might have to introduce the 48-hour week, which its partners must implement within three years. After the additional seven years, there will be a 'review' of the derogation, leaving open the possibility that it may be extended. British workers who want to work more than 48 hours a week will be able to do so; those who do not will have the protection of the law. Employers will have to keep records of both categories, for inspection by national health and safety authorities whose job it will be to ensure no discrimination. But workers in the UK will for the first time have the legal right to: A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours. Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours. At least one day a week off. No more than eight hours a shift on average for night work. Four weeks' annual paid holiday, although the UK would have to guarantee only three weeks for the six years after the directive is formally adopted, probably in seven months' time. There are exemptions on the working week rules for transport, agriculture, fisheries, all work at sea such as the offshore oil industry, and - at UK insistence - for doctors in training. Ireland and Denmark are the only other countries affected by the 48-hour week limit. Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal will have to extend guaranteed paid leave; and all these countries, along with Greece and the Netherlands, will have to modify other laws on time off. The Confederation of British Industry said it welcomed the government's undertaking not to implement the directive in the UK until its legality was determined by the European Court. Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'To introduce directives on working hours under the guise of health and safety regulations is unprincipled and reflects poorly on the integrity of the European Commission'. The government's stance was attacked, however, by Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of Britain's Trades Union Congress and president of the European Trade Union Confederation. 'The government would be foolish in the extreme to pursue this cause', he said. 'Once again Britain is the odd one out in Europe. It will send the signal to potential investors that it is less committed to Europe than our competitors'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Some of the animals, from Poland, were declared unfit for  human consumption after they were killed at an abattoir in  Birmingham. They had all been allowed through German border  checks.    Ministers, MPs, vets and animal welfare groups are angry  about the shipments at a time when the German Health Ministry  wants the EC to impose fresh curbs on British beef due to fears  over mad cow disease. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for  Birmingham, Erdington, will table questions about the diseased  sheep in the Commons tomorrow.    The EC council of health ministers will meet in Brussels on  March 30 to consider German demands for new EC restrictions on  British beef despite scientific opinion that it is safe to eat.    Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Minister of Agriculture, has told  Mr Rene Steichen, the EC Farm Commissioner, that the German move  could cause enormous harm to all beef producers in the EC if it  destroyed consumers' confidence in beef. She has already  indicated that Britain may claim compensation from Germany if it  imposes a unilateral ban on British beef.    Mr Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer,  said yesterday: ""I don't want to get into a tit-for-tat row. But  some of the imported sheep were in such a poor way when they  arrived at Dover that they should not have been allowed to start  the journey from Poland.    ""Obviously we will be urging Germany and other EC countries  to look again at their checking procedures to prevent further  incidents of this kind."" Mr Meldrum said that in one case a ewe  gave birth when it arrived at the abattoir. But both it and the  lamb were in such poor condition that they were slaughtered  anyway.    It is an offence under EC and British law to transport  pregnant ewes for slaughter for food.    British anger centers on four lorryloads, each of about 300  sheep, sent to Birmingham between Feb 17 and last week. Three  came from Poland and one from Spain.    Sheep in both the Polish and Spanish consignments were found  to be diseased. Some of the Polish sheep, ageing ewes of between  four and five years old, were found to be suffering from Caseous  Lymphadenitis.    This highly unpleasant disease results in internal  abscesses,  which could cause heavy losses among British flocks. The meat  from these animals was condemned.    The sheep were part of a growing trade in old ewes, shipped  to Britain to provide cut price mutton for ethnic minorities. It  sells for about a quarter of the price of meat from British  sheep.    The sheep are killed with a knife without pre-stunning under  an exemption enjoyed by Muslims and Jews.     "

The Hong Kong government is asking the finance committee of LegCo to approve an extra HKDollars 1.7bn of government spending on the airport. Of this, HKDollars 377m is for the running costs of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) until March 1995; HKDollars 1.3bn is for design work and construction of foundations for the airport terminal. If LegCo approves this finance, and it seems it will, the Hong Kong government will have until the summer to agree with China the overall financing for the project, an agreement which would keep alive the hope of finishing the project before the end of British rule in mid-1997. The balance of risk remains on the side of no agreement and that the government will have to admit publicly what most businessmen and government officials are saying in private: that the airport will not become fully operational much before 2000. Companies planning to tender for vital airport services, such as baggage and cargo handling, believe the new airport at Chek Lap Kok will not be fully operational until mid-1998. This prediction assumes the PAA is able to award the franchises for the various services by July this year, and importantly, that China gives its blessing to the franchisees. Potential holders of a franchise are in little doubt as to the importance of China's approval. One senior businessman whose company will be tendering from a franchise said: 'If the PAA awards the franchises without Beijing's approval, all China has to do is say they do not think it a good idea, and the banks will not lend the money. China calls all the shots.' Many in Hong Kong believe the political row between China and Britain over democracy in Hong Kong has made it virtually impossible for China to agree to the Hong Kong government's suggestions on how to finance the project. Some believe China has decided it does not want the British to 'complete' the airport and would rather it be finished a year or so into Chinese sovereignty. Mr Victor Sit, a university professor and adviser to Beijing on the airport, believes officials in China run a personal political risk if they accede to the Hong Kong government's suggestions for financing the airport at this time, when relations are so fraught. 'There is a very serious problem of mistrust, so if they (Beijing officials) let go of the airport issue, there would be more political troubles ..for themselves,' he said recently. British officials hope Mr Sit is wrong. They speculate that between now and when Governor Chris Patten introduces his second political reform bill (probably in early March) there exists a chance for a deal. To test this, Britain requested a meeting of the Anglo-Chinese 'airport committee' earlier this week and indicated it was prepared to make yet another offer on the financing of the airport. Since March 1992, it has made three separate proposals. But the fourth and latest offer may meet China's stated concerns about the level of debt the airport and railway will carry, come July 1997, when responsibility for Hong Kong passes from Britain to China. The Hong Kong government sought to meet Beijing's complaint about debt in its second financial proposal, made public in September 1992. Debt financing for the airport was cut to Dollars HK5.9bn from HKDollars 37bn, while the debt needed to be raised to build the airport railway was cut to HKDollars 17bn from HKDollars 36bn. The 'problem' with this proposal was that about half the Dollars HK50bn increase in equity it envisaged would come from a land fund established for the use of the post-colonial government. China, which wanted more equity, was not prepared to spend its 'own' money to see that end achieved. Beijing, on safer ground, also pointed out that the British had agreed in 1991 that total government debt outstanding at June 1997 should not exceed HKDollars 5bn. The Hong Kong government was still in breach of that agreement as the project's total debt was HKDollars 23bn. Details of the latest financial proposal are not public but it is understood the government is prepared to throw yet more equity at the airport and its connecting railway, meaning a commensurately lower level of debt. There is much resistance within the government to putting more money into the airport, but Hong Kong can afford it. Its coffers are brimming with cash, mainly due to receipts from stamp duty on stock market transactions; a projected deficit of HKDollars 3.5bn in 1993-94 is now expected to be a large surplus. China has yet to respond to the request for another meeting of the airport committee or to the latest financial proposal. Mr Zhang Junsheng, a Chinese official in Hong Kong, lowered official hopes of a positive response when he indicated a meeting of the committee was not in the offing.

Mr Kohl, who has strong domestic reasons for proceeding cautiously towards European economic and monetary union, said the Community should stick to the timetable of a single currency by 1999. A two-speed move would mean a small number of Community countries would achieve monetary union in a much shorter timescale. He insisted that renegotiating Maastricht was out of the question, in spite of opposition to it in Denmark and Britain. Public opinion in both Germany and France was also likely to be strongly sceptical about a two-speed move to European union, which would leave out key nations that both countries regard as economic and political allies. 'We want Britain to be with us, we want a Europe of 12, we don't want a two-speed Europe,' Mr Kohl told a press conference in Luxembourg. His message to Britain is likely to be reinforced by the French government when Mr John Major, the prime minister, visits Paris today. In spite of the growing split in the Conservative party over Britain's European policies, President Francois Mitterrand is expected to counsel Mr Major against anti-German rhetoric. Mr Mitterrand will try to persuade Mr Major to put aside the quarrelling with Germany sparked by this month's currency turbulence. He will urge Mr Major to adhere to the plan to ratify the EC treaty this year, French officials say. The attempt to persuade Britain to stick to the Maastricht process comes amid speculation that opposition to the treaty could prompt France and Germany to forge Emu with a small 'core' of other states. Neither Paris nor Bonn, however, appears ready to press ahead with such a move. Mr Kohl, who is under pressure from domestic critics who say the intended new European currency might be less stable than the D-Mark, denied that his government wanted a slimmer Emu. 'There are many rumours,' he said. 'It's like the Loch Ness monster, it keeps reappearing.' The chancellor's sentiments were backed up in London by Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German association of chambers of commerce and industry. He suggested that a delay in the Maastricht timetable was more likely than an overt move to a two-speed Europe. Mr Kohl said there was no reason to delay the start of negotiations with other European nations such as Austria and Sweden which have applied to join the Community. He added that it was wrong for people to fear the emergence of a European superstate or for them to blame the European Commission bureaucracy in Brussels for the problems of the EC.

The authority's forecast for this year, contained in its annual report, is based on figures for the January-to-June period when there were 8.5m visitors, up 10 per cent on the same period last year. Launching the report, Ms Adele Biss, who chairs the authority, said: 'We are forecasting an even stronger year to come as we reap the benefits of devaluation and the move away from simple sun-bathing to the more fulfilling holidays that Britain offers.' Spending by tourists in the year to the end of March grew less dramatically, increasing by only 7 per cent to Pounds 7.9bn. Tourists have bought cheaper holidays, cut short their length of stay and taken advantage of heavy discounting by the tourist industry. Travel from North America was up 18 per cent last year on 1991 - but tourism from the US that year was hit badly by the Gulf war. The number of Americans has still not recovered to 1990 levels.

He was speaking as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  began a two-day visit to central Bosnia, as part of  consultations on whether British troops should continue to serve  with UN forces there.    He stressed there was no question of Britain pulling out  unilaterally or withdrawing during ""these winter months"". His  comments came as protracted talks to try to end the fighting  remained deadlocked.    Mr Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is no  question of us pulling out during these winter months. There is  a job to be done ... and that is going to take a little bit  longer at the very least.    ""Secondly, I don't think there is any likelihood of Britain  pulling out unilaterally.    ""What we are talking about is whether the United Nations as  a  whole should continue to be in Bosnia, whether the time might  come at some stage when it no longer can carry out its mandate.    ""That's not just a matter for the United Kingdom. France,  Spain, Canada and a number of other countries are all having  exactly this debate at the present time.""    Britain and France currently provide the thrust of the UN  military operation which protects aid convoys to treacherous  parts of Bosnia.    Mr Hurd, following the main supply route running through the  British bases at Tomislavgrad, Gornji Vakuf and finally Vitez,  the location of the First Battalion Coldstream Guards, will  speak to officers from the battalion group before moving on to  the UN headquarters for Bosnia in Kiseljak tomorrow.    Mr Rifkind, pressed whether it was unlikely that British  troops would still be serving in Bosnia in the spring, indicated  that this was too early a time for withdrawal.    ""`Come the spring' I think is fairly early, we are not far  from the spring.    ""I think the important point first of all is to see this  winter through.""    But if by the spring or early summer there was no prospect  of  a peace settlement ""then it does have to be addressed as to  whether the UN presence is making a material contribution to  ending this ghastly war.""    Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said a  unilateral British withdrawal would be ""wholly unreasonable"".    But Tory MP Peter Viggers said the humanitarian mission was  grinding to a halt and it was time to pull out the troops.    The Gosport MP and Commons Defence Select Committee member  told the Today programme: ""We are coming to a time of decision.  I fear that decision must be to withdraw the troops.""    Meanwhile, peace mediator Lord Owen was struggling to retain  credibility after an embarrassing vote of no confidence from  disgruntled Euro MPs in Strasbourg.    The 106-95 vote showed their determination to express  dissatisfaction at Lord Owen's failure to find a breakthrough  after almost two years of bloody conflict.     "

It had a wonderful time. Europe isn't working, the young employment secretary declared. No, he wasn't just referring to the dole queues. Stop the rot from Brussels, he shouted, as the hall achieved lift-off. Huge cheers. In that strange European world, he warned the excited representatives, people thought carrots were fruit and bananas should be straight. Britain would have no part of it. Ecstatic ovation. It was a skilful performance. Mr Portillo has long been judged by the Tory right at Westminster as the natural heir to Lady Thatcher. Now he is beginning to build the constituency he needs among the party activists. Waving the Union flag among the retired colonels and the young militants who have come to dominate these annual gatherings is the surest way to win their hearts. They crave certainty. Mr Portillo gave them it. He was rewarded with an ovation lasting four minutes. Mr Michael Heseltine, for a generation the unchallenged master of conference showmanship, managed only two. Mr Portillo was careful not to overstep the bounds of collective cabinet responsibility. In his tirade against the social chapter he evoked Mr John Major's 'act of statesmanship' in negotiating Britain's opt-out. He disassociated himself from Mr Norman Lamont's apocalyptic warning that Britain may be forced to withdraw from Europe to preserve its nationhood. To have done otherwise would have invited dismissal from the cabinet. But Mr Portillo's tone was enough to stake out his ground. He does not favour withdrawal now from the European Union. But he thinks the government should not go an inch further along the path of integration - whatever the consequences. He would probably agree with the colleague who described Mr Lamont's intervention as follows: right message, wrong messenger, wrong time. It seems scarcely credible that it was only four years ago - in this same conference hall - that Mr Heseltine prepared for the challenge that would destroy Lady Thatcher; or that his most potent weapon then was her anti-Europeanism. Yesterday Mr Heseltine stuck to his principles and warned that disengagement from Europe would be an abject surrender of Britain's national interest. The representatives did not enjoy the return to the earth. They sat on their hands. Mr Major must have looked on in despair. The minefield of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of European integration lies between his government and the general election due by 1997. Alongside Mr Portillo stand Mr Peter Lilley, Mr John Redwood, Mr Michael Howard and perhaps a dozen junior ministers. Behind Mr Portillo stand up to 100 Tory MPs. The pro-European wing is stronger. Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Douglas Hurd do not share Mr Heseltine's instinctive view that Britain should participate in all projects European. But they and the majority around the cabinet table are equally clear that there is no future in opting out. Mr Hurd - busy crafting a British agenda for 1996 which has a chance of holding the Tories together without being laughed at in Paris and Bonn - is reviewing his original intention to quit the Foreign Office next year. He has just turned down the post of Nato secretary-general in spite of pressure from the Alliance's four biggest members. He has not discussed his future with the prime minister since then. But friends have the impression that if Mr Major asked him to stay, then Mr Hurd might well agree. Like most others in the cabinet, Mr Hurd sees no possibility in the short-term of Britain joining a single currency. It would break the party. The electorate would not have it. But the foreign secretary is certain that Britain must be in the vanguard of efforts to build a common European security policy. Once an admirer of Mr Portillo's sharp intellect, Mr Hurd is now dismissive of the notion that it would be possible now to abandon the political dimension of Europe. In his mind the 'variable geometry' approach to the next stage of European integration would allow Britain to opt out, if necessary, from Emu while remaining on the inside track on defence and foreign policy. Mr Major's position is more complicated. In spite of the sceptical edge to his recent pronouncements on the future of Europe he has not joined the ranks of the antis. He is irritated by the grand strategies of Mr Jacques Delors and other European visionaries. He finds them patronising. But he regards Mr Portillo's view of the world as self-serving and lacking an understanding of history. He is searching for a formula which will allow him to take the bulk of the Tory party - and of the much wider electorate - with him. If he succeeds he will be assured a place in history as the prime minister who saved the Conservative party. It is far from certain he will succeed. Beyond the German elections this weekend and the French presidential race next summer it is easy to see another Franco-German drive towards European unity. The Conservative party is being held together only by the fact that it wants to remain in government. But seen from Planet Portillo, any further transfer of sovereignty to Brussels would be too high a price for victory at the general election.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

How could a country which once astonished the world with its industrial achievements have sunk so low? Some blame the legacy of the industrial revolution and the failure to adapt to German and American competition in the late 19th century. Others put more weight on inter-war protection and cartelisation, or on misplaced priorities after 1945, when resources which should have been devoted to industrial modernisation were spent on the welfare state. That there should be competing explanations is not surprising; the past two centuries of British economic history contain plenty of unresolved controversies and puzzles. But even if complete agreement among historians is unlikely, it should be possible to remove at least some of the misconceptions which pervade so much of the debate about British economic decline. That is why the second edition of The Economic History of Britain since 1700, edited by Floud and McCloskey, deserves a much wider audience than the university students for whom it is primarily intended. Substantially revised from the 1981 version and with the addition of a third volume which extends the story to 1992, the book brings together in an accessible way the work of 39 scholars on a range of topics which includes population trends and living standards, the growth of cities and the economics of the Empire. The third volume is inevitably less authoritative than the first two, but the book as a whole provides a dispassionate review of the evidence and a welcome readiness to put British experience in an international context. The starting point is the period leading up to the industrial revolution when Britain, more than any other nation, provided the incentives and institutional support which were necessary for sustained technological innovation. As Joel Mokyr writes: 'Ancient prejudices, which regarded intellectual efforts devoted to production as something unfit for decent gentlemen, though not quite dead, no longer dominated British society. It was becoming socially acceptable to make money from industry, and therefore from innovation'. Britain's strength was not so much in basic inventions, a large number of which originated in France, as in incremental improvement based largely on mechanical intuition and dexterity. Whereas French science was theoretical and abstract, the British approach was empirical, experimental and pragmatic. Did the emphasis on inspired tinkering contain the seeds of subsequent failure in industries which called for formal scientific and technical education? This is part of the wider issue of Britain's alleged over-commitment to the products of the first industrial revolution - textiles, iron, coal - and its lag in the newer activities such as electrical engineering and chemicals which came to the fore towards the end of the 19th century. But, as Knick Harley explains, Britain had a comparative advantage in these older products until well into the 20th century and close trading links with countries, chiefly outside Europe and the US, which had the largest demand for them. With Germany and the US protecting the new industries by tariffs and government support, Britain's pattern of trade and industrial specialisation before 1914 was a rational response to market circumstances. One of the consequences may have been a neglect, relative to Germany and the US, of the investment in human capital which the new industries required. But this hardly justifies the view that between 1870 and 1914 there was an entrepreneurial and organisational failure from which the economy never recovered. As Sidney Pollard shows, there were successes and failures during this period, but no general industrial decline. 'The entrepreneurs who had got to the top in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain could hold their own with the very best abroad'. Even in education, Pollard argues, substantial progress was made, including the creation of civic universities in Leeds, Sheffield and other cities. Admiration for the formal, state-directed German system 'overlooked the merits of the British voluntary and demand-led education, with its largely practical emphasis'. A more serious legacy of the industrial revolution may have been the system of employment relations whereby, as William Lazonick puts it, employers delegated control of the manufacturing process to skilled craftsmen. 'The authority and responsibility to manage the shop floor organisation of work provided in turn a basis for key groups of workers to form powerful trade unions that, through collective bargaining over the conditions of work and pay, consolidated craft control'. Employers, in effect, gave up the right to manage. That Britain's labour relations arrangements became a competitive handicap in some industries is not in doubt; more questionable is Lazonick's assertion that the 'root cause' of the country's inferior performance was the unwillingness of entrepreneurs to invest in 'modern managerial structures that could plan and co-ordinate shop floor work'. The failure before 1914 to build US-style managerial hierarchies was not unique to Britain and not necessarily a long-term source of weakness. Was it, then, the inter-war period that put in place, as Barry Eichengreen suggests, 'the shackles that prevented the British economy from keeping pace with its European competitors'? The first world war violently disrupted the structure of world trade and finance on which Britain had depended; the retreat into protectionism forced exporters to rely more heavily on Empire markets. At the same time 'mergers, collusion, cartelisation and protection may have insulated British manufacturers from the chill winds of domestic and foreign competition'. Yet the habit of collusion was even more deeply entrenched in Germany. Moreover, entrepreneurial dynamism was far from lacking in inter-war Britain. The chemical and electrical industries recovered from their earlier lag; the growth of the motor industry was impressive; and there was a promising start in electronics. Despite structural problems in older sectors, especially textiles, Britain remained a powerful industrial nation. So why did Britain fall behind in the 1950s and 1960s? Charles Feinstein argues persuasively that rapid growth in Germany, France and Italy 'owed far more to their low starting point than to any special merits of their particular economic and social arrangements'. According to his backwardness-convergence hypothesis, overtaken countries eventually respond to their changed circumstances, as Britain did in the 1980s. 'Established attitudes and ossified institutions will finally be recognised as barriers to progress, and will gradually be forced to make way for new and more efficient arrangements'. No doubt there is still a residue from Britain's industrial past which has to be cleared away. But it is probably a mistake to conflate the post-1945 story - an initial lag followed by partial modernisation - with Britain's loss of industrial dominance in the 19th century. Both episodes need to be analysed, as they are in this book, realistically and without nostalgia; neither should be a cause of national lamentation.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT924-9115 ,"FT924-9115 _AN-CKHAHAAPFT 921107   FT  07 NOV 92 / Germany dismayed at Maastricht delay      By QUENTIN PEEL      BONN   THE British government decision to postpone final ratification of the Maastricht treaty was greeted in Germany yesterday with alarm and dismay. Senior officials fear that it will cast a new shadow over next week's planned summit between Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister - just when Anglo-German relations had started to revive in the wake of sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. 'If the British are making their decision dependent on the second Danish referendum, it is totally wrong,' one official said yesterday. 'To make the future of Great Britain dependent on some emotional Danish voters is silly and irresponsible.' German dismay is clear for three reasons. In the first place, the British decision will make it more difficult to insist that there shall be no renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty to meet Denmark's objections. Second, it will actually relieve the pressure on Denmark to vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty when it finally comes to a second referendum next year, because it will no longer be the last EC member left to ratify. Third, it may stoke popular doubts within Germany about the treaty, and strengthen demands to abandon the idea of a single European currency to replace the D-Mark, or to have a referendum. Mr Kohl is absolutely determined to resist both moves, but they are a severe embarrassment. The German government put out a careful statement yesterday, expressing its 'regret' at the British decision to postpone ratification, because it would mean that the treaty would not come into effect on January 1, 1993, as intended. At the same time, Germany politely but coolly welcomed the restated British determination to implement ratification of the treaty during 1993. For its own part, 'the federal government remains determined, like other member states, to finalise its ratification process - as foreseen - by the end of this year', according to Mr Norbert Schafer, the deputy government spokesman. The first suggestion of doubt about that aim was voiced by Mr Gunter Verheugen, the Social Democrat chairman of the joint parliamentary committee set up to ratify the treaty. He said the British decision should start a full debate on whether the aim of European union remained realistic. 'We cannot simply carry on regardless,' he said yesterday. 'At least we should have some clarity over whether European union is still realistic. The British decision means that Britain is dependent on finding a solution for Denmark, and there is no solution in sight.' The delay should be used to canvass for wider popular support for the treaty, he said, bearing in mind German opinion polls showing a growing minority casting doubt on the ambition of European union. Nevertheless, Mr Verheugen said he expected the German Bundestag to stick by its ratification timetable, and complete the process before the Edinburgh summit in December. Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman for Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was adamant that there must be no wavering on the part of Germany. 'If we start to show uncertainty, it would be a catastrophe,' he said. 'As for Britain hiding behind Denmark, it is simply not right. It is not worthy of your country. Britain should be giving Denmark the lead, not the other way round.'  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

British chambers have only one fifteenth of the resources of German chambers on average, while staff numbers are just one sixth of German levels. This means UK chambers often offer a far narrower range of services. In spite of their limited resources the British chambers are active in helping their members develop business in continental Europe, their unit costs are lower and they are more commercial in their approach to the needs of business, the study says. Official backing for the German chambers and the requirement for businesses to register with their local chamber make for a much larger organisation. The German chambers have 3.2m members employing 25m people. The UK chambers of commerce and chambers of trade, with voluntary membership, have just 210,000 members with 4m employees.

According to the FCIS, the spy kept the British services  informed on the latest Russian weapons, financing of defense  research and development and Russia's defense technology  cooperation with other countries.    The source said that the report, made public on March 1,  about the arrest of a Russian citizen who spied for Britain had  nothing to do with the Ames case in the U.S. he added that  unlike the Ameses whose cooperation with Russian special  services had yet to be proven, the Russian citizen had been  caught in the act (he carried spying equipment and manuals on  using caches -- IF) and admitted his guilt.    The source said that the Western spying services had stepped  up their activities in Russia. In 1993 alone 20 people were  convicted for spying. Colonel Baranov of the Intelligence Main  Office of the General Staff was convicted on February 19.

Although a joint official statement maintained that talks held in Buenos Aires had been 'cordial', the two sides remain far apart. Argentina, which still claims sovereignty over the South Atlantic islands despite its defeat by Britain in the 1982 Falklands conflict, has previously co-operated over the setting of fishing limits. Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentina's deputy foreign minister, yesterday denied reports that Buenos Aires had unilaterally declared a quota of 220,000 tonnes, but confirmed it 'believes there is no problem aiming for the maximum catch possible'. He said scientific reports indicated that levels of fish around the islands were such that there was no need to repeat last year's bilateral agreement, in which the Argentines and Falkland islanders agreed to limit their catch as 'the resource was becoming scanty'. The British government is likely to consider provocative a statement by Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, late on Wednesday night. He said: 'Last year we did not catch (our full quota of) 220,000 tonnes, but this year we will do so because our scientific information indicates that this will not affect the biomass.'

The Falklands may have become a peripheral issue in Britain, but Argentina remains obsessed with the islands and clearly hopes that Mr Hurd's five-day visit will signify another step on the tortuous road to 'recovering' the islands, this time through diplomatic means. The British have publicly disabused their hosts of any belief that the Falklands is up for negotiation. Mr Hurd told Argentina's La Nacion newspaper at the weekend: 'I do not expect, and neither should you, that my visit will set in motion any great advances.' Instead, he said, his visit would be devoted to further consolidating Britain's improving links with Argentina. Britain and Argentina re-established diplomatic relations in 1990, a year after President Carlos Menem took office. Since then relations have improved steadily to the point where they co-operated militarily during the 1991 Gulf war. Britain is assigning greater importance to its relations with Latin America, and Mr Menem's free market and pro-western policies have made Argentina an increasingly visible reference point in the region. The economy has settled down to rapid growth and its privatisation policies have involved British banks, consultancy firms and industrial companies, the most notable being British Gas's leading position in the consortium which took control of the Buenos Aires gas distribution company last month. Argentina has also opened up its secretive atomic establishment and scrapped its Condor II missile project. Britain and the US viewed both projects with great suspicion as a source of proliferation. At the same time Argentina has sent troops as UN peacekeepers to the Gulf and Yugoslavia, for reasons of prestige and to keep its habitually restive troops busy. That still leaves the awkward question of the Falklands. Buenos Aires continues to press a claim to the islands, despite the humiliating defeat of 1982. Equally, Britain refuses to discuss sovereignty formulas. Both have agreed to disagree over sovereignty, but cannot agree on how to manage shared resources, especially oil and fisheries. There have been some advances. Seismic tests for oil will be carried out in Falklands waters this year by two companies. The two sides have also worked out a fisheries conservation agreement for 1993, and are now working on a more permanent arrangement. UK and Argentine scientists have started joint research on fish conservation. Curiously, the illex squid, prized by gourmets in the Far East, is the centre of a dispute which islanders see as a continuation of the 1982 conflict by other means. The islands have become one of the richest spots on earth by selling licences to Far Eastern squid-fishing fleets. But in December, Argentina announced it would start issuing cut-price licences of its own, breaking the Falklands' monopoly. The move is expected in Port Stanley to deprive the islands of half or more of the Pounds 30m a year in revenues from licence sales. Some two-third of the islands' revenues come from licensing. Provided the Argentine decision has a commercial, rather than predatory, motivation, the British government is virtually powerless to influence the move. However, Mr Hurd has warned that attempts to use squid licences as 'political toys' could threaten wider bilateral relations. Mr Hurd, who travels on to Chile, will be pressed to invite Mr Menem on an official visit to London. Mr Menem himself first asked to be invited to the UK over a year ago.

'It will send a message around the world - to our allies and to Iran,' he told a London press conference. 'It is very important that the British government is now leading from the front.' Mr Major's first meeting with Mr Rushdie, indicating a further hardening of Britain's line, is likely to incense Tehran, which claims Mr Rushdie's book is blasphemous. Downing Street said yesterday Britain had great respect for Islam, but added that the fatwa did no service to its religion. Mr Rushdie gave no details or proposals discussed with Mr Major, saying he had undertaken not to reveal concrete plans. Relations between Iran and Britain were 'frosty and might get frostier any second,' he said. Downing Street said no specific action had been decided yesterday. The prime minister had underlined his full support for Mr Rushdie's rights as a British citizen and expressed concern that Iran had not repudiated the fatwa.

0,FT942-9672 ,"FT942-9672 _AN-EEPB4AB5FT 940514   FT  14 MAY 94 / Not a single safe Tory seat, warn the Euro-election polls: The rocky road to Strasbourg is compounded by poor voter turnout and first-past-the-post anomalies      By DAVID BUTLER   John Smith's death has thrown into turmoil all the parties' plans for the first week of the European election campaign. But the battle will still turn more on John Major's leadership than on any European issue. Between Thursday June 9 and Sunday June 12 voters in the 12 countries of the European Union will choose 567 MEPs to go to Strasbourg. Britain will have 87 MEPs. The political composition of the European parliament depends to a remarkable extent on British voters. Great Britain (though not Northern Ireland) alone votes first-past-the-post instead of proportionally; the winner in votes gets a disproportionate majority in seats. In 1979 the Conservatives secured 62 seats to Labour's 17. In 1989 Labour won 45 seats to the Tories' 32. If there had been proportional representation the Conservatives' lead in 1979 would have been 22, not 45. In 1989 the Labour lead would have been four not 13. If, as some suggest, the Conservatives suffer a Canadian-style wipe-out next month, the effect could give the left a net majority at Strasbourg 60 or 70 greater than it would have been if Britain had adopted proportional representation. If the Tories are embarrassed by the outcome they will be able to use as an excuse low participation. Britain has been consistently bottom of the turnout league. On average 33 per cent have voted, less that half the level for Westminster and well below the norm in local council elections. Voters can behave unexpectedly. In 1989 the Greens jumped from an opinion-poll level of 3 per cent three months earlier to 15 per cent in the ballot box, pushing the Liberal Democrats into fourth place in every constituency except Cornwall. Six months later, their support had evaporated. This year the Liberal Democrats seem set to mop up much of the protest vote  -and there is plenty of protest vote about. The local election figures and the opinion polls suggest that there is not a single seat that is safe for the Conservatives. In a three-cornered race, 34 per cent of the vote is needed to win, even if the other two contestants are evenly divided (which is most unlikely). North Yorkshire seems to be the only seat north of Birmingham where there is a serious chance of a Conservative victory, but even in the south there is no safe seat. There are only three constituencies where a swing at the level of the local elections last week would leave the Conservatives with 40 per cent of the vote, and in each of these the Liberal Democrats are the stronger challenger. On the basis of local election results last week it was calculated that Labour would get 56 seats, the Liberal Democrats 14 and the Conservatives 12. The ICM poll in The Guardian earlier this week suggested that the Conservatives would get only 27 per cent of the vote in the European election. Its findings could be projected to 57 seats for Labour, 15 for the Conservatives and nine for the Liberal Democrats. Some would say that both projections are too optimistic for the Conservatives. With no council tax at stake their erstwhile supporters may be tempted to a more vehement protest vote, or protest abstention, while the Liberal Democrats may gain even more from tactical voting by Labour. The fate of Mr Graham Mather, the Conservative candidate in Hampshire North and Oxford, will turn on whether Labour voters in Oxford East realise that their only hope of defeating the Conservatives lies in voting Liberal Democrat. Similarly, Dr Caroline Jackson's survival as the Conservative MEP for Wiltshire depends on whether Swindon voters stay loyal to Labour. On the other hand, it can be argued, as the ICM poll suggests, that the Liberal Democrats will get only 24 per cent in the European election. It may be that their pavement politics cannot be so effective in a European contest.

The controversial British rebate on  payments to the EU budget will, however, not be discussed during  the summit, the Federal Government said.    Bonn is extremely interested in the European Parliament's  approval of EU enlargement by Austria, Sweden, Norway, and  Finland on 4 May. That is why Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  will be going to Brussels in the evening following talks in  London and Chequers to discuss the matter with German members of  parliament.    In his talks with Prime Minister John Major, Chancellor  Helmut Kohl also wants to address ""the consistent moving toward  the EU"" of the Central and East European states. This was also  the topic that Kohl put at the center of his working lunch with  Jaques Delors in Bonn yesterday.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt will have comprehensive  talks with British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael  Heseltine in London. Rexrodt is planning to visit the European  capitals in the near future in preparation for the German [EU]  presidency in the second half of 1994. London is considered the  first and most important destination; a second visit by Rexrodt  is scheduled for 9 July.    The economics minister is mainly seeking Britain's support  for the deregulation offensive that he wants to make the focus  of the second half of 1994. Competitiveness of European  industry will be the central issue of the London talks.    Rexrodt and Heseltine also want to discuss aviation,  telecommunications, and steel. In the field of aviation, the  so-called future large aircraft, the joint production of a  transport aircraft, will be discussed. Another item on the  agenda is the joint development and production of aeroengines.  This includes a comprehensive harmonization of export controls  for dual use products that has been demanded by German industry.    German-British trade declined last year due to recession  (- 3.9 percent in imports, - 0.3 percent in exports). In  1992, German imports amounted to 43.57 billion German marks  [DM], and exports were DM51.95, while the relevant figures were  DM33.16 billion and DM46.61 billion in 1993. As in previous  years, Germany was Britain's major trading partner in 1993 (14.0  percent of foreign trade). Great Britain is one of the most  important trading partners for the FRG as well (6.9 percent of  foreign trade).    The Finance Ministry said yesterday that the German side  wants to discuss the 1995 EU budget and financial implications  of EU enlargement with British Chancellor of the Exchequer  Kenneth Clarke. Another issue to be discussed is EU-wide  measures against fraud.    Bonn denies that the EU rebate of DM6 billion per year,  which  Great Britain was granted in 1985, will be discussed in the  London talks. Yet, it is not only the coalition parties and the  finance minister, but also the Social Democratic opposition that  wants to reshuffle EU finances in Germany's favor. The rebate  for Great Britain is no longer justified, the Social Democratic  Party's deputy chairwoman Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said only  recently.     "

After four months since the signing of Ireland-Britain peace  initiative this is the first time ever that the two countries'  senior officials have launched a fresh effort for overcoming the  existing obstacles. Britain, which is one of the old parties to  the Northern Ireland dispute, through setting certain  preconditions for the participation of Sinn Fein, the political  wing of the Irish Republican Army, at their peace talks has  resulted in prompting this army to view their future peace talks  with pessimism, thus continuing its armed struggles [sentence as  received].    Britain, through setting a precondition for the Irish  Republican Army for putting an end to the armed struggles  without determining any obligation for London in connection with  the withdrawal of its forces, has drawn these talks to a  stalemate.    Political observers believe the presence of 12,000 British  troops as well as a 7,000 strong Ulster police in Northern  Ireland, which are considered as major opposition forces  antagonizing the IRA, are regarded as major obstacles to the  continuation of the peace talks process.    The British Government, contrary to its claims, based on its  interests in resolving the Northern Ireland dispute, still  insists on certain stands which are typical of the continuation  of Britain's dominance in Northern Ireland.    The British Government has hinted at the issue of self-rule  for Northern Ireland in its plan for peace initiative which  means that London refuses to accept the right to sovereignty for  Northern Ireland and is attempting to keep Northern Ireland as a  region under British dominance. Meanwhile, the Protestant  majority residing in Northern Ireland, that enjoys all-out  support and protection of Britain, is yet another obstacle to  the process of peace talks. In order to overcome it, Britain  has to adopt a stance taking into consideration the existing  realities.    Assuredly the British Government is no longer able to resort  to the past methods to suppress the IRA and seek to exercise  military power for the materialization of its political  objectives.    In the meantime, one should note that the IRA, in turn, now  does not see continuation of the armed struggle to be enough for  achieving its goals. That is because the Conservative and Labor  Governments in Britain have demonstrated that they have made  themselves invulnerable to the blows of the army and will  neutralize the effects of such measures and the government's  political decisions. With regard to the fact that the two sides  have obtained great experiences during more than two decades of  struggle, and also in view of the difficulties faced by each  side, it appears that one can assess the future of these talks  optimistically through the presentation of peaceful views by  each side.

They are looking to the Premier to block Euro moves aimed at  bullying Britain into a single currency and greater integration.    And in a glimmer of light for the Tories, the survey  suggests  they will lose 13 of their 32 Euro-seats on June 9, nothing like  as bad as the party's worst fears.    There is also a personal boost for Mr Major. Fifty-seven per  cent of Conservative supporters want him to stay as Prime  Minister even if the Tories are hammered. Only 38 per cent say  he should go. Labour are on course next month to win 61 seats,  up from 46, and the Liberal Democrats three, their first ever in  Strasbourg.    Voting intentions for the Euro-poll are Labour 46 per cent,  Tory 27 per cent, Liberal Democrats 22 per cent and others five  per cent.    If there was a general election Labour would collect 48 per  cent, the Tories 26 per cent, Lib-Dems 23 per cent And others  four per cent.    The poll, carried out by ICM [International Communications  and Marketing Research] coincides with the launch of election  manifestos by the three main political parties in London today.    Last night Mr Major underlined how polarised they will be in  the campaign, with the Tories increasingly Euro-sceptic and  Labour and the Liberal Democrats pro-federal.    In a letter to voters in key constituencies, he declared:  ""Some people say, `Does it matter who runs the European  parliament?' Yes, it does and now more than ever before.""    He pointed out MEPs [members of the European Parliament]  would have a say in choosing a successor to Commission president  Jacques Delors and had new powers to make laws. ""By voting  Conservative you will be voting for a strong Britain in a strong  Europe,"" said the Prime Minister. ""And what will you be saying  if you vote Labour or Liberal?    ""You will be saying you are in favour of a United States of  Europe. You will want more powers to pass to Brussels.""    Launching the Lib-Dem manifesto, Paddy Ashdown said: ""We  want a Europe which provides practical opportunities or people,  not grand theories for politicians.    ""We won't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for  Britain's sake.""    His party's document says: ""We want a European Union [EU]  which is democratic, decentralised and diverse, a federal Europe  that works for Britain.""    Worryingly for the Tories, four out of five voters say  domestic politics rather than Euro issues will influence how  they vote.    Among Conservative voters who want a new leader 46 per cent  favour Michael Heseltine, 24 per cent Kenneth Clarke, 17 per  cent Michael Portillo, seven per cent Virginia Bottomley and six  per cent Michael Howard.    The poll suggests that a new Prime Minister could cut  Labour's 22-point lead over the Tories in a general election to  14 points.    Under a new Tory leader, Labour would poll 46 per cent, the  Tories 32 per cent, Lib-Dems 19 per cent.    The ICM survey was taken among more than 1,019 voters in 52  constituencies last week, after the death of Labour leader John  Smith.    Though it predicts the Conservatives holding only 19 Euro  seats, it suggests they could reduce their losses if they can  get their supporters out during the campain.    Two-thirds of those determined to vote but still undecided,  voted Tory in the 1992 general election and two-thirds of those  live in Conservative-held seats.    But if all the don't knows stay at home or vote Labour or  Lib- Dem, the Tories could be annihilated, holding only 11  seats. Asked what would be the most important influence on how  they would vote, 79 per cent said the political situation in  Britain and only 14 per cent Europe.    When ICM asked voters which party best represents Britain in  the EU, 37 per cent said Labour, 27 per cent Conservative and 15  per cent the Liberal Democrats.    Fifty-nine per cent of all voters want Mr Major replaced if  there is a Tory election disaster next month.    But although 52 per cent said he should regard the polls as  a  verdict on him as Premier, the figure was only 42 per cent among  Tory supporters.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday played down Tory  divisions on Europe and promised a positive manifesto message.    The twofold theme of the Conservative campaign will be Put  Jobs First, highlighting opposition to the social chapter and  Keep The Veto, a pledge to fight Britain's corner in Europe.     "

With David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, sitting out  because of the British opt-out, they approved a directive to  establish European works councils in transnational companies  with at least 1,000 employees in the community outside Britain.    The law is designed to ensure that workers are consulted  about strategic corporate decisions which could affect their  livelihood, such as changing technology, shifts in production  from one country to another, or large-scale redundancies.    Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the  decision was an historic breakthrough after 23 years of  argument. He claimed the law could improve the competitiveness  of business by strengthening its most important asset -- good  relations between managements and their staff.    ""We have reaffirmed in a dramatic way the commitment of  member states to maintain social progress at the same time as  other policies,"" he said.    But Mr Hunt said the decision to establish ""trade-union  dominated works councils"" was a dreadful mistake which would  ""impose unnecessary costs and bureaucracy on companies at a time  when the overwhelming need is to reduce costs and increase  employment."" The measure was opposed by every employers group  in Europe, he said.    Up to 100 of the largest British-based multinationals might  be affected by the legislation because they have more than 1,000  employees in the EU outside Britain and meet the threshold of at  least 150 in two or more of the other 11 member states.    They will be obliged to set up works councils for their  continental and Irish employees. ""But they will be free to  decide for themselves what arrangements they have for consulting  and informing their staff in Britain,"" Mr Hunt said.    He presented this as a benefit of the opt-out, but this  interpretation was disputed by Norbert Blum, the German labour  minister, who said: ""Modern entrepreneurs must have a system of  informing their employees if they are going to make headway.  This is all about motivation and we can't have the standards of  the last century.""    Mr Flynn said the evidence from company boardrooms was that  they intended to apply the directive right throughout the EU.  ""De jure this legislation covers the 11, de facto it will be  applied across the 12,"" he said.    He estimated that 1,500 multinationals would be affected in  the EU as a whole, of which 15 to 100 would be based in Britain.    John Monks, general secretary of the TUC [Trade Union  Council], said yesterday: ""I regret the British government  opt-out means some British workers will be denied rights that  obtain elsewhere, but I am confident that many of the  British-based companies concerned will take the sensible course  and apply the same provisions to their British operations.""    The legislation agreed yesterday is expected to pass through  the European Parliament in September and to receive a second and  final approval from the Council of Ministers before the end of  the year. The 11 member states then have up to two years to  transpose it into their national law.    The directive is designed to encourage managements to agree  arrangements with their trade unions for consulting employees in  the way which best suits the style of the business. Its  legislative bite lies in a fall-back procedure which imposes  works council machinery if these negotiations fail.    On a proposal from the French government, the allowable  negotiating period was extended from two to three years. This  means no compulsory machinery can be established before the year  2000, but Mr Flynn believes there is now the incentive for firms  to start negotiating immediately.    Another amendment approved yesterday was to restrict the  legislation to firms with at least 150 employees in two or more  member states, instead of 100.    The social affairs council gave final approval for a  directive to prevent the exploitation of young workers,  including a controversial exemption to allow 14 and 15-year-olds  in Britain to continue to work more than 12 hours a week.    Mr Hunt said this was a ""UK opt-out"" which would protect  British schoolchildren's traditional right to earn pocket money  by delivering newspapers and gaining work experience from a few  hours work at weekends.    Mr Flynn said there was a temporary concession, but no  opt-out. Britain would have to legislate to comply with the  directive within the next six years because the exemption would  automatically expire unless the European Commission proposed its  renewal, which it would never contemplate.

A report by the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) expresses serious doubts about protection offered to Hong Kong's judiciary, its legislature and people by the Basic Law, the colony's post-1997 constitution, promulgated by the Chinese government in April 1990. The report strongly criticises Britain for not offering Hong Kong's people the right of self-determination in the form of a referendum over the terms of the Joint Declaration. In the absence of this the report says Britain should offer 3.2m holders of locally-issued British passports the right of UK abode. Robert Rice, Legal Correspondent, adds: Sir William Goodhart, the British QC, who with jurists from Australia, Malaysia and Germany visited Hong Kongfor the ICJ, said:  'The agreement was signed before the brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989. The big question is will the Chinese government allow the people of Hong Kong to exercise the rights and freedoms which it has denied so far to its own citizens?' Countdown to 1997.

Young people and women in service industries will bear the brunt of the job losses. As for bringing Britain into line with Europe, a glance at youth unemployment rates in those European countries with minimum wages is instructive. UK youth unemployment in 1988, the latest year of complete OECD figures, was 11.8 per cent compared to 21.7 per cent in France, 34.5 per cent in Italy and 40 per cent in Spain.

To give you more information on the issue, let us  speak to Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammadi on the telephone  right now:    [Announcer] As you know, our president revealed the British  espionage activities against Iran. We will be grateful if you  can provide more details for our listeners. When was the affair  discovered?    [Mohammadi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. In the first week of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May],  when work was being carried out on one of the walls in our  embassy in London, workers found a British electronic  surveillance device planted in the wall. The issue was assessed  so that all the British espionage activities might be  investigated and every action that contravenes diplomatic  parlance and the Vienna Convention regarding Britain's official  espionage might be exposed.    The British politicians tried to preempt this with a hasty  defensive reaction to cover up this aberration and actions that  violate diplomatic practices. They thus committed another  blunder. They propounded the issue of our collaboration with the  IRA.    [Announcer] Thank you. It appears that in its efforts to  cover up its humiliation stemming from its espionage, the London  government is pursuing other objectives with this propaganda  clamor. How do you appraise Britain's overall objectives with  this latest propaganda outcry?    [Mohammadi] Initially, these were attempts to conceal the  espionage affair and violation of diplomatic practices and  ethics. At the same time, Britain sought to mask the domestic  problems with which it has been grappling for quite some time.  By raising such issues in its foreign policy, Britain aims to  divert attention from internal and external policy issues.    We must mention our diplomatic efforts and moves regarding  the rights of the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  conflict between our support for Bosnia-Herzegovina and British  policy. In this context the hue and cry raised by the British  was designed to counteract our policy. When the British  perceived their vulnerability and isolation in their support of  Rushdie against Muslim public opinion they were forced to  concoct a new issue to divert their public and replace the  Rushdie issue in this manner.    As a result, the objective pursued by Britain was that world  attention should be directed toward a new issue that would in  some way relate to the United States' accusatory and domineering  policies against the Islamic Republic of Iran.    [Announcer] I thank you for your explanations and Your  Excellency's participation in this talk.    [Mohammadi] I thank you. Goodbye.

According to figures from Kuala Lumpur, UK exports to Malaysia rose 80 per cent in the period to Pounds 666m (Dollars 1bn). Meanwhile, Malaysia's exports to Britain dropped by 24 per cent to Pounds 581m. Malaysia imposed its ban on British companies in February this year in retaliation over reports in the London press alleging that a British company had tried to offer bribes to senior Malaysian officials. The Malaysian government was also angered by the publicity surrounding the granting of British aid for construction of the Pergau dam and the parliamentary inquiry into its linkage to multi-million-pound Malaysian purchases of British defence equipment. While British officials would not comment on the latest trade figures, it is thought that a large portion of the goods exported by Britain to Malaysia over the last six months resulted from contracts signed before the ban was imposed. The trade figures are likely to have included British defence equipment, including British Aerospace Hawker fighter aircraft, delivered recently to Malaysia under the terms of a controversial 1988 memorandum of understanding on defence sales signed by former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, her Malaysian counterpart.

0,FT942-5948 ,"FT942-5948 _AN-EFBDVACCFT 940602   FT  02 JUN 94 / Big companies oppose social chapter      By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent   Britain's big companies are overwhelmingly opposed to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, according to a Gallup poll for the Conservatives published yesterday. The poll of 301 top companies also reveals opposition to proposals by the Socialist Group in the European parliament for a minimum wage and cuts in working hours to reduce unemployment. Mr John Major said the poll showed that the social chapter was 'a licence to mess up the British recovery'. He said Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who support the social chapter, were 'stuck in the groove of the old corporate, centralised, over-regulated Europe'. Labour said the economy was being severely damaged by the government's lack of concern for public health and social welfare. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said Britain's rate of sickness absence from work was twice as high as Germany's. 'The need for the social chapter to be implemented here is matched by the crying need for Britain to lift its standards to those of a first-rate nation rather than an offshore tax haven,' he said. Gallup interviewed companies with an average payroll of 5,500 and average turnover of Pounds 220m. It found that 79 per cent support the UK opt-out from the social chapter. Nearly 80 per cent believe Labour's plan to adopt the chapter would damage British business, and 73 per cent believe it would cause a substantial loss of jobs. More than 80 per cent oppose European Union legislation on industrial matters within the UK; 74 per cent oppose a minimum wage; and 66 per cent believe wages legislation would increase unemployment. Nearly 90 per cent believe compulsory cuts in working hours would harm competitiveness. Gallup said 53 per cent of respondents believe that Britain has most effectively enforced EU legislation. Italy, France, Greece and Spain were the countries most widely regarded as ineffective in this respect. The poll also indicated that political integration is well down the list of business priorities for the EU. It showed that 73 per cent want improved competitiveness; 43 per cent seek more flexible labour markets; and 37 per cent want reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Just 22 per cent favour economic and monetary union; 12 per cent want an enlarged community; 3 per cent want implementation of the social chapter; and 2 per cent back political integration. Mr Major said the survey supported the government's claim that the economy had benefited from the opt-out from the social chapter. 'We are doing relatively better because we have the right ingredients for jobs and growth. The social chapter will put that at risk. It is the very last thing that Britain needs.'

INTRIGUE AND NEUTRALITY ACCOUNT FOR ITS MODERN APPEAL.      By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Independent and stridently neutral Malta, the base for the first  American-Soviet seaborne summit meeting, is a fortress archipelago that insured  the maritime power of Great Britain for more than a century, then lost its  strategic importance in the decline of the British Empire and the dawn of the  nuclear age.    Now, the tiny nation seems destined to enter the consciousness of Americans for  the first time since John Huston directed his first movie, ""The Maltese  Falcon,"" in 1941. In a tense moment that has made film history, the Fat Man  (Sydney Greenstreet) asks Humphrey Bogart, the star playing detective Sam  Spade: ""What do you know, sir, about the Order of the Hospital of St. John of  Jerusalem?""    ""Crusaders or something,"" Bogart replies, and the spellbinding intrigue of  ancient treasure quickly unfolds.    As hordes of news reporters and photographers descend on Malta to cover the  Dec. 2-3 meeting of President Bush and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail S.  Gorbachev far offshore, Americans will discover that the three inhabited  islands of Malta are still exotic, steeped in history and touched by intrigue.  Although the falcons have been exterminated, the Order of St. John, which ruled  Malta for more than two centuries, still exists, its three dozen or so members  wearing their medieval robes and oddly shaped Maltese crosses.    The intrigue even hints of terrorism. West German officials said only this week  that they have come upon clues that link the destruction of the Pan American  World Airways plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21 to a suitcase that  came from an Air Malta flight. The suitcase may have been put aboard the Air  Malta plane in Valletta, the capital of Malta, and transferred to the Pan Am  plane in Frankfurt, they said.    In another brush with terrorism, the Maltese government allowed Egyptian  commandoes to storm an EgyptAir passenger plane that had been hijacked to  Valletta in November, 1985. The assault was bungled, and 57 people died in the  terrifying battle.    Maltese officials infuriated the Reagan Administration in April, 1986, when  they warned Libya that they had spotted American bombers flying overhead on the  way to Tripoli and Benghazi. Since then, the Maltese have elected a more  pro-Western government, led by Prime Minister Edward Fenech-Adami.    But Fenech-Adami has still tried to maintain the neutralist position of Malta  -- a stance that may help explain why Bush and Gorbachev agreed that the small  republic could serve as a logistical base for the summit aboard their warships  in the Mediterranean Sea.    Another reason may be its magnificent harbor, a small bay alongside Valletta  known as the Grand Harbor. Warships nestled in that harbor for centuries but no  longer do. From the fortified Grand Harbor, the British navy could guard both  sides of the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic and Aegean seas as well. In the  19th Century, neither France, the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the Hapsburgs nor  the Ottoman Empire of Turkey could control these waters so long as Britain  controlled Malta.    The strategic importance of Malta was so great that Hitler tried in vain to  bomb it into submission during World War II.    Now British, German and Scandinavian tourists crowd the few beaches of the  islands, and the Malta government hopes to attract a million tourists next  year. That is three times the population of the republic itself.    The 350,000 Maltese live on the 122 square miles of the three islands -- Malta,  Gozo and Comino -- located south of Sicily, east of Tunisia and north of Libya.  There are two other Maltese islands but they are not inhabited.    Over the centuries, Malta has been settled or conquered by Sicilians,  Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, Normans, French and British. The  mixed population speaks a language that is three-quarters Semitic, mostly old  Arabic, and a quarter Romance, mostly Italian. English, however, is recognized  as an official language as well.    The fascinating history of Malta makes clear that its main resource has always  been geography; its location creates a bridge between the Christian and Muslim  worlds and between Europe and Africa.    Christianity was introduced in Malta when St. Paul was shipwrecked there in the  year 60. The Maltese are mainly Roman Catholic and boast that they attend  church more regularly than any other people on Earth.    In 1530, Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire ceded Malta as a fief to  the Knights of St. John, who had been evicted by the Turks from their base on  the island of Rhodes. Their tribute to the emperor was a single falcon, to be  given every year on All Saints Day. It was not a sculpted jewel-bedecked black  bird of the John Huston movie and the Dashiell Hammett novel on which the movie  was based, but a real falcon from the islands.    The knights, who began as an order nursing Crusaders stricken en route to  Jerusalem, later became a military order as well. They transformed Malta into a  naval base and the southernmost bastion of Christianity in Europe.    Napoleon seized the islands in 1798 but surrendered them to the British two  years later. Malta's strategic value was so great that Horatio Nelson, the  British naval hero, wrote: ""I hope we shall never give it up.""    Britain formally annexed it as a colony in 1814, building an enormous port in  Grand Harbor and using it until recent times as the base for its Mediterranean  fleet. British spending on the base insured economic prosperity for the  Maltese.    As the power of Britain waned and as naval dominance became far less important  than nuclear dominance, the military significance of Malta diminished. In 1964,  Britain granted the islands their independence. Malta, while remaining in the  British Commonwealth, broke its ties to the Queen of England in 1974 and  declared itself a republic.    Although the British maintained the Grand Harbor as a North Atlantic Treaty  Organization naval base for several years after independence, it withdrew all  its military forces in 1979. Malta then assumed its neutral role.    The decline in British spending on the base after World War II insured a  decline in prosperity, and there has been an extensive emigration from the  islands for the last few decades. In 1954 alone, more than 11,000 Maltese, 3%  of the total population, left the islands.

0,FT944-3487 ,"FT944-3487 _AN-ELNDJAD6FT 941213   FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: China and 1997   It is in everybody's interest that the UK's handover of Hong Kong should be a success. Britain needs a dignified exit from its colonial past; China requires a prosperous and peaceful Hong Kong if it is eventually to reintegrate Taiwan. As 1997 gets closer, China will increasingly be calling the tune. The question is how it plans to use that influence. Last weekend's meeting in Beijing of China's preliminary working committee, which is examining details of the handover, was not encouraging. China plans to install a provisional Legislative Council in 1997 in place of the body elected next year under Governor Chris Patten's reforms. It has now made clear it intends that council to run for at least a year. It is also prevaricating about the shape of the court of final appeal which is to be the territory's supreme legal authority after 1997. This is unsettling, not only because Britain thought the arrangements were already agreed. Without some guarantee of judicial continuity, Hong Kong's future looks deeply uncertain. China will damage its own interests if it lets rancour over electoral reform impede practical progress on the handover arrangements. There is a pressing need to ensure that Hong Kong can remain an economic and social success after 1997. Civil servants need to be sure their careers will continue after that date. The business community needs to know that the provisional LegCo will not be used to impose capricious and repressive legal changes that will undermine confidence in the economy. To prevent a legal vacuum, China should agree quickly to the establishment of the court. It may be unable to go back on its LegCo plans. But when Chinese officials meet their British counterparts in London this week, they could at least make a categoric commitment to limit the scope of the provisional council's mandate to passing essential legislation, rather than allow it to enact more far-reaching changes. For its part Britain should leave the door as wide open as possible to practical co-operation, allowing formal contacts between government officials and the preliminary working committee and taking more care to consult on policy. One problem is China's apparent obsession with the notion that, since it will not recognise the Legislative Council elected under the Patten reform, it will also not recognise any laws it passes. That only makes for maximum uncertainty. A more constructive approach would be to work for a good showing by pro-mainland parties in next year's elections. The world would then see that Hong Kong's Chinese citizens did not all view 1997 as a threat. Many are deeply patriotic and would welcome reversion to mainland rule were it not for their fear of the Communist party. Beijing cannot succeed in this enterprise unless it tries harder to win the hearts and minds of the Hong Kong people.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.     HKZ  Hong Kong, Asia.

Confirming the purchase, announced in Stockholm last week, of the Barnangen household and personal products company from Sweden's Nobel Industrier, Mr Sihler said the acquisition had cost DM900m (Dollars 569.6m). It had increased turnover in cosmetics to 10 per cent of the group total. Henkel had achieved 'critical mass' in several European markets. 'Cosmetics is now a very profitable business,' Mr Sihler said, although a greater presence in Britain would be welcome. Barnangen is best known in Britain for Aapri skin care products, in France for Le Chat, and in Germany for Vademecum toothpaste. Household detergents and cleaning products, a Henkel speciality accounting for 32 per cent of group sales, comprise 15 per cent of Barnangen's turnover. Personal products, including the Fa and Poly brand names, account for a further 76 per cent. The deal includes between DM150m and DM200m of debt, Mr Sihler added. It would be funded from group reserves and borrowings. Henkel expects sales in the current year to increase from DM12.9bn in 1991 to around DM14bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

However, he  added, it would be very unfortunate if the British government  adopted retaliatory measures because the Malaysian action was  not directed at the British Government. Abdullah made the  statement after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  reportedly indicated that the British Government might take  retaliatory measures. [passage omitted]    We are not hasty in our action against the allegations but  we  cannot allow the British media to publish baseless statements,  he told reporters after presenting Id festival aid to poor  people in the northern Penang state. Abdullah said Malaysian  leaders had to defend their dignity by taking action owing to  the allegations by influential newspapers in Britain.    The action by the Malaysian Government resulted from the  attitude of the Western media which forced the country to act,  he said. Abdullah said the government would wait and see what  action the British Government would take in the matter.    Any action by the British Government should be directed at  the media which brought about this problem between the two  countries and should not be a retaliation against this country,  he said. He said that if the British Government took retaliatory  measures against Malaysia, bilateral relations would be strained  and subsequently Britain would be the loser.     "

His comments were immediately contradicted by Conservative Central Office and Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative MEPs. Mr John Major's advisers were irritated by the intervention of Sir Leon, the former Conservative trade and industry secretary, in the middle of the European elections. The prime minister said last week he did not believe that a single currency would come in his lifetime. In an interview with BBC radio, Sir Leon, external economic affairs commissioner, said: 'Where people in Britain would make a great mistake is if they think that it (a single currency) is not going to happen. 'It is going to happen and since the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism in its old form, the fact is that most of the countries of continental Europe are keener than ever to go ahead with a single currency.' Sir Christopher dismissed Sir Leon's predictions, saying the moment for a single currency had come and gone. He made clear that while the government was not opposed to the principle of a single currency it was up to the British parliament to decide if it wanted one. However, he added: 'There would be difficulty in getting one through parliament because of the deep-seated opposition to it in the country.' The Liberal Democrats accused the Tories of being split over the issue, pointing out that many Conservative MEPs had voted in favour of federalism in the European parliament. Sir Christopher pointed out that the Single European Act 1986 had legalised 'super-nationalism' and therefore there was nothing odd that all MEPs had voted at some stage in favour of federalism 'of one sort or the other'. Sir Leon said the fact that the rest of the EU was moving towards a single currency did not mean that Britain had to follow suit. 'But it is important that we do not think it is going to go away and not happen.' He denied that there was a need for concern because Britain had the option of a single currency but not the obligation. 'Britain can decide when it wants whether to join or not join. This is a genuinely free choice,' he said. Sir Leon said he was in favour of joining, although this was not a decision that had to be taken now. The Conservatives yesterday published a document detailing the support of Labour MEPs for 'leftwing causes'. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said: 'Socialists in Europe are a threat to British interests, to free enterprise and to jobs in Britain.'

Police  suspect profits from the booming international trade are  ultimately financing Somali warlords.    Bill Hamilton, who was sacked from the Metropolitan police  four years ago because of business links with a convicted IRA  terrorist, has become embroiled in the international trade in  qat, a highly addictive drug cultivated in the Horn of Africa.    Britain has become the world's biggest clearing house for  the  drug, which is banned in many western countries but remains  legal here. The Home Office, which monitors the drug, maintains  it does not constitute a serious threat to British society  because its use is restricted to a few thousand refugees from  Africa.    However, drug abuse workers in areas of London populated by  Somalis have become concerned at the harm that misuse of qat is  causing to the refugees. They claim it is turning many of them  into zombies and creating serious social problems.    Police and customs officers have also become concerned that  the trade is helping to finance the clan leaders running the  civil war in Somalia. They control some of the main areas where  qat is grown and are thought to be behind the booming business  in supplying the drug to Somali, Ethiopian and other refugee  communities in countries where it is illegal.    The National Criminal Intelligence Service and customs  officers in Britain estimate that at least 80 different  syndicates are importing qat from Africa and then re-exporting  it illegally to countries where it is banned.    Hamilton, a former Special Branch sergeant who worked at  Heathrow, has used his knowledge of the system to fly British  couriers into North America with suitcases full of qat plants,  which are chewed to obtain an amphetamine-like high. He was  sacked by Scotland Yard after an inquiry into a double-glazing  business he had set up in Northern Ireland with a convicted IRA  man. He now operates from west London, recruiting couriers in  local pubs.    Many couriers have failed to consider the possible  consequences of being caught. Some have been banned from further  entry into the United States and one man is currently serving a  six-month jail sentence in Finland, according to Peter Coutts, a  courier recruited by Hamilton.    Coutts, 41, an ex-Reuter journalist from Isleworth, west  London, was arrested last month with another Briton at  Philadelphia after they flew in with four suitcases crammed with  the drugs. ""We were isolated, handcuffed and grilled. It was a  pretty horrible experience,"" he said.    In the past year more than 1.5 tonnes of the drug smuggled  from Britain has been confiscated in Scandinavia alone. Yet  Hamilton, who was detained at Toronto airport 18 months ago for  possessing the drug, remains unrepentant. Last week, he admitted  involvement but insisted he had now severed his ties with the  syndicate. ""My involvement was largely on a casual self-employed  basis.

It can only be that Britain is uncharitable and illiberal, unwilling to shoulder its international responsibilities and share its peace and relative prosperity with those who are manifestly less fortunate. No wonder the foreign secretary feels that his authority on the world stage has been undermined. Of more lasting damage, however, may be the message Mr Clarke is sending to the British people that Britain is for the British, that Bosnian refugees are undesirable, an unacceptable burden, outsiders who should not be allowed to share our way of life. If Mr Clarke rests his closed door policy on fears of an anti-refugee backlash from the far right then he should be aware that he is playing into their hands. He cannot counter their arguments by singing their song. The message he projects must be reversed: that refugees need not be a burden but an asset. In the short term they need our help. In the long term, if they stay, they will contribute to the economic prosperity and cultural diversity of our nation as generations of refugees have done before. The German Interior Ministry has belatedly launched a publicity programme of this kind. The Swedish government has for many years provided Swedes with positive information about people who have moved to live in that country. The extraordinary humanitarian efforts of agencies like Alert demonstrate a generosity of spirit from which Kenneth Clarke has much to learn. But opening the doors would not be enough. We must tell the British people not only that this is the right course of action for Britain to take but that both internationally and domestically, it is in our interests to do so.

The legislation also limits the time children and adolescents can work. The meeting of employment and social affairs ministers was the first since the Maastricht treaty, from which Britain has an opt-out on the so-called Social Chapter, came into force. The UK has won extensive derogations, or opt-outs, with a review after 10 and seven years respectively on both these EU laws, put through under pre-Maastricht rules which attempted to keep the 12 on roughly the same social policy course. The European Commission and the UK's 11 partners yesterday also formally opted to decide without Britain about plans for compulsory consultation with elected works councils in pan-European countries, using Maastricht's Social Chapter. A proposal to give unpaid parental leave of three months to both fathers and mothers, with guarantees they would get their jobs back, was also abandoned after being blocked by the UK. It will now almost certainly be put forward again for approval by the 11, senior EU officials said. Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, was jubilant and combative, claiming that Britain was winning the argument about the cost to Europe's industrial competitiveness of EU social legislation. 'I'm very optimistic that more and more governments are listening to what we have to say,' he said, despite Britain's isolation on all four measures. Mr Hunt said the British government would be taking the working time directive to the European Court, probably in the new year, because it had been 'inappropriately' put through under health and safety provisions which denied the UK its veto. Under the measure, there are safeguards for the 2.5m British workers who now work more than 48 hours a week who no longer wish to do so. The UK will also for the first time be obliged to introduce laws giving mandatory daily rest periods after six consecutive hours; a minimum daily rest period of 11 hours; at least one day a week off; no more than eight hours a shift on average for night work; and four weeks annual paid holiday. UK officials insisted that Luxembourg also had problems with the parental leave plan. But this is because the tiny Grand Duchy offers eight times the amount of time off to look after children in the Euro-plan, but without the right of return to the same job. The 11 are happy to accommodate the Luxembourg mix - but the exasperation with the UK at yesterday's meeting showed that patience with Britain's blocking tactics has been all but exhausted. 'The UK is living in the stone age,' said one EC diplomat. 'Any kind of standards is anathema to them.' 'It's ideology rather than content,' said another, 'it's the word 'social' that offends.'

0,FT931-10290 ,"FT931-10290 _AN-DBICOAF6FT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / Personal View: How to mend the labour market      By RICHARD LAYARD   With unemployment in the UK nearing 3m it is time for a fundamental re-think of policy. For we now know that high unemployment is not a temporary problem. It is a permanent scar on Britain's present economic structures. Since 1986 the number of people out of work has averaged 2.4m. Inflation now is the same as in 1986, so this means that, as things are, the government cannot control inflation with fewer then 2.4m unemployed. That is the horrible truth that needs addressing. First, a policy is needed which will prevent long-term unemployment (of more than one year). On most evidence long-term unemployment does nothing to prevent inflationary wage pressures, so it is a total waste. The long-term unemployed cease to be part of the effective supply of labour since they become of no interest to employers. This imposes a huge cost on taxpayers and companies, as well as on the unemployed themselves. Unemployment now costs the economy roughly Pounds 60bn, of which Pounds 24bn is borne by taxpayers, Pounds 12bn by lost profits and Pounds 24bn by the unemployed. Long-term unemployment accounts for about a third of the total. To prevent long-term unemployment requires adopting an 'active labour market policy' of the kind recommended by the OECD and practised in Sweden, even by its new Conservative government. The principle is that, if people want to work, they should be helped to be employable. And no one should be left to rot in idleness for more than a year with no offer of useful work. An active labour market policy for Britain would have the following elements: Job Centres would provide for each unemployed person a personal placement officer, who would ensure that every client received training or a job offer within a year. Training would be of better quality than at present (Sweden spends the same on an unemployed trainee as on a university student). If a person gets no offer of regular work within a year, he or she must be offered temporary work. This should be with a regular employer and be paid at the standard hourly rate for the job. A low-quality 'workfare' scheme, where workers get benefit 'plus', would be a real mistake. Workers need the self-respect which goes with a normal job paid at the normal rate. If funds are stretched, the job could in the last resort be part-time. There is little point keeping people off the unemployment register if they are doing nothing useful. Poor-quality schemes are unlikely to be justified. What is done now should be part of a long-term plan, constructing a system which will prevent long-term unemployment. Details of such a plan have been outlined in a pamphlet by John Philpott and myself*. International evidence suggests that such a system could reduce Britain's unemployment permanently by about 0.75m. In due course it would pay for itself through lower benefits and higher tax receipts. A complete system could not be fully in place much before 2000. But now is the time to start. The proposed 250,000 temporary jobs should be a step on the way. Second, a rethink on youth training is needed. At least two-thirds of British workers have no professional or vocational qualification - compared with only a quarter in Germany. No wonder so many find it difficult to get jobs. If Britain follows the German example it should: finance all vocational education and training from collective sources (taxes or levies); require that all young people in employment are employed as trainees, with at least one day a week off-the-job training. Improving the quality of labour will do much to reduce inflationary pressures. But, point three, Britain must also improve its anarchic system of wage determination. As soon as there is a recovery, wage settlements will rise again, as they did after 1986. The country will be into the same old cycle. Business, in its own interest, should deal with this problem by contriving a more co-ordinated approach to wage determination, analogous to Germany's. But this will not happen without government encouragement. In this connection everyone in Britain should be watching Germany, to see how it handles infinitely greater problems than Britain has ever had to face. You can be sure that western Germany will control its inflation with fewer than 3m unemployed. So should Britain.

The dispute erupted over the weekend when Britain ordered the expulsion of  eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists for alleged spy activities. While  initial news of the expulsions was suppressed to avoid disturbing what has been  acknowledged here as one of the warmest periods in Anglo-Soviet relations since  World War II, Moscow quickly retaliated by announcing the expulsion of an  identical list of 11 Britons.    Then, in an additional move, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.  Gerasimov told a news conference in Moscow on Monday that the number of Britons  permitted to live in the Soviet Union would be reduced by 170 from a present  level of 375 to 205, a figure he described as a quota agreed upon by the two  countries.    ""The quota, at 205, has been radically violated, and as a reciprocal measure,  it is stated that now we establish the quota of personnel of British  representation at the figure of 205,"" Gerasimov said.    In London, however, Foreign Office officials said they are unware of any such  quota and expressed confusion over Gerasimov's figure of 375.    ""There are 78 registered British staff working in the Soviet Union,"" a Foreign  Office spokesman said. ""We have no idea what he (Gerasimov) is talking about  with 375.""    The spokesman speculated that the figure might relate to all personnel, both  Soviet and British, who work for British organizations or diplomatic missions  in the Soviet Union.

British officials dealing with the affair said illegal activities by the 11  Soviets were first brought to Moscow's attention as early as last January and  that warnings had been repeated since.    ""We gave them every opportunity to . . . cease their activities,"" said a senior  government official. ""We didn't want this to happen.""      Lunched With the Queen    The present diplomatic row comes just one month after Soviet President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's visit to Britain, during which he strengthened his personal  links with Thatcher and lunched with Queen Elizabeth II.    The British monarch's acceptance of a formal invitation to visit the Soviet  Union -- the first such invitation since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution --  seemed to symbolize a high point in post-World War II Anglo-Soviet relations.    Despite this warmth, Thatcher has consistently been among the severest critics  of Soviet policy.    In a recent dispute within the Western Alliance over how best to react to  Gorbachev's offer to negotiate away short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, she  has been the most strident opponent of talks.    Domestic political opponents Monday linked her tough stand on short-range  weapons with the diplomatic expulsions.

Viswam]    [Text] On board the Prime Minister's aircraft from  London to Edinburgh, March 16: Britain's stand on Kashmir,  though not identical with that of India, was nonetheless not  very far either, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said  on Wednesday.    Talking to newsmen accompanying him on his visit to the  United Kingdom on board his aircraft, the Prime Minister said  that the three-point formula being advocated by Britain needed  to be studied and analysed further.    He said he was aware of the British position and had seen  the  three points advanced by the British government in the recent  past.    ""On the whole,"" he said, ""their position is not identical  with ours, but then it is not very far either.""    ""We will study their position further before making an  assessment,"" he added.    The three points advocated by Britian are first, a  resumption  of dialogue between India and Pakistan, second the restoration  of the democratic process in Kashmir, and third, the cessation  of external terrorism in the valley.    India, on the other hand, has been insisting that the  Pakistan abetment of subversion and terrorism should cease first  as a pre-condition for the normalisation of the situation in the  valley. India has made it clear that it is very keen on  restoring the political process in Kashmir, and it has also  expressed its readiness to initiate bilateral discussion with  Pakistan on Kashmir, and if Pakistan was not willing to do so,  it was prepared to talk to Pakistan on settling other  outstanding bilateral issues.    However, on the broader question of terrorism, which was a  crucial element in respect of the Kashmir question, the views of  India and Britain converged. Britain appeared to have a better  understanding of what India is going through, what it is  suffering and what the experience has been. Nothing illustrated  better the impact of the ""menace of terrorism"" than the fact  that a visitor to Britain had to go from airport to airport to  land or take off to ward off danger from the menace.    The Prime Minister was obviously referring to the fact that  following the series of mortar attacks on the Heathrow airport  mounted by the IRA [Irish Republican Army] terrorists, his own  aircraft had to be diverted to Gatwick, some 50 miles away,  similarly, by way of abundant caution, the British arranged for  his flight to Edinburgh from London take off not from Heathrow  or Gatwick but from the royal air force base at Brize Norton,  which is a two-hour drive from the heart of London.    ""Just imagine,"" said the Prime Minister, ""all this happening  in their own capital and all because of terrorism. They are  experiencing the same kind of terrorism which we have been  experiencing. Therefore, there is no elaborate need for the two  of us to convince each other about this menace.""    Assessing the outcome of his goodwill visit to the United  Kingdom, the Prime Minister said it had ""gone off very well.""  His overall impression was that the atmosphere during the visit  was great friendliness and greater closeness.    As a result of which both economic and political relations  had firmed up on a constructive footing. The thrust of the  discussions he had had with his counterpart, Mr Major, as well  as with other British Ministers was a combination of both  economic and political.    Apart from bilateral issues, he had the opportunity to  discuss with them a lot of other issues in the international  sphere, such as Bosnia and the crisis in that region. The  British Prime Minister had informed him that there had been some  improvement in the Bosnian situation and he expected the  improvement to continue in the months to come. Asked whether  India was being approached to send more troops to Bosnia, the  Prime Minister said in the kind of situation which prevailed,  there was no point in making new proposals.    The Prime Minister said he had seen newspaper reports in  London about the intended purchase of Hawk trainer aircraft by  India from Britain. Dismissing suggestions that the deal figured  in the discussions, Mr Rao said that decisions in respect of  acquisition of military hardware were not taken during visits  such as his. There were established procedures for such  transactions, and so if there was any impression that the visit  was made as a result of decisions on such transactions it was  erroneous. The Prime Minister left London for Edinburgh on the  final lap of his journey after planting an oak tree at the Magna  Carta Memorial, the first time, he said, that any world leader  had been requested to do so on the spot where the charter was  signed. The rights figuring in the charter were the same as he  had been incorporated in chapter three of the Indian  Constitution.     "

After talks today with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid and President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Hurd will travel on to Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before returning to London on Sunday. Britain is broadly supportive of the efforts of Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, to convene a Middle East peace conference and by visiting Amman Mr Hurd will be signalling the importance of Jordan in any resolution of Palestinian demands for self-determination. The attitude of King Hussein to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait has left a coolness in relations between Amman and Washington which Britain would like to be eased. In Kuwait, Mr Hurd can be expected to add his weight to British efforts to win a larger share of post-war reconstruction contracts, but will also be blunt about international concern over persecution of non-Kuwaitis deemed to have co-operated with the occupying Iraqi forces.

It is not true, as Aguilera asserts, that the islanders'  income from fishing in the Malvinas ""will probably increase with  the entry into effect... of another ocean zone, known as the  Falkland Outer Conservation Zone (FOCZ)."" Aguilera bases this  statement on a comment attributed to the Falklands governor who,  ""based on this fact, was assessing the possibility of extending  the fishing season and increasing by 10 percent the number of  fishing licenses to be granted in 1994.""    The truth, however, is quite different. For a start, we are  not referring to a ""London Treaty,"" but to a mere fishing  agreement that may or may not be renewed every year. Secondly,  in this agreement we have made sure that Great Britain limits to  150,000 tonnes the amount of fish extracted this season. It  does not matter where it fishes, either in the new zone  established by a common agreement with Argentina or in the ones  previously agreed upon; Great Britain cannot surpass the  aforementioned amount, and therefore the establishment of the  FOCZ will not cause any ""damage."" Moreover, it could well  benefit Argentine fishing, because every ship the islanders send  to the new zone will help reduce the number of ships operating  between the islands and the continent -- up to now the busiest  zone -- which will clearly benefit Argentine ships and help  preserve the resources.    As for the comment by David Tatham, it by no means entails  increasing fishing above the 150,000 tonnes ceiling. In spite  of what the article says, all it does is announce the price they  will charge for each fishing license and a longer term for each  permit -- factors related to their commercial policy, always  within the fixed 150,000 tonnes limit... Argentina, in turn,  has similar variables, and I would say much better ones than  what the aforementioned article suggests. Thanks to our  comparative advantages, better infrastructure, and a growing  operative efficiency, we can offer licenses for longer periods  at more attractive prices. This fact, during the past two  years, has been reflected in clear Argentine leadership in that  fishing region.    Something that is not mentioned in Aguilera's article --  which is so gloomy about the government's action -- is that  right from the beginning of these annual fishing agreements,  Great Britain has maintained the 150,000 tonne ceiling while the  Argentine ceiling has done nothing but rise. This year it has  risen to 220,000 tonnes, which will allow an income equivalent  to almost half our traditional beef exports.    It is also not true that the establishment of the FOCZ will  be necessarily negative because the preservation zone has been  turned into an exploitation zone. We are talking about  renewable resources, where preservation measures are justified  if fishing reaches the point of depredation. But if the volumes  set by the two countries do not together threaten the  preservation of resources, all that is allegedly being preserved  ends up lost with no benefit accruing to anyone.    Every year Argentina and Great Britain carry out joint  investigations and coordinate their own predictions to  scientifically assess the total fishing volume within the  preservation limits. If this coordinated policy determines the  need to ban fishing in a given zone, this is decided on a yearly  basis. For the time being the market demand does not threaten  this resource being exploited jointly.    Neither is it true that the fishing boom [preceding word in  English] represents a true and permanent increase in the  islanders' income. Quite the contrary, as the very charts  published by Aguilera show: Since these fishing agreement with  Argentina were signed, the British volumes have done nothing but  drop: 44 million pounds in 1991, 40 in 1992, and 31 in 1993.    Fishing is, in fact, very important for the islanders (it  represents 49 percent of their income) and they are perfectly  aware that maintaining these conditions depends, in the very  near future, on the good will of Argentine foreign policy and,  in the long term, of some type of agreement with our country  that will surpass the not always guaranteed annual renewals of  agreements signed so far.    Aguilera's comment about Heathcoat Amory is opportune. He is  the second consecutive British minister of state for foreign and  commonwealth affairs to publicly recommend that the islanders  seek more significant agreements with our country.    It is also true that the profits obtained from fishing will  generate deep-rooted changes in Falklands society, which sooner  or later will understand that their best alternative to exploit  this and other natural resources, and to enter the next century  with a flourishing economy, unavoidably entails basic agreements  with the only neighbor God gave them on Earth.

Wednesday is the time for Britain to decide, clearly and unequivocally, whether it intends to ratify the Maastricht treaty. He is right to put the question, on a substantive motion, squarely before the House of Commons. At some point this moment of truth had to be faced. There is now no point in delay  - unless the objective is to scupper Maastricht. If the intention is to ratify the treaty, rather than find a pretext to bury it, the time to act is now. The longer the decision of principle was left, the more the government's opponents would scent blood. They would view deferral as victory in disguise. Both the Labour opposition and the Tory dissidents have claimed until now that it 'makes sense' to wait for Denmark to make its decision on the treaty. Their argument has been that (as indeed the government came perilously close to conceding over the summer) Copenhagen's intentions should be settled before the Commons resumes work on a bill which might be unnecessary. Why have a Tory punch-up today over a treaty which could sink under its own weight into the Baltic Sea tomorrow? These arguments have always been specious. What the 'after you' school of Euro-diplomacy is really saying is that it would be very happy to see Maastricht die. For anyone to claim that there is no link between early UK ratification and Maastricht's chances of coming into effect is in fact to engage either in self-delusion or deception, or both. What incentive have the Danes to do a deal unless they see that all other member states will ratify? UK inertia distorts their choice. In Labour's case, cloudy logic is motivated by the pursuit of unprincipled party advantage. In the case of the Tory Euro-phobes, the refusal to admit the link is much more calculated. It is a cynical deception designed to disable the government and impose a minority view. Thank goodness the government has seen the dangers of that route. The same disingenuousness now reappears; so the claim that a deal on subsidiarity must be settled before the Maastricht bill can proceed. How could the British presidency of the European Community act as honest broker in Edinburgh on this or any other issue if the Commons declined to discuss the treaty, let alone if it voted against it? Letting things slide might help the government in the short term, but it would leave Britain as the one clearly seen to have pulled the plug on further progress. That would deliver another big blow, after the ERM retreat, to British credibility and influence in Europe. The government clearly understands the risk and is not prepared to run it. The case for an early Yes vote by the Commons thus comes back to the treaty's substance. Why do we want Maastricht at all? The answer is we want it for positive and negative reasons which the public debate so far has scarcely addressed, distracted by the media obsession with party and parliamentary tactics. Positively, Britain knows that its standing in the world is greatly enhanced by effective membership of a strong European Community. It wants a common foreign and security policy, on the right kind of terms set out in the Maastricht treaty. It believes in closer co-operation in justice and home affairs. It favours more democratic legitimacy and better control of EC administrative structures. Britain also likes the flexibility offered by more moves towards intergovernmental decision-making, but accepts the rationale for binding law decided by majority vote in respect of the single market. As any continental politician will testify, the final treaty design owes much to the UK. We have nothing about which to be ashamed or defensive. More negatively, we have much to fear from Maastricht's demise. The treaty keeps firmly alive the notion of the EC developing 'as 12'. It makes less, not more, likely a fast-track, inner-core move by Germany and France to form their own monetary and political union, with Benelux in tow. For Denmark, too, it should be seen as a last chance to save the power of the smaller countries in a system which, almost by chance, gives them disproportionate influence. Few people in Britain seem to have caught up with the speed with which the anti-Maastricht forces have retreated in France since September 20. While the French government may be boxed in by its farmers on the Gatt talks, Paris is now proceeding on all other mainstream European issues as if nothing had happened. France stared into the abyss and realised the absolute necessity of re-cementing the Franco-German axis as the working motor of Europe. That process is already back on track. In Bonn, similar conclusions were drawn. Britain's Euro-phobes need to understand the reality that follows from this. Failure to ratify might mean the 'death' of Maastricht in a technical sense. But it would certainly not kill the concept of closer - much closer  - partnership between 10 (or five) of the other member states. Whatever the technical difficulties, they would find a way of going ahead without us. And that would be the real defeat. The economic consequences for Britain would be disastrous. Last year, Japan's then prime minister, Mr Toshi Kaifu, told me that he regarded the country's link with Britain as 'the keystone of the arch of their relationship with Europe'. However, last week a Japanese businessman bluntly put to me a very different point of view: 'We are beginning to wonder whether we were right to regard Britain as the gateway to Europe after all.' It is not only Japan. In my native Wales, for example, 50 German companies have chosen to invest. By 1995, Bosch alone will be employing 1,200 people. How long would this kind of investment continue if Britain were to repudiate a treaty that had been so precisely tailored to our needs? Those Conservative MPs (and others) who dub Maastricht as a distraction from the economic debate really must cast aside such inward-looking myopia. Economic recovery and European policy are two sides of the same coin. Failure to ratify Maastricht would be a truly massive economic as well as political calamity  - for Britain, for Europe, and indeed the rest of the world. The Thatcherite dream of Britain miraculously evolving as a kind of north European Switzerland convinces nobody beyond our shores. They would see us wrapping ourselves in the Union Jack, in preparation for burial at sea. John Major is right to regard the ratification of the treaty as an issue of historic proportions. He knows that the case for sticking to his gun is overwhelming. Any government which, having been ejected from the ERM, then presided over Britain's wilful destruction of Maastricht (and that is how it would be seen), could have no place at the heart of Europe. Mr Major knows that Maastricht simply must be ratified  - for his sake, for the government's sake, for our country's sake, for all our sakes. The time to settle the question is now.

The British Audit  Office may have indeed concluded that the Pergau Dam would not  be an economic proposition and should not be built. But it is  for Malaysians to decide. Malaysia has brilliant think tanks,  an effective parliamentary opposition, and a highly vocal  environmental lobby. The British certainly don't have any  special wisdom that has missed all of them. Nor should British  papers assume that concessionary loan arrangements in return for  purchase of warplanes and contracts for major development  projects are unusual. If such linkages are prohibited in  Britain, that is for the British Government to answer. It has  nothing to do with Malaysia. And there is simply no link  between these deals and the BMF [Bumiputera Finance] affair. In  fact, it says something about the British press that it has only  now discovered that scandal. Carrian [company] collapsed a  decade ago. All the BMF offences were committed in colonial  Hongkong. Most of the people involved remain in the British  colony's jurisdiction. London has seen it fit to grant Lorraine  Osman [former BMF official] residence in Britain after he served  a short sentence in a plea bargain deal. British newspapers  could still demand an accounting, if they are so inclined.  Britain could set up a full inquiry into the affair and  override colonial inhibitions. Instead, British papers dredge up  some old BMF stories and link it tenuously to the Pergau Dam  payments.    Truth to tell, the British newspapers have their own  political agenda: they want to bring down John Major and the  Tory government. The editors feel that the Conservatives have  been in power too long. Some of them also feel that Major's  government has been dishonest in telling them Britain would  never deal with terrorists while holding secret negotiations  with the Irish Republican Army. Mr. Major's Back-To-Basics  policy has also gone seriously awry. It was meant to distract  attention away from high unemployment and other economic woes.  The Tory right wanted to use it to punish single mothers and  others living off social welfare. Unfortunately, the British  press decided that Tory politicians should be held to the same  moral standards that they prescribe for others. The result was a  series of embarrassing disclosures for Mr. Major. The Pergau  Dam and the arms deal has become yet another bludgeon against  Mr. Major.    None of this would have bothered Malaysia except that in the  process the British papers began to attack Mahathir Mohamed  personally, without a shred of evidence. It was too much. But  a shutout of British firms from future government contracts is a  very blunt instrument of retaliation indeed. It punishes the  wrong people. More importantly, it dilutes the principles of  free trade and competition. On his part, Mr. Major should help  to limit the damage to British industry. Of course, he has no  control over the British press. He should, however, officially  disassociate his government from these scurrilous reports. It  may only be a simple symbolic act but it might help to break thc  impasse.     "

The prime minister opted Britain out of EU [European Union]  decision-making on social matters like workers' rights.    But Greek Social Affairs Minister Vangelis Giannopoulos  [name  as received] has told British socialist Euro MPs that he would  be pressing for decisions by the other 11 member states if  necessary.    The other states have been reluctant to invoke a social  policy without Britain, on the grounds that it would lead to a  damaging rift within the Community.    But Mr. Giannopoulos, who will be chairing EU meetings on  social issues for the next six months while Greece holds the EU  Presidency, said: ""It is difficult to move away from the system  of unanimity. But I will bring these things forward and get a  decision even if that means just 11.""    He told Euro-socialists in Athens: ""I hope I will be  successful. Perhaps the British Labour Party will come into  government and Britain will rejoin the ranks.""    Labour Euro MP David Martin said: ""The Major government has  blocked and frustrated attempts to create a genuine European  social policy.    ""It is time for the other 11 governments to say loud and  clear that they will no longer tolerate the UK preventing the  Community from making progress on rights of temporary and  part-time workers, protection of young workers, fair pay and  parental leave.""

0,FT923-1238 ,"FT923-1238 _AN-CIXB5ABYFT 920924   FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A time for leadership   UNSURPRISINGLY, in the light of the events of the past eight days, the prime minister has lost much of his authority. His credibility is near to zero. He put his shirt on Britain's permanent adherence to a particular parity with the D-Mark, and lost. He staked his good name on steadfast adherence to the Maastricht treaty, and saw his stake swept away. He gambled on a carefully nurtured friendship with the German chancellor, and was disillusioned. Now it is asked of Mr John Major that he rise above these disappointments. It is a great deal to expect of any individual. The debate in the House of Commons this afternoon is ostensibly about the future of Britain and Europe, but there is a possibility that it will degenerate into a slanging match about the fitness for office of the prime minister and his party. Labour will have to show self-restraint if it is not to initiate such a contest. It is, however, open to Mr Major to set the tone for a serious assessment at a time of genuine national concern. To achieve this, he must indicate that he is no longer befuddled by the hour-to-hour tactics that have characterised so much of what the government has done over the past week. What is not required is a rehearsal of the by now familiar catalogue of explanations and excuses for the devaluation of the pound. It would be particularly destructive to add to the heaped-up pile of doubts about the position of Britain within any exchange rate mechanism, however strengthened, or any version of the Maastricht treaty, however revised. A U-turn switching the Conservative party away from being the 'party of Europe' towards the narrow nationalism that so ill-fitted Labour before 1983 would be a humiliation for the Tories and a disaster for Britain. Much will depend upon nuance. The existing Maastricht treaty has no future, but the process of amending it can be either constructive or destructive. Britain should be a friendly participant in the discussions among the 12. It is one thing to wait a few weeks for the Danes to declare their hand; it is quite another to indicate that Britain will not attempt to ratify Maastricht-as-amended until a second Danish referendum has come back with a positive vote. It makes sense to link the ERM and Maastricht, but it is perfidious to suggest that assent to the latter can only follow the elimination of the 'fault lines' in the former. Much more will depend upon tone. 'Overall,' Mr Major might say, as he did on September 7, 'the treaty is good for Britain and good for Europe.' He could add that 'what lies at the heart of the community . . . is the notion that by binding together the nations of Europe in a common economic framework it would be possible to build an inextricable network of shared interests that would render war between former enemies impossible.' This would be better than chants about the franc's current difficulties. It would challenge Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to live up to his solidly pro-European stance. It would not create hostages to fortune against the day when Britain once again participates wholeheartedly in European affairs. Such a speech would begin the process of rehabilitation of the prime minister. Anything less would not.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "
0,FT941-3579 ,"FT941-3579 _AN-ECODSAHRFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (26): How the others do it - Business cultures      By LINDA BILMES   The Seven Cultures of Capitalism by Charles Hampden-Turner and Alfons Trompenaars Doubleday, New York, Dollars 25 404 pages This new study offers insight into how different business cultures and value systems influence behaviour and success in the commercial worlds of seven countries. It stems from a questionnaire given to 15,000 managers from the US, UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Japan between 1986 and 1993. The framework used to compare their values and business cultures is a set of seven 'valuing processes' that come into play when a society chooses how to create wealth. The first valuing process is 'making rules and discovering exceptions'. Each country, and each organisation within it, must set generalised rules, procedures and routines, while at the same time making special exceptions to those rules. The other six cover the extent to which a culture analyses or integrates; relies on the individual (vs. the community); feels in control of its fate (vs. control by external forces); does things in sequence (vs. in synchronisation); expects status to be achieved (vs. ascribed); and desires equality (vs. hierarchy). Many of the responses are illuminating. For example: should a poorly-performing subordinate, who you know has trouble at home, expect your protection against others in the department? Most American managers (95 per cent) said the subordinate had no right to protection. Attitudes were similar in Germany (94 per cent), Sweden (91) and Britain (84). By contrast, only 56 per cent of Japanese and 43 per cent of French managers agreed with this view. The book devotes three chapters each to the US and Japan, and some of the most interesting material concerns the differences in the way they approach almost every dimension of business. The analysis explains why the two countries have found their trade negotiations so difficult. The authors explain the more subtle reasons why things go wrong. The American preference for analysis leads them to seek clarification of the details first. After all, reason Americans, if the numbers don't add up, there is no point in going to a lot of trouble to develop a relationship. The Japanese, on the other hand, prefer 'integrating', which makes them approach a situation cautiously. They need to sense whether a harmonious working relationship is possible, and whether the potential partners are trustworthy, before they bother with the numbers. The Japanese manager feels he can deal with the details further down the road if the relationship has potential to succeed. The chapters on Germany, France, Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands each show a depth of understanding that is rare in the comparative genre. The authors explain why the US, with its universalist, individualistic, analytical, egalitarian mindset, has been so successful at producing products with universal appeal - such as McDonalds, Levis and Coca-Cola. These values, however, also handicap the US in important ways. They stifle creativity and discourage managers from relying on mentors or caring for employees. They encourage high executive turnover, reducing the incentive to train anyone. They foster hostile takeovers and an over-reliance on profitability as a yardstick of success. The chapter on Britain offers a rich and complex explanation of why its industry is in decline. One of the main culprits, say the authors, is that Britain has been unable to resolve the seven value dilemmas. 'Wealth-creation is a function of the resolution of dilemmas facing a national economy.' The problem with Britain is that it has a love affair with words. It enjoys intelligent discourse, oratory, rhetoric - anything other than solving the dilemmas. The authors recite the familiar list of British inventions lost, sold, or given away (the jet engine, steam turbine, penicillin, the computer, the hovercraft) due to a lack of interest in the squalid business of exploiting their commercial value.

0,FT923-6831 ,"FT923-6831 _AN-CHYAUADDFT 920821   FT  21 AUG 92 / French fighters to help US and Britain police Iraq      By ALICE RAWSTHORN, ROGER MATTHEWS and Agencies      PARIS, WASHINGTON   FRANCE announced yesterday it would contribute about 10 fighter aircraft to help police the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq which British and US officials say will be proclaimed in the next few days. As western officials worked out details of the 'no fly zone', the Baghdad regime declared it would resist the plan 'with all means'. Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, said his country was ready to send to the Gulf about 10 Mirage 2000 fighters, the same type of aircraft that participated in the Gulf war. France already has eight Mirage fighters based in Turkey to enforce an air exclusion zone in northern Iraq to protect Kurds from attack by Iraqi forces. Britain agreed on Tuesday to send six Tornado aircraft to the Gulf to help enforce a security zone in the south to stop Iraqi aircraft from attacking Shia Moslems in the region. The US already has more than 200 combat, reconnaissance and control aircraft in the Gulf area and the Pentagon says there are no plans to send extra aircraft. Britain and the US have denied there is any rift between the allies about the 'no fly zone'. General Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, said the principle of the zone, designed to prevent Baghdad's forces striking the Shia population south of the 32nd parallel, had been fully agreed. Only the details - 'such as who does what, when' - remained to be sorted out, Gen Scowcroft said. US defence officials said the chances of a military confrontation would depend partly on how tough a 'no fly zone' was imposed in southern Iraq. 'Is it going to be really stringent: 'you fly one inch in and we're going to nail you' - or . . . 'we won't attack you unless you attack the Shia'?' one official said. US officials said the three allied governments agreed that their planned action was fully covered by UN resolution 688 and that there was no requirement to return to the Security Council for an additional mandate. Gen Scowcroft claimed there was increasing evidence that President Saddam Hussein was pursuing genocidal policies in southern Iraq. Iraq's defiant response to the western allies' plan came after a meeting of military and political leaders presided over by President Saddam.

The new accusations, made in an interview with BBC World  Service Wednesday night, follows comments from Foreign Office  Minister Douglas Hogg, falsely describing Iran as a ""factor of  instability in the region"" during a visit to Qatar.    Both remarks are uncharacteristic of the norms of diplomatic  protocol that supposed to be based upon mutual respect and are  seen jeopardizing the already strained relations between the two  countries after the reciprocal expulsion of senior diplomats.    In his interview, Hurd claimed that the expulsions, started  by Britain last Thursday, were ""not a game,"" but believed that  it was up to Iran, and not Britain, to ensure that the  tit-for-tat exchanges did not continue.    The sting in his remarks was in resorting to old allegations  about Iran's ""supposed involvement in terrorism"", which have not  been heard from a British minister since Tehran severed  relations with London in 1989.    The foreign secretary cited the Rushdie affair and  orchestrated smears about Iran's links with the IRA to maintain  that it was Tehran, and not London, that should change its  behavior before there could be ""decent relations"" between the  two countries.    But he made no mention of the `forged documents' issued  earlier in the day by the Foreign Office that apparently  hoodwinked no one into believing its claim of Iran's involvement  in discrediting Britain's already discredited policy in Bosnia.    The documents disclosed are two among many floating around  over the past year and are so ludicrously written that it is an  insult to even the most illiterate to suggest they were produced  by ""Iran's intelligence service"", as claimed by the Foreign  Office.    Even more incredible were the conflicting statements put out  by the Foreign Office, which came after maintaining last week  that its excuse for expelling an Iranian first secretary would  remain confidential because of its apparent childish nature.    Hurd's tact in his interview was to claim that it was now  impossible to go on ""excusing inexcusable behavior."" But behind  his words, the question left open as to who was trying to  convince whom about who in stooping so low to worsen the  diplomatic row.    The sudden change of events in Britain's relations with Iran  can be traced to the U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to London on April 25, when he was reported  to have asked for further UK support in Washington's campaign to  isolate Iran.    With Hurd due to meet Christopher in Oxford this Saturday,  it  is presumed that he can be briefed about subsequent campaign  that was launched with the smears about the IRA [Irish  Republican Army] links only four days after his visit.    But still left to be answered by the British Government is  the earlier embarrassing discovery of an intelligence service  bug in the Iranian Embassy, which the succession of UK insults  have been trying to camouflage.    Indications are that Britain's increasingly erratic and  often  eccentric foreign policy is the result of a power-struggle,  where hardline anti-Iran opinion currently has the upperhand to  produce unpalatable behavior reminiscent of its colonial past.

His uncompromising rejection on the first day of the Tory conference of any further moves towards European integration was instantly dismissed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as 'completely out of date'. But, with some on the Euro-sceptic wing of the party backing Mr Lamont's stance, his speech signalled the potential for the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of EU integration to spark a renewed Tory civil war. Mr Lamont accused Mr John Major of 'wishful thinking' in judging that Britain's partners would not press ahead with a single currency and dismissed as 'simplistic' the prime minister's assertion that leaving Europe was 'unthinkable'. There was not a 'shred of evidence' that any of the 11 other governments shared Britain's view of the EU's future. Earlier Mr Hurd had anticipated the intervention by warning the conference to ignore the Eurosceptics. 'There will always be siren sounds suggesting we can just turn our backs on the awfulness of Europe,' he said. Insisting that the federalist ambitions of Britain's partners had been severely curbed by the experience of the Maastricht Treaty, Mr Hurd said: ' We must resist that temptation. Our interest lies in steering Europe our way, rather than pretending we belong to another continent.' Amid criticism from the pro-European wing of the party, other cabinet ministers were less diplomatic. Privately they accused Mr Lamont of being driven by a desire to exact revenge on Mr Major for his dismissal from the Treasury. But Mr Lamont, whose Euro-sceptic credentials pre-date his departure from the government last year, articulated the views of a small but powerful minority within the party at Westminster. Some ministers - including in the cabinet Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood - are understood to believe that Britain should not accept any further integration at the 1996 conference. Speaking at a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon Group, Mr Lamont stressed he was not advocating immediate withdrawal from the EU. But he said: 'Britain is on a collision course with its partners unless we find a means of resolving the different aspirations.' He suggested that Britain should accept no further moves towards a federal Europe and opt for membership of the European Economic Area rather than the Union or an outer tier of EU membership.

The delay was 'very worrying' said Mrs Elizabeth Guigou, the European affairs minister. It risked undermining 'indispensable dynamism' in the whole process of ratifying the treaty on monetary and political union in Britain and Denmark, said Mr Daniel Bernard, foreign ministry spokesman. 'A more rapid British ratification would without doubt create a happy dynamic to help the Danes ratify,' he said. The foreign ministry accepted that Britain was entitled to some flexibility on the timing of Maastricht ratification, but officials were privately annoyed that Mr Major appeared to have withdrawn an assurance to President Francois Mitterrand that the Maastricht bill would pass through parliament by early next year. Britain's delay is doubly irritating to Mr Mitterrand, for whom European construction has been a constant priority. He took the biggest political risk of his career by putting the ratification of Maastricht to a referendum in September, in which victory was slim enough to inflict further damage on an already weak and divided ruling Socialist party. Another dose of suspense over the future of the treaty will hardly please the French president and could well provide fresh ammunition for opponents of Maastricht in the finely balanced French electorate.

But, argues producer and director Ismail Merchant, we may only have ourselves to blame      By ISMAIL MERCHANT   Barely a week passes without another lamentation: the British film industry, according to hand-wringing obituarists, is mouldering in the grave. Yet each year Britain manages to produce at least two or three films that shatter box office records on both sides of the Atlantic. Merchant Ivory did it with A Room With A View and Howards End. Last year it was The Crying Game and The Remains of the Day, and now it is Four Weddings and A Funeral. Each year a steady stream of British films like Shadowlands, In The Name of the Father and Much Ado About Nothing achieve critical acclaim and commercial success. All these films compete triumphantly, both at the box office and at awards, with the best in the world. This does not seem to indicate even a symptom of ill health let alone death. And how could it be otherwise when British cinema can draw from the best writers, the richest source material, the finest actors and excellent technicians? In addition, it has an enormous advantage over its European neighbours in sharing a common language and culture with the United States, so British films are immediately accessible to one of the largest movie audiences in the world. The morticians of the industry complain that there is no money for films here. As a producer who has spent most of his life parting financiers from their money I believe I am qualified to state with some authority that there is money here. You have to go and get it, and it isn't always easy - but it is there. Despite all the recent vicissitudes London is still a major financial and commercial centre; it is also recognised worldwide for its pre-eminence in the performing arts. It shouldn't take a great leap of the imagination to connect the two and develop the possibilities. I have managed to fund not only British productions, but also Indian and American productions with City money. You have to work at it, but it can be done. Film-makers in this country accuse the government of not adequately supporting and funding the film industry. Of course the government should provide incentives and subsidies, but it doesn't. So why does the industry look to a weak and ineffectual government for help when it has been made clear that the arts are not a priority and barely even on the agenda? The energy that goes into lobbying the government for greater state intervention is wasted, and could be channelled more productively into making movies. Film-makers must take responsibility for their industry, and become more aggressive in fighting for their films. What has died in Britain is not the film industry, nor indeed any section of the arts, which are demonstrably alive and flourishing, but rather the indomitable spirit that once characterised this nation: the enteprising spirit that established empires, the unyielding spirit that stoically endured the hardships of war without a whimper of self-pity. The passive, negative attitudes that are prevalent now, the constant moan of complaint, are not just tiresome but a tragedy for this country. Since I first came here some thirty years ago I have noticed, particularly in the past decade, a gradual deadening of the spirit of the country. Goals, ideologies and even thought seem to have died. It is as if a shroud has descended on this island and everyone is resigned to living in this cocoon instead of ripping it apart and letting the sunlight in. Even as Britain has united with Europe it seems to be isolating itself from its partners. When I work here I can tolerate the climate, the skittish fluctuations of the economy, the food, and even the ridiculous rigidity of shopkeepers who smugly slam their doors in your face punctually at closing time even if you are waving a fistful of money at them; I can deal with any crisis and calamity, but I'm becoming less tolerant of the pessimism and bleakness of spirit that has permeated every aspect of life here. Yet people still gravitate to Britain from every corner of the world seeking a better life. If so many foreigners can see how much Britain still has to offer why are the British so blinkered? When you start to believe that your country is second rate, you are only a step away from creating a second rate country. Equally damaging is Britain's capacity for disparaging her own achievements. When we made A Room With A View in 1986 everyone was delighted with the extraordinary success of the film. By the time we made Howards End six years later, critics were picking holes in Forster's work and questioning why we even bothered to film his novels. But those two films, together with our production of Maurice and David Lean's A Passage to India, brought 28 Academy Award nominations, 10 Oscars and a heap of other awards, as well as considerable revenue and kudos to Britain. No author in the history of cinema can claim as much. Anywhere else Forster would be celebrated as a national hero, a public holiday would be declared on his birthday and streets would be named after him. But in Britain his reward is to be picked over by soi disant intellectuals. The British film industry should applaud its achievements and build on them. British cinema has the talent and the ability, but it needs to rediscover its spirit. The grave diggers should put their shovels away before the death of the British film industry becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The drugs, hidden in lead ingots, were brought into Britain  in cargo ships from Venezuela by a front company, which,  according to lawyers and customs officers, was financed by the  CIA, the American intelligence service.    CIA and British police officers who monitored the shipments  allowed the drugs in because they hoped to gain valuable  intelligence on senior figures in the Colombian cartel. However,  they failed to tell British Customs and the undercover operation  was ruined when their key informant was arrested by customs  investigators, who seized 900 kilograms of cocaine with a street  value of 200m.    The case raises serious doubts about a policy that appeared  to allow criminals to profit from drug smuggling in pursuit of  more important targets. It has since emerged that at the same  time, the CIA in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, allowed more than  900 kilograms of cocaine into the United States in a similar  operation, now the subject of a US Justice Department inquiry.    Details of the role of the drugs enforcement agencies in the  cocaine shipments emerged during a 40m trial at Newcastle  crown court, which ended last Thursday when Joseph Kassar, a  Manchester businessman, was jailed for 24 years for trafficking.    Kassar was the only one of nine original defendants to be  convicted for importing cocaine from Venezuela via Felixstowe  docks in January 1992. One died in prison, four were acquitted,  two face a retrial and another, Brian Charrington, had no  evidence brought against him.    Much of the trial collapsed after it emerged that  Charrington, a Middlesbrough garage owner, was an informant for  the police number two regional crime squad based in Cleveland.  Lawyers for the other defendants want an inquiry into the case.  Kassar's solicitor, Keith Dyson, said: ""The involvement of the  number two regional crime squad and its relationship with Brian  Charrington and his role as an informant who was allowed to  profit from the crime must be the subject of a major  investigation.""    Customs investigators had decided in 1989 to target  Charrington, 37, who was already suspected of importing large  quantities of cannabis into Britain from Amsterdam and Morocco.  He had become increasingly wealthy, running a Bentley, a  Rolls-Royce, two private jets and a deep-sea diving boat while  selling second-hand cars from a forecourt in Middlesbrough.    Undercover customs officers involved in Operation Fullbloom  followed Charrington and his associates around Europe and to  Caracas, where he was watched entering the offices of Conar  Corporation, a small shipping agency.    The company sent several shipments of cocaine to Britain and  other parts of Europe which Customs failed to find. In January  1992, a 900-kilogram consignment of cocaine was found hidden in  lead aboard a ship, the MV Adviser, which had sailed from  Caracas to Felixstowe.    The drugs were removed and the lead allowed to travel into  Britain to lure out the British gang members. In March 1992, 11  men were arrested. Charrington was taken into custody in June  when he returned in his private jet to Teesside airport from a  trip to France.    During seven months in jail before his trial, Charrington  refused to talk to investigators about his role in the cocaine  smuggling. He also declined to comment on almost 2.5m in  banknotes discovered in the loft of his Teesside home. These had  traces of cocaine, cannabis and heroin on them.    According to senior customs investigators, there was no  evidence of police involvement on computer records held, by the  National Drugs Information Unit.    But in November 1992 investigators realised their hopes of  nailing the man known as Target One were about to sink. Two  officers of the number two regional crime squad drugs  wing--Detective Inspector Harry Knaggs, now retired, and  Detective Sgt Ian Weedon--said they would give evidence that  Charrington was a long-term informant.    In January 1993, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was  offering no evidence against Charrington and he was freed. After  celebrating his release, he disappeared. He is believed to be in  the Far East.    Police and Customs blamed each other for the debacle, but  there were further damaging disclosures about the extent of  trafficking taking place with full police knowledge. Tim Devlin,  Conservative MP for Stockton South and parliamentary private  secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, revealed  details of six other consignments of cocaine due into Britain,  taking the street value up to 1 billion.    Devlin said Charrington had been one of Britain's best drugs  informants and could have closed down half the Colombian  cartels. He said the authorities had intended to collapse the  case against Charrington to provide him with further cover.    ""The whole thing is a monumental cock-up,"" Devlin said. ""It  has all been screwed up because the jolly old Customs think they  are cleverer than anyone else.""     "

Mr John Major's decision to resort to a confidence motion today to try to rescue the government from its crisis was scornfully derided by Mr John Smith, Labour leader. To cheers from packed Labour benches Mr Smith scoffed that the prime minister had been driven to use the confidence factor because 'he cannot win a vote on anything else'. He announced that Labour would table an amendment to the motion to give the House the opportunity to 'vote positively' for the social chapter. Further cheers rang across the opposition benches when Sir Russell Johnston, for the Liberal Democrats, attacked the government for doing a deal with the Ulster Unionists to avoid defeat on the Labour amendment backing the chapter. He said ministers had been willing to 'strengthen sectarian politics in Northern Ireland' to deny workers their rights throughout the UK. Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) urged Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, to consider whether,in light of the government's failure to secure a majority, it would be acting contrary to the Bill of Rights if it were to use the royal prerogative to ratify the Maastricht treaty. He claimed that there was no provision in the European Communities (Amendment) Act - the official title of the Maastricht bill - enabling the House to reverse an earlier decision. Earlier, Mr Smith had warned Mr Major that if he sought to defy the will of the house over Maastricht he would have 'exceeded the power of his office'. Calling on MPs to support the social provisions of the treaty, Mr Smith claimed that the debate was more about the 'tattered reputation of a discredited prime minister' than the national interest. This theme was taken up by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who told Mr Major that if the vote went against the government 'we expect him to obey it'. To Labour cheers Mr Smith insisted that Britain had no future as the 'sweatshop of Europe', and forecast accelerating economic decline if the policies of social devaluation which lay behind the attempt to opt out from the social chapter continued. Mr Smith said Britain was alone among the 12 member states of the European Community in opposing a modest extension of its competence to such matters as the protection of health and safety of people at work. He accused the prime minister of increasingly inhabiting a 'Walter Mitty world' in which he alone suffered from the delusion that getting Britain excluded from a decision-making process of considerable consequence constituted a triumph.

Dunn, a member of the Executive Council, which advises Hong Kong's governor,  called on Britain to fulfill a ""moral obligation and a constitutional  responsibility"" to the people of Hong Kong. She said confidence in the  territory was severely hurt by the bloody suppression of China's pro-democracy  movement.    Dunn and senior legislator Allen Lee leave for London next Monday to lobby  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of Parliament for what they call  an ""insurance policy"" for the 3.25 million British subjects here.    She said there would not be a mass exodus of Hong Kong people to Britain.    ""We know that Hong Kong people do not want to leave Hong Kong. Hong Kong is our  home,"" she said.    Special British passports available to 3.25 million people in Hong Kong do not  entitle the holders to live in Britain.

0,FT932-2810 ,"FT932-2810 _AN-DFQCFACRFT 930617   FT  17 JUN 93 / Political Notebook: On the European sideline      By PHILIP STEPHENS   THERE have been two unaccustomed reminders this week that Mr John Major's government can now lay claim to the occasional political strength among its all-too-manifest weaknesses. They came from Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Douglas Hurd. On Tuesday Mr Clarke offered few insights into how the substance - as distinct from the rhetoric - of his chancellorship will differ from that of his predecessor. Even for a government so familiar with policy U-turns, the constraints imposed by Britain's budget and trade deficits and by the gloomy world outlook do not allow for radical policy shifts. Over time, Mr Clarke's priorities may well turn out to be distinctly different from those of Mr Norman Lamont. But in the short term the policy changes will be at the margin. His typically unconventional performance was important nonetheless. In casting himself as a character in a DH Lawrence novel, Mr Clarke sent an important message to the government's disgruntled supporters. After a long excursion into theoretical debates about the relative worth of monetary or exchange rate targets, economic policymaking is to re-enter the real world of jobs and living standards. Reassurance of a different kind came from Mr Hurd. The easy elegance of the foreign secretary stands in stark contrast to the rough-edged populism of the chancellor. But there is a common denominator - instinctive political skill. So, after the ravages of Maastricht, Mr Hurd yesterday had soothing words for MPs on the European Community's agenda for next week's Copenhagen summit and beyond. His message was straightforward. Britain is not alone in suffering from post-Maastricht depression. Anyone who has followed the pronouncements in recent weeks of Chancellor Helmut Kohl or those of the new French administration of Mr Edouard Balladur will understand that. Belgium, which assumes the EC presidency next month, will continue to fight the cause of federalism. It will do as much as it can to hold up the enlargement of the Community to include Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. So will some others. They might even manage the odd 'Britain isolated' headline with a rhetorical ambush at the autumn summit planned to salute Maastricht's ratification. But the political realities in Germany - Chancellor Kohl has one or two domestic problems on his mind - and the Gaullist instincts of the new French government had undercut decisively the integrationist reflex of the 1980s. The economic impact of recession meanwhile had reduced to wishful thinking the timetable for monetary union. Britain's agenda - enlargement, subsidiarity (now a respectable word in continental Europe) and intergovernmental co-operation - was now making the running. It all sounded pretty convincing, even if Mr Hurd still shares the incurable weakness of most at Westminster in underestimating the capacity of the Franco-German axis to make trouble for Britain. His skilful presentation to the foreign affairs committee also reinforced the essential political point. For the last several years British domestic politics has been dominated by two issues - the economy and Europe. They are now being handled by the two most powerful members of the cabinet. Mr Hurd and Mr Clarke also happen to share the same view of the world (the latter ran the former's campaign for the party's leadership). Who better to apply the patches necessary to hold together a bitterly divided party? But like Mr Clarke, Mr Hurd is offering short-term respite rather than medium-term strategies. By changing the rhetoric the chancellor has bought himself time to consider options while economic recovery takes hold. Similarly, the foreign secretary is cleverly exploiting post-Maastricht exhaustion across Europe to sustain the impression that Britain can shape its future. For all the talk, though, of setting the agenda, there is a growing realisation at Westminster that the government has opted for what used to be called the European slow lane. It has said the pound will stay outside the exchange rate mechanism at least until 1996. In a few unscripted remarks in the Commons last week Mr Major undercut the purpose of the Maastricht opt-out on EMU by indicating that, whatever others decide, sterling will never be part of a single currency. Britain is outside the Schengen group of France, Germany and the Benelux countries. The government is defending stridently its social chapter opt-out. All this makes for relative tranquility on the Tory backbenches. But however eloquent the exposition, Mr Hurd will find it hard to sell as a strategy which keeps Britain at the 'heart' of Europe.

0,FT931-1901 ,"FT931-1901 _AN-DCXAWAE2FT 930323   FT  23 MAR 93 / Debt deal likely to be at core of aid for Russia: Clinton aims to outline proposed G7 package at Vancouver summit meeting with Yeltsin      By Our Foreign Staff   A DEBT rescheduling deal worth about Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) is likely to be the main plank of an aid programme for Russia to be discussed by the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries. President Bill Clinton aims to announce the broad lines of the aid plan at his summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3-4. It will then be discussed at an emergency meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers expected to be held later in April before being finalised at the July G7 summit in Tokyo. Western efforts to complete an aid package have if anything been speeded by Mr Yeltsin's announcement on Saturday that he would rule by decree until a referendum on April 25. Japanese officials involved in preparing the ministerial meeting say a multilateral aid programme for Russia for this year is almost certain to reach more than Dollars 30bn and may be as high as Dollars 40bn. The package is expected to include debt rescheduling likely to rise more than sevenfold from the Dollars 2.5bn deferral agreed last year (although Russia had much greater de facto debt relief in 1992 as a result of failure to keep up with service payments). It may also contain funds for monetary stabilisation and special assistance for small business and the energy sector. However, Japanese officials say there are unlikely to be more large pledges of bilateral aid at the April meeting, from Japan or any other country, given G7 fiscal and political problems. They say the package to be discussed at the April meeting is likely to include: Relief worth about Dollars 16bn from the interest and principal on the Dollars 80bn foreign debt which Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. Aid worth about Dollars 12bn. This would be a continuation of the G7 Dollars 24bn programme agreed last year, when only about Dollars 13.3bn was disbursed, mainly in bilateral credits. A monetary stabilisation fund worth about Dollars 3bn administered by the International Monetary Fund. Micro-economic measures which could provide proof of the value of western aid and economic reform. These include boosting investment in small and medium-sized businesses, developing the energy sector, decommissioning nuclear power plants and converting military factories to civilian production. Western countries continued yesterday to support Mr Yeltsin in his confrontation with the Russian parliament. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, yesterday said: 'We are still standing behind Yeltsin. He is the best hope for reform in that country.' She added that President Clinton had no current plans to change the venue of his summit with Mr Yeltsin, but would consider moving the meeting to Moscow if the Russian leader suggested it. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, sent a strong personal message of support to Mr Yeltsin. He underlined that there was 'very wide support for the (Russian) reform process throughout this country and in Europe'. He added: 'I strongly support the emphasis you give in your address to controlling inflation, completing land reform and helping small and medium-sized businesses. These are all areas in which we and our partners have compared experience with you and have offered co-operation and assistance.' Britain is convinced assistance for Russia can be delivered most effectively at the micro-economic level, for example, by support for small businesses or financial services. Officials said Britain was not interested in grandiose schemes that would lead to money being poured down 'a bottomless pit'. Britain is therefore prepared to build on existing programmes such as the Pounds 100m know-how fund for the former Soviet republics; the 'chancellor's scheme', devised by Mr Norman Lamont, to place Russian personnel with companies in the UK financial sector and the various technical assistance schemes organised by the European Community in which the UK participates. Treasury officials said Britain supported a rescheduling of Russia's foreign debt on terms that were as liberal as possible. However, Britain is not one of Russia's biggest creditors and officials acknowledged that UK views might not be shared by other G7 countries, notably Germany. Officials from Russia's creditor governments are due to discuss its arrears at a meeting of the Paris Club this week. This may show how far Russia can look forward to an easing of its debt burden. Any Paris Club deal, however, is still held up by the failure of Russia and Ukraine to reach agreement on how to divide responsibility for the debt of the further Soviet Union. US officials yesterday urged Mr Victor Pynzenyk, Ukraine's economics minister, to settle this problem. At the big international financial institutions in Washington, Mr Yeltsin's move appears to have caused little immediate change in policy. The World Bank signed a new Dollars 90m loan agreement with Russia on Friday to help privatisation efforts, but the funds are not likely to be disbursed for several weeks in any case. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is still a long way from agreement with Russia on the kind of stabilisation programme that could lead to substantial financing under the Fund's normal terms. Both institutions have been asked by the G7 to work on a list of 'deliverable and visible initiatives' to clear the way for concrete international aid to Russia. The Bank has been asked to work particularly on efforts to restructure and privatise Russian companies and on a social safety net to ease the transition to a market economy. IMF staff are looking at ways of expanding the pool of money available to help Russia, such as the General Arrangements to Borrow, whereby the Fund raises money from 10 industrial countries. Meanwhile, some influential voices in Washington are urging the US administration to concentrate, until Russia's political future looks clearer, on humanitarian aid. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a leading advocate in Congress of aid for Russia, called for the US to focus on initiatives such as supplying disposable needles for an inoculation programme, or diverting money from the Nato infrastructure fund to help build housing for the armed forces that have had to be moved back to Russia from the other former Soviet republics and from former Soviet satellite states in eastern Europe.

0,FT924-9734 ,"FT924-9734 _AN-CKEBPACAFT 921104   FT  04 NOV 92 / Big UK companies back PM's stance      By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent   BRITAIN'S biggest companies yesterday gave near-unanimous backing to the government's pro-Maastricht stance and warned that the country faced continuing recession and deepening isolation if its political commitment to Europe faltered. More than 50 of the country's biggest corporations contacted by the Financial Times on the eve of the critical Commons debate said a No vote risked leaving Britain as a 'semi-detached' member of the Community, powerless to influence events. There is evident impatience at the uncertainty surrounding Britain's future role in Europe and a desire to see an end to a period of mounting confusion. Many companies voiced fears that Britain's ability to exploit fully the single market would be seriously undermined if it were not to ratify the treaty and that inward investment into Britain would be badly hit if the country appeared to be increasingly isolated within the EC. Though many companies want the government to clarify elements of the treaty, they believe its ratification remains an inevitable step in Europe's political and economic development. Most chief executives say that, whatever the doubts over Maastricht, the vote will send an important message to Britain's EC partners and that it must be positive. Britain's smallest companies appear most hesitant about the implications of integration. The Federation of Small Businesses said it supported a referendum on Maastricht, claiming the treaty offered 'threats and promises'. It feared the negative aspects would hit smaller companies. A more widespread view was put by Mr Barry Stephens, chairman and chief executive of Siebe, the engineering group, who said a No vote would seriously damage Britain's trading and manufacturing prospects. 'I believe the penalty will be profound - in one word isolation.' Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, said Britain had to demonstrate political commitment to reap the full advantages of the single market. 'Now is the time to move forward from a decade of half-hearted commitment to Europe to a real commitment.' Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury, the grocery group, said: 'We cannot keep pretending that we are half-in half-out. To be out would be disastrous but to be constantly debating whether we are in or not seems to me to be equally ludicrous.' Support for Major, Page 10  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

But Mr Reynolds' comment that written questions about the declaration from Sinn Fein were 'answerable' coincided with the murder by the IRA of another British soldier in a rocket attack on an army outpost in Armagh. Speaking in the US where he held unscheduled talks at the weekend with Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, Mr Reynolds, also indicated that Dublin and London would not wait indefinitely for a positive response from the Republican movement. Mr Reynolds, pictured above right with Mr Clinton during a ceremony in Indianapolis honouring Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr, told RTE radio: 'The questions by and large are answerable, and I hope that the British government will see them in that light, and will give the most positive response they can.' He added: 'I think the vast majority of people in Ireland - and Britain - want to see a breakthrough, and move this latest roadblock out of the way.' But in a speech in Chicago where he received an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, Mr Reynolds displayed his frustration at the IRA's refusal to end its campaign. Stressing the two governments' commitment to secure a new broad-ranging political accord to replace the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, Mr Reynolds said: 'The leaders of the Republican movement know that we still hope they will opt to play their part . . . They must also know, as Edmund Burke once put it, that there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue.' Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, signalled that the two governments were drafting plans for a comprehensive political settlement. British ministers said the questions submitted by Sinn Fein, passed to the London government by Dublin last week, would be published within the next few days. Alongside them would be the government's responses. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was determined that Britain would not be drawn into negotiations on the declaration unless and until the IRA ended permanently its campaign of violence. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, gave a clear hint during a weekend meeting of the areas in which the IRA was seeking clarification. These include the timescale in which Britain expected to see agreement between all the people of Ireland, the constitutional options it foresaw as realistic alternatives to the status quo and the basis for the 'Unionist veto' on change in the north.

0,FT933-13353 ,"FT933-13353 _AN-DGTCCACEFT 930720   FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems split over Maastricht strategy      By RALPH ATKINS   A DIVISION among Liberal Democrat MPs last night over tactics for Thursday's Maastricht debate offered the government a possible lifeline in its efforts to avoid a defeat at the hands of Euro-sceptic Tories. Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal Democrats' Europe spokesman, suggested his party's MPs might vote with the government to save the Maastricht treaty if Labour failed in its attempt to force Britain to accept the social chapter. A final decision by the 21 Liberal Democrat MPs will not be taken before tomorrow or possibly pending fresh legal advice on the implications of defeating the government. Sir Russell said, however: 'If the Labour amendment is defeated I think that the likelihood is that we will vote with the government - but it's not 100 per cent.' His comments were at odds with aides to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who said the party would vote against the government on both of Thursday's votes: the first on Labour's amendment backing the social chapter and the second on the government motion noting its opposition to the social chapter. The importance of the apparent rift is that Liberal Democrat support for the government on the second vote would force Tory Euro-sceptic MPs to concentrate on the first vote if they want to inflict a defeat on the government. They would have to vote for the social chapter rather than just against the government. The clash came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, again urged Unionist MPs to back the government, saying the province needed the social chapter 'like a hole in the head'. He is expected to meet Unionists on Thursday and appeared unwilling to rule out attempting to strike a deal. The three Democratic Unionist party MPs led by the Rev Ian Paisley announced they would vote against the government - except possibly if the government made a complete U-turn and abandoned the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. But the nine Ulster Unionist MPs will not decide how to vote until Thursday. They have not agreed tactics and although some want to back the Tory Euro-sceptics, others want to use the chance to force government concessions on Northern Ireland policy. Liberal Democrats want to put maximum pressure on the government to reverse Britain's social chapter opt-out but also do not want to wreck the treaty. Thus the party would be in a quandary if Labour's amendment were defeated. To then vote against the unamended government motion could mean no resolution being passed - possibly preventing ratification. Mr Ashdown wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday saying Liberal Democrats 'would use our votes in whatever way we felt would give Britain the best chance of being inside the social chapter'. He said that was the only way that Britain would be able to influence the development of the European social and employment policies.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Cisneros justified Argentina's policy of approach to the  Malvinas Islanders saying: ""The better the Malvinas Islanders  get along, the more they exploit their own resources, the  quicker they will realize that they can only do it with us.  They will realize they can grow economically and as a society  associating themselves with the only neighbor God gave them on  earth, that is, us.""    He flatly denied to Radio Continental that such approach  policy showed government ""weakness,"" adding that he is convinced  the policy ""will inevitably lead to a discussion of the  sovereignty issue in a nontraumatic way.""    Cisneros praised the Argentine Government decision to  propose  to the British Government the removal of the mine fields buried  on the islands during the 1982 war.    ""When offering to cooperate in the removal of the mines that  we planted we are not just fulfilling international norms that  almost no one else respects, but we are giving an example to the  world about the civilized behavior of a country that has been at  war with another but which does not want to kill civilians  unwillingly after the war ended,"" Cisneros said.    ""The work of removing mines is not easy, but neither is it  impossible,"" Cisneros said, adding that ""Argentine technology is  good to manufacture and to clean a mine field and we are well  prepared for the job.""    The official said: ""The lesson Argentina and Great Britain  are giving the world on the civilized way to proceed after a war  is exceptional.""    Cisneros said: ""Although international treaties mention it,  very few countries do what Great Britain is doing in the  Malvinas Islands; investigating their own alleged war crimes.""    Cisneros confirmed that U.S. President Bill Clinton is  intent  on organizing a summit with the presidents of all the Americas,  except Cuba and Haiti, adding that ""U.S. foreign policies during  the past five years have tended to include guidelines on the  entire region.""    ""They are integrating proposals that seek to create links  with the rest of the Americas to determine consistent policies  for the entire continent,"" Cisneros said, adding that  ""corruption and poverty are two issues that concern U.S. and  Argentine foreign policy the most.""    Regarding the negotiation between Argentina and the United  States for the purchase of Skyhawk planes equipped with state of  the art radar, Cisneros admitted that negotiations will remain  ""deadlocked"" until a new defense minister is designated in the  United States.    ""The issue will probably be delayed until the U.S.  Government  appoints a new defense minister, but Foreign Minister Guido Di  Tella and Defense Minister Oscar Camilion are quite optimistic  about obtaining a good result,"" the official said.    Regarding the free trade treaty (NAFTA) between the United  States, Mexico, and Canada became effective on 1 January,  Cisneros said we still do not know ""if the treaty will remain  with just those three countries or if it will incorporate"" other  nations in the continent.    Cisneros said that Argentina ""must now give priority to our  own economic regionalization process -- Mercosur [Common Market  of the South]"" -- which ""does not exclude NAFTA.""     "

[Yasin] Well, I'm happy about this, when the minister says  so, because this will stop any further deterioration of  relations between Sudan and Great Britain and everybody knows,  you know, the relationship is an old one and is a strong one.  We don't want the relationship to be affected by diplomats  being expelled here and there. It is a heritage and legacy of  long relationship, so I'm really happy that the gist of the  minister's speech will curb any further deterioration of  relations between my country and the United Kingdom.    [Snow] On the other hand, you must be unhappy that it needs  the expulsion of yourself and your British counterpart in the  first place.    [Yasin] Well I'm really sad for being expelled from the  United Kingdom because of the retaliation to what has been done  by my government, but it is known in international practice in a  situation like this, but I thought the British Government would  have thought otherwise by substituting Peter Streams with  somebody else.    [Snow] Let's get to the nub of this, because Peter Streams  is  accused of basically having hammered the human rights issue,  which very many people feel very strongly about. Not just  Britain but many other Western nations in particular, have  voiced their concerns, and surely that, at the end of it, has  made him an unpopular ambassador with you?    [Yasin] Well, in fact he was stressing human rights issues,  but he was very much exaggerating on issues which were only  based on heresay. You know, he doesn't have direct evidence to  condemn my government. He was just a good and observant  listener of people from the opposition and he was making  prejudgments in cases which could not be proved.    [Snow] Well, he was hardly a lone voice. The Amnesty  International has a list of cases of grave concern in Sudan and  of course the civil war itself is thrown up the most awful  realities of human rights abuse.    [Yasin] Well, I must tell you maybe some people are  exceeding  the polls here or there but it was under absolute control of my  government, and my government has opened the doors and all the  avenues for any person from outside to see for himself, and the  archbishop has been given the opportunity to see for himself the  tolerance and freedom for everybody to worship whatever religion  he chooses. The situation in Sudan is, we are not hiding  anything.    [Snow] Is there now a sense of regret that the Islamic  fundamentalism practices that the government indulged in up  until the last year or two have perhaps gone too far?    [Yasin] Well, I can't see any sort of fundamentalist  practices that would be reproached or blamed in Sudan; it is  just an allegation. Sudan is living in a very civilized  situation now. We are far better than any other country in the  continent of Africa or even the Middle East. If you can name  any country better than the Sudan now, I will admit to what you  have said.    [Snow] Ambassador, on that note, thank you very much.     "

Newspaper coverage of Britain's general election campaign has been scant, with Japanese-language editorial comment missing altogether. Even well-informed Japanese seem utterly relaxed about the possibility of a Labour victory. This is, at first glance, surprising. Japan had something of a love affair with Mrs Margaret Thatcher and on almost every front Britain is Japan's most important partner in Europe. Britain is a big recipient of Japanese direct investment, and under the Tories the two nations have seen eye-to-eye on a broad range of political and trade issues. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Japan has sought to promote a tri-polar view of the world  - with Japan, the US and Europe sharing leadership. 'This view is best understood by the British  - rather than by France or Germany,' says a Japanese foreign ministry official who was a student in Britain. If the relationship is so important to Japan, why is the prospect of a change in government not more worrying? The short answer is that Labour, from halfway round the globe, does not look so fearsome. Mr Taizo Nishimuro, general manager at electronics company Toshiba, says: 'As a company which has large investments in the UK, we feel that the basic attitude to Japanese investment will not change drastically, notwithstanding the election result.' This needs to be put into perspective. Japanese people in Britain under the Labour government of the late 1970s were appalled by what they saw - declining living standards, materials shortages, disruptive strikes. Mrs Thatcher remains something of a folk hero in Japan for having cured the British disease  - a reputation untarnished by the recession. Professor Hidekazu Kawai, a specialist on British politics at Gakushuin University, says: 'Most Japanese believe the British people are still enthusiastic supporters of Mrs Thatcher.' Yet even informed Japanese, who know that Mrs Thatcher has lost her political influence, believe much of her legacy  - the strengthening of market-based institutions, trimmed power of unions, the privatisations  - will survive intact, regardless of who wins the election. While the debates over taxation, economic policy, or social welfare are real enough, from a long distance they look like much huff and puff over small disagreements. It is a battle for the moderate middle ground and, to the Japanese at least, it is not  - as Mr Major tried to portray it  - a choice between socialism and the market. 'This is not a referendum on the Tories for their past 13 years in government,' says the foreign ministry official. It is rather a question of who best can run the government. This is not to say there are no doubts at all. The Japanese government has been genuinely impressed by Mr Major's confident performance in foreign affairs, particularly in regard to Europe. On the other hand, the foreign ministry official says: 'We do not know very much about Mr Kinnock.' Mr Taida Hidea, who managed the London operation of Marubeni, the trading company, from 1977 to 1983, and is now general manager of international corporate planning, says: 'I am just concerned, if Labour wins, that there not be a drastic change in economic policy.' This, he says, could potentially affect Japanese investment in Britain. Mr Nishimuro says Toshiba is confident it can retain good relations with the EETPU electricians' union at its factory in Plymouth regardless of any changes in government policy. His only concern is that the social welfare costs of operating in Britain do not rise steeply. However, he points out that this has nothing to do with Toshiba's Japanese ownership and he thinks it probably won't happen. If there is residual fear of a Labour government it is a fear of change, of the unknown, rather than objections to Labour or its policies. Labour has made successful efforts to win friends. The party has repeatedly assured Japanese diplomats that it would place a high priority on maintaining close relations with Japan and that there would be no change in policy. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, visited Tokyo in 1990 and made a broadly positive impression. Mr Taida, who met Mr Smith briefly at the time, says: 'I think we can believe him.' Underpinning all these views is a deep respect for, and even envy of, the British parliamentary system, where a change in governing party is seen as a healthy sign that democracy survives. In Japan  - where the Liberal Democratic Party has been in power since 1955 and opposition parties offer no credible alternative  - this seems inconceivable. Plainly, many Japanese people have accepted one of Labour's basic messages: that it is a credible candidate to govern Britain.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "
0,FT941-4767 ,"FT941-4767 _AN-ECJDQAATFT 940310   FT  10 MAR 94 / Voting row goes to heart of EU's fault lines: How a dispute among the 12 has put the prospects for the 16 in jeopardy      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   Britain and Spain will come under intense pressure from their European partners to settle the EU power-sharing dispute which threatens to prevent four new members - Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway - entering the Union. Britain in particular, has been identified as the villain in sabotaging prospects for the wider Europe it says it wants. Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, mainly blamed the UK when the enlargement negotiations broke up in rancour late Tuesday night, to resume in Brussels next Tuesday. London and Madrid, with lukewarm support from the Italians, insist on keeping the weighted voting rules of the 12 - where two large and one small countries combining 23 out of 76 votes can block measures - for a Union of 16. Their nine partners want to move the threshold to 27 out of 90 votes, keeping the same, roughly 30 per cent proportion for the 'blocking minority', after the four newcomers arrive. 'The Nine won't blink on the 27 votes,' Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister for Europe warned early yesterday. British officials maintain that only the Benelux countries and possibly France firmly oppose the UK and Spain, with a large pool in between for both sides to fish in before next Tuesday. The known evidence from what has nevertheless been a row behind closed doors suggests they are wrong. First, the power-sharing issue goes to the heart of the divisions in the Union which the Maastricht treaty failed to close: between North and South, between big and small member states, between the sovereignty-conscious who prefer inter-governmental co-operation, and federalists who want to tighten European integration and make decisions at EU level easier. But more immediately, countries like Germany and Holland - both with greater right to complain about under-representation in the Council than the UK or Spain - feel certain that the European Parliament will not ratify the accession treaty if EU law-making is made more difficult by a shrinking minority. Parliament formally has to decide whether to go ahead today. This might be stretched to next week. Much beyond that, however, and the January 1995 enlargement target could be lost, along with momentum in the applicant countries which still have to convince their voters to endorse entry. Although nobody disputes that the UK and Spain can block the decision, there is a growing feeling in Brussels that Britain has misread the situation - unless it is putting down markers now for the 1996 constitutional review to which the 12 heads of government (including Mr Major and Mr Felipe Gonzalez) in June 1992 remitted the votes issue. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has suggested moving to 27 votes for the moment, and for the 12 leaders to set up a committee to study vote distribution ahead of 1996, specifically taking into account British, Spanish, Italian, and also German concerns. This looks like the only sort of framework which can resolve the dispute and deliver a Europe of 16 next year - and the British and Spanish governments can expect to be told so in no uncertain terms in the few days left.

0,FT932-3676 ,"FT932-3676 _AN-DFMAUAD8FT 930612   FT  12 JUN 93 / As They Say In Europe: Please drive Caerphilly - James Morgan examines an attempt to measure quality of life in different parts of Europe      By JAMES MORGAN   A 'EUROPE of Regions' is one of those dreams that provides a useful standby for all kinds of commentators on the Community scene. The attractions of this dream derive from its evocation of cheery images of Burgundians and Bavarians exchanging tales of heroic drinking and cholesterol cuisine. The trouble is that some nations have regions and some do not as was amply demonstrated by this week's publication Regional Trends from Britain's Central Statistical Office. Britain contains four countries but no regions, merely what someone in Whitehall would probably call 'Areas of Administrative convenience'. Thus we English live in the east Midlands and the north west. The Dutch live entirely in such AACs, but they probably prefer it that way. The Portuguese, the Danes and the Irish have nothing but Portugal, Denmark and Ireland. The French have fabricated some nice bits of country but for the real thing you have to go to Italy and above all Germany. Their regions inspire the dullest mind - Lombardy and Rhineland-Palatinate, Abruzzi and Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania. There one hears the heartbeat of history; Yorkshire might achieve that, but in the hands of Whitehall it becomes Yorkshire and Humberside. If there is ever to be a Europe of regions, which are the most attractive? This is where Regional Trends might be expected to provide an answer. There is a general view in Britain that the place to live is anywhere but Britain, but international statisticians disagree. This was revealed to me while thumbing through a publication from the United Nations Development Programme last month which put Britain at number 11 in the world in terms of its quality of life. That was odd because it ranked 21 on the income scale; no other industrial nation was able to sustain such a high quality lifestyle on the basis of such relative poverty. Mind you, any survey which puts Japan at number one must arouse considerable suspicion. The niceness of Britain comes through in Regional Trends' European lifestyle comparisons. Again the Brits may not be the richest, but they are not that poor either. And they enjoy notable advantages: if you want to avoid being run over, Britain is plainly the place to be. Wales in fact has the lowest rate of road deaths of anywhere in the Community, which I find hard to credit. If you want to be hit by a car Paris, unsurprisingly, is your natural choice; it is three times more likely to happen there than in London. If one takes apparently similar regions there are more surprises in store. South east England and North Rhine-Westphalia have about the same population  -around 17m - in about the same area. Now if Regional Trends is right, the south east English enjoy the higher standard of living. On the basis of the purchasing power of their incomes they are 10 per cent better off than the Rhenish Westphalians. Their babies are more likely to be born healthy and each working person has fewer people to support. The Germans will suffer (inevitably) far more car crashes, and will be nearly twice as likely to be working in factories (those nasty, noisy places), something the English gave up years ago. But North Rhiners and Westphalians are not as likely to be out of work, not yet anyway. The regions of Europe of which people dream are probably Provence, Tuscany and the south of Spain. Well, the last of these is all right, judging by the figures, but on no account look for work there for it has the worst unemployment rate in the Community. Provence and central Italy are so favoured as retirement locations that scarcely anybody but the over-65s seems to live there. But all these Latin idylls suffer the disadvantage on which Regional Trends puts such insistent emphasis - danger on the roads. Even by local standards they seem unusually well stocked with wrecks and corpses. One is left wondering if the compilers of this fascinating volume deliberately selected their international comparisons to create that image of a 'nation at ease with itself' of which the prime minister, John Major, spoke once, and only once. Come to Britain, enjoy its active, youthful population, its fine babies and careful drivers. But a Europe of regions is not to be fashioned from the demographer's computer. At least not according to those Arcadians whose columns decorate the more conservative weekly journals in Britain. Their vision has no time for comparative unemployment figures, but emphasises the qualities of local alcoholic beverages, specialites du pays, and vernacular architecture. The curiosity is that this dream is so widespread among anti-Maastricht nationalists who live in a country which has virtually eliminated the possibility of achieving the regional vision. If you really care about creating a healthy regionalism you should probably be a Euro-federalist. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.

0,FT934-8664 ,"FT934-8664 _AN-DKOCBAE0FT 931113   FT  13 NOV 93 / Tory and CBI clash over Europe grows      By ROLAND RUDD and TONY JACKSON   THE GOVERNMENT was on the defensive yesterday over its European policy after Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, warned it not to close off the option of a single currency. Mr John Major insisted that Britain was not 'remotely ready' for a single currency. The prime minister added that he believed businesspeople were 'very much behind the government's approach'. Speaking on a visit to Ealing, west London, the prime minister claimed that Mr Davies's views on Europe had been misrepresented in an inter-view published in The Guardian newspaper on Thursday. Mr Major, pressed for his view on a single currency, said it 'certainly isn't going to happen in this decade'. In an interview with BBC radio yesterday, Mr Davies appeared to broaden his attack. He said: 'What we are slightly concerned about is a feeling that the government is prepared to dismiss the prospect of a single currency in the longer run, or exchange-rate stability, which we think are, in the long-term, of interest to the business community. The arguments which brought us into the ERM in the first place still have some force. 'What I think concerns us is that the government's rhetoric on EMU has become very negative indeed. We would like to stop that getting too far.' The CBI fears the government is closing off its long-term options in Europe. A survey of business leaders, commissioned by the CBI and to be published tomorrow, shows many in business in favour of a single currency. Last night a CBI official stressed that there was 'no question' of Mr Davies having criticised the government's policy on Europe. 'What he criticised was the attitude of some politicians who were opposed to Britain's greater involvement,' he said. 'The business community cannot afford to be excluded from a Europe which is moving to a single currency while Britain is left outside.' Commenting on the CBI's poll of businesspeople, he said: 'The bulk of replies favour the return of Britain to a single currency in the longer term.' Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, appeared to distance himself from some anti-European remarks by some colleagues at last month's Tory party conference. He said: 'We have taken historic decisions to move to a single market. That process is bound to create difficulties and short-term controversies.' While Mr Davies knew 'perfectly well that today's circumstances' had upset the assumptions on which yesterday's discussions had taken place, Mr Heseltine said it did not mean that circumstances would not change. Later in the evening Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, urged the party to stop debating Europe in terms of Euro-sceptic versus Euro-enthusiast. At a meeting of the Conservative Group for Europe Mr Clarke said: 'We must fight the real battle which is between the right and the left in Europe, between British Conservatives and John Smith's Euro-socialist Labour party.'

Until recently Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, maintained that the fairest method of charging for motorway use was through electronic tolls. Yesterday he told a transport conference in London: 'Electronic tolling offers much more flexibility in the long run, but probably won't be technologically achievable until at least 1998. 'So if we are going to move fast to get the benefits that road pricing offers, then vignettes (annual permits displayed in the windscreen) are the most realistic option.' Last month the government published a green paper exploring the options for introducing motorway charges as a means of funding road infrastructure expansion. At a meeting in Luxembourg last weekend European Community transport ministers agreed a package allowing countries to introduce annual permits costing up to Ecu 1,250 (Pounds 979) for lorries using their motorways, with the option of introducing permits for cars. Pressure for the EC deal was led by Germany, which faces heavy costs in providing infrastructure for transit traffic but receives little in return. Nine member states including Britain are considering the introduction of motorway charges to raise more money. Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg plan to introduce vignette systems in January 1995. Mr MacGregor said the introduction of vignettes to Britain would require primary legislation, so it could not come quickly. The earliest feasible date would be 1995.

At Guisborough, Cleveland, he said: 'What is needed is a package of measures to get Britain out of recession, not an attack on the incomes of the unemployed, pensioners and the disabled.' Mr Dewar urged the government to recognise that the best way to reduce the social security budget was to reduce the numbers on the dole by ensuring there were chances for them to secure creative employment. He strongly criticised the speech by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, at last week's Conservative party conference in which he condemned people he said cheated to claim social security. In a letter to the minister, Mr Dewar expressed particular concern about the implications of his attack on 'young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing list'. Mr Dewar deplored the 'offensive suggestion' that women, in significant numbers, became pregnant simply to advance up the queue for housing. He accused Mr Lilley of showing a lack of understanding of the difficulties facing lone parents and young couples in Britain today.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "
0,FT941-230 ,"FT941-230 _AN-EC4C0AAOFT 940331   FT  31 MAR 94 / How the British blundered in Brussels      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   Britain's decision to pick a fight with her EU partners over voting rights is more than a political disaster for Mr John Major. As the British prime minister battles for survival in London, the view is gaining ground in Brussels that his government's tactics during the enlargement negotiations could turn into a serious long-term diplomatic setback in Europe. 'There's nothing new about Britain being criticised about her attitude to European integration,' said one senior Commission official yesterday. 'What's new is that Finland, Sweden, Austria, and Norway thought they had a British friend, but in the end their friend turned out to be Germany.' Germany is the big winner as a result of enlargement. Vigorous Bonn diplomacy has kept prospects bright for bringing in four wealthy neighbours into the European Union by January 1, 1995, lightening Germany's burden as the paymaster of Europe and expanding her role as the power-broker at the heart of the Continent. As a champion of a wider Europe, Britain was well-placed to take joint credit with Germany for expanding the Union from 12 to 16 new members. However, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, passed up a mouth-watering opportunity: instead of standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, Mr Hurd found himself trapped in all-night arguments in Brussels, arguing a brief in which he had little confidence. How did this come about? Aside from political misjudgements by the UK cabinet inside Downing Street, it seems that the British Foreign Office fundamentally miscalculated in their assessment of how their European partners would respond to UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules in an expanded Union. These rules prevent two large countries and one small member state being out-voted, with 23 votes at present needed to muster a 'blocking minority'. For the past six months, senior British officials, including Sir John Kerr, the permanent UK ambassador to the EU in Brussels, held out hopes of persuading the large member states to sign up to the 23-vote blocking minority. Ironically, they placed most of their bets on Germany on the grounds that Bonn would agree to almost anything in the interests of keeping enlargement on track. UK policy rested on five other assumptions. France, Spain and Italy would support enlargement, but not if it further distorted the relationship between a country's voting strength and its population. Increasing the blocking minority from 23 to 27 would mean that a combination of smaller states could out-vote large states representing 40 per cent of the population, an important democratic principle which the majority of member states would not ignore. Most states were at best neutral on voting rights, with only federalist Belgium, Holland, and 'plucky little Luxembourg' arguing strongly for an increase. Rising French and German concern about encroachment by Brussels strengthed the case for making EU decision-making more difficult. The flaw was that while France and Germany shared many of these doubts, neither wanted to open up the question of power-sharing ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. 'We don't want another constitutional debate,' said one senior French official. Bonn in particular expressed horror at the idea of linking population to voting weights, because it would mean a more populous Germany acquiring more votes than France, thus jeopardising relations with its closest ally. In one Brussels session, German officials warned the British that they risked stirring up German nationalism in an already sensitive election year. Lastly, no member state wanted to be accused of jamming the EU's decision-making. After labouring to ratify Maastricht, 'the member states are committed to making the treaty work', said a senior EU official. Mr Peter Ludlow, head of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, believes that the Foreign Office's misreading of the intentions of her EU partners on the voting rights issue is as serious as any since 1945. Britain can still claim that though it lost a battle, it may win the war. Voting rights and institutional reform will be tackled 'root and branch' at the 1996 conference, combined with planning for a Union of 20-25 member states, including the east Europeans, according to Mr Hurd. The EU's tilt eastward has already aroused misgivings in France. These may grow as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic press to join the Union by the end of the century, and the Baltic states take encouragement from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's support for their own candidacy. At this point, Britain is likely to face a choice much more difficult than the argument over voting rights. For all British diplomats' claims that the UK is relaxed about the shift eastward, their views rest on the assumption that 'widening' will not mean 'deepening'. The setback in this round of enlargement means that Britain's hand will be much weaker - and Germany's much stronger - than it might have been ahead of the 1996 review.

The plight of Bosnia's Muslims has become the latest  anti-Western rallying cry for Iran's leadership, which is trying  to whip up revolutionary fervour to coincide with the fifth  anniversary of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death on Saturday.  Photographs depicting the suffering of Muslims in the besieged  Bosnian town of Gorazde are prominent in the lobbies of several  hotels in the capital, and the subject has dominated Friday  prayers at Tehran University for months.    In spite of its economic crisis, Iran is sending arms to  Islamic fundamentalists in the West Bank and Gaza, Algeria and  Sudan, and last month donated 1 million pounds to Bosnian  Muslims. Tehran radio began broadcasting propaganda in  Serbo-Croat on short-wave transmissions to Bosnia. Iranian  government officials and diplomats in Tehran believe President  Rafsanjani would like to see better ties with the West, but is  being forced to retreat by pressure from hardliners. Iran's  foreign policy has hardened markedly in recent weeks.    Tehran attacked Saudi Arabia after Riyadh prevented Iranian  pilgrims holding anti-Western demonstrations during the annual  haj pilgrimage. And yesterday the Iranians arrested two Iraqis  they claimed were high-ranking intelligence officers sent to  organise sabotage.    Iranian leaders are using the row with Britain to prove  their  revolutionary credentials while at the same time presenting  Tehran as the Islamic world's leading champion of dispossessed  Muslims. Radical groups which have the upper hand are urging  Iran to sever ties with Britain following accusations that a  listening device was planted in the Iranian Embassy in London.    Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani tried to tackle the hard-liners  last autumn by dissolving the 15 Khordad Foundation, a shadowy  pseudocharitable organisation based in Qom which put a 1.3  million [currency not specified] bounty on Salman Rushdie's  head. However, the move was blocked by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,  Iran's spiritual leader, who went on Tehran Radio to insist that  Muslims worldwide were duty-bound to murder Rushdie.    ""The two men have had at least one screaming row over  (Salman) Rushdie,"" an Iranian official said. ""Rafsanjani would  love to crush these autonomous religious circles that are  getting in his way, but they are financially independent and  constitutionally they are answerable to Khamenei.    The Rushdiefatwa remains a rallying cry for radicals hoping  to reinvigorate waning revolutionary fervour, but it has impeded  the President's attempts to improve relations with the West and  win investment crucial to the faltering economic reforms on  which he has staked his reputation. Iranian hard-liners have  gained strength following the economic crisis which is blamed on  Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani's programme.    The President surprised diplomats last month by taking a  high  profile in the row with Britain by alleging that M16 was bugging  the Iranian Embassy in London. He incited the Iranian media,  and several newspapers urged the government to sever ties with  what one paper called ""the ageing father of colonialism.""  Despite the unpopularity of Iran's Islamic leadership, its  attempts to incite anti-British sentiment are guaranteed some  success in a society ready to believe conspiracy theories  against the old colonial master whose history of meddling in  Iranian affairs is taught to children in all schools.

0,FT944-12040 ,"FT944-12040 _AN-EKCEGADDFT 941103   FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Bang up to date - Bernard Gray reviews two books which show that the story of how the Bomb was born has lessons for today      By BERNARD GRAY   The agreement that North Korea is currently preparing to sign with the US to limit its nuclear programme may avert a potentially dangerous proliferation of atomic weapons material in Asia. It also has ramifications for the handling of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, due to be renewed next year. How the west handles its own nuclear disarmament, and how it deals with developing countries' nuclear ambitions are central in the debate about nuclear proliferation. But the story of the North Korean nuclear programme has a more disturbing resonance from the west's recent past. Two books published recently about the British and Soviet atomic bombs show just how closely the Koreans were following the path which the second world war allies trod 50 years ago. The kind of nuclear reactors Korea built recently, and the purpose for which they were intended, are almost identical to those constructed by the US, the UK and the Soviet Union during the 1940s. Those interested in the science and engineering of how an aspiring weapons state might go about building a nuclear bomb can learn much from either of these books. David Holloway's* is the more serious, and is an important addition to the history of the Bomb. Brian Cathcart's account** is lighter, and sadly misses out much of the detail that gives Holloway his authority. Yet the scientific detective story, the romance, and ultimately the horror of the original development and use of the atomic bomb is still best set out in Richard Rhodes's award-winning and definitive story first published in 1986***. As well as technical detail, Rhodes picks out the human side of the story: the struggles of physicists, many Jewish fugitives, against technical challenges and political obstacles makes compelling reading. His account of Hiroshima is harrowing. The two more recent books lack the thrill of the initial chase and its sickening conclusion, but they throw fascinating light on the similarities and differences between the US, Britain and the Soviet Union. Cathcart's book is written in a less academic style, but both books tell parallel stories about the same period and inevitably view the same incidents through different lenses. In all three countries bureaucratic bungling held back development. It was more than two years after Einstein wrote to Roosevelt, warning the president of the possibility of the Bomb, that there was a significant US effort to produce atomic weapons. In the Soviet Union Stalin had received excellent intelligence from Britain and the US on the critical issues in bomb development, but Russia in the early part of the war was thinking of survival in terms of weeks, rather than the years that the new superbomb would take. Even when the USSR regained the initiative, Molotov, the foreign secretary, did not trust his own scientists and believed the reports could be a plot by the west to make Russia waste resources on a pointless scheme. Only Hiroshima finally shifted official Russian attitudes. Britain had more mundane concerns. Having been ahead in 1940, thanks largely to a brilliant analysis of the main problems by Frisch and Peierls at Birmingham University - leaked wholesale to the Russians - Britain refused to share its work equally with the US. The Americans soon pulled ahead and it was not until 1943 that the US readmitted the UK to the project. Despite the UK effort to help develop the Bomb, the US cut Britain off from atomic research after the war. Attlee then determined that Britain must have at least the capacity to build nuclear weapons. William Penney was encouraged to head the project but he ran headlong into Whitehall. Other departments were so jealous of resources that they refused to supply half a dozen draughtsmen for a project the prime minister had given the highest priority. There are many such vignettes in both books. Beria, the secret police chief in charge of the Russian Bomb, made a list of those to be shot or deported to Siberia if the project failed. When it worked, he used the same list: those who would have been shot were made Heroes of Soviet Labour; those to have been deported received lesser honours; those who would merely have been sacked got commendations. In the UK, Penney got a knighthood. The Americans, once persuaded of the viability of the Bomb, were typically thorough and threw enormous effort and scientific skill at it. By 1945 the project had cost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The British were typically proud of the fact that they built their Bomb on a shoestring. The Russians poured in the full resources of the command economy and had no idea how much they spent. 'Give them what they want,' Stalin told Beria, 'we can always shoot them later.' Neither the British nor the Russians made much of the fact that their first atomic bombs were direct copies of the original US design. Chillingly, given how much technology has progressed since, that design is nearly the one that would be used by a nascent weapons state today. Those trying to learn the lessons of 50 years ago can see clearly that once the physics had been established, getting plutonium or enriched uranium was the hardest problem. Producing it requires enormous, expensive sites, which are relatively easy to spot, as in Korea. Controlling the production and flow of plutonium is the only way to keep the nuclear genie even half way in the bottle. The destructive power of the Bomb, vividly described in these books, makes that an urgent task for the negotiators to take on. *Stalin and the Bomb: the Soviet Union and Atomic Energy 1939-1956.

Potential gains from attracting the agency, which will control the safety of medicines in the EC and encourage innovation and technical co-operation between member states, extend beyond status and direct jobs. Britain has one of the community's leading pharmaceutical industries and the presence of the agency would be likely to stimulate its growth. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, will launch the campaign for London's bid today with the backing of Mr John Major, prime minister. He says in a note endorsing the bid that the case for siting the agency in London is a 'powerful one'. A brochure setting out the UK case enlists the support of a variety of leading figures in pharmaceuticals and medicine including representatives of Zeneca, Hoechst UK, Glaxo, Wellcome Foundation, Astra Pharmaceuticals, London University and its medical schools. Although it is possible that a decision on the agency's location may be made at the Copenhagen EC summit next month, it is more likely to come later in the year. Rival bids are likely to come from Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Irish Republic. The British bid will emphasise that London's worldwide reputation as a medical research centre, with more than half the nation's expenditure on academic medical research going to the London medical schools, is complemented by a well-established pharmaceutical industry. There are 65 pharmaceutical manufacturers in the UK, 89 per cent of them foreign-owned, employing 87,000 people. One fifth of these staff are employed in medical research and development. Britain is Europe's largest investor in pharmaceutical research and development - spending in 1991 was Pounds 1.2bn or 22 per cent of the EC total - and is second only to Germany as an EC exporter of pharmaceuticals to non-community countries. Exports from Britain account for about 16 per cent of the EC total. Locating close to the predominantly London and home counties-based pharmaceuticals industry would, say the promoters of the British bid, have the additional advantage of guaranteeing the agency an adequate supply of qualified and experienced staff. The British bid will stress other advantages of housing the agency in London, many of these related to communications. Evaluating new drugs requires the exchange of massive amounts of information. Supporters argue that Britain's telecommunications system, allied to physical communications advantages such as the capital's airports and the opening of the Channel tunnel, make London the natural choice. English is also the internationally recognised language of medicines regulation. The agency, which is due to start work in 1995, will have 300 at first staff with substantial information technology and archive support. It is estimated that it will need 5,300 square metres of office space by the end of the century.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2834 Pharmaceutical Preparations.

Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is set to make the announcement on Monday at the start of a two-day Commons debate on defence. The decision means the RAF faces losing its nuclear mission after its current WE177 bombs become obsolete. Mr Rifkind is also expected to outline the government's views on the future of the royal dockyards including moves towards private-sector ownership, probably from 1996. The dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth are now managed by private-sector companies under contract. Savings from these measures are seen as going some of the way to responding to Treasury pressure for further cuts in defence spending. The Treasury is believed to be seeking a reduction of about Pounds 1bn in the defence budget, currently Pounds 23.7bn for next year. This would be in in addition to cuts of Pounds 1.05bn over two years, imposed last November. The Ministry of Defence argues that the armed forces cannot sustain further cuts unless Britain reduces or abandons some of its defence commitments in the UK, Europe or overseas. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the Commons defence committee, warned yesterday that more reductions could cripple the services. Lord Bramall, a former chief of defence staff, called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to intervene against further personnel and equipment cuts. The decision to dispense with the new missile, which would have been a joint effort with either France or the US, reflects both the squeeze on spending and the dramatic change in the strategic situation since discussions began almost six years ago. It appeared increasingly unlikely that Britain would be able to test a warhead for the missile, because of the US moratorium on testing and forthcoming negotiations on a global ban. Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have opposed the new missile. Funding for the air-launched weapon - known as the tactical air-to-surface missile or TASM - was included in the MoD's secret long-term costings. However, this sum is understood to have been much less than the Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn overall cost estimated by experts, and the savings will come in the medium rather than short term. The two missiles being considered as the basis for the project were the Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (Slat) made by Martin Marietta of the US, and the Air-Sol Longue Portee, an extended-range version of a missile already in service with the French air force. An earlier candidate, a nuclear version of Boeing's Short-Range Attack Missile, was cancelled by the US in 1991. Aerospatiale, the state-controlled French company which has been working on the ASLP project, said yesterday: 'It is very unlikely that the French government will continue alone.'

0,FT911-625 ,"FT911-625 _AN-BEJAXAFEFT 910510   FT  10 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Time to move on the Rock   MR Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, was right when, during a visit to London this week, he described Britain's only remaining colony in Europe, Gibraltar, as an anachronism. That judgment is all the more true since the centuries-old dispute about sovereignty over the Rock is now the only real obstacle to a genuine improvement in relations between two countries which, in nearly every other field, are daily drawing closer. Britain's stewardship could once be justified by the argument that it was protecting the Rock's 25,000 inhabitants against the dictatorship of General Franco. However, now that Spain has become a democracy and both Britain and Spain are partners within the European Community, colonial disputes harking back to the War of the Spanish Succession are both irrelevant and embarrassing. Irrelevant, but for one important proviso. Britain would find little difficulty in divesting itself of its troublesome heritage, if it had not given a number of firm political assurances to Gibraltar. The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which gave Britain sovereignty over Gibraltar, stated that if this sovereignty were ever to be transferred by London, Spain would have first refusal. Yet two and a half centuries later, Britain promised in the preamble to Gibraltar's 1969 constitution that it would never agree to any transfer of sovereignty against the 'freely and democratically expressed wishes' of the people of Gibraltar. Commitment reiterated Though Britain and Spain have since agreed that the issue of sovereignty could be raised in annual discussions between them, the British commitment to the people of the Rock has been reiterated regularly. Unfortunately, it has also been used by the British government as a pretext for soft-pedalling. London has even turned a blind eye to Gibraltar's blockage of a four-year-old agreement between Britain and Spain on the joint use of the Rock's airport. Indeed, Mr Gonzalez clearly touched a sore point when he said in an interview with this newspaper that for the British, discussions with Spain about Gibraltar are like an annual visit to the dentist, while for Spain it was like a permanent stone in its shoe. Small as it is, the Rock, which is linked to Spain by an isthmus, is understandably regarded by Spaniards as part of their country. Growing irritation If anything, Spain's irritation has been growing recently because it considers that the Gibraltarians want to have their cake and eat it; to take advantage both of their special fiscal regime within the European Community and their right to freedom of movement and establishment in Spain. The Rock's rapid development as an offshore financial centre has led to Spanish accusations that it is becoming a haven for tax dodgers and money launderers. Thanks largely to tax exemptions, Gibraltar has become the largest single source of investment in Spanish real estate, with a large number of Gibraltarians either living or owning property in Spain. Mr Gonzalez is not asking for the moon. He knows that no quick solutions are possible and that only a gradual evolution of public opinion in Gibraltar can lead its people to have a change of heart. Nor is he insisting on an immediate all-or-nothing solution. A number of intermediate schemes have been proposed by Madrid, ranging from a British-Spanish condominium over Gibraltar to a lease-back system on the Hong Kong model. In all cases, Spain is prepared to accept a large measure of autonomy for the Rock. Without going into the merits of these alternative schemes, it is nevertheless reasonable to expect the British government to make a bigger effort than it has done to work out a step-by-step approach which will satisfy Spain. Certainly, the desires of the Gibraltarians have to be taken into account, but not only their wishes. At stake too, are the interests of Britain and Spain, which cannot allow their bilateral relations either to stagnate or deteriorate while they are both deeply involved in achieving greater European unity.

An official government handbook, published yesterday and used by British diplomats to sell the country overseas, reveals a country with record amounts of leisure and holiday time and a growing number of homeowners and shareholders. The reference book, Britain 1992, published by the Central Office of Information, is intended to paint the country in the rosiest light, and little mention is made of the effects of the recession or the impact of rising unemployment. It nevertheless presents a comprehensive contemporary picture of British political and social affairs and gives an insight into changes over the last decade and more. The overall impression is of a nation of leisured couch potatoes whose life is governed by the acquisition of consumer durables. In 1989, for example, 91 per cent of full-time manual employees were entitled to more than four weeks' paid holiday, while in 1961, 97 per cent were entitled to only two weeks. The number of share owners has risen to one in four of the population in 1990 from one in five three years ago and one in 13 in 1979. and the number of people owning their own homes has risen nearly four-fold compared with 40 years ago. Home ownership in 1990 stood at 15m com-pared with 4m in 1951. However, the average size of households has fallen from more than four people in 1911 to 3.09 in 1961 to 2.46 in 1990 as more people live alone. Television easily remains the favourite pastime, followed by listening to the radio, do-it-yourself, reading and gardening. More than nine in 10 households had colour television and almost 25 hours a week on average was spent in front of the set. The 480-page glossy handbook, the latest of 43 annual editions, shows there has been little change in alcohol consumption in the past decade. However, big changes have been recorded for cinema admissions, which have increased by 84 per cent since 1984, mail order purchases, up from 16m in 1981 to 20m a decade later, and car-related crime, which accounts for 25 per cent of all crimes compared with 10 per cent in 1957.

'The support of the United Kingdom is very important to us - perhaps they could participate even in a symbolic way at the moment to show solidarity for our situation,' Mr Fujimori said in an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Fujimori, on his first visit to London, met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, for talks at which he described Peru's economic reconstruction and stabilisation programme. He suggested Britain might give training to assist the fight against terrorism. Britain did not take part in the support group of nations, led by the US and Japan, which eased Peru's re-entry into the world financial system after the election of Mr Fujimori in 1990. Peru's economic programme won IMF approval in September last year. Mr Fujimori, who is also using his visit to highlight the environmental damage caused by the drugs trade, vigorously defended his anti-drug and anti-terrorism campaigns. 'When I took over the government the anti-drug policy was very repressive and militaristic,' he said. 'In our new strategy we do not have to fight against the farmworkers. We have to distinguish between the farmworker who is growing the coca leaf and those who process and commercialise cocaine. 'We have to gain the confidence of the farmworkers, who are actually exploited by the drug traffickers. We have to campaign to help them change,' he said. Peru produces at least 60 per cent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. Mr Fujimori admitted that corruption continued to be a problem. 'Without corruption you could not explain how drugs continued to arrive in the US. But the level of corruption has been reduced.' He also claimed progress against the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas and the MRTA (the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement), which have waged a long and bloody struggle against the Peruvian state. 'I am completely sure that I will leave Peru completely pacified,' he said, switching briefly into English 'to make matters absolutely clear.' Suspected Shining Path guerrillas rampaged through Comas, a shantytown north of Lima early yesterday, killing four people and wounding three others whom they had accused of trafficking in drugs, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Lima. The deaths brought to 39 the number of people killed in political violence around the country since Monday.

0,FT934-16080 ,"FT934-16080 _AN-DJHCKAB2FT 931008   FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Upbeat Clarke warns on borrowing      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday delivered an upbeat assessment of the recovery but warned that tough decisions must be taken in next month's Budget to reduce government borrowing. The recovery 'is really happening', he said. Although he was 'concerned a bit' that the recovery was 'still not very strong', the economy was 'going along quite well'. While there were occasional 'blips', the recovery was stronger than the government could have hoped at the time of the Budget in March, he said. Since he succeeded Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor in May, Mr Clarke has avoided trumpeting Britain's growth performance and has frequently warned of the dangers posed by the recession among Britain's main trading partners in continental Europe. Yesterday, while acknowledging that unemployment and crime rates were too high, he struck an optimistic note. Britain was the first country in Europe to come out of recession and was set to grow faster than any of its main European competitors this year and next. 'We can begin to lift our horizons to look beyond recovery and set ourselves the realistic aim of making Britain the most dynamic and most successful economy in Europe,' Mr Clarke told the conference. The UK, he said, had 'good news to build on'. Interest rates were at their lowest levels for 16 years. Inflation was 'down - and staying down'. However, Mr Clarke said that Britain 'must lead the way' in reducing government borrowing. He said that his first duty as chancellor was to tackle debt by reining back public spending. But he did not rule out tax increases in his November 30 Budget. 'As Margaret Thatcher discovered in her courageous Budget of 1981, when the first priority is to balance the books, tight control over public spending is not always enough.' The chancellor said that everyone wanted lower income taxes - and a tax system that protected the saver and encouraged the investor and entrepreneur. However, he said it was necessary to get back to sound public finances to achieve this. Mr Clarke strongly defended the tax increases announced in the March Budget by Mr Lamont. These were 'absolutely vital'. Most of the increased revenue would come from people in work, with the better off paying the most. Three quarters of the tax increases would come from higher National Insurance contributions, cuts in income tax allowances and a clampdown on tax avoidance. Mr Clarke was unrepentant about the plans to raise nearly Pounds 3bn in a full year through levying value added tax on domestic fuel from April. Defending the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel, he pointed out that: two thirds of the revenue would come from households with Pounds 12,000 a year or more; gas, coal and electricity prices had come down so prices would be unchanged in real terms from five years ago; extra help would be given to the poorest members of society.

0,FT924-11680 ,"FT924-11680 _AN-CJYAZAA8FT 921024   FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Hard workers in an industrial game - Rugby League; Britain and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in Sydney, and John Hopkins assess the two sides      By KEVIN BROWN and JOHN HOPKINS      SYDNEY   HAVE ANY industries been more closely associated with one sport than cotton, and wool and coal mining with rugby league? As Geoffrey Moorhouse noted in At The George, his book of essays about rugby league: 'The industrial heartland of the north of England was powered by men who worked in the mills, foundries and pits of the region . . . in time the majority of rugby clubs in the north drew their playing strength from . . . these places.' There is therefore, a particular piquancy that at the moment that Britain's rugby league team has achieved its greatest success by reaching the final of the World Cup at Wembley this afternoon, 30 pits are being threatened with closure and British Coal is ending its sponsorship of Great Britain's rugby league team. Eighty thousand spectators will be at Wembley to watch Britain play Australia, the world champions. Great Britain have improved so much recently that the Australian coach said the current side would beat its predecessors of four and six years ago by 30 points. Nevertheless, the Australians are the favourites. They have held the Ashes since 1970 and won the World Cup in 1975, 1977, 1985 and 1988. 'They are the champions. They have beaten us in the past two Test series,' says Jonathan Devereux, the burly Widnes back who was in Great Britain's World Cup squad. 'Their record stands for itself and in Allen Langer they have the outstanding player. If he was in our side then we would be favourites. He has got everything. He has speed. He can read a game very well. He has electrifying pace over ten yards, which is what he needs to get through a gap. He can wrestle the ball clear of his opponents in a way that is almost uncanny for a small man. He is a good kicker and he is very tenacious.' If Langer, a scrum-half, is a potential match winner for Australia, then Martin Offiah is quite capable of doing the same for Great Britain. Offiah, whose nickname is Chariots, is the fastest man on the field so long as the injury he appeared to be carrying last Sunday when he played in the Lancashire Cup Final has healed. Much will depend on him as it will, too, on Gary Schofield, Great Britain's captain, playing in the centre, and on the 35-year-old warhorse, Kevin Ward, in the front row. If Great Britain win, and it is an even money bet that they will, then they will have demonstrated how much they have learnt from the Australians in the past ten years. A decade ago British rugby league hit rock bottom. It was time for change and officials were dispatched from Britain to sit at the feet of men who had once been their pupils. They discovered that Australian rugby league was applying science to the art of football, setting scientifically determined standards for everything from diet to fitness. Whereas in Britain many training sessions included unopposed rugby, the Australians favoured fierce physical contact in practice. This was one radical change. Another that the British noted was the way the Australians work with weights to develop their upper bodies. The British, up to then, had concentrated on building up the torso and legs. The result was a generation of massive, fast-running men like Mal Meninga, the Australians' captain who is 6 ft 1 in and weighs 17 st 2lbs. This afternoon he will face Gary Schofield who is 5 ft 8 in and 12 st 7 lbs. Schofield is wiser and heavier than he was when he met Meninga in 1984 and was thrown around like a rag doll, but he is still giving away five inches and 65 lbs. The Australians did not stop there. They trained hard so that they could play the game at a fast pace. Having done all this, they set about shoring up their defence so that it was well-nigh unbreachable. 'They put so much pressure on you when they have not got the ball that you start to make mistakes' says Davies, a member of Britain's 1990 Test team. As the years went by, the Australians refined all these skills, making themselves more formidable still. One try in the second Test against Great Britain in 1990 bore out everything they had been trained to do. The ball was in play for 36 seconds and there were 16 passes before the try-scorer touched down. No other team could live with such an athletic, skilful approach. The advances shown by the Australian rugby league teams were soon noticed by that country's rugby union authorities as well. That code now produces big men of great athleticism, trained to a higher level of fitness than ever before. When these mastodons are teamed with key individuals in the key positions such as scrum-half, stand-off and full back, then the entire team whirrs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. The result is that the Wallabies won the rugby union World Cup last year and there is no sign of their dominance being ended. As the Australians were pushing back the frontiers of the game, so in Britain it was being professionally administered and marketed. In the days of Eddie Waring commentating on BBC television on a Saturday afternoon, rugby league was, frankly, a joke. To my eyes, used to the rhythm of rugby union, rugby league was nothing more than a series of crash, bang, wallop attacks. Six tackles and then something had to happen. The game seemed one-paced, physically unambitious, tactically sterile. 'Oooooop and oooonder' and 'he's taking an early bath' were Waring's catch phrases. Now it has become a game of considerable pace and skill - as you should see this afternoon. It is as different from the rugby league of 20 years ago as colour is from black and white television and jets are from propeller-driven aeroplanes. 'Rugby League has remained unusually true to itself' noted Moorhouse, 'an expression of values as well as a challenge and an entertainment now embedded deeply in the lives of generations on both sides of the world . . . But a game can be much more complex than patterns of athletic energy on a playing field. It can reflect and embody various habits and attitudes that amount to nothing less than a way of life and this game does.' Like rugby union, rugby league is a game in its prime.

The sheer inertia induced in business by the depth and duration of the recession, aggravated by the unwillingness on the part of the Conservative government to recognise the problem, makes investment a major priority. Will Britain be a better place to invest under Labour or the Conservatives? Further investment depends upon restoration of confidence. Many people do not believe the policies or indeed lack of policy of the previous government warrants its re-election. Britain would be better for investment under Labour because Labour would be more aware of the need to encourage investment. What would be the effects of Labour's plans to restrict takeovers? Labour is broadly in line with that of the European Community. The distinction is between short-termism and Labour's longer-term view. Should Britain have a minimum wage? I do not believe that a minimum wage would have an adverse impact. Our objective must be to stimulate the economy and a factor in this must be tackling low pay. Are there any attractive features of the Conservatives' industrial policy? It is the sheer absence of an industrial policy which has contributed to the worst recession that business people in the UK have ever encountered.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

The report surfaced as Libya's North African neighbours, headed by Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, engaged in a flurry of meetings to try to head off UN Security Council moves to impose sanctions against Libya, including an arms and civil aviation embargo. In Tunis, an unidentified North African diplomat was quoted as saying that Arab states were 'intensively working' on a solution and that Libya had agreed in principle to surrender the two accused Libyan agents to the UN secretary-general. But British and US officials suggested that Libya might be seeking to win time before an eventual vote on a proposed Security Council resolution calling for sanctions - expected early next week. Britain and the US have demanded, backed by UN resolution 731, that Libya hand over the two men - Mr Abdul Basit Ali Magrahi and Mr Lamin Khalifa Fahima - for trial in either the US or Scotland. France has also demanded that Libya surrender four men suspected of bombing a UTA flight over Niger in 1989. US officials said Libya's unconditional surrender of the two men would suffice to forestall a vote on the UN resolution. Other western officials said the move might ease but not entirely remove pressure on Libya, since Tripoli, under the terms of resolution 731, should still hand over the men linked to the UTA bombing and disassociate itself from all acts of terrorism. Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime has wriggled uncomfortably under the pressure from the US, Britain and France. It has proposed a string of solutions short of western demands while stockpiling vital goods and shifting billions of dollars of overseas assets in case of sanctions. Anxiety among Libya's neighbours that Col Gadaffi's regime might be fatally destabilised by external pressure has prompted a concerted attempt to broker a solution, led by Egypt. In its scramble for a way out, Libya yesterday despatched a senior envoy to Riyadh to meet Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi foreign minister, while Major Khoueldi Hamidi, a Libyan defence official, held two sessions of talks with King Hassan of Morocco on Thursday.

0,FT944-1738 ,"FT944-1738 _AN-ELSDLABZFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: FT Guide To EU Inter-governmental Conference      By LIONEL BARBER   What will the European Union's 1996 inter-governmental conference be about, and why the sudden interest? In 1996, the 15 members of the EU are due to review the operation of the Maastricht treaty, and possibly amend it. French and British Euro-sceptics are worried that the conference (IGC) could mark a second great leap forward in European political and economic integration. Dissident British Tories are warning about 'Son of Maastricht'. They are demanding a referendum, before or after the conference. Why the referendum fever? After all, Britain held one on EU membership in 1975. UK prime minister John Major hints that he might hold a referendum, but only if the IGC produces far-reaching constitutional changes. At this stage, the chances of a 'big bang' IGC look remote. Jacques Delors' decision against running for the French presidency makes a Franco-German push in 1996 for deeper, faster integration less likely. OK, but what about the single European currency? Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist presidential candidate in France, says he favours a referendum on European monetary union. True. But contrary to popular belief, the IGC will not discuss policy issues such as the single-currency project. It will only examine possible treaty changes. Anyway, Emu is already in train. There could be a move to Emu in 1997, but 1999 is far more likely. Why? Maastricht says that Emu can only be triggered in 1997 if a majority of the 15 member states meet tough targets on budget deficits, government debt levels, exchange rate stability and interest rates. In 1999, you do not require a majority - just those countries which meet these so-called convergence criteria. If a privileged group does go ahead, it could be very divisive. Either way, Britain would face a tricky decision on staying in or out. If Emu is off, what is on the 1996 agenda? One of the big topics is European defence policy. Britain led opposition to moving too fast towards a separate European defence 'identity' in 1991, because it was worried about undermining the Nato alliance and upsetting the Americans. But that was before the Bosnian war, and before the US made clear it wanted the Europeans to take more responsibilty for defence matters, albeit under Nato's umbrella. So what might come out of the conference? Reports of a future common European army are wildly exaggerated. But the British, French and Germans are interested in strengthening the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defence arm. Pay attention, too, to the Anglo-French axis. Paris and London have been 'bonding' in Bosnia as the biggest contributors to the UN peace-keeping operation, and they are planning a joint air command. Also, Britain thinks that playing the defence card is the best way to bolster its Euro-credentials with Paris. Any other business in 1996? Everyone, even the British, appears to agree that some institutional changes in the Union will have to take place to prepare for the next round of enlargement - that is, the entry of the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, around the turn of the century. Most people think the Union may have as many as 27 countries by 2005-2010. What are the options for institutional change? Mind-numbingly numerous. The British want a minimalist agenda. They would like to cut down the number of commissioners (presently 20), but that means breaking the tradition that every country has its own commissioner. The big countries want to tinker with the voting system in the EU decision-making body, the Council of Ministers. The present system is weighted disproportionately in favour of the smaller member states. So what is John Major's problem? Germany and the federalist-minded smaller states would also like to introduce more majority decision-making and reduce the power of the national veto. Another sensitive area is justice and home affairs. Chancellor Kohl would like to introduce supranational decision-making to tackle organised crime and drug trafficking. His dream is to turn Europol, the fledgling police network, into a European FBI. That is anathema to the sovereignty-conscious British and French, but still bet on some movement here. What about the European Parliament? Kohl believes that strengthening the Strasbourg assembly is the best chance of filling the 'democratic deficit' in Europe. He would like to increase its power of co-decision in EU legislation. But he could run into opposition in 1996 from countries such as Britain and Denmark which see their own national parliaments as the big players, and are reluctant to cede more powers to Strasbourg. What is the next step in preparing for 1996? The European Commission, the European Parliament and a group of selected representatives of the 15 member states will shortly submit papers identifying the institutional problems created by future enlargement and a possible agenda for 1996. The smart money is on a long IGC, probably lasting beyond the next UK election. Perhaps John Major will not even be around to conclude the negotiations. In which case, step forward Tony Blair, the UK Labour party leader.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Their optimism was part of an orchestrated attempt to drown out 'doom-mongers' - who have been condemned by Mr John Major. Ministers want to shift the agenda of economic discussion towards the Budget's benefits for business and away from the implications for the needy of the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel and power. Some ministers have been reluctant to claim in public that they, too, have detected 'green shoots' of economic recovery, apparently first sighted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, at the Tory party conference in 1991. Their fear has been that the sighting might be equally shortlived. Yesterday's ministerial speeches contrasted the UK's grounds for economic confidence with the recession elsewhere. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said: 'Recovery is not yet secure but our prospects are looking brighter, while for many countries they are looking bleaker.' Public service minister Mr William Waldegrave told his Bristol West constituents that the skies over Britain were becoming brighter. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, told a meeting in his Loughborough constituency: 'This has been a five-star week for Britain. Why won't Britain welcome it?' Labour continued to pursue ministers on VAT and on their 'betrayal' of election promises not to raise taxes.

Mr Raul Domingas, the movement's chief negotiator at peace talks that have been going on for 18 months in Rome, said in London that Britain's military support for the Mozambique government was 'jeopardising all peace efforts'. Britain was supporting a 'party army', he said. The UK Foreign Office says that by the middle of next year up to 800 Mozambican soldiers will have been trained by Britain. Mr Domingas, visiting London at the invitation of a group of Conservative MPs, said the Rome talks had become deadlocked over the issue of the country's constitution which Renamo says should be reviewed and multi-party democracy institutionalised before a ceasefire could be agreed. He claimed that the country's new constitution, which commits formerly Marxist Mozambique to a mixed economy, freedom of the press, an independence judiciary and multi-party elections, was designed to defend Frelimo interests. Mr Domingas recognised his movement had an 'image problem' but denied reports of Renamo atrocities. Initially backed by Rhodesia and then South Africa, Renamo has reached the negotiating table by way of a harsh guerrilla campaign.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Welcoming the endorsement of economic and political union in the Irish referendum, the UK prime minister rejected calls from Tory Euro-sceptics for a renegotiation of the deal. He stressed the gains Britain had secured from Maastricht, saying an attempt to re-open the agreement would cast the government in the role of 'political gazumpers'. Conservative opponents of closer European integration, however, said that disappointment at the Irish result would not deflect their efforts to prevent ratification of the treaty. The rebels argued that Denmark's rejection of the treaty earlier this month could not be 'cancelled out' by its acceptance in Ireland. The anti-federalist European Reform Group has invited leaders of the Danish 'no' campaign to a strategy meeting at Westminster next week aimed at bolstering opposition in the British parliament. Mr Major acknowledged that there was no prospect that the UK government would re-introduce legislation to ratify Maastricht until the Danish government had clarified its position and until after the French referendum. Some ministers are speculating that the British legislation could now be deferred until after the EC's Edinburgh summit in early December. But in terms calculated to confront head-on the critics in his own party Mr Major said: 'If we were now to set aside our word we would not be trusted again. We would lose our influence to determine events.' His speech - designed to detach waverers in the Conservative party from the hard core of Euro-sceptics - stressed that Britain could not exercise authority if it stood on the sidelines. 'I want this country to be at the heart of Europe,' he said. 'Only if we are there can we have real influence. We need that influence to build the Europe we want.' Mr Major signalled that Britain, which takes over the presidency on July 1, would seek to rescue the Maastricht agreement by emphasising that it did not represent the 'federalist closed shop' that many feared. That would be achieved by pressing Britain's agenda for the next few years. It included pushing ahead with enlargement, curbing centralism, exercising control over the powers of the Commission and the creation of a genuine single market.

But as one of Britain's longest-established cremator makers he has reason to be decidedly upbeat. With Britain's crematoria due to replace their 700 cremators over the next few years, the country's tiny cremator making business is experiencing a boom. Mr Hayward, cremator director of Cheshire-based Furnace Construction said: 'Britain has been leading the way in cremation and cremator making for some time - this can only help.' The company, like the handful of other cremator makers, is expecting orders to rise by at least 40 per cent next year. Mr Hayward said that in the 50 years he had been in business his cremators had changed considerably. When he started the cremation rate was only 10 per cent. Now the rate is nearly 70 per cent, handling nearly 500,000 incinerations a year. The construction process demands extensive research and development to cope with the demand for environmentally friendly, computerised cremators. As uncertainty over environmental legislation triggered a fall in domestic demand during the 1980s cremator makers tried to expand overseas - Australia, with a 47 per cent cremation rate, has been a fruitful market, while Germany and the Netherlands have also been buyers. In Britain the industry seems set for several years of steady expansion. Mr Max Kingsland, chief executive of the cremator division of Evans Universal, said: 'There aren't many industries where Britain is still strong at home. But this is one of them.' His comapny has a turnover of about Pounds 4m a year from its cremator business.   Companies:-  Furnace Construction.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Secretary of State for Education John Patten said effort  needed to be made to put mutual relations back into the warm  waters.    Malaysia barred British companies from bidding for public  sector contracts in February following publication of  unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Malaysian  leaders in the British media.    Speaking to reporters at the British Council here a few  hours  after his arrival yesterday, Patten said he was disappointed by  the effect of reports in the British press on the relationship  between the two countries.    As Douglas Hurd (British Foreign Secretary) said in the  House  of Commons last Wednesday, we should not allow the press to come  between us, he said.    He said both Hurd and Trade Secretary Richard Needham had  made it clear that Britain wished to see a resumption of normal  relations as soon as possible.    Patten added Britain would continue to work vigorously to  bring about a situation in which the Malaysian Government felt  able to lift its ban on public sector contracts for British  companies.    Certainly the British press had been pretty quiet on this  issue over the last two or three weeks, he said.    Asked about Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's stand on  the matter, he said the Malaysian leader had always been a very  powerful advocate of Malaysia's case internationally.    He said Dr. Mahathir had made his views known especially in  a  very striking letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of London a few  weeks ago.     "
0,FT943-10149 ,"FT943-10149 _AN-EHGAUADMFT 940806   FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: Ancient pyramids found in Britain - Serious Money      By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor   Collapsed Russian finance group MMM has been besieged by anguished depositors in Moscow this week. The group's success had been based on selling shares in itself to millions of people. The share price rocketed from Rbs1,600 in February to over Rbs100,000 and back down to Rbs950 before the shares were suspended last week. MMM did not have anything so prosaic as an underlying business: it was a share pusher, pure and simple. Caritas, the Transylvanian pyramid scheme, which made millions of Romanians rich before it collapsed late last year was a bit similar. It had promised investors a sevenfold return on their money in 100 days, and had no trouble meeting those promises - until the new money stopped flowing in. Some pundits argue that former eastern bloc countries are particularly vulnerable to double your money schemes, because they are only beginning to develop financial markets. As the South Sea bubble was to Britain in the 18th century, and the Ponzi scheme to Boston in the 1920s, so Caritas and MMM are to Romania and Russia. And of course the proletariat in developing countries lacks the financial nous to distinguish between sound investments and scams. The inference is that all the deeply sophisticated citizens of the Western world can tell a pyramid selling scheme from 1,000 metres. Well maybe. But only this week the department of trade and industry shut down a clutch of UK pyramid selling schemes operating under the apposite name of 'Alchemy'. Members' profits did not come from anything so humdrum as selling a product. One of Alchemy's irresistible offers was that it would turn Pounds 140 into Pounds 600 - though it could not tell you how. The DTI describes it as 'redistributing' members' subs. Very Ponzi. Alchemy was shut because it was 'not in the public interest' for it to continue to recruit members. As the judge said: 'Schemes of this nature are bound to fail because the pool of those willing to join is not inexhaustible'. Pyramid selling as such is not illegal in the UK. The DTI even has a handy consumer booklet telling would-be salesmen how to spot the dud ones. Some pyramid schemes, such as Amway, have been operating in Britain for more than 20 years. Am-Who? The first thing any of its distributors (salesmen) tell you about Amway is that it is not, repeat not, a pyramid selling scheme. It operates a multi-level marketing strategy, which is entirely different. Indeed, the head honchos at Amway are exceedingly cross with the DTI for tagging it with the 'pernicious label - legal pyramids'. One important difference between schemes such as Alchemy and those like Amway is that Amway has a product to sell. Much of the money flowing into the group is sales revenue, rather than subs from new members. Based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Amway has global sales of over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn). It is big business in Japan. And it has floated its Asia-Pacific subsidiary in order to make the push into China. It sells mainly basic products, such as detergents. It has around 50,000 UK distributors. But a successful distributor's main money comes not from selling goods to the public but from recruiting new salesmen, and sharing their commission. Each salesman pays Pounds 70 to join, with an annual renewal fee of Pounds 15. New recruits are shown charts with scores of interdependent, ever-widening, circles. (The term pyramid is tempting.) They are told to make lists both of all the people they know and of all the people they might meet, and work out how to approach them. Some of the people high up in the - er pyramid - do make a lot of money. And successful distributors come from all over the world to seminars packed with wannabees. The average amount earned by each distributor is around Pounds 1,300. But the top 1 or 2 per cent of the sales force mop up more than half total earnings of perhaps Pounds 38m. The hierarchy of distributors and bonus systems is mind-blowing. In the US, Amway has sometimes seemed akin to a religious movement. A few years ago, for instance, rival soap giant Procter  Gamble successfully sued Amway distributors for spreading rumours that P  G and its products were instruments of Satan. In Britain the seminars are described as very tasteful - none of this coarse American hard-sell. And a local network can often be traced back to some local dignitary, which is a great consolation for anyone who feels squeamish about peddling soap to his friends - or his friends to Amway. All so much more sophisticated than Russian peasants buying shares in MMM. And quite different of course.                           *       *       * A real stockmarket rally - or just dead cat bounce? Robin Griffiths, technical guru at James Capel, is his normal passionately equivocal self. If the FT-SE 100 index can stay above 3,050 you can relax. (The dreaded head and shoulders pattern was a false omen.) But even if the rally survives, it will run out of steam at 3,200 and dither until the autumn. Then you can expect a surge continuing into the start of next year. Now you know.   Companies:-  MMM-Invest.     Amway Corp.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

China sees ruling Hong Kong after 1997 an internal, domestic  issue. How can the Joint Declaration be secured by Britain  after the transition in 1997?    [Patten] Nobody is arguing for an extension of sovereignty,  nor extending British influence. It's very curious to suggest  that fair elections are a way of extending British influence.  Equally, it is a complete contradiction of the meaning of the  Joint Declaration to say that Britain has no moral  responsibility and no interest in Hong Kong after 1997.    First of all, until 2000, there will be meetings between the  Joint Liaison Group (JLG) and Chinese officials about transition  issues, and that is an agreement made with Britain and China.    Secondly, since the Joint Declaration is a treaty signed  between Britain and China, Britain plainly has an interest in  ensuring that it is properly implemented. It's a treaty lodged  at the United Nations and also a treaty between Britain and  China. We have a moral responsibility to ensure the freedoms  and values of Hong Kong are maintained and will continue after  1997.    It's a moral responsibility and a practical concern but I  totally accept it doesn't involve any aspects of sovereign  action.    [Tsao] But it is a declaration, not a treaty. It is called  a declaration, not even an agreement.    [Patten] It is a recognised treaty lodged in the UN like  other international treaties. China is obliged to abide by it.  Equally, since we are the other name on the document, we have a  continuing interest in it being implemented.    [Tsao] Can you define what you mean by continuing interest?  Would it be regarded as a challenge to China's sovereignty over  Hong Kong? China has its own glossary on the words and terms of  the Joint Declaration, especially on words like ""freedom"" and  ""election."" It is the basis of endless arguments between the  two sides.    [Patten] We can't do anything which involves sovereign  intervention in Hong Kong, but we certainly would, if we  believed the Chinese were breaking their solemn undertaking of  the Joint Declaration. We'll certainly raise it internationally.    For example, freedom of speech. There is no amount of re-  interpretation which can turn freedom of speech into brutal  intervention by Government in the affairs of newspapers or  broadcasting organisations. If China means, by elections,  arranging things so that you get the result you want, then China  should say that. But ""elections"" in the Joint Declaration were  never meant to imply that. Look at the debates that took place  after the document (was signed) in which people talked about a  steady development of representative government.    China can't go back on that now and make words which appear  in the Joint Declaration have meaning which they have never  borne. I'd prefer to believe China means to keep her word  rather than speculate about arrangements that we'd need to  follow if China wasn't keeping her word.    I believe China has given her word to Hong Kong, Britain,  and  the international community. But if it was apparent that China  wasn't doing so, then I'm sure there are a number of options  which would need to be followed by Britain.    [Tsao] During your trip to Australia, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans was the only cabinet  minister who expressed strong support publicly for your  democracy package. Did you not see this as a disappointingly  solitary voice when compared to the reaction you received after  you announced the dem-ocracy package in 1992.    [Patten] I have said at the outset that I haven't travelled  principally to Australia just to persuade Australians to throw  their hats in the ring on the issue of political development. I  am in Australia to encourage more people to do more business in  Hong Kong and to give a reassurance to Australian businesses  that are already in Hong Kong.    But, if you look at the support that we've had this week, it  seems to me difficult to argue that (support) has been in any  way diminished. I think every major Australian newspaper has  had a leading article supporting what we've been doing (in Hong  Kong).    We've had the support of every level of government, from the  states as well as the federal government; from right across the  political spectrum. I was giving evidence to the Foreign  Affairs Joint Committee yesterday and the support, or the  understanding [of the issues], is very considerable indeed.  Hong Kong has good friends around the world and some of our  best friends are in Australia.    [Tsao] Do you think that your Australian visit will be seen  as an attempt to gather international support for your reforms?    [Patten] Intelligent, rational discussion isn't advanced by  taking the frequently repeated propaganda of pro-Beijing  newspapers, or of United Front activists, as representing the  truth and a sensible view of the world. All this propaganda  about internationalisation is ridiculous.    Every time anybody from Hong Kong travels abroad, those  propaganda bugles play their tune about internationalisation.  It's a very curious argument. Are we to believe that when  Chinese officials go abroad and are asked about Hong Kong, they  don't set out their views and thoughts about Hong Kong? Of  course they do.    Given that, everywhere I've been, there's been a recognition  that resolving successfully the argument between China and  Britain is a matter for China and Britain. But equally,  everywhere I've been and places I haven't been, people take an  active interest in what happens in Hong Kong. They do it  because Hong Kong is such a regional and global asset. Those  are the realities. No amount of propaganda from the New China  News Agency (Xinhua) or from the communist newspapers in Hong  Kong is going to change that.    Sir Leon Brittan (Vice-President of the European  Commission) is to visit China this month to express concerns  that British business may suffer discrimination in trade with  China because of the Hong Kong democracy debate.    Is it not likely an EU (European Union) consensus may be  difficult to negotiate because Europe does not have a united  position on this matter.    [Patten] First of all, it's not for me to talk about British  trade with China. It's not one of my responsibilities.  Secondly, Chinese officials keep on saying there is no  relationship between politics and trade. I assume when they say  that they mean it.    Were they to behave in a different way, it would have  profound implications for the China-European Union Cooperation  Agreement and it would have profound implications for China's  application to join the GATT.    It would also have distorted some other arguments China is  having around the world about trade issues.    I don't believe China will be well advised to ignore what  the  Chinese leader and other Chinese officials have said. [sentence  as published] As for Sir Leon's visit, I know very little about  that. The visit has been long planned.    [Tsao] You've spent more than 10 days in Australia,  including a private holiday. Have you, since you left Hong  Kong, being in a more relaxed mood, come to a firmer idea about  when to table the rest of your bill and in what form? [Patten]  Nothing I've thought or done in Australia during my leave has  changed the decision about the legislative process made before I  came.    We still want to return to the negotiating table with China.  Realistically, that seems less and less a possibility. When the  present bill is concluded, we'll have to move on to the last  remaining legislative brick and place that in the wall.    That will depend on the timing of that and crucially, when  the present bill emerges from the Legislative Council.  [sentence as published]    It's worth noting the present bill has been in the  Legislative Council [Legco] for nearly two and a half months and  there are about four months until Legco rises for the summer  recess.    There's a recognition that if we were able to get talks  going  again, we'd have to go into a more intensified form of  negotiation -- like a week or two -- to sort things out during  prolonged negotiations. I wish time was on our side, but it's  not.    [Tsao] Although there is still no official response from  China to your latest proposal on the airport project, some  peripheral pro- Chinese voices have called for additional  injections of funding, over and above the $6bn reportedly  offered by the Hong Kong government to China.    There is plenty of money left in the government reserve. Why  is the Government still so financially cautious given that the  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) requires that $25bn be left to  the future special administrative region (SAR) government.    [Patten] We've put forward, in good conscience and with  considerable sincerity, a financial package which appears to me  to include all the points that China put to us last year. I  hope China can react positively and quickly, but I don't think I  can react to the reports of the so-called friends of China.    I just hope some of those socalled friends of China would be  friends of Hong Kong.    [Tsao] You have encouraged Australian companies to compete  in bidding for projects in the new airport plan.    You have also assured them there will be fair treatment from  the government on assessments of tenders.    But China claims unofficially that some British companies  have been given favourable treatment when contracts have been  granted for the Chek Lap Kok project.    [Patten] That's, of course, a load of rubbish. Of the large  projects, about 60 percent have been won by Japanese-led  consortia. That paranoia should be put on one side.    [Tsao] Equally pressing is the issue of the Final Court of  Appeal. Legco has reached a consensus on the agreement between  the two governments. When will there be a resolution, so that a  Final Court of Appeal, which is acceptable to Legco, will be put  in place?    [Patten] We're working on draft legislation for the Final  Court of Appeal.    We then have to put it to legislators. I hope they will take  a swift decision. I don't think there is any chance of being  able to renegotiate the settlement made in the JLG [Sino-British  Joint Liaison Group].    [Tsao] You've always said Legco's opinions should be  listened to and respected, yet they clearly rejected this  agreement.    [Patten] We'll have to see what they say when they're  presented with the actual legislation. If Legco says we prefer  no Court of Appeal rather than one which reflects the agreement  then we'll have to take account of that. That's an obligation.    We've have no other alternative. The Legislative Council has  the responsibility of legislating.     "

Dr Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of the National Security Council, Iran's top foreign policy body, said the 'no-fly zone' imposed by the US, Britain and France over southern Iraq would help protect the region's inhabitants from the forces of President Saddam Hussein only if supplemented by a ban on heavy weapons similar to that already imposed in the Kurdish region to the north. He was speaking to journalists on Wednesday night during a private visit to London. Dr Rowhani's comments indicate that the Iranian leadership is closely monitoring western policy towards Iraq from the sidelines, in the hope that external pressure will eventually topple Mr Saddam's regime. He said the west had missed an opportunity to do so immediately after the 1991 Gulf war, when Shia Moslems in the south and Kurds in the north rose up against their ruler. Mr Saddam's survival, he added, presented the west with 'a difficult dilemma - and it has not decided what to do.' Dr Rowhani played down western fears that removing a strong central government in Baghdad could lead to Iraq's partition along ethnic and sectarian lines. Instead, he said, negotiating a secure future for the people of Iraq was one of many regional issues on which the west shared common interests with Iran, if only countries such as the US and Britain could overcome differences with the Islamic republic.

0,FT932-6040 ,"FT932-6040 _AN-DFACAAAEFT 930601   FT  01 JUN 93 / Brussels backs UK decision to leave ERM: Chancellor is warned he must take tough measures on deficit      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   BRITAIN was right to withdraw from the European exchange rate mechanism, says a confidential paper from the European Commission to be presented to senior officials from central banks and finance ministries today. Brussels warns, however, that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, may need to take tough measures to curb the country's budget deficit. It suggests that tax rises and/or spending cuts may have to be more severe than planned at present. The Commission's assessment, which is likely to arouse protest from Britain's EC partners, is to be discussed by the EC's secretive monetary commission. The meeting is due to discuss the UK's programme to make its economy ready for economic and monetary union by the end of this decade, should parliament approve such a step. The Commission's paper suggests that Britain can more easily rebalance its fiscal and monetary policies outside the ERM. It also suggests that getting the right balance might be more difficult if the Bank of England were independent of the Treasury. However, some European officials fear the Commission has gone too far in an attempt to appease Mr John Major's embattled government while the Maastricht treaty is still unratified by Britain. They find it extremely odd that the Commission should appear to cast doubt on the benefits of Britain's membership of the ERM. The paper points out that the UK has made little progress towards making the Bank of England independent. But its central finding that the present relationship between Bank and Treasury should help UK policy makers push through necessary changes is likely to be disputed in Germany, France, Spain, Belgium or the Netherlands. These are all countries that either have independent central banks or are planning to introduce independence. While the Commission warns that the UK might have to tighten fiscal policy more than planned, it says the method of doing so should be left to the UK government. Under the principle of 'subsidiarity', as much decision-making as possible should be left with national and regional authorities, so Mr Clarke would have the difficult choice of whether to raise taxes or cut public spending. The paper discusses the UK's latest plan for bringing the economy back into balance, which is understood to repeat the measures announced in Mr Norman Lamont's last Budget in March. It also outlines the government's medium-term financial strategy for reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement from about 8 per cent of gross domestic product in the present financial year to 3.75 per cent by 1997-98. The document's bias towards fiscal tightness might encourage some to infer that the commission would like to see lower British interest rates to stimulate investment and growth. While the paper in general is likely to meet with approval among the UK monetary authorities, neither the Treasury nor the Bank of England is in any mood to reduce interest rates. Elsewhere in the EC, there is sufficient disenchantment with UK policy for the paper to cause a row. Only last week, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank president, angrily declared that currency co-operation in Europe had 'collapsed' and implicitly criticised Britain, Italy and Spain for having engaged in the competitive devaluation of their currencies since the ERM crisis last September. It is also not so long since Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was castigating Britain for 'social dumping'. The devalued pound and the UK's refusal to agree to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty were viewed in the Commission as a deliberate move by the UK government to lure investment and employment from Britain's EC partners. Although there are signs of warmer relations between France and Britain since Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right coalition took office, France's economic establishment remains critical of UK policies since sterling left the ERM. Some French officials point out that Britain has not been able to reap the same benefits as France, where continued ERM membership has delivered lower long-term interest rates than is the case in the UK. Others make no secret of their concern about Britain's increased competitiveness on the depressed export markets of continental Europe.

In evidence to the commission in Washington on management and labour relations, Mr Edmonds will say Britain's industrial-relations system is likely to be 'stuck in limbo' for the time being. But, he continues in written evidence, EU social directives imposed on Britain will rescue the country from the worst excesses of Labour market de-regulation within the next five years. Mr Edmonds is taking comfort from a number of important European legal rulings in recent weeks on part-time work, the transfer of ownership of an enterprise and collective redundancies, which have strengthened the position of trade unions. The GMB leader will tell the commission that Britain cannot escape from the introduction of works councils - consultative and information forums in large companies - inside the EU. Multinationals are unlikely to establish them everywhere but in the UK, he said. British employers will also be greatly inconvenienced by EU directives which seek to improve the conditions of part-time workers and other vulnerable groups. Mr Edmonds will tell the commission that 'whenever a new directive is signed by the other 11 European countries and British workers do not benefit, everybody's trade union will slap in a claim for similar treatment.

0,FT923-6380 ,"FT923-6380 _AN-CHZBXACFFT 920825   FT  25 AUG 92 / Present pain for future gain: European economists say the UK has little choice but to hold its ground within the ERM      By DAVID MARSH   The British government, facing the most serious sterling pressure since joining the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990, was yesterday battening down the currency hatches. Concerted central bank intervention to limit the D-Mark's rise against the weak dollar staved off the immediate risk of higher British interest rates. But, with the dollar closing in London at just above DM1.40, the threat of a serious monetary crisis may grow. The message from Germany is uncompromising: Britain should stand firm. 'We are seeing exaggerated speculative movements where everyone is moving into the D-Mark,' Mr Axel Siedenberg, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, said yesterday. To show currency markets that it is serious about combating inflation through the ERM discipline, he says the British government will probably need to send a 'firm signal' by raising UK banks' base rates from their current level of 10 per cent. Whatever the outcome of the next few days, Britain will remain caught in the crosswinds of an international currency storm whose causes, in both the US and Europe, are largely beyond the UK's control. The US has been easing monetary policy to try to end recession. On the other hand, the Bundesbank  -which effectively sets the interest rate floor for the whole ERM area  - is keeping interest rates high to counter the reunification-induced rise in German inflation. The foreign exchanges are also being buffeted by the latest opinion polls showing increasing French opposition to the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union. The currency markets believe a 'no' vote in the French referendum next month would increase demand for the D-Mark  - and thus heighten disruption in the ERM, the EC's exchange rate stabilisation scheme which has functioned without a full-scale realignment since January 1987. The political complications over ratifying the Maastricht treaty have compounded Britain's economic predicament. Having described the ERM in September 1990, a fortnight before Britain joined, as 'a modern day gold standard with the D-Mark as the anchor', Mr John Major is presiding over Britain's longest peacetime recession since 1930-31. Yet the UK government's ability to cut interest rates to revive the economy is constrained by the tight credit policies of the Bundesbank. Since interest rates have fallen more slowly than inflation since autumn 1990, UK real interest rates have risen to an annual 6 per cent from 4 per cent since October 1990 (see chart). Calls from some UK politicians and economists for Britain to devalue sterling against the D-Mark have been heightened by Britain's current account deficit, underlined by a further widening in the shortfall for July to Pounds 934m. In spite of economic decline, Britain will record a current account deficit of between 1.5 and 2 per cent of gross domestic product this year. The UK's ERM experience so far has been in sharp contrast to France, which managed to improve industrial competitiveness after adopting an austerity policy which stabilised the franc against the D-Mark during the 1980s. The pain caused by Britain's transition to a low inflation economy has prompted debate around Europe about whether the UK should change policies. Most leading European economists, however, say that Britain has no choice but to keep taking the D-Mark medicine  - even though this may, in the short term, force a highly unpopular increase in the cost of credit. 'After the UK failed during the 1980s to bring down inflation with its own efforts, improving anti-inflation performance through an external constraint represents Britain's last hope,' says Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, international economist at the Cologne-based Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, the industry-backed economic research body. 'Britain has to grit its teeth and press on.' The option of devaluation within the ERM would not allow British interest rates to fall below German levels. Such a step might even send sterling interest rates higher if the markets believed Britain's anti-inflation resolve were flagging, according to Mr Andre Szasz, executive director of the Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank. He says experience shows that 'devaluation ends up increasing interest rates rather than lowering them'. When the Dutch government  - against the advice of the Nederlandsche Bank  - devalued the guilder by 2 per cent against the D-Mark in 1983, Mr Szasz says this had a negative impact on financial market sentiment. 'The government caused Dutch interest rates for years to be higher than would otherwise have been the case.' Another experienced continental central banker, speaking anonymously, advised Britain to 'stick it out' because 'all the alternatives are awful'. Having decided much later than France to bind itself to ERM discipline, Britain is only halfway through a four-year battle to convince foreign exchange markets that it is serious in trying to defeat inflation, he says. If the UK took the drastic step of leaving the ERM, cutting interest rates and allowing the pound to float, it would take 10 years to restore confidence on the financial markets, he adds. Even if Britain departed from the ERM, it could not wholly insulate itself from the influence of high German interest rates, owing to the UK's strong trade and investment links with the rest of the continent, according to Mr Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'Even if you are not in the ERM, you are not outside the German monetary area, and this is a zone of high interest rates. There is no hiding place.' Mr Eric Taze-Bernard, chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, advises central banks around the continent to defend present ERM parities with all means available during the nervous period up to the French referendum on September 20. In view of the large credit facilities available to central banks whose currencies fall to their ERM floors, countries may be able to maintain present currency rates without having to raise interest rates, he believes. Mr Peter vanden Houte, international economist at Banque Bruxelles-Lambert in Brussels, also favours a tough line. 'The British are being very masochistic in pegging the pound to the D-Mark. But there is nothing else they can do.' He says that organising a moderate sterling devaluation of about 5 to 6 per cent within the ERM would have little significant impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. Leaving the mechanism altogether, allowing sterling to float down to perhaps DM2.20 to DM2.40 from its present level of about DM2.80, would be politically impossible during Britain's current six months as president of the EC. Britain's ERM difficulties represent the latest example of the system's external constraints colliding with a member government's domestic policy priorities. For several reasons, however, Britain's problems appear exceptionally dire. After a 2.4 per cent decline in GDP in 1991, City economists forecast a further 0.5 per cent contraction in 1992  - the worst two-year performance of any ERM member since the European Monetary System started in 1979. Because EMS members have become increasingly reluctant to devalue, countries which run into exchange rate difficulties can no longer expect to be bailed out through agreement on a general currency realignment, as was the case in the early EMS years. Mr Ernst-Moritz Lipp, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, illustrates this point by pointing to France's refusal to devalue the franc during the past few years. This upset chances for currency realignment based on a revaluation of the D-Mark at the time of German unification in 1990-91  - when it would have been economically beneficial for Europe. In spite of governments' antipathy to devaluation, Mr Lipp believes pressures are building for an ERM realignment this autumn. The strains are focused not simply on Britain, but also on the lira, which has also slid close to its D-Mark floor. Mr Lipp suggests that Britain should join forces with France to persuade Germany to revalue the D-Mark. If this fails, Britain should devalue unilaterally in order to 'decouple' from the D-Mark  - a move, he says, which could be presented as a legitimate reaction to the extreme monetary pressures caused by German unification. A powerful reason behind France's commitment to a firm franc has been its desire to put into place the conditions for European economic and monetary union. The French government sees the establishment of a single European currency, to be run by a European central bank, as the best way to end the present dominance of the D-Mark. This justifies the heavy economic and political capital France has invested in the Maastricht process  - and also underlines the high stakes in next month's French referendum. Yesterday's international intervention to support the dollar suggests that central banks have adopted the policy of doing everything possible to steady the foreign exchanges before the French vote. Their inability, however, to stop the US currency's slide indicates, however, how ineffective that effort may be. According to Mr Brendan Brown, international economist at Mitsubishi Finance in London, the Bank of England may allow the pound to fall within the next few days to its lowest possible ERM limit against the D-Mark. Under the rules of the EMS, this would oblige the Bundesbank to intervene to sell D-Marks, inflating domestic German liquidity and threatening further unwelcome expansion of the German money supply. This, Mr Brown suggests, might force the German government to abandon its present reluctance to revalue the D-Mark. Britain's dilemma is a cruel one. The measure most needed to convince the foreign exchange markets of the government's anti-inflation commitment  - a rise in interest rates  - is precisely the step which could risk turning the UK's recession into a full-scale slump. Mr Major must hope for a French 'yes' next month, followed by an earlier-than-expected easing of Bundesbank policies. If these hopes are not realised, and the dollar's slide continues, the pressures to break free from the ERM may intensify.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

The reason that prompted the ban in the first place is  still there, the 1982 Israeli invasion of south Lebanon. The  combination of air raids, strafing, piracy, abductions, combing  of towns and villages and their devastation and depopulation is  an invasion in another guise. By lifting the arms embargo on  Israel, the United Kingdom is, in effect, rewarding the Israeli  aggressors and furnishing them with the means to bolster their  superiority and pursue their recklessness and acts of terror and  aggression.    Advancing an alibi for removing the embargo, the United  Kingdom cited ""encouraging developments in the peace process,  specifically the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho"", to  quote British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. More  surprisingly, London has made lifting the arms ban on the Arabs  conditional on the bilateral talks moving forward. The party  that must take the blame for the failure of these talks to  advance is Israel itself. This is an example of the double  standard in UK policies -- one standard for Israel, another  against the Arabs.    By ending the ban on arms sales to Israel and making its  revocation regarding the Arabs conditional on the peace process  making headway, the British Government has set a serious  precedent in international relations. Britain has underscored  its blind bias toward Israel, its aggressive and terrorist  policies, and has stabbed the Arabs and their worthy causes.  The British Government defended its decision by citing  encouraging developments, sidestepping the facts and the  substance of the peace process. Just what are these  developments that prompted this decision? Do they include the  substitution of Israeli withdrawal as stipulated by UN Security  Council resolutions with the redeployment of forces provided for  in the self-rule agreement? Is the continuing existence of  Jewish settlements and consequently Israeli occupation an  encouraging development? Does Israel's responsibility for  security and political matters in the self-rule area or its  control over roads, crossings, and bridges also rank as  encouraging developments? Does the United Kingdom really rate  these as truly encouraging developments, or is it knowingly and  deliberately pursuing deceptive policies calculated to mislead  world opinion and liquidate the Palestinian people's rights?!    The United Kingdom is all too aware that the self-rule plan  does not meet the Palestinian people's aspirations. The United  Kingdom is equally aware that Israel continues to cling to  occupation, and thus is not eligible for any reward. Nor should  Israel's repressive machine be rewarded for its savagery and  terror. It is not right that the Israeli military should be  furnished with what it takes to pursue coercive and genocidal  programs.    It is worthwhile to make one thing abundantly clear:  Britain's pro-Israel stance is bound to further complicate  things in the region. It would have been more helpful if  Britain had acted to deter Israel's aggression and brought  pressure to bear in the interest of making it comply with UN  resolutions. The lifting of the arms embargo will only  exacerbate Israel's excesses and intransigence and its rejection  of the bases on which the peace process was launched. Britain  should have acted to end Israel's recklessness and arrogance,  and should have helped the cause of an even-handed and universal  peace settlement in the Middle East.     "
0,FT941-1004 ,"FT941-1004 _AN-EC1CRAABFT 940328   FT  28 MAR 94 / UK isolated as Spain agrees EU vote compromise      By LIONEL BARBER      IOANNINA, GREECE   The UK found itself isolated and under intense pressure last night to accept a compromise over reforms to European Union voting procedures as Spain signalled it was ready to accept a deal. After two days of talks in Greece, Britain was faced with a proposal that falls well short of its demands and leaves the planned enlargement of the EU on a knife-edge. The UK government will now decide at a cabinet meeting tomorrow how to react to the compromise, arranged by the Greek presidency. EU foreign ministers said they wanted to complete a deal by 6pm tomorrow. The UK met immovable opposition over its requests to maintain a threshold of 23 votes as the blocking minority after the admission of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union next year. Spain, which had also resisted voting reforms, and Britain are being offered a 'reasonable' delay on decisions that are opposed by countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes, the proposed new threshold to block legislation. During this period, the European Commission and the presidency will be obliged to seek a consensus, 'always respecting the rules of procedure', according to the text. Senior Union officials said this language expressly excludes an open-ended discussion. British demands for an indefinite delay on controversial decisions also ran into strong resistance. Current rules would still apply whereby one member state can call for a vote on controversial legislation, on the basis of a simple majority. The proposed deal attempts to strike a delicate balance. It recognises the need to protect large countries from being outvoted easily in an expanded Union. But it tilts decisively against introducing rules which could paralyse decision-making. The deal does not meet UK demands for legally-binding guarantees preserving the power of two large states to join with one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The latest twist in the power-sharing dispute confronts Mr John Major, the prime minister, with an acute dilemma. Either Mr Major accepts an offer which could trigger a revolt among Tory Euro-sceptics, or he rejects the compromise and risks bearing sole responsibility for delaying enlargement, which has long been supported by the British government. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said 'serious work' had been accomplished over the weekend, but he declined to predict the outcome of the cabinet meeting. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, echoing comments from other EU foreign ministers, suggested Britain had received the best terms available. Without agreement on voting rights this week, he forecast 'an absolute crisis' in the EU. Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, spoke of a 'breakthrough', but Mr Hurd was more cautious. He said the UK's partners now accepted that the relationship between the size of member states and their votes could not be brushed under the carpet. This issue had to be tackled 'root and branch' at the 1996 conference to review the Maastricht treaty, said Mr Hurd. Although Britain's position will be crucial, other countries voiced some reservations about the deal, raising the danger of amendments later this week which could delay settlement.

The task of the Nineties, for  Britain and Germany, is to make a political reality of that  cultural reality.    Had the Iron Curtain not divided Europe after 1945, none of  the founders of European integration would have ever thought of  excluding countries such as Czechoslovakia or Poland. We must  project security and stability from our part of Europe to other  European countries in the East. Eventually, they should  participate fully in all European institutions -- in particular  the European Union [EU] and NATO.    At its last summit in January 1994, NATO declared that it  was  open to new members. The European Community summit in  Copenhagen confirmed the prospect of membership for those  countries which have concluded Europe Agreements.    There are three fundamental reasons why we should consider  enlarging the EU and NATO: security, prosperity and shared  values.    We shall not be secure if uncertainty and anxiety reign just  beyond our borders. Stability in central Europe enhances our  own stability.    The basis of our prosperity is the open world trading  system.  We have now, on our doorstep, dynamic economies with highly  skilled labour, rich in ideas and full of entrepreneurial  vigour. The fastest growing stock market in the world last year  was not in Shanghai or Canton: it was in Warsaw.    We and our trading partners to the East are already  benefiting from this. EC exports to central Europe increased by  87 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and now stand at around US$11  billion. The central Europeans themselves sell half of their  exports in the EC. The Europe Agreements stipulate free trade by  the end of 1995 -- with a few exceptions such as agriculture.    But more remains to be done. Too often the EC reserves its  greatest trade restrictions for precisely those goods that the  central Europeans produce most efficiently.    We have to face new competition. Closer ties with the  economies in central Europe will mean more structural adjustment  for us. But those structural changes will open the way for  enormous overall increases in wealth -- for us and for our  partners.    Last, but not least, culture. Our Eastern neighbours belong  to Europe, not just as a matter of geography or economics; there  is a common culture. We have to increase the exchange of ideas  -- particularly in the humanities and the social sciences.    A sober assessment of our interests shows that they all  point  in the direction of enlarging the EU and NATO. That cannot  happen overnight. Guarantees that exist only on paper do not  contribute to security. Security guarantees must grow out of a  sense of shared values, common interests and a common destiny.    Enlarging NATO is a decision for the Alliance as a whole-not  just for Britain and Germany. All its members, above all the  United States which continues to do so much to maintain European  security, must give their wholehearted consent.    The Western EU is developing its role as the European pillar  of NATO and as the defence component of the EU. Britain and  Germany are working together with others to involve the central  Europeans and the Baltic states in the work of the WEU [Western  European Union].    New members must be capable of implementing EU law. That  presupposes a competent administration and a proper system of  justice. They must be capable of competing in the Single  Market. On our side, too, there will have to be changes. EU  institutions and EU policies will have to adapt to a wider  community -- a community of 20 or more members. We must ensure  that at every stage a wider community becomes a stronger one.  Both for the EU and NATO, widening must not mean weakening.    Those are goals for the medium-term. In 1994, we must open  ourselves to our neighbours in as many ways as possible. The  forthcoming German EU presidency will spare no efforts to draw  our Eastern neighbours closer.    But in all this, the transatlantic relationship remains a  fixed anchor point for the EU. Without a continuing stake by  the United States in European affairs, enlargement of the EU and  NATO cannot succeed.    The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe also  has a vital role. It is the only institution embracing all 53  European and North American states. Through the CSCE we can  assure that developments in West and Central Europe are not  misinterpreted by our Eastern partners.    To enlarge the Alliance in a way that made those inside it  more secure but left those outside feeling threatened would be  no service to Europe. That means that other countries must be  convinced that this is a development in which they are not  ignored.    No country is an island, whatever its geography. We have a  duty to our European neighbours. They had to live under imposed  isolation from West Europe. They are now returning to freedom  and to the rule of the law. This is a historic task. Britain  and Germany have committed themselves to this goal for the rest  of the century.     "
0,FT921-16179 ,"FT921-16179 _AN-CAFBMAAWFT 920106   FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Thursday puzzle   Why must the next UK general election be held on a Thursday? An election can in law take place on any weekday. In 1924, for instance, the voters of Britain went to the polls on a Wednesday, and in 1931 the date was a Tuesday. But since 1935, general elections have always been held on a Thursday. According to David Butler, the well-known psephologist, Thursday is generally considered to be the least inconvenient day of the week for the purpose of an election. However, others have suggested that it may have something to do with the fact that it is the day before pay-day, and in olden times the lower orders would not have any money to spend on rival distractions to the polling booth. Whatever the reason, the next general election may well be the last to be held on a Thursday. The vast majority of Britain's EC partners hold theirs on a Sunday and no doubt Brussels will soon be arguing for a common electoral policy requiring Britain to hold elections at weekends.

In a speech in New York, he said Britain could not  understand  why the United States did not back plans to send an extra 8,250  troops and instead approved an increase of just 3,500.    ""We must not put ourselves in the situation where we lack  the  tools to carry out the job,"" he told the Carnegie Council for  Ethics and International Affairs.    He urged the United States to back the full increase when  the  proposal returned to the UN Security Council and ""to throw their  full weight behind the peace process.""    Mr Rifkind will intensify his campaign when he meets U.S.  Defence Secretary William Perry in Washington tomorrow. He will  attempt to persuade him to support the full deployments of extra  peacekeepers and to send American ground troops for the first  time.    Britain believes a substantial U.S. force of ground troops  is  vital if peace is to be restored successfully across Bosnia.    In his speech, Mr Rifkind made clear that the UN would  maintain its impartiality in Bosnia. He said air strikes could  be launched against any of the warring factions if they were  putting UN forces under threat and if a request for air support  came from the UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose.  But he warned it was important to weigh up the consequences of  future air strikes.    ""We must think where this kind of activity is likely to lead  us and be prepared to manage our future responses so that we get  where we want to go,"" he said.     "

Spending fell Pounds 198.7m - a 4 per cent drop - in the 12 months to July. The federation said there had been an 'across-the-board slump' with retailers selling 19.3m fewer pairs of shoes, boots and slippers. The downturn represented a 7.6 per cent fall in volume sales, it added. Figures compiled for the federation show a further decline in the first half of the year with volume sales down by 8.6 per cent. In July, the worst month for the sector, sales of men's footwear declined 22 per cent and women's 10.2 per cent. Weakening demand has forced employers to cut the total workforce by 6.2 per cent to 36,000, although the federation said this trend was likely to be reversed in forthcoming months. The main impact of the downturn appears to have been felt by overseas manufacturers who saw direct exports to the UK decline by 18 per cent in the 12 months to July. Companies based in the Far East, which have the lion's share of the export market to Britain - Pounds 217.8m out of a total of Pounds 299m  - saw volume sales fall by 19 per cent. Worst affected was Hong Kong where sales fell by 70 per cent. Sterling devaluation, meanwhile, helped UK manufacturers offset poor demand at home by increasing exports by 17 per cent. Exports of children's footwear showed the strongest growth, up 92 per cent. While welcoming the increase in overseas orders, the federation said export production represented only about 10 per cent of total output.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The department announced that 126,000 units of blood  products  manufactured by UB Plasma, of Koblenz, had been bought by the  National Health Service.    Last year Britain imported 120,000 doses of a product to  boost immunity. Since 1989 the NHS has bought 6,000 doses of  albumin, also made by UB Plasma, to treat severe blood loss.  ``Because of the length of time, it must be assumed that some of  these batches have been used,'' a department spokesman said last  night.    The other countries which have decided to withdraw suspect  blood products are France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria,  the Czech Republic and Greece. At the same time the Greek health  ministry said it would take legal action against the German  exporters of possibly untested plasma.    It is feared that suspect products may also have reached the  Middle East.    Remaining stocks in Britain are being urgently recalled by  Immono, an Austrian company which bought the consignment from  Germany and exported it here, said the department spokesman.  ``However, we are absolutely sure that these stocks were  batch-tested by the National Institute for Biological Standards,  Testing and Control and there was no trace of HIV,'' he said.    The recall was ``purely precautionary and is to ensure total  patient safety''.    Authorities are seeking to establish how many doses of the  immunity booster Gammabulin have been used. People with impaired  immune systems or those travelling abroad and at risk of  hepatitis would have been among those intramuscularly injected.  The other product -- Human Albumin Solution, 4.5 per cent --  would be used in any situation in which blood was lost in  quantity, such as accidents, surgery or a complicated birth. The  spokesman said: ``There is no evidence that HIV has been  transmitted by these two products. We are self-sufficient in  blood and plasma and we do import blood products which are  licensed by the Medicines Control Agency.''    Britain does not import blood -- only blood products. Since  1985, when the risks of spreading HIV were realized, all blood  factors have been heat-treated.    Mr David Blunkett, Shadow Health Secretary, urged the  Government to make a clear statement to allay fears.    Dr Harold Gunson, director of the National Blood Authority,  said: ``British patients can be reassured that this blood in  England and Scotland is the safest that one can have in the  world.    ``We have been fully testing all our blood since 1985 for  HIV.''    But he added: ``We do import some final purified plasma  products.'' He did not know whether any had come from Germany.    British military authorities in Germany urged the small  number of people treated in German hospitals in emergencies in  the past 10 years to have themselves tested if they were  worried. Pentagon officials issued similar instructions to US  Servicemen in Germany.    In Germany, where blood donations are paid for and where a  number of people connected with UB Plasma have been arrested,  there is evidence that the health ministry is uncertain of the  extent of the spread of suspect products.    When the scandal broke a month ago, the semi-autonomous  Federal Health Agency was dissolved for failing to pursue  evidence that UB Plasma had flooded the market with possibly  untested blood products. Then on Thursday it was alleged that  the firm had knowingly released ``slightly infected'' blood on  to the market.     "

The National People's Congress (NPC) presidium suggested the  statement--proposed by Hong Kong delegate Cheng Yiu-tong, and  supported by more than 30 delegates--be referred to the legal  committee, rather than being passed during this plenary session.  It appears the move is to cool the atmosphere created by the  row with Britain as China accelerates efforts to unite the  people of Hong Kong.    Mr Cheng proposed using legislation to defy the Legislative  Council, district boards and municipal councils set up in Hong  Kong if Britain and China failed to agree on democratic reform.  His proposal states China has a right to re-organise the  government under the Basic Law and the decisions of the Congress  and its Standing Committee. Mr Cheng said yesterday his  proposal was not dismissed and suggested the Congress chairmen  might have felt it was ""not the best timing"" to make such a  statement.    In a separate move, Britain's ambassador to Beijing, Sir  Robin McLaren, dismissed Chinese suggestions that introducing  the single-seat, single-vote election system was a ""backward  step"" in democracy for Hong Kong. He was responding to comments  made last week by China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu  Ping, who is the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office. Sir Robin said: ""That is not the view of either the  British Government or the Hong Kong Government, and I don't  think it is the view of Legco, since it has frequently supported  the single-seat, single-vote system. It does not seem to me  that 60 constituencies for a population of six million is  excessive.""     "

The RAF is seeking to replace the Hercules -- the workhorse  for the British forces in Bosnia -- with the C130J aircraft  bought ""off-the-shelf"" from America in a multi-million pound  contract.    But the Government is under pressure from the aerospace  industry to support an eight-nation consortium which wants  British backing for the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) project that  it claims would provide 10,000 British jobs over the next 10  years.    The Commons Select Committee on Defence is expected to throw  its weight behind the FLA with a report on 30 March calling for  the RAF Hercules fleet to be refurbished and the FLA consortium,  known as Euroflag, to be given government backing.    Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, threatened  to resign if Britain pulled out of the European Fighter Aircraft  [EFA] project, but he has told colleagues he will not resign  over the FLA project.    He is ready to support the RAF. He does not believe a  replacement for the Hercules has the strategic importance of the  EFA, a high-technology project, capable of defending Britain  into the next century. However, buying from the United States  could upset trade and industry ministers, and open the  Government to attack from the aerospace industry that it would  threaten thousands of jobs. Defence ministers are braced for a  Cabinet row later this year, when a feasibility study is  completed.    British Aerospace, which forms the British part of the FLA  consortium, is lobbying hard, warning it could damage British  participation in civil aircraft projects, such as the future  generation of the Airbus.

0,FT934-12958 ,"FT934-12958 _AN-DJXAPAECFT 931023   FT  23 OCT 93 / London Motor Show: Indulgence first, reality later      By STUART MARSHALL   PICKING the star of the London Motor Show depends on your attitude to cars. Are they a business tool, a mobile extension to the home - or sheer indulgence? If an indulgence, there are several on which to feast your eyes at Earl's Court. One is the AC Ace, a Ford V8-engined convertible which is hand-built in Surrey a stone's throw from the old Brooklands race track. The Ace is put forward as a realistic alternative to the class leader among mature motorists' sports cars, the Mercedes SL. While the Ace is making its world debut, the DB7 that promises to be the best Aston Martin for two decades has been seen already at Geneva and Frankfurt. Powered by a supercharged Jaguar 3.2-litre, in-line, six-cylinder engine producing 335 horsepower, it is a two-by-two of head-turning elegance. An Ace will be around Pounds 50,000; a DB7 - - on sale from next April - nearer Pounds 80,000. But these are modest prices compared with the Pounds 150,000 Ferrari will ask for its latest offering, the 456GT, when UK deliveries start early in 1994. Is Toyota's new, twin-turbocharged, Pounds 37,500, three-litre V6 Supra an indulgence, too? I suppose so, although this ultra-civilised very high performer might appeal to a young entrepreneur seeking dashing business transport. Worth looking at, if only enviously, are the latest manifestations of the seemingly everlasting Porsche 911 and the BMW 840Ci coupe. The Porsche, as always, has an air-cooled, horizontally-opposed six. The BMW is powered by a four-litre V8 instead of the 850Ci's five-litre V12 and, especially with automatic transmission, is sheer joy to drive. All these high-profile, glamorous cars are the icing on the motor show cake. Of greater personal interest to most visitors are cars that might realistically grace their garages, or decorate their drives, given an indulgent employer or understanding bank manager. There are a lot of them at Earls Court, although not all will be on sale immediately. Ford's Probe, seen for the first time with right-hand steering and due to reach Britain early in 1994, is the overdue successor to the Capri. Alhough Ford-badged, it is built at Mazda's US factory and will be offered with either a Mazda two-litre, four-cylinder engine or Ford's own 2.5-litre V6. A pretty car, it competes with the 2.5-litre, V6-engined Vauxhall Calibra. The Honda Civic coupe, shown first at Frankfurt, is another international car designed for Europe, made in the US and not even sold in Japan. The South Korean Kia Mentor 1.6-litre, a neat, power-steered, four-door saloon, looks most attractive and will be in British showrooms soon, priced keenly to undersell most of its European and Japanese counterparts. The new Seat Ibiza, made by Volkswagen's Spanish arm, will soon be in Britain with three or five doors. Think of it as a cut-price VW Golf equivalent. Toyota's new three-litre Lexus GS300 (on sale in the UK now at Pounds 31,950) is a challenger to the Mercedes E-Class and BMW 5-Series. Mazda's Xedos 9, available in Germany but not due in Britain until early in the New Year, is related closely to the Xedos 6 but has V6 engines of two or 2.5 litres. A Volvo saloon or estate with turbo-charging and a top speed of close to 150 mph (240 kph) sounds like a contradiction in terms. But the company thinks the 850 T-5 will snap at the heels of Pounds 24,000-25,000 cars in the BMW and Saab Turbo class. There is a bullish air on the Mercedes-Benz stand where the new C-Class has pride of place. Last week, Mercedes-Benz UK took orders for nearly 800 vehicles, of which 500 were C-Class. This roomier, curvier replacement for the best-selling 190 seems bound to become the benchmark for compact executive saloons. All the engines, including diesels with four and five cylinders, are multi-valve designs. Prices, starting at Pounds 17,600 for a 1.8-litre C180, are only slightly higher than those of the 190 equivalents. Also worth a look in this size class is the latest Volkswagen Passat, face-lifted for 1944 and bristling with safety features, twin air-bags among them. It is expected to be priced from Pounds 13,000-22,000 when it arrives in the UK in January. The first Golf estate, with 25 per cent more luggage space than the hatchback, and the new Golf Cabriolet are both on show at Earl's Court and will reach Britain early in 1994. Can the on/off-road, recreational, four-wheel drive market absorb any more new models? Toyota clearly thinks so because its 4Runner, with three-litre petrol or diesel engines, joins the long established Land Cruisers. It looks as hefty as the Vauxhall Frontera and also shares a pick-up truck's underpinnings. Land Rover, meanwhile, is showing the best all-round version of the Discovery yet: a diesel automatic with a hush pack. This is quiet, has excelllent fuel economy and is car-like to drive in town. On Fiat's stand, the Punto - due in Britain next spring - makes its UK debut. The London Motor Show at Earl's Court is open daily from 9.30am-7.30pm (9pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) and closes on Sunday October 31 at 6pm. Admission is Pounds 6.50 (Pounds 5 after 5pm) with reductions for children and pensioners.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7999 Amusement and Recreation, NEC.

He pointed out the absurdity of the fact that, under current educational guidelines, 'school children are required to study natural sciences but not economics, which . . . is far more relevant for daily life'. I totally agree, but how can we in Britain expect such a radical rethink of priorities when our secretary of state for education is someone who has publicly stated that religious knowledge should be compulsory for all secondary school students? The word 'economics' never passed his lips, probably because it never even crossed his mind. Unfortunately, the people with the power to update and improve our education system are still stuck in the 19th century. This is also demonstrated in the thinking behind the vocational courses being proposed by Sir Ron Dearing, the UK government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests. According to your article 'Business offered role in schools' (March 21), 'the aim is to encourage children who are less interested in academic subjects to gain skills and stay in full-time education'. In fact, if these courses are well thought out, they will attract a lot of interest from a broad range of students and not just those who are 'less interested in academic subjects'. Most young people want to learn the skills they need to be employable. These courses should at least provide some direction for them. At the moment they are groping in the dark.

On this issue, the United States and Britain do  not agree with countries such as France and Russia. The former  two are in favor of continuing the oil sales embargo, while the  latter maintain that, since the Iraqi Government is cooperating  with UN weapon inspectors and showing some progress in its  attitude, lifting the embargo should be considered.    The oil sales embargo on Iraq was an important part of the  overall sanctions against Iraq imposed by the UN Security  Council when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Oil is the  main source of Iraq's foreign exchange income and an important  underpinning of the national economy. Cutting off its oil sales  channels undoubtedly spells disaster to the recovery and  development of Iraq's national economy and its people's  livelihood.    To solve its predicament and break the blockade, Iraq has  repeatedly called for the Security Council to end the sanctions  and has adopted a positive, cooperative attitude in accepting  the United Nations' destruction of its long-range missiles and  chemical and biological weapons, as well as the organization's  long-term supervision of its ordnance production. Not long ago,  Iraqi culture and information minister Hammadi made a public  statement to the outside, saying that Iraq has long dropped its  territorial claim on Kuwait, and the Iraqi National Assembly has  also withdrawn its decision to annex Kuwait, which was approved  by Iraq's supreme power organ, the Revolutionary Command Council.    It was in the hope that the Security Council would end its  sanctions against Iraq at an early date that Iraq made those  efforts and took those positions. What is worth mentioning here  is that the Security Council initially also cited the  above-mentioned conditions, stating that, as long as Iraq could  meet those requirements in its behavior, it would lift the  sanctions. The relevant sources pointed out: The efforts Iraq  has made in the above-mentioned areas have reached and satisfied  the conditions set down by the Security Council at that time;  therefore, lifting the oil sales embargo should be considered  and Iraq should be released. France argues that the Security  Council must stand by the agreement. In other words, once  Baghdad has satisfied the requirements raised at that time, the  oil embargo should end. At present, the Iraqi side is launching  a new diplomatic offensive and is sending out important  officials in all directions to explain that Iraq's efforts have  met the requirement for scrapping the sanctions, thus putting  pressure on the Security Council.    But the United States and Britain have taken exception to  the  positions of France, Iraq, and other relevant parties. They  have ignored all dissenting views and have insisted on  continuing the oil embargo against Iraq, splitting opinion on  the matter. Some say that Iraq deserved the sanctions earlier  because it had invaded Kuwait and was in the wrong, but, now  that Iraq has admitted defeat and bowed to justice, if one again  made a futile effort to convince people with one's arguments or  was actually scheming about something else, it would indeed be  absurd. [sentence as published]    The Western media pointed out: The Americans want to use  sanctions to stop the Iraqi Government from persecuting the  Kurdish people and the southern Shiite Muslims in the country,  but the oil embargo resolution did not cover these issues. It  is common knowledge that the Kurdish and Shiite Muslim problem  is purely Iraq's internal affair.     "

The search for a new quarry begins in Cyprus on Wednesday, when leaders and representatives of 50 nations gather in Limassol for the organisation's biennial conference. It will be the first time in more than two decades that South Africa need not dominate the proceedings. How to end apartheid sharply divided the Commonwealth (usually Britain from the rest); it also gave the association a sense of purpose and power, whether illusory or not. With sanctions lifted and a general election in the offing, the Commonwealth has to refocus, say diplomats from within its ranks. Efforts that began in Harare two years ago to find a raison d'etre must produce results this week they warn, or the loose association of states with little in common other than the English language and historical links with Britain will become increasingly irrelevant. As Australia's proposed move to republican status illustrates, Commonwealth ties with the former colonial power are wearing thin. But as one senior British official made clear last week, the reverse applies. In the run-up to Limassol, British diplomats do not conceal their doubts about the wisdom of allocating five days of Prime Minister John Major's time to a conference whose merits 'are not entirely self-evident', as one put it. Past acrimonious exchanges over South Africa sanctions, as far back as the arms-to-Pretoria row in Singapore in 1971, are readily recalled. Not even radical change in South Africa was enough to lay the sanctions issue to rest in Harare in 1991. Britain still bears the scars. At least one African high commissioner in London detects irritation and impatience in the speech to the English Speaking Union last week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. The South African issue had 'distorted' the Commonwealth, he said. Since it 'is not an organisation with voting rights or international legal authority, these differences never got us anywhere.' It only 'convinced many people in Britain that the Commonwealth was an institution for lecturing Britain, and its effectiveness suffered as a result'. Commonwealth officials and delegates challenge that view, but none is likely to pursue old scores this week. Instead they will press for a substantial Commonwealth role in South Africa's April election, assisting in the preparations and monitoring the poll. Mr Hurd, who pointedly noted that 'change lies in the hands of South Africans, not their well-wishers', will want to ensure discussion of this role does not divert attention from a broader objective for the Commonwealth, say Foreign Office officials. Other items on the agenda are important, they acknowledge, such as the state of multilateral trade negotiations, the emergence of a 'global humanitarian order', and the environment and development. But the conference is not the best arena for action in these areas they argue: what member states can do is to put the Commonwealth house in better order. Mr Hurd himself says: 'A new task is staring it in the face. Good governance and democracy cannot be imposed by imperial means.' It requires a combination of persuasion and reward, and 'expressions of displeasure' if democracy is undermined. 'These are all characteristics of the Commonwealth, and that is where its task for the nineties could lie.' Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general, would not disagree. Writing in the organisation's annual report, published this month, he sees the 1991 Harare communique as a renewal of a commitment to 'fundamental political values: democracy, the rule of law, just and honest government and human rights.' In the intervening two years there has been change for the better, and Commonwealth observers have monitored the transition to multi-party states in Kenya, Ghana and elsewhere. Critics, however, note the continued reluctance to appoint a Commonwealth group to monitor and publicise human rights abuses in member states and the fact that two governments which have flouted democracy - Nigeria and Sierra Leone - will take their seats on Wednesday. The challenge at Cyprus will be to close the wide gap that remains between the Harare principles and their practice.   Countries:-  CYZ  Cyprus, Middle East.

The quarrel, which has set Britain and Spain against their  10  EU partners, is blocking the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway  and Sweden into the Union by a target date of January 1 next  year.    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there had been  no  movement in negotiations Tuesday and that no acceptable  compromise was in sight. ""We're not moving. It's a position of  principle,"" he said over Spain's refusal to allow any weakening  of its ability to block decisions when new members are accepted.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: ""I am not very  hopeful of reaching an answer today. ... So far we do not have  on the table a proposal satisfactory to Britain.""    Earlier the Belgian, Dutch, German, French and Luxembourg  ministers, who oppose the British-Spanish stand, all expressed  doubt that the quarrel could be overcome at Tuesday's meeting --  the fourth in so many weeks.    Dutch diplomats said 10 of the EU's 12 countries had  hardened  their refusal against compromise to satisfy the British and  Spanish demands.    On the sidelines of the meeting, Swedish European Affairs  Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel warned that the dispute could affect  the chances of the Swedish electorate accepting entry into the  Union.    The four applicants, which completed negotiations to join  the  EU earlier this month, must all hold referendums before the end  of the year to ratify their membership accords.    Asked whether the EU quarrel could turn the Swedish  electorate against EU membership, Dinkelspiel said: ""Yes,  certainly"" -- an answer which diplomats say applies equally to  the other three applicants.    Commenting on Tuesday's meeting, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said: ""Nobody is moving. Better no accord than a  bad accord.""    Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement  of  the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger  countries to block decisions they do not like.    The Spanish want to maintain the power of three countries to  block unpopular decisions. The British want to brake the  accelerating shift of power from EU governments to a central  authority.    The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshold of  blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of  90 to take account of the incoming members.    But this would weaken the ability of the EU's bigger  countries to block controversial decisions, because a coalition  of one small and two large countries could no longer make their  ""no"" stick.    The issue involves a balance of power between north and  south, between big countries and small, between free traders and  protectionists.    Prominent members of the European Parliament have warned the  Euro-Parliament will not ratify the enlargement accords if  concessions are made to Britain and Spain.    Euro-MP Jean Cot said Tuesday: ""The British will be to blame  if the enlargement fails. They want to widen Europe but they  are trying to weaken it too.""    Cot is the leader of the Socialist group, the largest bloc  in  the Euro-Parliament. ""Douglas Hurd is playing with fire,"" he  said, adding that the parliament would accept no compromise to  satisfy the British or Spanish.    But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of  jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in the four  applicants. ""We intend to work until we get a satisfactory  result,"" he said.    If there is no agreement Tuesday, the issue is likely to  dominate a meeting of the EU foreign ministers at Ioannina, in  northwest Greece, Saturday and Sunday.     "

In the first outright admission by a senior minister that the EC will miss one of its fundamental single market objectives, he told the European parliament there was ' no prospect of any general removal of frontier controls on January 1. . . . there is difficulty in reconciling the position of all the (EC) countries.' His frank comments will set the tone for next week's two-day meeting of EC interior ministers in London, where immigration policy and border controls will be under discussion for the last time before the symbolic opening of the barrier-free European market. Britain itself is still adamant that controls on people are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. That stance has put the UK in dispute with the European Commission and the nine continental European members of the Schengen free-travel zone. But in an attempt to take the heat off the UK, Mr Clarke indicated yesterday that the nine Schengen members might also want to impose stricter checks on travellers from the non-Schengen countries. He later picked out the Netherlands, but Dutch officials denied the allegations. Schengen countries are uneasy with a compromise solution to the British problem which would allow EC visitors to Britain simply to wave passports at immigration controls from next year. They believe that compromise would undermine the barrier-free internal market - and weakens the EC's external frontiers, where checks are supposed to be more rigorous.

The ceremony promulgating it will mark the informal opening of campaigning for next May's presidential elections. The 1853 constitution was amended mainly to allow Mr Menem to stand for re-election when his term ends next year. The previous constitution banned successive presidential terms. Lifting this ban became Mr Menem's overriding political aim of the past two years. As well as allowing the president's re-election to a second, four-year term, the new constitution introduces a semi-parliamentary form of government, broadens the powers of Congress and gives the judiciary greater independence. The constitution is Mr Menem's greatest personal achievement since his election in July 1989. Last December, he overcame the opposition of the Radical Party, led by former president Raul Alfonsn, by promising a number of concessions in return for allowing his re-election. The constitution incorporates referenda and entrenches a broad range of individual rights and declarations of principles. These include recognition of Indian lands and a restatement of Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands. Argentina has protested to Britain over the UK decision to extend a fishing exclusion zone around the Falklands, a government spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. Britain confirmed it was extending the zone to an area north of the islands known as the Gap. Mr Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, handed the protest to Britain's ambassador, Mr Peter Hall, on Monday. Mr di Tella later criticised remarks by British Home Secretary Michael Howard claiming there was 'nothing to negotiate' over the islands. London denies its decision to expand the fishing exclusion zone is related to Argentina's renewed claims over the Falklands. But Mr di Tella called the extension a tit-for-tat move.

0,FT942-7838 ,"FT942-7838 _AN-EEYBKACAFT 940524   FT  24 MAY 94 / Tories pledge a conditional commitment      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The balancing act is encapsulated in the manifesto's title: A strong Britain in a strong Europe. The Conservatives will be positive about Europe before the June 9 poll for the Strasbourg assembly. But the party will be more positive still about its determination to get Britain's way in Europe. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and author of the manifesto, has managed to exclude from the text the more extreme demands of colleagues on the anti-European right of the party. The doors are not slammed completely on the possibility of an eventual return to the European exchange rate mechanism - or of participation in a single European currency. There is no promise of the referendum sought by the Euro-sceptics on the next stage of European integration. As Mr John Major says in the document's foreword, the argument it advances is not framed in terms of Europe Right or Wrong but Europe Right or Left. It is the ambitions of the socialist centralisers for Europe's institutions that the government abhors, not the institutions themselves. But the manifesto's tone reflects the mood of a party willing to accept, even embrace, Europe if that can be done on Britain's terms; but quick to reject it if anyone else threatens to set the agenda. It is as defensive as it is positive. First the positive. Mr Major dismisses at the outset the idea floated by some on the Conservative right that Britain might in the next few years have to reassess whether it should belong to the EU. Its opening words state baldly: 'Our membership of the European Union is vital to Britain.' Mr Major reinforced that point at yesterday's launch when he ridiculed the notion of a repeat of the 1975 referendum on membership. A lengthy section on the European economy makes the same point. Britain's trade, its inward investment and its employment prospects are all linked inextricably to the EU. The manifesto argues that the government is winning the debate over the need for a new focus on competitiveness, flexible labour markets and de-regulation. Prosperity and jobs are at the top of the European agenda. Britain's opt-out from the social chapter will ensure its employment prospects remain bright. Pledging the government's determination to promote free trade and the completion of the single market, it adds: 'Open markets are the Oxygen of Growth.' To that end Britain will press for further liberalisation of the telecommunications, transport and energy sectors. Nor will the Conservatives' reservations about the ERM and a single currency prevent it co-operating with its European partners: 'Britain will play its part in future discussion of how economic policies can best be co-ordinated within the European Union.' The manifesto is replete with examples of where the government has set the agenda for the rest of Europe: in the push for subsidiarity; in the promotion of intergovernmental co-operation at Maastricht; and in the acceleration of enlargement. It calls on the union to build on co-operation in home-affairs policies to launch a concerted drive against crime and acknowledges the need for a more coherent European approach to defence. The manifesto says the process of enlargement should include the creation of a free-trade area stretching eastwards as far as Russia as well as the accession of the four Visegrad countries - Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. But for every positive idea there is plan or ambition that the Conservatives will thwart - and a charge that Labour and the Liberal Democrats would sell Britain's interests short. Labour is said to have signed up for 'a lethal concoction of high taxation, high borrowing, bureaucratic meddling and extra burdens on business'. Conservatives will resist any move to increase the present limits on EU spending or any threat to the rebate Britain receives on its contribution to Brussels. The government will defend implacably the British veto. It will oppose the interventionist, bureaucratic instincts of Brussels in favour of minimum interference in national affairs. There will be no advance commitment on a single currency. The successor treaty to Maastricht, due for negotiation at the 1996 intergovernmental conference, must continue the process of decentralisation. As Mr Major puts it in his foreword: 'We want less interference from Brussels not more.' The prime minister has been told by opinion pollsters that this negative message has the best hope of persuading disgruntled supporters to vote Conservative on June 9. The odds are that it will quickly drown out the positive.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

Clinging obstinately  to his course, he promoted the sale of his ""constitutional  reform package"" in the past year or so regardless of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements and  understanding reached between China and Britain, as if whoever  opposes his ""constitutional reform package"" opposes democracy.  Thus, Chris Patten suddenly transformed himself from a colonial  dictator into a fighter for ""democracy.""    Such a practice on the part of Chris Patten is  incomprehensible to many people: There has never been a tiny  bit of democracy in Hong Kong, which has been under British rule  for over 150 years; ""royal instructions"" are followed in all  [government] affairs there; and the Hong Kong governor alone is  in control of all the powers. What makes him think of giving  democracy to the Hong Kong people just before British colonial  rule is about to end? Even Mr. Sharp [name as received], former  chairman of the Britain-China Trade Association, also said that  he could not understand why Chris Patten was in such a hurry to  promote democratization in Hong Kong.    China has repeatedly declared that the focal point of our  differences with Britain is not a question of whether democracy  should be implemented but rather a question of whether one's  promise should be kept. Democracy is an important mark of  social progress. The Chinese Government has all along been for  the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong, and it was  China that was the first of the two countries to propose the  implementation of democracy in Hong Kong and the democratic  rights of a ""high degree of autonomy"" for the Hong Kong people  under ""one country, two systems"" during the Sino-British talks  back in 1982. Then, China spent as long as four years and eight  months formulating the ""Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region of the PRC"" and putting forward the  principle of proceeding in an orderly way and step by step for  the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong.    The ""democracy"" hastily bestowed by Chris Patten as a favor  obviously violates the law of development. All matters in the  world have their own law of development. Like many matters, the  democratic system has a process of coming into being,  development, and taking shape. It is not accomplished in one  step. The process of the development of the modern democratic  system explains this point. The transition from feudal  dictatorship to the capitalist democratic system of our time  took several hundred years. For example, passing from the  bourgeois democratic revolution in 1688 to the establishment of  the one-person, one-vote election system in 1948 took Britain  nearly 300 years; and the United States took 200 years to go  from the formulation of its Constitution and the beginning of  the implementation of democratic reforms in 1787 to the exercise  of one-person, one-vote rights in general elections by 18-  year-old citizens in the 1980's.    Very obviously, Hong Kong's democracy cannot be accomplished  overnight. Accelerating the democratization process by force in  violation of the law of development will inevitably result in  drastic social turmoil and chaos, affect social stability, and,  furthermore, have an impact on Hong Kong's investment  environment. The broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots do not  want to see such things happen.    On account of the aforementioned consideration, the ""Basic  Law"" states that Hong Kong will have both direct elections and  indirect elections in the first 10 years after 1997 and that the  transition to general elections will be achieved according to  the procedures prescribed by law by the year 2007. The 10-year  transitional period, compared with 200 to 300 years in Britain  and the United States, is actually very, very short. Therefore,  it should be said that the process of democratic reform  stipulated by the ""Basic Law"" not only takes into consideration  the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong but also conforms to  the law governing the development of democracy itself.    In the process of drafting the ""Basic Law,"" China has  extensively solicited the opinions of the people of all walks of  life and social strata in Hong Kong and has taken into full  account their 40 to 50 proposals concerning Hong Kong's  political system. When it was promulgated, the ""Basic Law"" was  well received by the Chinese people, including the compatriots  in Hong Kong, and by the people of the world. They universally  held that the ""Basic Law"" not only embodies the Hong Kong  people's aspirations but also conforms to the interests of  economic development in Hong Kong and to the requirements for  its stability. Even the British Government has spoken highly of  the ""Basic Law."" In Britain, both the prime minister(s) and  ministers have expressed their satisfaction with the ""Basic Law""  on many occasions, and the British side has repeatedly promised  to converge with it.    However, at a time when the ""Basic Law"" needs to be further  publicized, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten dished out his  ""political reform program"" in an attempt to ""expand democracy""  in Hong Kong. This is an openly perfidious act.    People cannot but ask: Why does Patten want to go against  the objective law and ignore Hong Kong's safety? People who  know the history of colonial rule can see the real purpose of  the Hong Kong Government: It is vainly attempting to help,  through so-called democratic elections, a group of pro-British  persons gain power, especially those who dare to challenge the  central government, so as to make the government of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] powerless after 1997.  In doing so, Britain can attain its goal of ruling Hong Kong  without Britons -- continuing its colonial rule over Hong Kong  in another form.    When he met with Geoffrey Howe on 31 July 1984, Deng  Xiaoping  said: ""I hope that the Hong Kong Government will not form a  leading body of its own during the transitional period and then  impose it on the government of the Hong Kong SAR."" Today, his  prediction with profound insight has been proved accurate.    History has shown that before withdrawing from its colonies,  Britain would invariably pursue a policy of division and create  contradictions and confrontations to facilitate its manipulation  and control in an attempt to maintain its political and economic  interests in its former colonies. The same shameful tricks of  this old-brand imperialist have been employed in many of its  colonies in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not only were they not  successful, but they were condemned as shameful tricks by the  people of the world. Therefore, what Britain is doing with  regard to the Hong Kong issue is obviously a replaying of the  same old tricks. The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are  able to see through these tricks.    What the Hong Kong Government did more than 20 years ago  can help us see through its shameful tricks. In the 1970's,  Britain applied two international human rights conventions to  Hong Kong, but it omitted the portions on democratic elections  so that those would not be practiced in Hong Kong. In  displaying the big banner of ""democracy"" at a time just before  its withdrawal, is it not clear now as to what its ulterior  motives are? In sharp contrast to this situation, the Chinese  side included democracy in the ""Basic Law"" when there was not an  iota of democracy in Hong Kong.    Faced with iron-clad facts, a slight change seems to have  taken place in the tune of ""democracy"" sung by Chris Patten. He  claimed in a high-sounding manner that his arrangements on  direct elections are ""open, just, and accepted by the Hong Kong  people."" This new argument seems beautiful, but is actually  pale and weak.    It is known to all that during the five years of drafting  the  ""Basic Law,"" China had carried out a very open and democratic  way of discussions on all issues, both primary and secondary  ones, especially on the method of selecting the chief executive  of the government of the Hong Kong SAR and the forming of the  Legislative Council. Members of the drafting committee could  say what they wanted to say and could express their views  freely. Every article and every annex of the ""Basic Law"" was  passed with a two-thirds majority by all members of the drafting  committee in a secret ballot. Members of the drafting committee  visited Hong Kong many times to solicit the opinions of the  people from all walks of life regarding the method of selecting  the chief executive and the method of forming legislative  organs. Many revisions were made regarding this question. The  processing of drafting the ""Basic Law"" was highly transparent:  A news communique was published after each meeting. In four  years, nearly 100 news conferences were held by the Political  Group. Therefore, only the method of selecting the chief  executive of the Hong Kong SAR and the method of forming the  Legislative Council prescribed by the ""Basic Law"" are open and  just. Moreover, the masses of people in Hong Kong are satisfied  with them. In contrast, Chris Patten's ""political reform  program"" is not open and democratic. He arrived in Hong Kong in  June 1992, and in September he dished out his ""political reform  program."" Except for his premeditations with the British  Government in concocting this program, he had no prior  consultations with anyone, nor did he solicit the opinions of  the people of Hong Kong. It can be said that Chris Patten  dished out his ""political reform program"" without an iota of  democracy at all.    The essence of democracy is that the people enjoy the rights  to their own interests and happiness. The biggest interest of  the Hong Kong people is the maintenance of Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability. Only the ""Basic Law"" can satisfy the  wishes and demands of the masses of compatriots in Hong Kong;  only the ""Basic Law"" can bring about true and real democracy in  Hong Kong; and only the ""Basic Law"" can guarantee the most  important interest of the Hong Kong people. This has become the  consensus of many people.    ""Democracy"" under Chris Patten's signboard is not only very  deceptive but also extremely dangerous. Just imagine -- what  good does it do the economy of Hong Kong if Chris Patten leaves  behind a legislature that divides the Hong Kong people and  challenges the future SAR government? What consequences will  such a situation bring to investors in Hong Kong?    The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are very patriotic.  We are convinced that in the transitional period before 1997,  more and more Hong Kong people will see through the real purpose  of the British authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with  the people from the motherland to maintain Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability. Hong Kong -- the brilliant pearl of  the East -- will certainly be able to return smoothly to the  embrace of the motherland!     "

The flamboyant American led in the first half of the race but Gunnell, silver medallist at the world championships in Tokyo last year, joined her on the bend and the two came into the final straight neck-and-neck. Gunnell nosed in front and then moved away on the final hurdle as Farmer-Patrick checked her stride, powering home in 53.23 seconds. The American took the silver in 53.69sec with her compatriot Janeene Vickers just holding off a late challenge by world champion Tatyana Ledovskaya of the Unified Team to win the bronze. Gunnell, 26, from Chigwell in Essex, became Britain's first female runner to mount the winner's rostrum at the Games since Ann Packer won the 800m in Tokyo in 1964. 'It hasn't sunk in yet,' she gasped as she completed a lap of honour with the Union Jack draped around her shoulders.

Speaking as he arrived for an urgent meeting of EU foreign  ministers on the issue, he said: ""I'm not very hopeful of  reaching an answer today.""    But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of  jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in Austria,  Finland, Norway and Sweden.    Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos was  holding separate meetings with Hurd and Spanish Foreign Minister  Javier Solana just ahead of Tuesday's meeting, the fourth in so  many weeks to grapple with the issue.    Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement  of  the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger  countries to block decisions they do not like.    The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshhold of  blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of  90 to take account of the incoming members. But this would  weaken the ability of the EU's bigger countries to block  controversial decisions.    The issue has caused a deep split in the EU, with most of  its  members accusing Britain and Spain of wanting to cripple the  Union's decision-making ability.    The four applicants, who completed their negotiations to  join  the EU earlier this month, cannot enter until the issue is  resolved.    Hurd said no compromises so far advanced were satisfactory  to  Britain. ""We intend to work until we get satisfaction,"" he said.    Failure to reach a decision this month could make it  impossible for the four countries to join the EU on schedule on  January 1, and could also dampen the enthusiasm of their  electorates to endorse membership.

The announcement was timed to coincide with a meeting in London of European Community ministers responsible for immigration, defusing German calls for its EC partners to shoulder more of the refugee burden. It was also intended to take the sting out of a series of resolutions agreed at yesterday's meeting to toughen EC asylum and immigration rules. Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office minister, told the House of Commons that Britain was willing to offer accommodation for an initial period of six months to 1,000 former detainees of prison camps and their dependants, a total of about 4,000 people. Welcoming the move for Labour, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said it had been 'forced' on the government by the strength of feeling on the issue in Britain. He urged European leaders to keep their nerve and not to be 'stampeded' by racial tension into adopting a 'fortress Europe' policy. Last month, Britain offered at an Anglo-German summit to take 150 former detainees and their dependants. The latest, additional, offer compares with Germany's commitment to take 1,000 ex-Yugoslav detainees. Germany already has some 260,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been seeking shelter for 6,600 detainees, mainly from Bosnia, and until last Thursday had found temporary homes for 4,300 - of whom 1,000 would be in Germany, 600 in Spain and 150 in the UK. Before yesterday's meeting, Mr Eduard Lintner, parliamentary under-secretary at the German interior ministry, said Bonn was 'not very satisfied' with the response of its EC partners. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, who chaired the meeting, said afterwards that nobody had supported German calls for refugee quotas. But he claimed the asylum rules agreed yesterday would be 'a positive counter to any tendency towards racism inside the Community'. The rules have already been attacked by a number of human rights and refugee protection organisations for allegedly breaking international law. Separately, Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, was unable to persuade Britain and Denmark to agree to give up systematic controls on people at internal EC borders after January 1, 1993. The Commission is seeking a practical solution to EC members' concerns that controls at external borders will not be strong enough to justify lifting internal checks.

Ministers are still not willing to provoke a Tory rebellion  by bringing forward social legislation to implement EU proposals.    But EU officials suggested last night that Britain will  shortly respond to a German demand that employment protection no  longer be limited to those in full-time work.    A deal is expected during a German ministerial visit to  London in the next few weeks.    Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the 12  employment ministers indicated at a council meeting in  Luxembourg yesterday that this proposal should not be switched  to the Maastricht social protocol track, which allows the 11  other member states to proceed without Britain. ""The Germans  said the measure would be a high priority during their EU  presidency (which starts in July). It requires unanimity in the  council,"" Mr Flynn said.    He hinted, however, that he may switch two other draft  directives to the social protocol track to bypass British  opposition: a statutory right to substantial paternity leave;  and allowing parents absence from work for family reasons. The  second would shift the burden of proof in disputed cases in  favour of the employee.    ""I must reflect on how to proceed, bearing in mind the  social  protocol,"" Mr Flynn said.    He spoke after the first item under the Maastricht protocol  started its way through the social affairs council. British  ministers will not be allowed to vote or speak as other member  state ministers discuss legislation to give multinationals'  workers the right to consultation on takeovers, redundancies,  and shifts of production between countries.

It is a pity that he didn't emphasise the size of that gulf. The Thatcher era has not only left us with a battlefield of broken 'social' institutions but with brigades of enterprise warriors force-marching human and capital resources in the opposite direction from the social market towards the 'free market'. For example, in the field of vocational training, David Marsh is wrong to say that Britain is already actively trying to imitate the German 'dual system'. The core of the latter is the industrial craft apprenticeships for Facharbeiter (skilled workers), as in the metal-working sectors. British training has been, and is still being, pushed away from the Facharbeiter/craft principle of training for broad-based potential capacities, towards much narrower train-as-you-need-them 'competencies'; a trend that the government's National Council for Vocational Qualifications is actively endorsing. When a British government has to turn social market rhetoric into reality - if only to keep up with the probable institutional harmonisation for common EC standards in training and other employment relations - the necessary U-turn will be on a scale to match the retreat from Moscow.

The Kazakh president said that the sides displayed mutual  interest in expanding bilateral cooperation. ""I believe that a  mutual interest in exchange of opinions will help us to know  each other better and determine prospects for and forms of  development of mutually advantageous contacts,"" the Kazakh  president said, addressing the Confederation of the British  Industry, uniting prominent businessmen of the country.    The basis for Kazakh-British relations was laid in October,  1991, when during Nazarbayev's first visit a joint statement was  signed, determining principles and prospects for bilateral  cooperation.

""At the same time, we realise that this is only the start,  opening a broader road for the development of large-scale and  perspective projects.

By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      U.S. authorities accused the Iraqi government Thursday of masterminding an  elaborate plot to smuggle electronic devices from California to Baghdad for  eventual use in detonating nuclear weapons.    Unsealing an indictment by a federal grand jury in San Diego against five  alleged agents of the government in Baghdad, officials said they hope to  extradite for prosecution in the United States the plot's alleged ringleader,  Ali Ashour Daghir, and possibly other participants.    Separately, Daghir and two accomplices were charged Thursday in an Uxbridge  Magistrates Court in West London with violating British export laws. Both U.S.  and British officials reiterated their concerns about the proliferation of  nuclear weapons in the Mideast.    ""This is probably the biggest case the Customs Service has ever had,"" said U.S.  Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett. ""It was a very frightening situation.""    As new details of the 18-month sting operation emerged on both sides of the  Atlantic, Iraqi officials vehemently denounced the U.S. and British actions.  President Saddam Hussein told a Baghdad rally that the nation's enemies are  trying to hinder Iraq's ""march of progress.""    The official Iraqi news agency INA said the acting head of the British Embassy  in Baghdad was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and told by Undersecretary  Nizar Hamdoon that ""Iraq did not violate the laws of Britain or any other  country."" INA said a Foreign Ministry spokesman ""denied categorically, chapter  and verse, allegations contained in a statement by the British authorities on  Wednesday.""    In Washington, senior Customs agent John C. Kelley said there is no doubt that  the Iraqis had intended to use the U.S.-made devices, called capacitors, to  help set off nuclear weapons.    Appearing with Hallett at a press conference, Kelley said: ""Based on their  specifications . . . it left nothing to the imagination . . . as to what the  purpose would be.""    The indictment, which charged the defendants with five counts of conspiracy to  export defense articles, said they represented two firms that ""acted as agents  for the Republic of Iraq in the procurement of defense articles, military  equipment and munitions items.""    In addition, the indictment said the devices were sought by the defendants ""on  behalf of Al Qaqaa State Establishment, a division of the Ministry of Industry  and Military Industrialization of the Republic of Iraq.""    Portions of the indictment contained extensive excerpts from conversations that  appeared to have been surreptitiously recorded, a fact that officials  reluctantly confirmed.    ""The tapes will be presented in court in San Diego,"" Kelley said.    The legal status of the five suspects remained unclear Thursday.    Authorities were unable to resolve whether any of them can be extradited from  Britain to the United States under a bilateral treaty. The issue is still  ""under review,"" said Dan Eramian, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman in  Washington.    According to the indictment, the plot's mastermind was Daghir, 49, a dual  Iraqi-British citizen who ran an Iraqi government purchasing office from a  London suburb. The firm posed as a food export company called Euromac (London)  Ltd.    The other suspects named in the indictment are Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41,  a Euromac executive; and three engineers: Karim Dhaidas Omran, Wallid Issa  Ahmad and Dafir Al-Azawi. The three engineers are believed to be in Iraq.    ""I'm sure that in the case of those who are currently in Great Britain there  will be an effort -- at least discussions with respect to extraditing them,""  Hallett said. ""But for those who are in Iraq, obviously there is little  likelihood that we will see them here in the United States.""    In the London court proceeding, a magistrate ordered Daghir held without bail  pending a court hearing April 5. The magistrate released Speckman on bail and  ordered a court appearance on May 10.    The magistrate ordered another alleged Daghir accomplice, Toufic Fouad Amyuni,  held without bail. U.S. officials said that Amyuni was not involved in the U.S.  case.    In addition, the British Home Office ordered the deportation of Omar Latif,  described as the station manager at Heathrow Airport for Iraqi Airlines.    Still another suspect, a Cypriot with a British passport, was released after  questioning Wednesday.    The international sting operation was set in motion in September, 1988, when  Daghir approached a San Marcos, Calif., firm, CSI Technologies Inc., seeking to  buy custom-made, high-voltage capacitors, according to the indictment and  information provided by U.S. officials.    The request quickly aroused the suspicion of CSI President Jerold D. Kowalsky,  who alerted Customs officials and agreed to play an important part in the  sting.    The capacitors allegedly sought by the Iraqis are electric energy storage  devices designed to quickly discharge about 5,000 volts of electricity into a  trigger in order to detonate a nuclear missile warhead.    After further contacts were made with the Iraqis, Hallett said, Customs agents  learned that ""Euromac is an official purchasing office of the Iraqi government  which had done millions of dollars of business in procuring military materiel  for the Iraqi government during the Iran-Iraq conflict.""    By May, 1989, Euromac officials had disclosed to Kowalsky and a Customs  undercover agent, Daniel Supnick, that the devices were destined for Al Qaqaa  State Establishment, a part of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Military  Industrialization, Hallett said.    Additional investigations by Customs agents confirmed that Al Qaqaa is a  facility involved in the development of missiles and rockets and explosives  research and development for the Iraqi government, she added.    During the negotiations between Daghir and CSI, the Iraqis also expressed an  interest in acquiring another type of sophisticated device called krytrons,  which serve as actual triggers for nuclear bombs.    As a result, Customs agents persuaded the sole domestic manufacturer of  krytrons, EG&G of Wellesley, Mass., to participate in the sting operation.    The firm provided Customs with 40 inoperable devices, but agent Kelley said  that the plot never progressed to a stage that called for use of the phony  triggers.    Instead, Euromac, which later changed its name to Atlas Equipment (U.K.) Ltd.,  paid $10,000 for 100 capacitors. CSI earlier this month shipped 40 to London's  Heathrow Airport, by way of the Los Angeles International Airport.    The shipment was closely monitored by U.S. and British officials throughout the  journey, officials said.    When it reached a cargo hangar at Heathrow, British officials substituted dummy  capacitors as a precaution. Several days elapsed before the Iraqis moved to  load the crate, labeled as containing air-conditioning units, onto an Iraqi  Airways jet bound for Baghdad.    Authorities then moved in.    If convicted, each person named in the San Diego indictments faces up to five  years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The firms face a maximum fine  of $1 million.    At the State Department in Washington, spokesman Richard Boucher carefully  avoided any direct criticism of Iraq, while denying that the Bush  Administration is letting the Iraqis off the hook.    Boucher reiterated the Administration's concern about nuclear proliferation,  but he did not accuse Iraq of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which  it is a signatory, or of trying to develop a nuclear weapon.    ""We do not foresee a near-term Iraqi nuclear weapons capability,"" Boucher said.  ""However, we remain concerned about the danger that Iraq may seek to develop a  nuclear weapons option in the future.""    Asked if the incident will have an impact on U.S.-Iraqi relations, Boucher  said, ""I don't have any conclusions as to that. I said we'll examine the  information from this case very carefully, and we're raising at this point our  concerns with the Iraqis both here and in Baghdad.""    The State Department called in Iraq's ambassador, Mohammed Mashat, to register  U.S. concerns about the case.    In London, the Iraqi plot sparked a lively debate in the House of Commons, with  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher calling it a ""very, very serious incident.""    Sounding a similar note struck by President Bush on Wednesday, Thatcher said  Britain is now ""urgently contacting"" the signatories of the Non-Proliferation  Treaty and related agreements ""to see what we can do . . . (so) there is no  repeat of this. . . .""    Also in the House of Commons, the opposition Labor Party's shadow foreign  secretary, Gerald Kaufman, demanded that Britain expel Baghdad's ambassador and  break off diplomatic relations in retaliation.    But Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd rejected that course, noting that two  Britons are being held prisoner in Iraq.    ""I can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off diplomatic relations .  . . and no actual advantage,"" he said. ""I do not want to get into a position  where we not only leave our citizens, including our two prisoners, without  protection, but we also get in a position where we don't actually have an  embassy in the Middle East between the Khyber Pass and the Mediterranean.""    Britain is said to be Iraq's third-largest trading partner, and about 2,000  British citizens live in Iraq. Despite pleas for clemency from the British  government, Iraq executed a British journalist of Iranian birth earlier this  month after convicting him of espionage.

Sounding a similar note struck by President Bush on Wednesday, Thatcher said  Britain is now ""urgently contacting"" the signatories of the Non-Proliferation  Treaty and related agreements ""to see what we can do . . . (so) there is no  repeat of this. . . .""    Also in the House of Commons, the opposition Labor Party's shadow foreign  secretary, Gerald Kaufman, demanded that Britain expel Baghdad's ambassador and  break off diplomatic relations in retaliation.    But Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd rejected that course, noting that two  Britons are being held prisoner in Iraq.    ""I can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off diplomatic relations .  . . and no actual advantage,"" he said. ""I do not want to get into a position  where we not only leave our citizens, including our two prisoners, without  protection, but we also get in a position where we don't actually have an  embassy in the Middle East between the Khyber Pass and the Mediterranean.""    Britain is said to be Iraq's third-largest trading partner, and about 2,000  British citizens live in Iraq. Despite pleas for clemency from the British  government, Iraq executed a British journalist of Iranian birth earlier this  month after convicting him of espionage.

That must  be the starting point. Our security and prosperity depend on  what happens on our own continent. Withdrawal from its leading  institution -- the European Union [EU] -- is the stuff of an  entertaining polemic, but unreal. The real question, and a  vital one for Conservatives, is how to achieve the kind of  Europe we can feel at ease with. We want it to deliver tangible  benefits for the citizen, while respecting the identity and  legitimacy of the nation state. Few people in Britain would  dissent from that.    On June 9 there is a choice between two different ideas of  Europe. The Conservative Party believes in closer European  cooperation. We seek it in order to deliver specific benefits  which are beyond the reach of individual nation states. Unlike  our opponents, we believe that the EU already has the  competences it needs. We are saying that the areas of policy  which go to the heart of the nation state -- like taxes, the  currency, immigration, and foreign policy -- must remain  governed by the national veto. We are clear that Europe is  strengthened by bringing the nation states to work together  rather than by fusing them into a federal European state.    We have had a rough argument inside the Conservative Party  over Maastricht. We differed on whether the Treaty, as signed  by Britain with the opt-outs, was a help or a hindrance to our  idea of Europe. That argument is in the past. I have found in  this campaign, from Aberdeen to Surrey, that when we discuss the  future, the overwhelming majority of Conservatives come  together. For months I have been hopefully predicting this --  so it is a relief to find it coming true!    The Labour and Liberal vision of Europe is different. They  see no objection in principle to further transfers of power to  the centre. Their equivocation over the national veto testifies  to that. The Liberals even reject the Maastricht idea of  flexible cooperation between governments outside the scope of  the European Commission and the European Court of Justice.    The divide over economic policy is also clear. Conservatives  are working for budgetary discipline, deregulation, labour  market flexibility and the lightening of costs on business.  Labour and Liberals are committed to a Social Chapter whose  only certain effect would be to destroy British jobs, along with  a raft of extra spending on proposals which would punish  Europe's taxpayers. The arguments here are familiar from our  own domestic politics -- a choice between jobs and enterprise on  the one hand and socialism on the other. That is what we mean  by Europe -- Right or Left?    One of the odd things about politics is the way an argument  suddenly reaches a wide audience some time after it is first  stated. It is good news that the Prime Minister regained the  initiative for Conservatives with his speech last Tuesday [31  May] about a multi-track Europe. It is a thought which he and  others of us have expounded before. It was a main theme of my  speech at the Scottish Party conference on May 11. It is a  statement of reality.    Britain has troops in Bosnia alongside the French, Spaniards  Dutch and some, but not all, other Europeans. We belong to the  Western European Union -- others don't. Britain is among the  pioneers of a common European foreign policy based on unanimity  and cooperation between governments. Where we can agree, it  makes sense to act together. We do not belong to the Schengen  arrangement on frontiers. We do not belong to the Exchange Rate  Mechanism. We are not committed to a single bank or a single  currency. But we are not alone in any of these positions. This  flexibility is already part of the Europe of nations working  together -- and will be even more so as the European Union  slowly expands to the East.    The next question is: Does the European Parliament matter  enough to vote for? The answer is yes. The Parliament has  important powers to amend EC laws, along with a new blocking  power in certain areas. It has new powers to scrutinise EC  spending, to deal with fraud, to call the European Commission to  account, and to approve its appointment. It must also give its  assent to the admission of new members. We need it to work with  us for the next five years -- not against us, as it does now  with its Left-wing majority.    That means that we need more Conservative MEPs [member of  European Parliament] in Strasbourg. To increase the influence  of the Centre-Right, they are allied -- not joined -- to the  Parliamentary group of the European Peoples Party with which we  see eye-to-eye on such issues as free enterprise, budgetary  restraint, law and order, and the Atlantic alliance. The  arrangement makes good practical sense. But Conservative MEPs  are standing exclusively on our British Conservative manifesto  which explicitly rejects the idea of a federal European state.    There are now unmistakable signs of a shift away from the  centralising consensus which has hitherto underpinned the  Community. This change of climate is becoming apparent across  Europe.    There are several reasons. The influence of the Commission  looks set to wane as Jacques Delors steps down and the member  states reclaim the political initiative. In France and Germany  we are seeing a more assertive mood from national politicians in  response to real public concern about Europe. Chancellor Kohl  explains why it is a mistake to follow the American analogy and  talk of a United States of Europe. The new Italian government  brings a different international pedigree to its attitude to  Europe.    We are already seeing some real change in the way the  European Union works. The number of legislative proposals has  been more than halved -- between 1991 and 1993. The Commission  estimates that 25 per cent of all existing law can now be  simplified or scrapped. Meanwhile, Europe's economic script is  being rewritten around our theme of deregulation and  competitiveness, with Germany eager to claim co-authorship.    So we have everything to gain by arguing from centre-stage.  There is plenty of tough argument ahead. The Commission is  still inserting itself into too many of the nooks and crannies.  The old-fashioned notion that the good European is one who  believes in the constant transfer of power to the centre in  Brussels still holds sway in some political establishments -- as  it does with the Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties here. But  we should not underestimate our influence. We did not win the  battles for the Single Market, budgetary discipline,  subsidiarity, intergovernmental co-operation and EU enlargement  by sulking on the sidelines.    For the next intergovernmental conference in 1996 we need to  work out a coherent framework for an enlarged union -- one which  paves the way for a flexible, multi-speed Europe formed around a  solid core of common policies and rules. This is the only model  which will enable us to build the new democracies of Central and  East Europe into our enterprise.    If Conservatives vote Liberal Democrat or abstain on  Thursday. they may find themselves represented at Strasbourg by  someone working hard for the kind of Europe they most dislike.  Little has ever been achieved for Britain by staying at home.  If, as Conservatives and as a country, we take a robust,  positive and distinctive stand on June 9, that will be an  important advance towards the kind of Europe we want.     "

Mr Cavallo, the first Argentine cabinet minister to make an official visit to Britain since the 1982 Falklands conflict, will meet Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The visit confirms the rapidly improving ties between the UK and Argentina since President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. Mr Cavallo became economy minister in 1991 and rapidly transformed Argentina into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, the unresolved dispute over the Falklands - which Argentina still claims - means that no date is likely to be set soon for a visit by Mr Menem. As well as meeting UK government officials, Mr Cavallo will give a lecture at the London School of Economics and a speech at the Confederation of British Industry. He will also chair a seminar with potential investors at Baring Brothers, the merchant bank with a long, if turbulent, history of business with Argentina. Britain has shown growing interest in Latin America as economic reforms across the continent create new trade and investment opportunities. British banks and companies, notably British Gas, have been active in Argentina's privatisation programme. Mr Cavallo's arrival in London follows a flurry of visits by senior British ministers. Earlier this year Mr Hurd and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, visited Buenos Aires. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, arrives in Argentina on Saturday for a brief official visit and Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, will visit London in November.

Iran's charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, was told of the  decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see the  Foreign Office Minister of State, Douglas Hogg.    Foreign Office officials refused to comment yesterday on the  meeting except to insist it was not linked to the fatwa calling  for the killing of Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic  Verses -- the main irritant in Anglo-lranian relations.    Iran's embassy also refused to comment.    The expulsion follows recent British charges that Iranian  intelligence has been in clandestine contact with the IRA. This  was denied by Tehran, which then made the charge --  conspicuously not denied -- that Britain's M16 had planted a bug  in the London embassy.    Unusual secrecy surrounded the expulsion decision, and it  was  not clear whether it was related to the IRA row or to other  bilateral strains. Suggestions of a Bosnian link were played  down. Mr Ansari was told there was irrefutable evidence of  wrongdoing.    Britain wants to keep the expulsion quiet to preclude  Iranian  tit-for-tat expulsions. Both countries are limited, by mutual  agreement, to 15 diplomats in each other's capital.    Reticence about the decision stems from concern that  publicity given to the IRA allegations last month was  counterproductive, provoking anti-British hostility in Iran,  including calls for a boycott of British trade or even the  severing of links.    Relations between the two countries have been stormy since  Iran's Islamic revolution in l979. Ties were severed in 1989  over the Rushdie affair but restored in 1990.     "

Last week the UK government announced that it would extend the 12-mile limit around the two island groups to 200 miles to halt over-fishing. British officials said yesterday that new fishing regulations were being drafted similar to those already being enforced around the Falklands. Argentina reacted angrily to Britain's decision to extend territorial waters and will be doubly displeased by a unilateral move to charge vessels for the right to fish there. Argentina claims sovereignty over the Georgias and South Sandwich islands as well as the Falklands. In statements issued over the weekend, Argentine officials said the new 200-mile limits would indirectly grant Argentina a role in fishing policy because both island groups fell within the ambit of the 22-nation Commission on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, of which both Argentina and Britain were members. British officials dismissed that suggestion, however, insisting that they would not accept any Argentine role that implied recognition of its territorial claims. For the moment, the British announcement is only a formality as London lacks fishery patrol ships to enforce the extended limits. However, officials said it was considered important to announce it before the next fishing season began in February. Britain and Argentina are to hold talks on a new fisheries regime in waters around the Falklands. No date has been set, but discussions are expected to begin in May or June. Argentina last year introduced a licensing scheme for ships operating in its waters that is similar to the Falklands' regime and it has managed to poach most of the islands' best customers by offering cut-price licences.

The Prime Minister gave several stark warnings that the  European Union would fall apart unless it became more flexible  and he cautioned stay-at-home Tory voters that they could be  letting in socialists who wanted a centralised federal state.    Success for Labour or the Liberal Democrats would be a  ticket  to disaster, he said, since the opposition parties supported the  ""seven deadly sins"" of Europe. They wanted more powers to be  transferred from Britain to Brussels, the social chapter, a  single currency, taxes to be levelled up, EU [European Union]  spending raised the veto weakened and Britain's rebate to be  renegotiated.    ""Don't stay at home and let others choose the destiny of the  continent,"" Mr Major told a rally in London. ""Don't stay at home  and complain when you hear, as you inevitably would, that a  socialist majority at Strasbourg is calling for more spending,  more tax, more interference by Brussels in the nooks and  crannies of your lives.""    Mr Major's appeal came as an ICM [International  Communications and Marketing Research] opinion poll for the  DAILY EXPRESS suggested the Tories could win between 15 and 20  seats -- more than some recent polls have suggested. The survey  put Labour on 45 per cent, the Conservatives on 27 and the  Liberal Democrats 22 per cent.    Yesterday Mr Major repeatedly returned to the multitrack  theme, which Conservative strategists believe may pay dividends,  brushing aside suggestions that the Cabinet was split over his  approach.    By the turn of the century, the Union could have 20 members,  he said: ""It is a different sort of Community, we have to deal  with it in a different way. It is bound to be more flexible. If  it is not more flexible it will break."" Later he told LBC that  people were uneasy at the direction they believed Europe had  been going, that it was too prescriptive and centralised and had  taken too many powers from Westminster. It was to combat that  feeling that he was pressing for a multi-speed Europe.    Mr Major's decision to keep playing the multi-speed card, in  spite of reservations among Cabinet ministers such as John  Gummer, reflects the support Tory canvassers are detecting for  it among traditional core voters. Even among Conservative MPs  not known as strong supporters of the Prime Minister, there is a  view that he has struck a chord and there is praise, too, for  the energetic campaign he has fought in sharp contrast to  Margaret Thatcher's low-key efforts five years ago.    Yesterday, Mr Major seized on an international jobs study by  the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as  evidence that Britain's approach to unemployment was being  adopted by other countries. But the report sparked an angry row  as Labour, too, claimed it vindicated the party's policies.    The study sets out the case for a compromise between an  over-regulated and a deregulated jobs market, pointing to the  dangers of both. Although it leans towards Conservative policy,  it does not come out against a minimum wage. It does, however,  call for more flexible working hours, wage and labour costs to  reflect local conditions and skills. It also spells out the  need for a highly skilled workforce.    Mr Major and Kenneth Clarke insisted yesterday that the  report was an outright endorsement of their campaign to cut red  tape and Brussels interference. Mr Major said its  recommendations had been the core of every Conservative  manifesto of his political career, while the Chancellor said:  ""It suggests that not only was Britain right to get out of the  social chapter, but that other countries should get out of it  too.""    But Labour's John Prescott accused the Conservatives of  twisting the word ""flexibility"" to mean low pay, poor conditions  and fewer rights. The report had, he said, endorsed Labour  proposals to impose a training levy on firms, to link education  to skills training and to create new jobs through improved  productivity, innovation and technology.    Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, meanwhile alleged  that the Government was so divided over Europe that it could not  govern effectively. ""Mr Major has been trying to play to his  Eurosceptics to try to placate them, to keep the party  together,"" she said. ``There is no substantive rift over Europe  in the Labour Party. We all agree that the way to do it is to  put Britain at the top of the heap in Europe while Mr Major  wants us in the bicycle lane.    ``One of the things we have to do is to maintain Britain's  influence in Europe. Part of the Governments incompetence in  Europe is that they are depriving Britain of a voice and of  influence.''    While Mr Major insisted yesterday that the European  elections  were not a referendum on his domestic performance, Paddy Ashdown  again urged voters to use the polls to deliver their verdict on  a Tory campaign that had broken promises and betrayed hopes.    The Liberal Democrat leader told a rally in Plymouth: ""The  Conservatives persuaded people to vote for lies once. I believe  most people in this country are not prepared to let the  Conservatives make mugs of them twice. Every Conservative vote  will be a vote to say that you don't mind broken promises about  taxation ... to say that honesty doesn't matter. Every  Conservative vote will be a vote to say to the Government:  `You're doing a great job, please carry on.'""     "

The move revives the possibility of an allied strike against Iraqi forces - an option General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, pointedly refused to rule out in London yesterday after talks on the rising tension in northern Iraq with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Gen Powell said after the meeting that he would not 'speculate on what we might or might not do with respect to the use of military action.' The US state department was last night preparing a formal warning to Iraq over the missiles. Officials said the Soviet-made SAM-2 and SAM-3 missile batteries had been moved within the last 10 days to Mosul, 32km north of the 36th parallel, beyond which Britain and the US have ordered Iraq not to stage military operations against the Kurds on pain of possible allied counter attack. The movement of missiles follows reports of renewed attacks by Iraqi forces on the southern fringe of Kurdish held areas in the north - including some around Mosul and Arbil north of the 36th parallel - and signs of a build-up of Iraqi armour in the north. Iraqi opposition groups in London also claim that a 36,000-strong Iraqi force last week launched a bloody three-day offensive, backed by helicopter gunships, against Iraqi Shias hiding in the country's southern marshes. These skirmishes and the deployment of anti-aircraft missiles, which could provide cover for an attack on the Kurds, has intensified top level consultations between Britain and the US on a possible punitive raid to deter President Saddam Hussein from threatening the Kurds - or from testing too far the resolve of the Gulf war allies in their undertaking to protect them. British officials said yesterday that Gen Powell had brought forward a long-intended trip to meet Mr Major in view of the deteriorating security position in Iraq. The two men gave no details about a possible response to the missile deployment. However, as a first step, Iraq is likely to be warned privately through its mission at the UN in New York that it risks an allied attack. The US, Britain and France patrol the area from the Incirlik airbase in Turkey, where a limited strike force has been based since the Kurdish uprising immediately after the Gulf war.

The move is part of a stand by leading export credit agencies unwilling to accept Bank Markazi as the Iranian government's choice as guarantor of export deals. British exporters were notified of the decision in a letter on April 19, the ECGD said yesterday. Japan's trading houses are believed to have arrears of up to Dollars 700m, according to the specialist publication International Trade Finance. About Dollars 300m of this was covered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In 1992 Britain's exports to Iran grew by about 10 per cent to Pounds 568m, giving a trade surplus of Pounds 404m. Iranian imports from Britain totalled Pounds 127m in the first quarter of this year. The country's total imports in the year ending in March 1993 were Dollars 20.8bn (Pounds 13.5bn), down from Dollars 25bn the previous year as balance of paymentsproblems grew more acute. The suspension of cover is expected to have marginal impact on British exporters. The ECGD resumed cover in December 1991 after having kept it off cover for 10 years. An unresolved dispute over repayment of debts dating back to the Shah's regime has prevented export deals being given backing since then. Other governments have had similar disputes, but some resumed medium-term credits. German, Japanese and Italian banks are thought to have the greatest exposure, although none is forthcoming on the extent of exposure. Payment problems appear to have been of greatest concern in the a forfait market, where German, Japanese and Italian banks are thought to be holding several billion dollars worth of Iranian letters of credit.

0,FT931-15907 ,"FT931-15907 _AN-DAJAPAEPFT 930109   FT  09 JAN 93 / Britain joins in a game once deemed a sin: With a national lottery on the cards, David Spanier delves into gambling history      By DAVID SPANIER   THE ARRIVAL of a national lottery in Britain will give the state a direct stake in the game. Church and state have traditionally been against gambling. But the Lottery Bill before Christmas changed this completely. Although they may deny it, the authorities will be encouraging gambling. The more money gambled, the more benefit to such recipients as the arts. And the more revenue, no doubt, for the Treasury. In this game, Britain is a late starter. The huge cash prizes promised in the lottery extend to Britain a trend proliferating round the world: the spread of commercial gaming with official approval. Gambling, provides a thrill; it may be short, as in the spin of a roulette wheel, it may be weekly, as in a national lottery, or it may be long term, as in currency speculation. The price - how much money to risk - is decided by the player. Gambling was once seen as a sin. In England it was opposed by the church, from the Middle Ages to Victorian times. The bible was cited as justification for this view, although no injunction such as 'Thou shalt not gamble' can be found in the scriptures. The real reason why the authorities opposed gambling was that it interfered with people's work. Games of chances were banned in the court of Henry VIII because the soldiers' passion for gaming grew so intense it interfered with archery training. When Premium Bonds were introduced, Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, fulminated against 'debasing the spiritual coinage of the people'. He told the Lords: 'The government knows, as well as the rest of us, that we can regain stability and strength only by unremitting exercise all through the nation of the old-fashioned and essential virtues. . . honest work honestly rewarded.' A more fundamental (perhaps instinctive) reason for the authorities' opposition to gambling is that people enjoy it. Anything allowing people to do what they want when they want, was seen as wrong or anti-social. In Victorian times attitudes began to change. Society came to see gambling as a crime rather than a sin, like prostitution. People might lust after fallen women but this was regarded as an undesirable trait of human nature which ought to be suppressed. But while formally condemned, prostitution was patronised by the upper classes. So with gambling. Around the turn of the century, the beau monde took off for Deauville or Monte Carlo to gamble. The masses, meanwhile, were supposed to get on with their work. The inconsistency of gaming laws was not shown up until the late 1950s, when John Aspinall came on to the London scene. His high stakes gaming parties, moving from house to house, were the Mayfair equivalent of the betting on horses with a street bookie - both were evading out of date laws prohibiting gambling. In due course the law was changed, first by a betting and gaming bill in 1960, which proved counter-productive, and then by the Gaming Act of 1968. Gambling in Britain still tends to be regulated by Home Office ideas of what is good for people. Thus, slot machines are limited to two per club. But perceptions about gambling are changing again. It has now come to be seen as a legitimate aspect of human behaviour. Once gambling ceases to be seen as wrong and is regarded as part of the leisure industry, it becomes practical to tax it. Indeed, gambling is being seen as a useful revenue earner. This reopens the question, however, of how gambling should fit into society. It is one thing for people to gamble at the race-track or in a casino. It becomes quite another thing if a government is actively encouraging gambling as a means of raising revenue. Furthermore, it is arguable that raising taxes through gambling is inherently bad economics. It is a voluntary tax because people do not have to gamble unless they want to. But it still has a bit of the 'smoke and mirrors' to it in that gambling revenue reflects expenditure diverted from elsewhere. Gains should therefore be discounted against lower activity in other sectors. At best, it is argued, such a source of revenue is a palliative which saves the government from bringing in orthodox tax measures, such as income or sales taxes. Certainly the Treasury should do well out of it. When up and running, say in its fifth year, the lottery is expected to produce anything from Pounds 1.5bn to as much as Pounds 4bn. Of this, the Treasury will lop off its due share in tax. The rate has yet to be decided, but if it were to be 20 per cent (which is one figure being talked about) the Treasury would benefit from between Pounds 300m and Pounds 800m. Good causes - arts, sports, charities, heritage and the 'Millennium Fund' for 2000 - will get 30 per cent of this. The Treasury, we may be sure, regards itself as a good cause. Expenses must also be paid. This would leave perhaps less than a half of the total money wagered for the prizes. What a gamble] But wait, this is merry old England. The government is not talking about 'gambling'. It is talking about 'improving the quality of life'. It is, formally, against encouraging gambling. You can bet on that.

Vice-chairman of the committee Taha Ahmad al-Dawud was  quoted  by a local daily as saying that the plan aims at urging the  world politicians and parliamentarians, and those of Britain and  the U.S. in particular to work for lifting the anti-Iraq  sanctions and holding the U.S. and Britain responsible for the  death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the destruction of  Iraq's infrastructure.    The plan, moreover, will make it clear that the continuation  of the economic blockade runs counter to human rights and  Washington's and London's claims and boasts of being the ardent  advocates of human rights, said Mr. al-Dawud.    He went on to say that invitation will be sent to a number  of  world MPs to visit Iraq for dialoge and to get acquainted with  the negative consequences of the U.S.-allied aggression and the  continuation of the UN-imposed economic sanctions.    The committee's plan also aims at urging the world MPs to  exercise pressure on their governments towards lifting the  embargo.    Moreover, the National Assembly, through its Arab and  International Relations Committee will work for holding talks  with MPs of the Security Council member-states in addition to  exchanging letters with heads of the world parliaments on their  stands and Iraq's stand vis-a-vis UN Security Council  resolutions and allegations and claims aired by iraq's enemies  to divert the world's attention from the recent positive  development in the stands of a number of the UN Security Council  member-states and in a bid to manipulate the world public  opinion, Mr. al-Dawud concluded.

Lord Tebbit, the former Cabinet Minister, belatedly marked  the fifth anniversary of Lady Thatcher's Bruges Speech in  September 1988, with a robust repudiation of closer ties in the  EC.    But Mr Clarke, Chancellor, painted a much more positive  picture of Britain's future inside what he preferred to call the  European Union in an address to economists in Paris.    Lord Tebbit, whose hostility to the Maastricht Treaty has  not  abated -- he equated the measure last night with the retreat  from Dunkirk -- said he believed the tide of affairs was flowing  once again in favour of the nation state rather than a grand  European design.    ""It is notable that some of the states which mouth the  slogans of federalism and centralism in accents most exquisitely  communitaire are now pursuing -- even if it involves cheating  and breaking the law of the European Community -- policies of  naked self-interest,"" he said. ""On that basis the day of the  nation state is far from over.""    Lord Tebbit, speaking at the Reform Club in London, said  that  before Europe could move to economic and monetary union -- the  precursors of political union -- there would need to be a single  language, something unacceptable to individual member states.    ""Until Europe enforces a single language policy, we  Euro-sceptics know that our views will be proved correct and  attempts at union will fail,"" he added.    Lord Tebbit also called for overdue reforms of the Common  Agricultural Policy [CAP]. ""It is really time there was a sense  of outrage against the unmitigated wickedness of the CAP,"" he  said.    In Paris, Mr Clarke -- speaking in French -- said Britain's  growth prospects were intimately connected with Europe's and  linked to the economic aims contained in the Maastricht Treaty.    However, he took the opportunity to swipe at moves to force  Britain to subscribe to social and employment policies that he  felt would hinder competitiveness.    Mr Clarke, a Euro-enthusiast, voiced the concern of senior  ministers that developments such as the social chapter -- from  which Britain has opted out -- will play into the hands of the  freer market economies of the Far East.    But his message was essentially one of moving forward, in  contrast to Lord Tebbit's belief that the existing structure  would begin to unravel.    Mr Clarke said: ""As fellow members of the European Union, we  share a common commitment. We now have to help ensure that the  Union is pointing in the right direction. It must tackle its  deep- seated problems of competitiveness, recession and  unemployment. We can only do that by allowing private  enterprise and markets to realise more of their potential.""    The Liberal Democrats launched their campaign for the  European elections yesterday with a claim to be the only party  with a positive approach to closer ties in the EC, writes  Phillip Johnston.    Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said: ""We are the only party  that has been consistently and unashamedly pro-European and we  are proud of our record. Our task is to show that Britain needs  to take a lead in making Europe work for people.""    Mr Ashdown called for a common security policy and military  command for unified action in crises such as Bosnia.    The party also wants:    Action on jobs via a European recovery programme;    Better exploitation of EC regional fund assistance;    Stricter Green standards;    Gradual steps to one currency;    A stronger European parliament.    The Liberal Democrats are confident of gaining between three  and nine MEPs [Members of European Parliament] -- their first.     "
0,FT932-5319 ,"FT932-5319 _AN-DFDB5ACKFT 930604   FT  04 JUN 93 / Management: Breaking the executive mould - Andrew Taylor examines Eurotunnel's plans for a common corporate culture      By ANDREW TAYLOR   Two years ago Peter Randall was a British Rail depot manager at Slade Green near Dartford, Kent. His experience of France was limited to the occasional holiday and a French O-level. Today, aged 33, he commutes weekly from his home near Folkestone in Kent to Calais in northern France where he is the Eurotunnel manager responsible for day-to-day maintenance of the company's wagon and locomotive fleet. Next year, when the tunnel operator finally starts running train services between Britain and France, he will be responsible for a staff of 160, most of them French. Quite apart from its continuing headaches dealing with combative contractors and nervous banks, one of the big challenges for Eurotunnel at the moment is to mould Randall and other senior managers into a new breed of cross-Channel executive. Eurotunnel's workforce is split evenly between British and French workers with different languages, cultures and lifestyles - but when it comes to senior jobs the group is anxious not to be overly influenced by a candidate's background. Yves-Noel Derenne, Eurotunnel's director of human resources, says: 'The aim is not to recruit a particular nationality for a particular post, but to get the right person for the job, whether they be British, French, German or from some other country. There will be some jobs, however, which we would expect to be filled by one nationality rather than another. The servicing of rolling stock (because this is based in France) would naturally fall into this category. Headquarters for security, on the other hand, will be based in Britain.' Not all jobs will divide so evenly. Engine drivers taking the 50km journey between the British and French terminals will be expected to be bi-lingual and will be drawn from both countries. Traffic controllers will also need to be fluent in English and French. The main control tower will be at Folkestone, but with a back-up in France. Staff working on a rota will switch regularly between Britain and France. Even at the top - where national sensitivities are often greatest - the company has tried to choose the best people for the job. Among the five senior executive directors there are admittedly two Frenchmen and two Britons - one of whom, chief executive Sir Alastair Morton, was raised in South Africa - but Frank Cain, on secondment from engineering group Bechtel to run the construction side, is American. Eurotunnel's workforce, small during the construction phase, is growing rapidly and currently stands at 900, more than double that of a year ago. Eventually this will rise to 2,650 of which more than 90 per cent will be drawn from Britain and France. A small number of mostly sales staff will be based in other European countries. Alain Bertrand, Eurotunnel's chief executive in charge of transport operations, says: 'We do not want a competitive culture to develop, Britain versus France. Unlike other bi-national or multi-national companies, which have separate management operations in different countries, we supply a single service irrespective of which country the customer comes from. 'It is important, therefore, that we establish a single management structure and corporate culture in which safety and customer service are the main driving force rather than nationalism.' The ability to provide information to customers is very important: 'All employees in contact with customers will have the equivalent of at least two weeks of language training,' says Bertrand. The aim will be to provide them with the basic phrases to cope with their job rather than speak fluent English or French. Staff who want to improve further their language skills or switch from one country to another will be encouraged. Language training is more intense for managers or engineers who need to be able to converse freely in English and French. Some of these are sent to live with English or French families while they attend intensive language courses for up to four weeks at a cost of Pounds 1,100 a week including accommodation. Language is just one problem: 'There are different laws and cultures affecting employees in Britain and France,' says Derenne. 'Some multi-national companies adopt the laws of whichever country they happen to be operating in. This is not feasible or desirable for us. We have decided to adopt a common corporate policy based on a combination of British and French laws, whichever works to the best advantage of employees. 'French companies, for example, are expected to establish works councils, comprised of workers representatives and management, to discuss problems and improvements for staff. Eurotunnel has decided to establish a group-wide works council covering both French and British workers,' says Derenne. Cultural differences, of course, will not be so easy to reconcile. As Randall points out: 'Britons like to go out for a drink after work. The French by comparison like to go home to their families first and may go out later.' In other respects, though, it will probably be a question of getting used to local custom. Management in France, he says, tends not to advertise posts internally as is done in many British companies. Instead they will just promote the person they think most suitable for the job. But the result in most cases is the same. Despite these cultural and sometimes procedural differences, Randall says that most of the problems brought to him are similar to those he faced when a depot manager at Slade Green. 'Staff want to know how much they will be paid, what holiday entitlement there is, what are the promotional opportunities and what happens when they are sick?'   Companies:-  Eurotunnel.

That is what emerges  from the goals and main points of the EU presidency that were  approved by the cabinet in Bonn on Wednesday [22 June].  Speaking at the meeting, Chancellor Kohl said that he wanted  the Germans to exercise ""a normal and good presidency"" over the  next six months, one that should not seek superficial  achievements, but continuity in cooperation with partners,  especially with France and Spain. Foreign Minister Kinkel said  that Germany will show that it is committed to close and  enduring cooperation in ""solidly implementing the Maastricht  Treaty"" and make a particular effort to provide the European  Parliament with additional powers.    Discussing the Strasbourg EU Parliament, Kinkel drew  attention to difficulties connected with personnel decisions.  The European Parliament must vote on the composition of the  future EU Commission in Brussels. According to Bonn, the most  important question that the European Council has to answer in  Corfu on Friday is who will succeed Delors. There is  substantial annoyance in Bonn that Dutch Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers is conducting ""an election campaign with all possible  means"" to become president of the EU Commission, despite his  defeat in the parliamentary elections. There is particular  irritation in Bonn about personal attacks on Kohl. It is being  said that in the case of a secret ballot in Corfu on Friday  evening, Belgian Prime Minister [Jean-Luc] Dehaene can count on  a majority of 10 votes to two among the EU member states. If  Holland does not block a decision in favor of Dehaene and Great  Britain receives compensation in the form of another post, the  European Council will propose a new president at the Corfu  meeting. Great Britain is currently still promoting its  candidate [Trade Commissioner Sir Leon] Brittan and has raised  objections to Dehaene, saying that the Belgian is a  ""federalist."" In Bonn, it is being said that Great Britain is  considering convoking a special meeting of the European Council  at the end of July or the beginning of September, because of a  lack of consensus. The German EU presidency would then have to  ""conjure up"" another candidate: The three current contenders --  Dehaene, Lubbers, and Brittan -- would have to drop out in such  a case. That would be inconvenient for the German Government.  Bonn sees that as making the presidency more difficult.  [passage omitted]    A European Council action program for combating unemployment  is to be launched during the German presidency, which begins  after the meeting on Corfu, and the Federal Government wants to  press for adherence to free market principles during its  implementation. Kinkel and Economics Minister Rexrodt said that  the currency union should not be postponed, but should only come  into effect once the convergence criteria have been satisfied.  Rexrodt announced that the German presidency would institute a  technical procedure in Brussels for monitoring the budgetary  situation in individual member states. Industrial policy should  not be allowed to amount to no more than employment programs,  but should also bolster private investment. Bonn will appoint a  commission composed of representatives of business, science,  public administration, and trade unions in the member countries.  The commission should establish which central regulations can  be done away with. The European Union should conduct a critical  assessment of restrictions on trade with East Europe. Various  Brussels subsidy programs should be examined ""so that there  should not be a flood of such programs, for which Germany pays  every third German mark."" Kinkel summed up Germany's intentions  for the next six months as follows: ""The German presidency will  not make any promises that it cannot keep.""     "

The communique opens  almost 100 percent of the fishing zone that London unilaterally  imposed in 1986 around the islands.    The Argentine-British communique states that the Kelpers  (the  islanders) in 1994 may fish only 150,000 tons of squid, both in  the 150-mile zone around the Malvinas (known as FICZ [expansion  unknown], which is its English acronym), and in the outside zone  (FOCZ [expansion unknown]).    This figure was agreed upon at the negotiations on 1  November  1993 (for Argentina, the maritime limit is 220 miles). Fishing  and prospecting for oil are two issues intimately linked with  the conflict over sovereignty over the islands.    The communique, which was simultaneously released in London  and Buenos Aires on 30 December, takes into account the  so-called sovereignty protection ""umbrella"" the two countries  agreed upon in 1990. In its substantive part, the communique  states:    ""The Argentine and British Governments today declared that  in  line with the previous exchanges between the two governments,  the British Government will authorize fishing during the 1994  season in the maritime zone described in the annex to the joint  declaration of 28 November 1990.""    The short communique means that Great Britain has agreed to  issue a joint communique to announce a measure that it was going  to adopt unilaterally, in order to facilitate the Argentine  Government's presentation to the nation of its new progress in  the South Atlantic.    The complex diplomatic language, however, reveals that the  decision to authorize fishing in the zone -- where all types of  fishing were banned for two years -- was made by London, and  that it was not a joint decision.    It is not merely a matter of semantics. The area that has  been opened to third-party ships is as big as Rio Negro  Province. In 1990, then-Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo,  shortly after the reestablishment of diplomatic relations,  managed to release a joint communique in which the two countries  decided to simultaneously ban fishing in the outside zone.    But, as CLARIN noted on that occasion, the fact that no  ships  with Argentine license are allowed to operate in that zone and  National Prefecture ships cannot patrol it either shows that  both joint communiques are a nice envelope for a bitter measure:  the expansion of the British fishing zone around the Malvinas.  In this regard, Kelper John Barton -- the Malvinas Fishing  Department chief -- has clarified things to REDES magazine: ""In  the zone known as FOCZ, fishing will be allowed only with a  license granted by our government.""    The only British concession obtained in the last  negotiations, along with the decision to release a joint  communique, is to maintain the 150,000-metric ton ceiling for  the licenses to be granted by the Kelpers.    [The same newspaper, on the same date and page, adds: ""Vice  Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella on 30 December said the  Argentine-British joint communique was `very positive' for a  series of reasons.    ``Petrella told CLARIN: `It is a text that was agreed upon  by the two countries, and not a unilateral measure. Great  Britain, which could have adopted a unilateral decision,  preferred not to do it, thus preserving the level of bilateral  relations.'    ``Petrella, who on 30 December replaced Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella, who went on vacation, emphasized that the  communique `has the same value as a communique' [as published]  and noted that the fact that it was issued within the framework  of the sovereignty protection `umbrella maintains the validity  of the fact that Great Britain admits that it is a disputed  zone.''']     "

During the weekend [26-27 March]  the foreign ministers presented a compromise proposal to their  London colleague Douglas Hurd as a last offer in Ioannina,  Greece, a proposal in which they do not yield one millimeter of  substance. They only built a bridge for Hurd, across which he  can retreat. What the British wanted to prevent at all costs has  now been set down: In an enlarged union it will no longer be 23  votes but 27 that are necessary to build a blocking minority.  The smaller minority then can still delay decisions, according  to the formal concession -- and that until the Council decides  the end of the debate with a simple majority in line with its  standing orders. Then the matter is decided with the usual  qualified majority of 70 percent.    However, this has been the usual procedure at the European  Council of Ministers' meetings anyway, because for them how one  treats the other is more important than the arithmetic of votes.  In Brussels the government representatives are not overly  surprised when the votes are taken. Quite the opposite: The  decisions of the Council are usually clarified in the ""Committee  of Permanent Representatives"" of the 12 governments, which comes  before the Council of Ministers' meetings. If the ambassador of  a larger member country, such as the United Kingdom, objects,  the other 11 discuss the matter with him and postpone the  pending decision.    The ambassadors virtually buy from each other, with  compromises, the majority that they think politically  appropriate. Occasionally, the opposition exhibited by any one  of them is nothing but a game with marked cards to deceive the  opposing forces at home. This means: Quite a few ministers do  not mind being outvoted in Brussels. However, if things get  tough sometimes, the oppressed government has the last resort of  stressing a ""vital national interest"" and blocking the decision.  Just last autumn France got into the headlines when it  threatened to veto the European-U.S. agricultural agreements  within the framework of the GATT round. The Germans definitely  could have put in their veto in the past to prevent Brussels'  bad banana protectionism. However the Bonn agriculture minister  himself ""betrayed"" consumers' interests because he had to follow  the producers' interests.    Douglas Hurd knows what conditions in Brussels are like and  he knows very well that London's struggle for 23 instead of 27  votes is quixotic. He has probably joined the insight of a  growing part of his faction, namely that the foreign policy  damage that Great Britain is doing to itself far exceeds the  benefit of a compromise about balancing the votes, in particular  since this benefit can hardly be measured. From the British  viewpoint, it would make sense to struggle generally against the  instrument of majority vote in the Brussels Council of  Ministers, with the goal of turning the EU back into a forum of  cooperation among states. Just modifying the qualified majority  seems to be pointless since even opponents of European  integration, such as the British, are occasionally very  interested in pushing something through in Brussels.    Great Britain, for instance, is the pioneer of a liberal  economic constitution in the EU. Precisely at the time when, by  being enlarged to 16, the traditionally protectionist majority  of the current 12 member states might turn into a liberal  majority, which would be acceptable to the British as they want  to make votes by qualified majority more difficult. Today,  Tuesday, Secretary Hurd will try to make it clear to his  stubborn party colleagues that in Europe, Great Britain has  meanwhile acquired the bad reputation of being erratic and is  dramatically losing political weight. ""Lightweights,"" however,  are actually very much in need of the instrument of majority  vote.     "

'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement . . . we are in the final stages of discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said late on Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a delegation of businessmen and trade officials. The last official visit by a British minister to the communist-ruled island was almost 20 years ago. Mr Taylor said that despite the two countries' different political and economic systems and the recession gripping Cuba, the British government saw good prospects for increased trade and investment. He said he was concerned Britain was lagging behind Europe and Nafta nations in developing economic links with the island. Mr Taylor said he would be evaluating the economic reforms in Cuba since the collapse of its ties with the former Soviet bloc. Reforms to the state-controlled agriculture system were critical, he said. He would also discuss the issue of Cuba's outstanding debt to the Paris Club and to British companies. The latter is estimated to total Pounds 60m. Mr Taylor drew a distinction between Britain's attitude to Cuba and the US trade embargo against the island. 'My view about our trade with Cuba is that it's less influenced by what America does, and more influenced by how strong Cuba's opening towards market forces is,' he said. UK exports to Cuba totalled Pounds 14m last year, a 50 per cent drop from 1992, caused by the recession and a shortage of foreign exchange. But exports for the first half of 1994 were up 180 per cent, mainly due to a rise in cereal sales.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legal action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officials said yesterday. Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon. Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover for action against the UK. Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. The commission has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans. A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which Britain and the commission say are working. In 1990, certain bovine offals, like brain and spleen, were banned for human consumption. Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of live cattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows. In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years. British officials say that the EU single market will be disrupted unless all member states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat of unilateral action risks a collapse in beef consumption similar to the fall that followed the 1990 BSE scare. 'We feel we have a sound case and other member states and the Commission agree with us,' a senior British agriculture official said.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

In a series of carefully crafted phrases, the party's  economic policy document for the European elections campaign  declares that Britain will not consider re-entry to the ERM in  the foreseeable future. The wording was approved by Mr John  Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign  secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.    But the formulation of the document -- A Competitive Britain  in a Competitive Europe -- left the door open for a change of  heart after the next election.    The document says that Britain's criticism of the ERM had  been widely acknowledged. In those circumstances, it says, ""we  will not re-enter such a mechanism in the foreseeable future,  nor could we do so until it is clear that such faults no longer  exist.""    That olive branch to the Euro-sceptics is followed by a  reassurance to pro-Europeans that ""we will not, however, cut  ourselves off from future discussion of how economic policies  can best be co-ordinated within the European Union [EU] in order  to secure competitiveness, growth and jobs.""    Ministers said the wording would provide the basis of the  party's position to be set out in the full manifesto next month.    Ministers also voiced confidence that the formulation would  bridge the sharp divide on Tory back benches over ERM membership.    On the issue of a single currency, the document repeats the  studiously neutral position implied by Britain's opt-out from  the Maastricht Treaty. Parliament would retain the right to  take a separate decision -- in the light of Britain's interest  and needs -- if and when other members of the EU moved to create  a single currency.     "
0,FT933-12706 ,"FT933-12706 _AN-DGWCHAAAFT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / Major ready to defy Commons on social chapter: Prime minister calls emergency cabinet meeting before crucial vote      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   MR JOHN MAJOR last night staked his administration's future on ratification of the Maastricht treaty with an unequivocal warning that he was ready to defy the House of Commons if it voted for the social chapter. In a stormy, angry debate as MPs prepared for last night's crucial votes on whether Britain should accept the treaty's social provisions, Mr Major said nothing would deflect him from ratification of the treaty. But with the outcome still on a knife-edge, the prime minister was forced to summon an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the options in the event of a defeat. Accusing his opponents of cynicism and political opportunism, the prime minister said that failure to ratify Maastricht would destroy British influence within the European Community. Conservative party managers last night were still struggling to secure endorsement of Britain's social chapter opt-out with a combination of blatant arm-twisting, backstairs bargaining and passionate pleading. But with the Ulster Unionists still wavering, no one was confident of a government victory. There was speculation that the cabinet was considering offering them a series of concessions, including the creation of a Commons committee with the right to look at security in the province. Mr Major sought to step up the pressure on Tory opponents of the treaty with an impassioned plea for loyalty and unity at a packed meeting of the backbench 1922 committee only hours before MPs were due to vote. He warned that imposition of the social chapter would risk aborting the economic recovery now underway, driving out British businesses and jobs to overseas competitors and undermining the flow of overseas investment in the UK. The prime minister told the Tory rebels that whatever the outcome they would fail in their attempts to wreck the entire treaty. Dismissing suggestions that he might be forced to embrace the social chapter, he said the enactment earlier this week of the European Communities (Amendment) bill had provided the authority for ratification of the original treaty. He added: 'Rarely in recent history has parliament shown its will so effectively. Today's debate is an attempt to frustrate that will.' His comments - signalling his readiness to defy the alliance of opposition parties and Tory Eurosceptics ranged against him - provoked outrage and warnings of a constitutional crisis from opposition leaders. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused Mr Major of threatening to ride roughshod over the will of parliament, warning that the social chapter opt-out would turn Britain into the 'sweatshop of Europe'. But Mr Major said that yesterday's debate had no relevance to the ratification process: 'Parliament is no longer debating the Maastricht treaty. The bill is now an act. In due course the treaty will be ratified'. Emphasising that Britain could not renege on its commitments, he told MPs: 'If we wilfully throw away our capacity to defend our interests and promote our policies in that (European) market, I believe this country will pay a dear price for that folly in the years to come.'

The reason China does not want to wreck Hong  Kong is because in recent years, Hong Kong's industrial and  commercial circles have firmly supported the position of the  Chinese Government, and the PRC would not wish to see their  benefits adversely affected.    Therefore, in my personal estimate, the possibility of the  Sino-British talks collapsing is not great; even if they did  collapse and agreement could not be reached, the resulting  impact would not be very great. On the one hand, this is because  Hong Kong residents have low expectations that the negotiations  would be successful, and the shock of not having any agreement  would therefore be correspondingly limited. On the other hand,  from a more serious perspective, any agreement that might be  reached between the two sides will likely be a tactical rather  than strategic agreement; as both sides can no longer cooperate  sincerely, any agreement reached will only involve cooperation  to the extent that it minimizes damages to both sides while  maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.    In point of fact, however, beginning in early April, the  points of view and observed tendencies among Hong Kong's pro-PRC  media have shown that China intends to separate politics from  economics, and even if no agreement is reached on the political  system, maximum effort will be made in the economic area to  maintain cooperation, for example, in approving the land-fill  engineering project for the Central District; Wang Qiren [3769  0796 0086], Hong Kong-Macao Affairs Office Deputy Director, has  also publicly stated that it is China's intention to continue to  support the development of Hong Kong's economy.    The above line of reasoning assumes a rosy scenario; that  is,  even if China and Britain really cannot reach any agreement on  the political system, the shock for Hong Kong will not be too  great. However, undeniably also is the fact that without an  agreement, there will be some side effects. To begin with,  Britain will face considerable difficulties in turning the Hong  Kong Government over to a Special Administrative Region [SAR]  government. The turnover, in and of itself, will involved myriad  details, but from the mid-1980s to the present, not a great deal  has been accomplished in terms of preparatory work. Now with  only a little over three years left before the 1997 turnover,  one must wonder whether it will be possible to complete all the  necessary preparatory work for the turnover. If the situation  should remain unchanged, the SAR government will certainly  encounter difficulties during its initial establishment phase in  1996 and 1997.    Furthermore, the lack of any agreement will impact on the  rank and file civil servants in Hong Kong. Under the  circumstances in which Britain and China cannot cooperate with  any degree of sincerity, how can these civil servants  concentrate on their work? Will the status of senior civil  servants be maintained? The highest-ranking civil servants have  various options, namely, to leave, to emigrate or to stay and  join the private sector in industries or commerce. It can thus  be anticipated that without any agreement the civil servants  will have no basis for making suitable plans.    Furthermore, as the Hong Kong Government becomes  increasingly  a ""lame duck"" government, it will have even greater difficulties  gaining majority support in the Legislative Council. At the same  time, as the Hong Kong Government must perforce concentrate on  managing the difficult Sino-British relationship, it will also  have to devote what energy it has left to solve the larger  issues of people's livelihood, and many problems such as housing  (particularly the problem of subdivided, multi-storied  buildings) will become even more difficult to handle. Another  example is medical services, where the whole set of concepts is  no longer applicable; with costs of medical care continuing  their upward climb, the per-bed intensive care cost is over a  thousand Hong Kong dollars but patients now pay only some 40  dollars; the government in fact will not be able to continue to  provide large scale subsidies to medical care, and without such  government support, the standard of medical services will  certainly decline. The government should encourage the younger  generations to purchase their own medical insurance before this  problem can fundamentally be solved. But if the government lacks  the political will, how can it proceed to institute such reform?  Confronted with [challenges of] the 1990s, the Hong Kong  government should have new policy measures to deal with such  issues, but the government has dragged its feet, not getting  adequate support from the Legislative Council to take any  action, and leaving many social problems of people's livelihood  begging for solutions. We can well imagine in the days to come,  the government will need to cope with the 1994 and 1995  elections on the one hand, and with the transition in 1996-97 on  the other; larger issues of people's livelihood may well have to  be put off to the next century before they can be dealt with.    Aside from the above, in a situation of Sino-British  contention, with two clearly defined camps facing each other,  both sides may well lack the ability to compromise. The closer  we get to 1997, the stronger the pro-China forces will become;  among them, some political parties may well decline to take part  in elections, and the democratic faction facing no opposition  will score another big win. This type of situation will make  things much more difficult, for while it is normal for any  political party to win big under normal competitive  circumstances, the situation would be much more complicated if  the victory was the result of elections boycotted by other  political parties.    Naturally, if the Sino-British relationship should really  deteriorate, some economic projects will of course face great  difficulties, such as the No. 9 container dock and the new  airport. But the major difficulties will be on the Chinese side,  because under the circumstance of mutual suspicion and extreme  non-cooperation, it will not be easy at all to reach agreement  on any individual economic projects; this is not so much a case  of the Chinese side refusing to grant permission, but when China  and Britain distrust each other, no Chinese official would dare  take on the responsibility to approve any individual economic  projects.    As for the stock and real estate markets, Hong Kong people  have gradually adapted themselves to the Sino-British disputes,  and will not attach great importance to the lack of an  agreement. For after all, any agreement will only be a tactical  move, and given the fact that 1997 is close at hand, the  importance of an agreement is declining daily. Major investors  pay even less attention to the question of Sino-British  cooperation or to 1997, since the factor they most emphasize is  still the future development potential of China. If China  continues to reform and open up, and remains a good place to  invest, then these investors would basically pay no attention to  the Sino-British dispute; were they to behave otherwise,  investment activities in Hong Kong in recent years would  certainly have been affected; yet on the contrary, the stock  market and real estate market have continued to score new highs.  Based on present development, unless Chinese economic  adjustments hit rock bottom, and that coming on top of the  Sino-British dispute, Hong Kong would not be affected to any  serious extent.     "

In doing this, the British  side unilaterally released some information about the talks  between the Chinese and British Governments on the arrangements  for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This constituted a  breach of the understanding reached between the two sides before  the opening of the talks, in which they committed themselves not  to reveal the substance of the talks. Furthermore, the British  side also misrepresented and lashed out at the Chinese side's  stance, in an attempt to lay blame on the Chinese side for  disrupting the talks.    In response to this, the Chinese side had no choice but to  release its version--""The Facts Concerning Several Major  Questions on the Sino-British Talks on the 1994/95 Electoral  Arrangements for Hong Kong,"" with the aim of dispelling  confusion among the public.    This dispute between China and Britain is not about arguing  whether Hong Kong needs democracy, as alleged by Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten, but whether it is still necessary to keep  international commitments and whether the local constitutional  development still needs to converge with the Basic Law so as to  ensure a stable transition in Hong Kong. The substance of the  dispute is that the Chinese side wants to uphold national  dignity, to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as  scheduled, to found the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  [SAR] -- which will be placed directly under the central  people's government -- and to set up an SAR government primarily  constituted by Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong.  Britain, on the other hand, is not willing to give up its  colonial rule over Hong Kong but is attempting to extend its  influence on Hong Kong as a former colony after 1997, by  knocking together a pro-British clique under the pretext of  ""constitutional reform."" This is our key to understanding the  disputes between China and Britain on a series of issues.    Ulterior Motives Behind Major Changes    Section 3 of Article 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration  provides that ""the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will  remain basically unchanged;"" Section 5 provides that ""the  current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain  unchanged, and so will the life style."" The Basic Law provides:  Hong Kong's political structure should evolve ""in accordance  with the principle of gradual and orderly progress."" However,  Chris Patten's ""constitutional reform package"" intends to  substantially change Hong Kong's existing political structure.  This obviously goes counter to the stipulations of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.    Over the more than 100 years of British occupation, Hong  Kong's political structure has always been based on the  principles laid down in the ""Letters Patent"" and the ""Royal  Instructions"" and was seldom changed. Then why is it necessary  to introduce such major changes in the political structure of  Hong Kong during the late transitional period? All  clear-thinking people can see the ulterior motive behind this  illogic and faith-breaking act by Britain. Let us review the  following facts:    Hong Kong has always upheld an executive-led political  structure. The term ""executive-led"" means that ruling Hong Kong  is primarily the responsibility of the executive organ. The  Legislative Council [Legco] is merely a consultative  organization for the Hong Kong governor in the legislative  process which does not hold any real power of legislation. Any  law bill adopted by Legco must be ratified by the Hong Kong  governor before it comes into force, otherwise it cannot be  implemented. What is more, laws that have been ratified by the  Hong Kong governor can still be overruled by the British royal  family, which can even create legislation for Hong Kong directly.    In the past, Britain upheld the executive-led structure.  Britain's ultimate purpose in doing this was to ensure that the  British monarch and the Hong Kong governor appointed by him  could exclusively hold power and maintain Britain's absolute  rule over Hong Kong, so that Britain's interests in Hong Kong  could be safeguarded. Given this objective fact, the executive  organ -- free of interference from the legislative organ --  could have a free rein in handling affairs, which enabled the  government to make decisions and operate in a highly efficient  manner.    With his ""constitutional reform package,"" Chris Patten has  been trying very hard to introduce the representative government  system practiced in western countries into Hong Kong, augment  the Legco's power, and change the existing executive-led  structure, so as to develop a structure under which ""the  legislative branch dominates the executive branch."" Hong Kong,  however, is not a state-like entity but merely an area. The  above development will inevitably lead to a loss of stability in  the decisionmaking process within the executive organ, thus  weakening the government's management efficiency. What is even  more serious is that, once the executive organ is dominated by  the legislative organ, Hong Kong will land in a position in  which it is vulnerable to endless disputes on political affairs,  the executive organ will be faced with difficulty in exercising  its power, and is likely to experience intervention by foreign  political forces in local affairs. Consequently, the  sovereignty that the Chinese Government is to exercise over Hong  Kong after 1997 will be nullified, and Britain will be able to  sustain its control over Hong Kong through this legislative body  which plays a dominant role.    The Basic Law has already expressly described the process  for introducing the democratic system into Hong Kong and  developing democracy in the territory, and it has set a rather  rapid pace for the process. For example, the future SAR  legislative organ will be completely constituted by elections  (including direct and indirect elections -- the number of seats  returned by direct election will be increased with every round  of elections until finally all the seats will be returned by  general election); the chief executive will be selected through  consultations or election; the legislative organ will be vested  with genuine legislative power, and so on. Therefore, this  dispute is not to argue whether democracy is wanted or not.  Whether the executive-led political structure is to be changed  or not is in substance a major issue of principle which has a  bearing on the smooth exercise of sovereignty and ruling power  over Hong Kong by the Chinese Government beyond 1997.    Breaking Faith and Going Back on Their Word    As far as the issue of Hong Kong's political structure is  concerned, the British side has violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law,  and the agreements and understandings already reached between  the Chinese and British sides. Examples of the ""three  violations"" by the British side are numerous in the  ""constitutional reform package"" put forth by Chris Patten.    According to the decision of the National People's Congress  [NPC], the first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be  formed by 60 members, of whom 30 are to be returned by  functional constituencies. If the term of office of the last  Legco to be formed in 1995 is to stride past 1997 to become the  first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR, then the last Legco  will have to be formed in accordance with the above principle.  However, Chris Patten's package proposes that 21 of the 30  seats returned by functional constituencies should be selected  through vote by individuals rather than through vote by  corporate bodies, and, for the nine newly installed seats, the  method of election by functional constituencies should be  replaced by a method in which ""every individual member of every  functional sector will have a vote."" In other words, the  package intends to make the indirect functional constituency  elections into a disguised form of direct elections based on  trades.    At present, of the 60 seats in the Hong Kong Legco, 21 (or  35  percent) are returned from 19 corporate bodies based on  different social functions. These seats are called seats  returned by ""functional constituencies"" (or ""functional  sectors""). In the Basic Law, election by functional  constituencies is called ""election by functional bodies."" It is  obvious that elections by functional constituencies is an  indirect election based on the votes of functional bodies, which  is different from direct elections based on a vote by the entire  electorate.    Election by functional constituencies was first proposed by  the White Paper on representative government published by the  British Hong Kong Government in November 1984. In 1987, when  reviewing this system, the British Hong Kong Government  maintained that it had been approved by the majority of the  population, and therefore it decided to retain the system.  Since then, the number of Legco members returned by this form  of election has been increasing, going from six members in 1985  to 21 in 1991. During the drafting of the Basic Law, the  British side continued to recommend this form of election to the  Chinese side again and again. The number of seats returned by  direct election, even when it was referred to in the letter that  the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd wrote to Foreign  Minister Qian on 12 February 1990, did not include seats  returned by functional bodies. This is more proof indicating  that the British side always considered elections by functional  bodies as indirect elections.    In the belief that this form of election had been accepted  by  the Hong Kong people and did have some advantages, the Basic Law  drafting committee included in the Basic Law this form of  election by functional bodies, based on the principle that what  has been practiced and proved useful in Hong Kong shall be  retained, and this decision had the endorsement by the National  People's Congress.    Thus it can be seen that Chris Patten, in changing the  election by functional bodies as a form of indirect election  into a kind of disguised direct election, has totally violated  the Basic Law and the understandings and agreements reached  between the Chinese and British sides in the past, as well as  the original idea behind the introduction of seats for  functional constituencies. Even the former chief secretary of  the Hong Kong Government, David Akers- Jones, who was also the  author of this form of election, criticized Chris Patten's  constitutional package for contravening the original purpose of  elections by functional constituencies. This change will also  result in inequality in the right of election among citizens  because, of the more than 6 million population in Hong Kong, 2.7  million members of the working population will enjoy an extra  chance to vote in the disguised form of direct elections based  on profession, in addition to their first chance to vote already  granted on the basis of geographical divisions, while those  retired from these selected professions and other people outside  these professions enjoy only one chance to vote in the direct  election based on geographical divisions. This man-made  discrimination regarding the citizens' right to vote is  definitely unreasonable. It also violates the principle of  ""gradual and orderly progress"" for the development of the  elections by functional bodies. Although the British side later  submitted a revised program, it still will drastically expand  the electorate for the election by functional constituencies to  nearly 900,000, which means the 90,000-strong electorate, as  originally set for indirect election, will be drastically  increased by eight times. This obviously does not conform with  the principle of ""gradual and orderly progress.""    Then why did the British side recommend to the Chinese side  the form of election by functional constituencies in the past  but now intend to change it into a disguised form of direct  elections? The basic reason is that, as 1997 draws nearer and  nearer, the British side wants to arrange for more of its  followers to enter Legco. Indirect elections by functional  bodies can more easily return candidates who are prestigious and  influential within their functional sectors and who are willing  to assume responsibility for the Hong Kong community, and it is  more difficult for the British side to manipulate these people.  In direct elections, however, many professionals have neither  adequate financial resources nor the intention to run for  election. Thus, the British side will be able to manipulate the  elections behind the scenes and arrange for its favored  candidates to be elected to Legco.    The True Color of the Colonialists Who Attempt in Vain To  Infringe Upon China's Sovereignty    When it comes to the issues of the ""through train"" program  and the electoral committee, the British side has more blatantly  exposed its true color as a colonialist attempting in vain to  infringe upon China's sovereignty over Hong Kong in regard of  the constitutional system issue.    The so-called ""through train"" refers to an arrangement by  which the members of the last Legco formed under the British  Hong Kong authorities; specifically, that Legco members elected  in 1995 will have their term of office carried forward beyond  1997 and thus they will become members of the first Legco of the  Hong Kong SAR of the PRC.    When drafting the Basic Law, the Chinese Government adopted  some opinions put forth by the British Government. The Basic  Law has included some provisions related to the ""through train.""  When the Basic Law was ratified by the Third Plenary Session of  the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] on 4 April 1990,  the session also adopted the ""Decision of the NPC on the Method  for the Formation of the First Government and the First  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR."" Paragraph 6 of this  decision reads: ""If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legco  before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity  with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law  of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic  Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC  and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC, and who  meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law of the Region  may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee, become  members of the first Legco for the Region.""    In other words, whether the incumbent Legco members can  benefit from the ""through train"" program is conditional; it is  not unconditional. As long as the requirements as cited above  are met, the ""through train"" program will work.    However, Chris Patten is attempting to slap together a Legco  lineup according to his ""constitutional reform package,"" which  he expects will take the ""through train"" and operate beyond 1997  as the future Hong Kong SAR Legco. It is obvious that this is  wishful thinking on his part, by which he is attempting to  ensure that this lineup will play a ""legislative-led"" role to  extend the influence of British colonial rule in Hong Kong.    Now let us review the disputes provoked by the British side  over the formation of the election committee.    According to the provisions set forth by Annex I and Annex  II  of the Basic Law, the chief executive and some members of the  Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be elected by a broadly  representative election committee. Annex I of the Basic Law  also expressly provides: ""The Election Committee shall be  composed of 800 members from the following sectors: Industrial,  commercial, and financial sectors, 200; the professions, 200;  labor, social services, religious, and other sectors, 200;  members of the Legislative Council, representatives of  district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, and  representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 200.  The Election Committee's term of office shall be five years.""    As far as this question is concerned, the Chinese and  British  sides reached an understanding through an exchange of letters in  the spring of 1990 before the NPC adopted the Basic Law. By  that time, the British side had already agreed in principle on  the composition and ratio of members of the election committee  as prescribed by Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft).    However, with his constitutional reform package, Chris  Patten  wants the 1995 election committee to ""be composed completely or  mostly of members of district boards returned by direct  election."" According to Chris Patten's package, both Hong Kong  deputies to the NPC and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National  Committee will not be able to become members of the election  committee as prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law, nor can the  four categories of people join the election committee to make it  more balanced as prescribed in the Basic Law.    British Ambassador to China Alan Donald handed a written  note  to the Chinese side on 6 February 1990, putting forth five  principles on the formation of the election committee and a  proposal that the committee be formed by four categories of  people. The Chinese side gave a written reply to the British  side on 8 February that year, expressly stating that ""the  Chinese side agrees with the five principles concerning the  election committee proposed by the British side in the document.  However, the Chinese side maintains that the provisions on the  composition and ratio of the election committee as specified in  Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft) must be followed  in terms of its proportional composition. This is because Annex  I was approved by a two-thirds majority of the membership of the  Drafting Committee at its eighth plenary session. China  believes that its provisions on composition and ratio are  appropriate and should therefore not be subject to change.""  Then, in his letter to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen dated 12  February, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd confirmed: ""I  agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for  an Electoral Committee, which could be established in 1995. The  precise details of how this should be done can be discussed  between our two sides in due course."" This evidence in black  and white shows that the British side did agree at that time to  have an election committee formed in 1995 in accordance with  Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. In other words, the  Chinese and British sides at that time had already reached an  agreement and understanding on the formation of an election  committee in 1995.    According to Chris Patten's package, all Legco members  elected in 1995 should be allowed to board the ""through train""  to become members of the first Legco of the Hong Kong SAR of  China, whereas Hong Kong deputies to the NPC -- China's highest  organ of power -- and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National  Committee -- China's highest consultative organ -- will not be  admitted into the Electoral Committee that is to elect some of  the Legco members. This is an extremely absurd plan which  constitutes an infringement upon China's sovereignty and the  Hong Kong people's rights.    The Old Trick Is Played Again; Their Character Remains  Unchanged    Hong Kong has been a part of China since ancient times.  Following the Opium War of 1840, with solidly built warships and  powerful cannons, Britain forced the Qing government to sign  three unequal treaties and thus occupied Hong Kong, Kowloon, and  the New Territories. After the founding of new China, the  Chinese Government has been consistently upholding its stance of  not recognizing the three unequal treaties that the imperialists  forced upon China but has maintained that Hong Kong as a whole  should be recovered in due course through negotiations. In  1982, Chinese leaders officially informed the British side that  the Chinese Government had decided to recover the entire Hong  Kong area in 1997. After that, in the Sino-British talks on the  Hong Kong issue, the British side first argued that ""the three  treaties are valid,"" then put forth the idea of ""exchange of  sovereignty for ruling power,"" and later on the idea of ""largest  extent of autonomy,"" with the aim of changing Hong Kong into an  independent or semi-independent political entity subject to  Britain's influence. After all these tricks failed, Britain  finally put forth the ""constitutional reform package.""    As the old saying goes: Reviewing the past helps one  understand the present. In modern world history, each time that  Britain was forced to withdraw from one of its colonies, it  consistently sowed discord and created conflicts and  confrontation by playing the trick of pseudo-democracy, thus  placing the new regime under the control of pro-British agents  so that it would be able to retain the political and economic  advantages that it enjoyed in its former colonies. The British  side has been trying to do this again with regard to the Hong  Kong issue. Back in 1946, as the British felt that their rule  over Hong Kong might not last long, then Hong Kong Governor Mark  Young made a statement on transforming Hong Kong's political  framework and planned to set up a ""municipal council."" In June  1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was heading south,  and the liberation of all of China was within sight. Under such  a circumstances, then Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham  gazetted the ""municipal council"" program. This was in fact the  very first ""constitutional reform package"" set forth by Britain  for Hong Kong. According to this package, Britain would withdraw  from Hong Kong only nominally but would actually maintain  British influence in Hong Kong through a British-style political  framework. New China did not send troops across the Shenzhen  River to expel the British out from Hong Kong, however. Britain  realized that it was possible for it to continue its rule over  Hong Kong without withdrawing from the territory. This being  the case, the introduction of a ""constitutional reform"" in  preparation for withdrawal from the territory would obstruct the  British Hong Kong authorities' rule over Hong Kong. Therefore,  without hesitation, Britain gave up Mark Young's plan for  establishing a ""municipal council."" The Churchill  administration even announced: ""Introducing any more  far-reaching political reform in Hong Kong would not be  appropriate."" We are now getting closer and closer to 1997,  when Hong Kong is to return to China, and the British will soon  terminate their colonial rule in Hong Kong forever. So we see  Britain playing its old trick again, sending Chris Patten to  Hong Kong to launch his ""constitutional reform package""  characterized by the ""three violations."" If we compare what is  happening today with historical facts, Britain's covert  intentions will become obvious.    The Chinese Government today is different from the Qing  Government of the past, however, and the Chinese people of today  are no longer the ""sick men of East Asia"" that they used to be.  China's sovereignty brooks no infringement by anybody. As  pointed out by Deng Xiaoping: ""The question of sovereignty is  not one which can be discussed."" China will never barter away  principles. China hopes that the Sino-British talks can achieve  positive results and that China and Britain can cooperate with  one another since it will be beneficial to Hong Kong's stability  and prosperity. Nevertheless, this does not imply that it will  not be possible for Hong Kong to maintain stability and  prosperity without Britain. Even if the British side shows no  sincerity in reaching an agreement through negotiations and  persists in undermining Sino-British cooperation, China will  still be able to ensure a stable transition and long-term  prosperity in Hong Kong.

Pilatus Aircraft, a subsidiary of Oerlikon-Buhrle, best  known  for its sophisticated weapons systems, currently manufactures  its Pilatus PC-7 and PC-9 aircraft in Stans, near Lucerne.    The planes, originally developed for training, have been  widely sold to countries such as Guatemala, Burma, Iraq, Iran  and El Salvador. Swiss law prohibits military sales to `areas of  conflict.'    Pilatus has long claimed that its planes are not military  equipment and that, if armies buy them for training, that is not  the same as buying them for killing. But the Defence Ministry,  which decides when export licences may be granted, is  interpreting the rules more narrowly.    The planes leave the factory equipped for training, but  sometimes acquire gun points by the time they reach their  destination. The Pilatus works and Oerlikon insist that they can  do nothing about what happens to their products at stop-overs.  At least one company in Belgium openly offers gun-ready  conversion services.    Officially, the company says the reason for its move to  Britain is `mostly money.' But the subtext is that the European  Union in general, and Britain in particular, look more  hospitable as export bases.    Pilatus will not say when the production transfer will take  place and a spokesman said last week that no jobs would be lost  in Stans, so aircraft for crop-dusting or training may be built  there, while more problematic buyers are served from Britain.    The Pilatus works are named after a nearby mountain which  commemorates a legend that a Roman, first name Pontius and known  for washing his hands of responsibility, wound up there in his  old age.

Our president, who was addressing the press festival  yesterday, said the British Government violated international  norms by planting a secret microphone in our embassy in London.  It also raised the controversy of collaboration between Iran  and the IRA.    About two weeks ago, the British Foreign Office claimed that  its security personnel had discovered documentary evidence that  the Islamic Republic of Iran was providing funds to the IRA  through its agents and was seeking to plan to deliver weapons to  the IRA too. These claims were immediately endorsed by the  minister for Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Commons.  But not much had happened when a spokesman for Sinn Fein--the  political wing of the IRA-- refuted the British claim as a  baseless shot in the dark and unfounded propaganda, adding: To  eclipse its defeat in organizing peace talks on Ireland, the  British Government has resorted to such accusations.    Similarly, three days after the British allegations against  the Islamic Republic of Iran and following a swift and  categorical rebuttal by our officials, London's newspapers  revealed that the accusations by John Major's government were  totally unfounded and bereft of any grounds or evidence. In  this regard, THE SUNDAY TIMES, in its 1 May edition, wrote: The  British Government has no acceptable documentary evidence to  present to the court.    It thus appears that the veteran statesmen of London  resorted  to espionage and an overt violation of international laws by  planting listening devices in our embassy to pursue objectives  that were more important than their international credibility  and reputation. Many possibilities can be enumerated in an  analysis of these actions and London's desired objectives. No  one should ignore that John Major's government and the  Conservative party led by him are confronting serious problems  stemming from a dichotomy in the party. This problem is so  crucial that there is talk of the resignation of John Major's  government.    Despite the defensive action by the British Government in  leveling charges against the Islamic Republic of Iran being  nipped in the bud, and neither British officials nor the British  rumormongering newspapers presenting any plausible evidence of  Iran's support for the Irish secessionists, the British  Government strove to initiate this unfounded rumor in a  so-called preemptive move to prevent humiliation regarding its  espionage activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy.    The British Government--by trampling international laws  underfoot--has confirmed that it attaches no importance to its  commitments to international rights and diplomatic immunity and  that when the country's interests dictate, it considers any  illegal activity justified.    As a country professing reciprocal respect for others'  rights, Britain has--by its recent acts of espionage in the  Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy--again revealed its  interventionist and aggressive nature. The past record of  espionage is nothing new for the British echelons. They believe  that the colonial world of past centuries continues and that  Britain has the right to interfere in others' affairs and to  trample upon diplomatic immunity.    For such countries, wholesome relations based on reciprocal  interests have no meaning. What is important is getting  information and capitalizing on the amicable approach of the  other side. The issue of British spying on the Islamic Republic  of Iran's Embassy is not the first such incident. It is  certainly not the last. Every country should be vigilant, aware  that such intentions and actions might not be confined to one  embassy in Britain alone.     "

In Spain, Oleg Davydov was a member of the delegation  accompanying Boris Yeltsin during his official visit, and in  Morocco he took part as an Russian observer in the concluding  meeting of the Uruguay round of the negotiations within the  framework of GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. In  Great Britain he conducted talks with his English colleagues and  business circles, reports POSTFAKTUM.    During his numerous meetings with foreign colleagues from  Spain, Israel, Brazil, Uruguay, Great Britain and other  countries, and with the business circles of Spain and Great  Britain, Oleg Davydov called upon them to actively cooperate  with Russia in trade as well as in economic investment.  Recognizing the difficulties of work by foreign investors in  Russia under conditions of a most difficult crisis, high  inflation and, mainly, the absence of legislation to guarantee  the effectiveness and ensure protection of foreign capital  investments, Oleg Davydov noted that at the present time Russia  is taking definite steps to stabilize the economy. Inflation has  been reduced, although it has been impossible to overcome the  inertia of economic decline. To support the continued movement  of reforms, the government is developing proposals for creating  beneficial conditions for foreign investors, specifically in the  sphere of the light and food industry.    To expand its foreign trade, Russia, according to Oleg  Davydov, intends to bring its foreign trade legislation in line  with the conditions of GATT, which it intends to join in the  near future. For this purpose, there will be a gradual  liberalization of foreign economic ties in accordance with the  conditions of the transitional period. On the road to GATT, a  reduction in export duties is envisioned, with their subsequent  total repeal in the future. The list of goods subject to quotas  and licensing is being reduced, certification of import goods  has been undertaken and a system of certification of export  products is being created, and the preferential financing of  import is being repealed.    Oleg Davydov stressed that Russia intends to adhere to the  right to intellectual property in accordance with the principles  of the Uruguay agreement. While speaking out in favor of a free  and open Russian market, Russia will nevertheless implement a  policy of rational protectionism, without violating GATT  principles.    Noting that British enterprises are most prepared for  cooperation with Russia, Oleg Davydov called upon them to  consider the fact that ""in the next century Russia and China  will define world economic development,"" reports POSTFAKTUM.    Upon his return to Moscow, the minister will meet with harsh  criticism, as expressed in the recommendations of the Duma, ""On  Foreign Economic Activity.""    Specifically, the Committee on Economic Policy headed by  Davydov's former chief, Glazyev, is recommending to the  president that the 12 presidential edicts on customs benefits be  ""brought into line with the legislation"" (in essence, repealed).  To the government it is recommending that it submit to the State  Duma a draft of a federal program for the development of export;  step up work on repayment of debts of foreign states to Russia;  develop measures for preventing economic crimes in the sphere of  foreign economic activity; introduce openness into the  registration of exporters of strategically important raw  material goods, and improve the system of management of foreign  economic activity in the interests of national industry. For  this purpose, it should examine the question of uniting the  functions of the state administration in the sphere of foreign  economic and industrial policy within the framework of a single  department (ministry) on the basis of the MVES [Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations], Goskomprom [RF State Committee on  Industrial Policy] and subdivisions of the Ministry of Economics.

Anyone who has fumbled with the controls on a video recorder, become confused by the digital display on a camera, or cursed at a computer will know what he means. Encouragingly for a country still struggling out of a harsh recession, people in Britain are somewhat more comfortable with today's technology than those in France, Germany or the US. While 55 per cent of French, 50 per cent of German, and 55 per cent of US adults and teenagers are techno-phobic, the figure for Britain is 46 per cent. The findings come from research by Dell Computer of the US. Gookin, a US author who has written books such as PCs for Dummies for those who shy away from anything mechanical or electronic, reckons technology has passed many people by. Commenting on the research, he says: 'One of the main reasons many people are paranoid about technology is that no one in the industry has bothered to help them understand how simple it is to use and what it specifically can do for them. Most manuals are as difficult to understand as a graduate-level course in quantum physics.' Not surprisingly, Dell's research shows younger people are less afraid of technology than their elders. The fact that it carried out the research at all is a sign that computer companies are increasingly nervous that business and individual users may be left behind by the bewildering pace of development in the jargon-ridden world of information technology. Increasingly, therefore, computer and software companies try to highlight the benefits and applications of their products rather than the technological content. But managers steeped in the fast-evolving world of electronics often find it hard to keep their message clear.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The cabinet was told that the five governments were seriously disturbed by the 'dictatorial attitude' of President de Gaulle and might be willing to continue negotiations to embarrass France. But ministers concluded that the five would not ultimately abandon France in favour of Britain. On January 14, the day negotiations on Britain's application for membership resumed in Brussels, President de Gaulle made a public statement opposing British entry. Although the negotiations did not formally come to an end for another fortnight, the cabinet knew from this moment that the British application was almost certainly doomed. Cabinet minutes show that, after the president's statement, one of the government's overriding objectives was to ensure that the French took maximum blame for the failure of the talks. Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, told the cabinet that de Gaulle's intervention did not reflect his conviction that the Brussels negotiations had failed, but his realisation that they were within sight of success. Such success, said Macmillan, would have been incompatible with de Gaulle's ultimate purpose of creating a Franco-German alliance to dominate Europe. De Gaulle, the cabinet was told, had alleged that Britain had made secret agreements with the US designed to transform the EEC into an Anglo-Saxon free-trade area. The minutes make clear the extent to which the government regarded failure of the EEC application as a serious setback to its policies. Ministers agreed that they should not abandon the objective of joining the community, but saw little purpose in seeking to develop a more limited economic association with the EEC. This, they decided, would not enable Britain to take part in shaping the community's policies, while probable French conditions on any such association would be unacceptable.

Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, warned that British fathers could be left as the only ones in Europe without the right to spend time with their newborn children. At a meeting with European ministers in Brussels today Mr Portillo will oppose a plan to allow either parent three months off work without pay after the birth or adoption of a child. His opposition could necessitate the use of the UK veto. Paternity leave was blocked by the UK in 1985, but it has now been taken up by the Germans, holders of the European presidency. Ms Clwyd condemned the government's opposition as 'a slap in the face for British fathers and families'. She said: 'How can the Tory party call itself the party of the family when Michael Portillo wants fathers in the UK to be the only ones in Europe without the right to spend time with their newborn children?' The employment department said: 'The government believes that the UK's rights on maternity leave are good already and this directive is an unnecessary intervention in matters between employers and employees.' If the matter is pushed to a vote, Britain may be forced to use its veto to block the directive. The other 11 member states would then have to proceed under the Maastricht social protocol, from which Britain has opted out. Today's meeting will also consider plans to force ex-patriate workers on short-term contracts to accept local pay and conditions while abroad. Mr Portillo will insist the idea, proposed by Germany, is protectionist and unfair, shielding employers in high-cost member states from competition from abroad.

The move is the latest step taken by Mr Stephen Walls, Albert Fisher's new chairman, to refocus the group on its core activities - the processing and distribution of fruit, vegetables and seafood. It also represents an opportune time to launch a publicly quoted vehicle group since the luxury car market is now showing signs of recovery, and the motor dealers' share prices have been buoyant over the past year. Charles Sidney was one of the first postwar dealerships established in Britain by Mercedes-Benz in 1953. Since then the group has become one of the largest distributors of Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Britain and had estimated sales in the year to August 31 of about Pounds 55m (Pounds 41m). The group holds the Mercedes-Benz franchises in Bradford and South Yorkshire (Sheffield and Doncaster). It operates Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle dealerships in Bradford and Sheffield - trading under the name Northside Trucks - passenger car dealerships in Bradford and Doncaster, together with after sales servicing, parts and repair facilities. Northside Trucks also includes a rentals division with a fleet of 400 commercial vehicles. In 1992, 40 per cent of turnover came from new and used commercial vehicle sales, 40 per cent from new and used car sales and 20 per cent from servicing, spare parts and commercial vehicle body building. Vehicle sales in the latest year were split evenly between commercial vehicles and passenger cars. Mr Raymond Edwards, Albert Fisher's director responsible for the European food processing division including Charles Sidney, will leave the group to become Charles Sidney's executive chairman. Mr Edwards joined Albert Fisher when it acquired Northside Trucks in 1983.   Companies:-  Albert Fisher Group.     Charles Sidney Holdings.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-4387 ,"FT922-4387 _AN-CFEA9AE5FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Brazil seeks to end impasse on diversity accord      By CHRISTINA LAMB, DAVID LASCELLES and STEPHEN FIDLER, America Editor      RIO DE JANEIRO, LONDON   BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor is today expected to suggest in a speech at the Earth Summit modifications on a crucial treaty on bio-diversity that it hopes will allow the US to sign it and thus reduce north-south divisions. The US has caused widespread consternation and anger at the summit by saying outright that it would not sign the accord, which deals with survival of species. So far there is little evidence that Mr Collor's initiative will do more than fall on stony ground. Early this morning Mr George Bush angrily rejected criticism of the US refusal to sign. 'I will not sign a treaty which in my view throws too many Americans out of work,' he said. 'I have some responsibility: responsibility for a cleaner environment and responsibility for families who want to work. . . If they don't understand it in Rio, too bad.' The Brazilian initiative comes just after France announced it would sign the treaty, putting further pressure on the other two waverers, Britain and Japan. Mrs Segolene Royal, French environment minister, said last night France 'wanted to be a leader' and would sign all the summit's conventions. Last night Mr Jose Goldemberg, Brazilian environment minister told Mr William Reilly, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, that Mr Collor's speech would incorporate some 'suggestions' to meet US concerns. The new effort to get the US on board came after the leaking of a memo from Mr Reilly to the White House in which he proposed that the US suggest modifications in the text in order to avoid being cast as a villain at the summit. Mr Reilly said last night the White House had rejected his suggestions and added 'we completely rule out signing the bio-diversity treaty in its present form. Many other countries share our view but for their own reasons do not wish to state this publicly.' Mr Reilly said the White House held serious doubts about the intellectual property issues raised by the bio-diversity treaty such as the possible patenting of genetic material. Mr Goldemberg appeared to share some of his doubts on the treaty, asking: 'What I don't understand is why people agreed to it in Nairobi (where the last meeting was held)'. Japan is expected to announce next week that it will sign the bio-diversity convention, and in London yesterday the UK government said it hoped and expected to sign. Britain had initialled the convention, but then had second thoughts because of concerns that it implied an open-ended financial commitment from the developed world. Japan, too, shares this worry that the treaty amounts to a 'blank cheque on aid'. Britain is seeking to ensure adequate arrangements to monitor protection of species. France was keen for the global community to draw up lists of the world's species. This, however, was rejected by countries, which feared it would encourage excessive conservation.

0,FT923-1237 ,"FT923-1237 _AN-CIXB5ABZFT 920924   FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear dumping   A NEW international treaty on sea pollution, signed this week in Paris, was right to extend the present ban on dumping radioactive waste for 15 years. But it was also right to resist calls for a permanent ban. The treaty commits the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic to reduce and eventually eliminate the dumping of a wide range of toxic materials. The most controversial point was that Britain and France insisted on retaining the right to dump low and medium-level radioactive waste in the sea. Alone among the north-east Atlantic countries, they have nuclear submarines and power stations that must be decommissioned in the next two decades. Under the compromise agreed, Britain and France will continue to weigh up land-based alternatives, reporting every two years to their co-signatories, and will fund expensive research into the impact if they consider dumping again after 2007. This is a sensible approach, though not because such studies will give a conclusive answer. It is impossible to prove that there will never be damage to marine life even when the waste is dumped in a three-mile deep trench 400 miles from shore, although Britain and France have many scientists on their side in arguing that the effects could be very small. But those studies will increase the currently inadequate levels of marine research and help focus attention on the dangers and costs of keeping the decaying hulks on land and the risks to the people who must dismantle and store them. In short, it will help achieve what Paris failed to do this week  -to set the risks of radioactive waste in the context of other kinds of pollution. Top of that list is the discharge of industrial waste into rivers and estuaries. Environmental groups have called steadily for better studies of the effects. The new treaty has also left unclear some of the obligations on countries and companies to publish information. The Ministry of Defence has claimed recently that under sovereign immunity it did not have to disclose its munitions dumping, and that clause persists in the new agreement. The treaty's fine print is open to interpretation on such points. It should always be interpreted in favour of full disclosure.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

Mr Lamont told the Common's Treasury and Civil Service committee that the UK had agreed under the Maastricht Treaty to contribute to a 'cohesion fund' which would help the four countries upgrade their economies towards the European average. Even if the UK parliament decides against joining Emu towards the end of this decade, Britain would be paying through the fund towards improving the environment and transport infrastructure of countries where gross national product per head was at or below 90 per cent of the EC average. Assuming that the wealth rankings of EC countries stay unchanged until union, Portugal, Greece, the Irish Republic and Spain could expect funds from Britain to help them become part of Emu with its single currency and European central bank. The size of the fund has still to be negotiated among member states and the chancellor insisted that the government would oppose 'huge transfers' of resources as part of the programme. But his disclosure that the government had accepted the principle of the cohesion fund while reserving the right not to join Emu clearly surprised some members of the all-party committee. Mr Lamont said that the government's decision on joining Emu would depend on its view of the sustainability and size of the union.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Australian civil servant John Hamilton is taking part in a  far-reaching overhaul of the bureaucracy.    His arrival comes as a battle rages between Britain and  China  over the loyalty of the territory's 180,000 civil servants in  the runup to China's takeover in 1997.    The overhaul, known as the Public Sector Reform (PSR)  program, will particularly affect civil servants with the  calibre to rise to the top of the service.    The government's top brass is said to be anxious that  mainland ethics and practices could become influential in the  civil service and take the place of the administrative culture  that is being built up to carry on after 1997.    The government has confirmed Mr Hamilton's appointment.    Before beginning his 13-month secondment on 10 January, Mr  Hamilton was assistant commissioner of the Australian Public  Service Commission for human resources management.    A government spokesman said Mr Hamilton was responsible for  ""developing a systematic approach to performance appraisal,  training and career development"" within the civil service and  was seconded for his solid human resource management background.    ""Staff of the Civil Service Branch have previously visited  the Australian Public Service Commission,"" he said.    ""(It was) considered the Australian experience in human  resource management would be a useful reference for Hong Kong in  the implementation of the PSR program.""    A theme of the PSR is to recommend a civil service mechanism  that would uphold ""human rights, openness and fairness"".    A distinctive difference between Australia's public service  and that in Britain and Hong Kong is that in Australia, top  policy secretaries are employed on five-year contracts.    The [preceding word as published] enables them to forcefully  confront outside political pressure.    The Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong said its  diplomats here were aware of Mr Hamilton's secondment, but its  press officer said she was unable to provide The Hongkong  Standard with further information.    The Australia Public Service Commission said simply that Mr  Hamilton's assignment was to look at Hong Kong's public service.    The Secretary for the Civil Service Michael Sze returned  from  a two-week visit to Australia on Sunday.    A local political columnist quoted sources as saying that he  had focused on how ""fairness"" was upheld in Australia's civil  service.    The theme of openness and fairness had been emphasised by  Governor Chris Patten in his rows with China.    A British parliamentary report recently called on the  government to form a human rights commission to keep a permanent  watch on human rights in the territory.    Beijing is worried Britain may use human rights to  internationalise Hong Kong after 1997. Members of the  Preliminary Working Committee sounded just such a warning on  Monday.    The territory's government vehemently denied the present  promotion mechanism in the civil service is unfair despite the  fact that Mr Hamilton has been asked to carry out a review.    A civil service spokesman also rejected the idea that  personal influence dominates the civil service promotion system.    He said there were clear guidelines including promotion  criteria specified in the civil service regulation which  promotion boards had to follow.    He said the boards comprised enough members from different  ranks to ensure that they fully understood the job requirement  and the candidates performance.    In cases within the jurisdiction of the Public Service  Commission, the boards recommendations had to be referred to the  commission for advice before they could be approved, he added.    ""The system is a fair one and has adequate checks and  balances,"" the spokesman said.    He said the PSR program was aimed at improving the civil  service's efficiency and quality.     "

The following is  the full text of the statement:    We have yet to see the full text of the ""report."" Judging  from the excerpts that have been revealed so far, we can see  that the report by the British Parliament Foreign Affairs Select  Committee has ignored the objective fact that Chris Patten's  political reform package violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings reached  between the Chinese and British governments, refused to adopt  the suggestions of some official British participants that the  British government resume cooperation on the basis of the  agreements between the two sides, deliberately confused the  truth, supported the British Government's policy of further  confrontation with China, boosted Chris Patten's ""three  violations"" political reform package, openly recommended that  Britain play the ""international card"" on the Hong Kong issue,  and openly advocate intervening in Taiwan and Tibet, which are  China's internal affairs. The ""report"" also made wanton and  unreasonable attacks on certain provisions in the Basic Law of  the PRC Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The report is  a negative example; it makes people see how veteran colonialists  racked their brains in exploiting every opportunity to continue  their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong. However, all  these efforts are futile. Nobody can change the Chinese  Government's determination to reclaim Hong Kong and restore  sovereignty over it as scheduled in 1997. The Chinese  Government has announced more than once: We will establish the  first government and legislature of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant provisions  of the Basic Law and National People's Congress resolutions. No  decisions made unilaterally by Britain during the transition  period on key issues straddling 1997 will be recognized by China.     "

Several Arab, foreign, and Iraqi figures, representing  humanitarian groups and organizations throughout the world,  spoke during today's session, which was chaired by Amin Shuqayr  from Jordan. [passage omitted]    Hugh Stevens from the United Kingdom said that the Muslim  communities in Britain suffered from a wave of racism as a  result of the policy of the British Government, which decided to  declare war against Iraq and deliberately created a racist and  tense atmosphere to prepare British public opinion for war. It  also exerted efforts to cooperate with the United States to  hamper any peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis.    He added that creating war deliberately is a crime against  peace, in accordance with the Nuremberg principles. Therefore,  in light of our experience, we can assert that the British  rulers committed crimes against peace, as well as war crimes  unprecedented in the history of war.    He said: I accuse former British Prime Minister Thatcher of  committing war crimes, as well as crimes against peace. He also  accused British Prime Minister Major and Foreign Secretary Hurd  of war crimes and of committing the crime of deliberately  creating poverty in one of the most important areas of the world  by imposing an unjust and illegal economic blockade, whose  consequences have become clear in Iraq's cities and hospitals.  He pointed out that, through its alliance with the United  States, Britain committed the ugliest crime of modern times. He  described the alliance as most hostile to Iraq. He called for  breaking that hostility through joint struggle by the free  people of the world, who yearn for freedom and to live in peace.    He added: We should continue, through public opinion, to  accuse the imperialists of crimes against peace, as well as war  crimes, in order to strengthen opposition against the blockade  imposed on Iraq.

The agreement was initialled on Wednesday by Britain's trade and technology minister, Mr Ian Taylor. Mr Taylor yesterday referred to Cuba as 'a very exciting market' at the end of a three-day visit, the first by a British minister to the island in almost 20 years. 'Clearly, the potential here is very considerable,' Mr Taylor said. 'The agreement will give confidence that Cuba is a market with which British businesses can deal.' He had led a British business delegation in talks on investment opportunities in air transport, construction, Cuba's sugar sector and insurance. Mr Taylor, clearly distancing British government policy from the US trade and financial embargo against the island, underlined the fact that Britain had never cut its trade links with Cuba. British exports for the first half of this year were up 180 per cent over last year. The 1993 export total was Pounds 14m, which was 50 per cent down from 1992. But he said many British companies had found it difficult to do business in the past because of Cuba's centrally-managed and highly regulated state economy. Cuba was moving to reform its economy to adapt to world trading conditions after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner. 'I made it clear that British companies would find dealing with Cuba easier the further the reform process goes,' said Mr Taylor, who had talks with President Fidel Castro. He said that while Cuban reforms were at an early stage, he was assured by Mr Castro they would continue. He noted that British companies were already operating in Cuba in oil exploration and oil services, agrochemicals, lubricants, soap and detergent manufacture, citrus, financial services and the sugar industry.

He vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's last volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of the approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for the leadership of the Conservative party. While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the agreement by Rover to sell to BMW was announced, Mr Heseltine insisted: 'We did not stand back from it.' He said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading figures in BMW, as a result of which 'assurances were given'. Mr Heseltine emphasised that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain its separate base in Britain with independent manufacturing, design and development facilities. He told MPs: 'I am proud that it was one of my ministers who asked for these assurances and got them.' Mr Heseltine urged his Labour critics to recognise that, while manufacturing was important, it accounted for only 27 per cent of the wealth producing sector and 20 per cent of the whole economy. He attacked Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs for damaging Britain's exporting companies by 'innuendo and smear', and claimed that Labour's industrial strategy would lead to the re-imposition of controls over dividends. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, launched an attack on the government's failure to prevent the erosion of Britain's manufacturing base. He taunted Mr Heseltine with a reference in his book Where There's A Will to the importance of maintaining British control over Rover. Mr Cook said British companies distributed most of their profits in dividends because of the fear that a fall in share price would lead to a takeover bid.   Companies:-  Rover Group.

The results were  obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston  that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy  the maps. According to a top source in the Malvinas government,  YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million  for the seismic maps.    Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing  the  Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the  area. Argentina reacted by sending ""letters of discomfort""  [preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them  that any activities carried out in the waters around the  Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal  conflict in the future.    Without taking the threat into account, the island's  government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko  Prakla (U.S. company) and Spectrum (British), which put the  study results up for sale late last year.    This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the  island's government that the first oil company interested in  buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of  before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey.  This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of  investigation into operation.    Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be  very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that  side. The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a  British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the  Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the  purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum. But  they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a  telephone not listed in the Houston directory.    Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the  seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real  name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps,  according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko  Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government.    The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey  result's sale.    There are no secrets on the island. A kelper said: ""It is  the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and  buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if  there is something wrong with your stomach."" This is why the  news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants.    Adviser Wendy Teggart said: ""It is a rumor but it seems that  YPF bought the seismic studies."" But she immediately said it was  true by adding: ""It is better for us because if YPF decides to  buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the  Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters.""    When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands  without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the  process on those terms because no oil company would risk  millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed  sovereignty.    The island's government members who were asked by this daily  said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large  quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not  those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a  juridical dispute. They said the first proof that business is  more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that  the first company that bought the seismic studies was  Argentina's YPF. At any rate, they said, this information will  help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on  hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or  early April in Buenos Aires.    The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that  the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and  the kelpers. This is what the government has been saying since  the British went ahead with the seismic survey without  consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less  costly step of the process.    The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain  through probes was ""optimistic."" The survey said there may be  oil in the islands. And the only way to prove it is to go ahead  with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling  in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain.    Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is  going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration  and exploitation licenses. What happens is that because of the  investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses  that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that  guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20  or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation.    The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the  possibility of finding oil in the islands. Their main concern is  that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological  balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style  of their small community.    To answer this type of question, the islands government has  recently contracted the services of the company Environment  Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will  deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have  on the islands. It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and  began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known  oil tax expert.    The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina  is  not yet in the kelpers' plans. The only thing they are sure of  is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be  absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between  Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires.

This shows the Chinese  side's sincerity. The Chinese side has been in favor of  building a new airport in Hong Kong on the condition that the  relevant financial package complies with the Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU).    The meeting will help the two sides exchange information,  study the feasibility of the newly proposed financial package,  and ensure that the financial package agrees with the airport  MOU. The Chinese side has not been given all the materials on  the project or detailed data on the financial package and cannot  afford to hire experts to carry out studies like the Hong Kong  Government, which has great financial strength due to its  enormous revenue. Given this situation, an airport panel  meeting, at which the Chinese side can directly put questions to  the British side and the latter can summit documents and  materials on the feasibility studies, will certainly help judge  whether the fourth financial package follows the principle of  cost efficiency and whether it will leave a heavy financial  burden to Hong Kong people.    Nevertheless, there are still quite a few unclear areas in  the fourth financial package tabled by the Hong Kong Government,  which places obstacles before the meeting.    After announcing that it had formulated the fourth airport  financial package before the Spring Festival, the British side  has launched a propaganda offensive over the last few days,  repeatedly insisting that the debts of the Provisional Airport  Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation  are not government debts and that, as the British Hong Kong  authorities had met the demands of the MOU by increasing  investment, the Chinese side should reach an agreement with the  British side on the ""new financial package.""    According to press reports, under the new financial package,  the British will increase investment by HK$15 billion [Hong Kong  dollars], but the PAA and the MTR Corporation will still run up  debts as high as HK$28 billion, approximately six times the HK$5  billion stipulated in the MOU. With such a large debt, how can  the new financial package be said to have ""complied with MOU  requirements""?    The British side continued to falsely allege that the debts  of the PAA and the MTR Corporation are not part of the  government debt, but such an argument is untenable. Since the  MOU has stipulated that the British Hong Kong Government is  responsible for the airport's core projects, how can the British  side defect responsibility onto the two institutions? Again,  the two institutions are wholly owned by the government, so  their debts must be undertaken and paid by the future Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government after 1997. Just as a  senior Hong Kong Bank economic researcher pointed out: For the  two institutions to take on loans is a matter concerning the  Sino-British agreement. Without sufficient guarantee, the two  institutions are unlikely to get the money they need. Even if  banks agree to extend the loans, they would increase the annual  interest rate to over 10 percent, because the two institutions  would not be able to give security for their debts. Such a high  interest rate would make it impossible for the borrowers to pay  off their debts--though they might be willing to pay the high  interest due to the lack of a sufficient guarantee--and  accordingly would increase the banks' risk. The result would be  that no banks would lend money to the two institutions. This  analysis also reveals that borrowing money in the name of the  MTR Corporation and the new Airport Corporation instead of the  Hong Kong Government contravenes the principle of commercial  operation and also deviates from the principle laid down in the  MOU. If the two sides fail to reach agreement on the financial  arrangements for the new airport, will the PAA and the MTR  Corporation be able to get the money they need?    The British side described the fourth financial package as  the best choice because of the increase in investment, termed it  a generous gift for the Chinese side, and urged the Chinese side  to rapidly accept the offer. This argument is not supported by  facts. As long as one compares the sharp increase in the  construction costs with the small and slow increase in the  British Hong Kong Government's investment, one will realize that  the most important concern is for the airport financial package  to follow the principle of cost effectiveness. If construction  costs are not capped and get out of control, the debt will  continue to grow much faster than investment. In 1991, the  construction costs of the new airport were HK$98 billion. In  March 1992, they increased to 120 billion, and today have  reached 175 billion -- and still no cap has been set on them.  In the first airport financial package, there was an unexpected  ""callable equity [huo you fu zhai 2057 2589 6298 0280]"" of HK$21  billion and the combined debt of $73 billion to be owed by the  PAA and the MTR Corporation, totaling HK$94 billion. A  financial package with such huge debt was naturally opposed by  the large numbers of Hong Kong people and the Chinese side.  Then the British side, forced to change its tactics, put  forward the second financial package in September 1992. In this  package, the British side demanded that 50 percent of the  proceeds from selling the 62 hectares of land above the airport  railway due the SAR government be injected into the rail plan in  an attempt to use the SAR government's money to help pay the  debt. Even so, the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation  were still as staggering as HK$22.9 billion. As the British  side's attempt to appropriate the land premium due the SAR  government was strongly criticized, the British side tabled the  third airport financial package in June 1993. In this financial  package, the British side agreed to plow into the railway plan  its 50 percent share of the land premium from the sale of the 62  hectares and to allocate HK$5 billion from the Hong Kong  government's financial surplus to symbolically increase the  investment, but the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation  soared to HK$45 billion, nine times the figure set in the MOU.  In the meantime, the British side was busy providing  appropriations and parceling away the airport project in an  attempt to create a situation of high cost and low returns, and  a huge debt in the future which China would be forced to take  over. In view of this attempt, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office made a firm four-point statement. Sensing that its coy  plan was not going to work, Britain pulled another trick -- the  fourth package. From the zany growth of the airport's  construction costs and the Hong Kong government's symbolic  increase in funding, we can see that the most crucial point in  the airport package is the principle of cost efficiency. If  prices keep rising with no end in sight, the only thing that  will happen is that actual debt will rise alongside the cost.  This will happen despite any agreement between China and  Britain on the financial arrangements. There is no guarantee  that the debt will not keep increasing.    China has always supported the construction of a new airport  to ensure and develop Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and  has consistently insisted that the airport project observe the  principles of cost efficiency and not saddling the future SAR  government with a financial burden. If Britain had followed the  provisions of the MOU, there would have been a financial  arrangement agreement. Britain should have the sincerity to act  in accordance with the MOU and stop its stalling tactics, for  that is the only correct way to solve the airport problem.     "
0,FT941-1053 ,"FT941-1053 _AN-EC0AVAEVFT 940326   FT  26 MAR 94 / 'Traditions' that mean nothing: As They Say in Europe      By JAMES MORGAN   A writer in the Spectator magazine the other day told of what happened when he entertained Enoch Powell, the former Conservative cabinet minister, at a meeting of a local Tory party association. (Readers outside Britain should know that Powell used to be a Tory but fell out with them and went on to represent the Ulster Unionists in parliament. He is renowned for his penetrating intellect.) To quote the article: 'Each time Mr Powell made a remark critical of the government, he was applauded incontinently. When a man stood up to announce he would be standing as an anti-federalist, against a Tory candidate, in June's Euro-elections, the ovation from his fellow Conservatives verged on the hysterical. There are pockets of Toryism flourishing and vibrant in Britain today. Sadly for Mr Major (the Prime Minister), they are unrelated to the government.' The writer added: 'Given the attitude of those who run the party now, I had better not say which Conservative association played host.' This is understandable: faced with the prospect of a confrontation with that Himmler of the Tory party, chairman Sir Norman Fowler, the most vibrant right-wing blood runs cold. Fortunately, I have uncovered details of the meeting. It was held just outside Ewell, Surrey, in the function room of Ye Olde Cocke House Inne, which stands between the Wok-on-By Chinese restaurant and a kitchenware shop called Hote Cuisine. There was a delicious meal (breaded scampi on a bed of lettuce 'garnished with all the trimming's'). The debate on the European Union was followed by a heated discussion led by Powell on another subject dear to his heart: the menace of coloured immigration. It included his famous expose of how Shakespeare's works had been written by a group of Elizabethan courtiers. I have spent much time burrowing through Europe's newspapers to see if lesser nations can produce anything to match this very English occasion. But their acceptance of the integration of Europe, and the suffocation of their own traditions, remains remarkable, partly because they do not believe that is what is occurring. Instead, they share a belief in a need for an authority to make rules to create that 'level playing field' so beloved of British politicians and which can make a single market work. That those employed in that authority are sometimes incompetent, corrupt, arrogant and stupid in no way distinguishes them from officials in the various national capitals. There is also a belief that the process of enlargement makes the system harder to operate, and a conclusion that the present British attempt to lower the proportion of votes needed for a veto is meant to ensure no decisions are taken at all. But, even then, there is not that moral outrage which characterises the British debate. There is certainly no equivalent of the Eurosceptic fury over the destruction wrought on a thousand years of constitutional perfection. Perhaps it is because these nations enjoy no such tradition. No chaps in tights opening their parliaments. No national leaders giving clear answers during the remorseless probing of prime minister's question time. There is no hysterical concern with the sexual incontinence of gentlemen in leading positions, either. Britain, the land that was once known for its phlegm and sang-froid is now in the grip of inexplicable obsessions. And those UK newspapers which make most of the trifling peccadillos of public figures are also those in which Europhobia is most pronounced. I must thank Fernando Vallespin, a writer in El Pais of Madrid, for explaining why. He was struck by the difference in attitudes towards sexual misdeeds in Britain and the US, on the one hand, and Brazil and Austria, on the other. (The president of the former behaved in an unseemly manner during the carnival in Rio; the activities of Austria's president were documented here last month.) There is, says Vallespin, 'a connection which almost always exists between repressive societies and liberal states'. Economic liberalism, he argues, is connected with capitalism in such a way that it pre-supposes the promotion of self-interest. As a result, a liberal state has to impose artificial rules to replace the glue that exists in traditional systems. There rules are broken easily without society falling to bits. Britain is no more a traditional society than Ye Olde Cocke House is a traditional inn. Its rules bind private and public morality in a seamless, brittle whole. So it is, I deduce, that European integration generates moral explosions in Britain: European integration is penetration by Europe.

In a series of carefully crafted phrases, the party's economic policy document for the European elections campaign declares that Britain will not consider re-entry to the ERM in the foreseeable future. The wording was approved by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. But the formulation of the document - A Competitive Britain in a Competitive Europe - left the door open for a change of heart after the next election. The document says that Britain's criticism of the ERM had been widely acknowledged. In those circumstances, it says, 'we will not re-enter such a mechanism in the foreseeable future, nor could we do so until it is clear that such faults no longer exist'. That olive branch to the Euro-sceptics is followed by a reassurance to pro-Europeans that 'we will not, however, cut ourselves off from future discussion of how economic policies can best be co-ordinated within the European Union in order to secure competitiveness, growth and jobs'. Ministers said the wording would provide the basis of the party's position to be set out in the full manifesto next month. Ministers also voiced confidence that the formulation would bridge the sharp divide on Tory back benches over ERM membership. On the issue of a single currency, the document repeats the studiously neutral position implied by Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht treaty. Parliament would retain the right to take a separate decision - in the light of Britain's interest and needs - if and when other members of the EU moved to create a single currency.

His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall about how US policy on Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton. Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK so long as that is backed by a majority of its population. Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start political talks after the local elections in the province on May 19, involving Unionists, nationalists, and the British and Irish governments. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less specific role. Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston Sir Patrick will meet members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media. As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last night called on Unionist politicians to enter unconditional talks on the future of the province. He also made it clear that any proposed political solution for Ulster based on purely internal arrangements would not secure support in Dublin.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The symbols are among the hallmarks that must be used under British law to protect consumers from 'under-carat' gold or adulterated silver. They are applied by assay offices in Birmingham, Edinburgh, London and Sheffield after independent tests. Other EC countries say the symbols restrain trade in the single market by forcing tougher British quality guarantees on foreign competitors. But the Association of British Cutlers and Allied Trades says their removal would open the UK market to cheats. Gold items can be sold in Britain at weights of nine, 14, 18 or 22 carats. Silver has only one standard denoted by the mark 925, which means the item is 92.5 per cent silver, alloyed with 7.5 per cent copper. European competitors often use 80 per cent silver. The association says draft EC proposals to harmonise European marking methods will allow substandard gold and silver items to be sold. Mr John Price, association president, said yesterday: 'If we are going to harmonise, everyone should adopt the British system.' Mr Price, chairman of Arthur Price of England which makes traditional silver, silver-plated and steel cutlery, said draft proposals would allow marking by manufacturers but the onus would be on consumers to check they had not been cheated. EC officials had said unique British hallmarks, such as the lion for sterling silver, the castle for Edinburgh's assay office, Sheffield's rose, Birmingham's anchor and London's crown would be banned. Mr Price added: 'There will be some traders in Britain who will welcome this. The profits are enormous if you can pass off 15-carat gold as 18-carat.'

If not, it will be excluded from a major European defence  programme -- dubbed Euroflag -- expected to secure 37,500  aerospace jobs and generate sales of $55 billion.    The demand comes as Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale of  France, British Aerospace [BAe], Italy's Alenia and Spain's Casa  [Dasa] prepare to challenge U.S. domination of the world market  for military transport planes by building a European  alternative. The so-called Future Large Aircraft is designed to  meet the needs of the Western European Union [WEU] defence  forces and enter into service by the year 2002.    WEU air forces have total requirements for 300 Euroflag  aircraft in the transport and tanker roles. Euroflag also hopes  to win additional contracts for another 300 copies from  non-European air forces.    Despite early support for the Euroflag project, the British  Government withdrew in 1989 and assumed ""observer status"" within  the European partnership as its Ministry of Defence and Air  Force considered a cheaper offer from Lockheed to refurbish its  existing fleet of 61 U.S.-built Hercules C-130 transports and  eventually to replace them with an upgraded C-130J variant.    Other members of the consortium say that a British decision  in favour of the Lockheed offer would be anti-European and give  U.S. manufacturers continued domination of the European market.  ""Lockheed hopes to kill off the Euroflag,"" said a British  Aerospace spokesman, ""and continue to monopolise the military  large aircraft market in Europe and worldwide.""    Britain's fleet of C-130s dates from the 1960's and is now  suffering from ""a number of corrosion, fatigue and age-related  problems,"" according to a recent parliamentary defence committee  document.    BAe this week launched a campaign to persuade UK legislators  that support for the $7 billion development phase of Euroflag is  vital if Britain is to avoid repeating its disastrous decision  in 1969 not to join the Airbus Industrie consortium at its  inception. Although BAe subsequently sought membership, it has  ended up as a minor player in Europe's most successful aerospace  venture to date and forfeited billions of dollars in lost work  as a consequence.    The Euroflag consortium which also includes Belgium,  Portugal  and Turkey as associate members -- plans to develop a  four-engined aircraft capable of transporting up to 25 tonnes of  military hardware and personnel over ranges up to 3,700  kilometres.    It will have 2.5 times the airlift capability of the  U.S.-built Hercules C-130J and, says a Dasa spokesman, is  designed for the rapid deployment of forces.    Growing pressure from member governments to reduce the  project's development and productions costs has prompted a  recent decision to make the Euroflag a turboprop rather than a  jet-powered aircraft.    Euroflag plans to run the programme within the framework of  Airbus Industrie ""in a professional and commercial fashion,""  explained an industry insider. This will involve the creation  of a special Airbus subsidiary and will be the first time it has  been able to accommodate the Italian aerospace sector through  the involvement of Alenia. Each of the partners will have a 20  percent stake and share of the work schedule.    Through this structure, Euroflag hopes to allay fears in  Germany and Britain that the programme will experience the usual  budget over-runs associated with cost-plus defence contracts.  According to a Dasa spokesman, Bonn does not expect to face the  same level of opposition as that experienced over the  Eurofighter which has been consistently attacked as a Cold War  weapon system.    French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last week urged WEU  governments to throw their weight behind the Euroflag programme.  ""I invite our main partners to develop this European aircraft  with us,"" he said in a pointed reference to British vacillation.    The project was, he said, ""a bearer of hope for common  European defence.""     "

It says that is a lower percentage than women receive in eight other European Community countries. The figures also show that Britain is second from the bottom in a league of 11 countries for average female manual industrial earnings as a proportion of men's earnings per hour. Only Luxembourg is lower. The figure for industry is the more accurate because a comparison of average monthly earnings tends to widen the difference between men's and women's earnings because women work shorter hours. The research found that more women in the UK worked part-time than elsewhere. In 1990 there were nearly 15m women part-timers in the EC - 5m of whom were in the UK. The commission argues that the tendency for part-time jobs to be low paid is an important factor in the gap between men's and women's earnings in the UK. Other factors include fragmented collective bargaining structures and the lack of a minimum wage. The research supports indications that while a higher percentage of women work in the UK, the gap between the earnings of men and women is among the widest in Europe. Earnings' comparisons are hampered by the lack of data for certain countries. Both comparison groups contained France, Germany and Denmark. Women and Men in Britain 1992.

Britain's deputy head  of mission, Hamish Cowell, had been asked to leave the country,  a spokesman said. Iran gave no reason for what the spokesman  described as an ""unjustified"" request, but the move appears to  be a tit-for-tat response to Britain's expulsion of an Iranian  diplomat last week.    The Foreign Office today for the first time officially  confirmed that expulsion had been ordered and named the Iranian  diplomat as first secretary Vahid Belourchi. He had been asked  to leave because of false allegations about British policy in  Bosnia. Members of the Iranian embassy in London had been  distributing forged documents purporting to show Britain's  policy in Bosnia was directed against Muslims, the spokesman  said.    Until today the Foreign Office would only confirm that a  meeting had taken place last Thursday [26 May] between Foreign  Office Minister Douglas Hogg and Iran's charge d'affaires in  London, Gholamreza Ansari. Diplomatic sources said the Foreign  Office's refusal to confirm the expulsion was aimed at trying to  forestall a tit-for-tat move by Iran.    The Foreign Office would not say today whether Britain would  respond further. ""We will keep the situation under review. We  are looking at it very closely at the moment,"" the spokesman  said. He confirmed the expelled Iranian diplomat had not yet  left the country but said there were no signs that Iran was  dragging its feet.    Mr Cowell was not expected to be packing his bags yet  either.  ""His departure would not necessarily be immediate,"" the  spokesman said. Yesterday, Mr Cowell himself referred inquiries  from PRESS ASSOCIATION News about the possibility of reprisals  against British diplomats in Tehran to the Foreign Office news  department in London.

Government officials in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica said yesterday they feared the Cuban move to restrict those fleeing the north coast on rafts, following the agreement last week by the Cuban and US government to curb illegal migration, would lead to a southward rush of refugees. More than 200 refugees arrived in the Cayman Islands over the weekend, despite an announcement last week by the government of the UK dependency that all 'economic migrants' would be repatriated. This brings to 620 the number of Cubans refugees on the Caymans, whose administration said it had no more money to take care of Cubans. Cuba's government said at the weekend that, until midday today, it would try to persuade would-be refugees not to depart in home-made rafts and boats. The government said that, after the deadline, the authorities would use force if necessary to stop rafters from leaving, especially if they resisted violently. After the accord with the US, a flotilla of rafts carrying refugees rushed to leave beaches near Havana before the authorities moved to stop them. Britain is in the final stages of negotiating an investment promotion and protection agreement with Cuba, in an effort to raise its trade and investment profile there. 'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement. We are in the final stages of discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said late on Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a business and official delegation.

British  business circles are no longer concerned about whether his  constitutional reform package will be passed by the Legislative  Council, and they have noted that his unilateral legislation was  an erroneous action. His countrymen asked him to make it plain  how the trade interests of British business would be harmed and  whether British-Chinese relations would turn for the better  after the talks on the Hong Kong issue broke down.    Therefore, this time, Patten was in no mood to put on  ""political shows"" by appearing on British television or  arranging interviews with British newspapers; instead, he  hastily consulted some ""China hands"" about countermeasures, and  tried to cope with the huge pressures from the British business  community. He discussed ways to deal with the Chinese with  former foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, and discussed how to  handle the deadlocked situation after the breakdown of talks  with Ambassador McLaren and Foreign Minister Goodlad.    When he was appointed Hong Kong governor and was on his way  to take office in Hong Kong, he vowed to maintain good relations  with China in front of some British businessmen who supported  his appointment. He said that he would build up trust with his  Chinese counterparts and would be able to solve many issues by  just dialing the phone. He meant that as Britain had appointed  such an able Hong Kong governor, British businessmen would gain  favor everywhere in their China trade.    However, all people have seen that he behaved in an  extremely  irresponsible way by challenging the established agreements  between China and Britain, refusing to make things converge with  the Basic Law, and recklessly bringing part of the controversial  constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council before  an agreement had been reached, and all this was unnecessary.  Patten ruined all of the progress that had been made in the  past and caused the breakdown of the talks without regard to the  interests of the residents of Hong Kong and the interests of  British businessmen. He simply made a mess of the situation and  broke the promises he made when he took office.    Therefore, at a hearing in the British Parliament, David  Howell and other Conservative MP's questioned him about whether  he had expected the strong reaction of the Chinese side, what  had caused the current deadlock in Sino-British relations, and  whether Patten formulated China policy and had forced the  British Government to adopt it, or, would he, as Hong Kong  governor, obey the British Government. Patten still stubbornly  fought with his back to the wall. He did not dare to speak  clearly, and just said that ""the British Government supports my  constitutional reform package."" It seems that his superiors are  only able to support a subordinate and do not have the power to  correct what the subordinate has done. Such an arrogant attitude  will only arouse strong criticism from the British business  community.    At the hearing, Patten still tried to conceal faults and  gloss over wrongs and to deceive the British public. He said  that he did not know about any agreement between China and  Britain in 1990 at all, because when he consulted Percy Craddock  about constitutional reforms, Craddock did not tell him that an  agreement had been reached on electoral arrangements, so he did  not have to worry about that. All people in Hong Kong have long  known about the seven letters exchanged between the Chinese and  British foreign ministers, and Chinese officials also told him  that the seven letters represented an agreement, but he still  declared in a session of the Legislation Council's that he  ""would not recognize any secret agreements"" and ""would not  create any more secret agreements."" The deadlocked situation  was created by him deliberately, and he is trying to shirk all  his responsibilities.    Now, Western countries, including the United States, Japan,  Germany, and France, are all vying with each other to march into  the Chinese market. Will Britain still allow Patten to continue  his blunders and harm British-Chinese relations?    Even the Labor Party's Allan Rogers also said that the  Conservative cabinet should bear the responsibility for the  worsening of British-Chinese relations.    The parliamentary hearing enabled British voters to clearly  see who has caused the worsening of British-Chinese relations.  It is Chris Patten who should bear responsibility for the  current situation. John Major is now bogged down in a  predicament, and does not want to be blamed for the worsening of  British-Chinese relations. Therefore, on the one hand, the  Conservative Party summoned Patten to give a testimony; on the  other hand, it has again dispatched McLaren back to Beijing to  deal the deadlocked situation left to him by Christopher Hum and  to sound out China's reaction.    Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin explicitly  replied to the British side: The Chinese side hopes that the  British side will withdraw the partial constitutional reform  package that has been submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative  Council for deliberation and returns to the negotiating table.  ""If the British side refuses to withdraw it and brings the  second part of the constitutional reform package to the  Legislative Council for deliberation, then this will further  show that the British side is determined not to return to the  negotiating table, and that the British side will thus have to  bear responsibility for all consequences.""

Noting that  ""things are not much different today,"" it is still in Lisbon's  strategic interest to align itself with the United Kingdom in  the field of European construction, he contends. Vegar cites  Carlos Gaspar, adviser to President Mario Soares, as saying that  ""it is necessary to choose the lesser of two evils, between  those who wish to preserve Portugal's transatlantic vocation and  the European Union (EU) and those who opt for subregional  integrations that obviate the existence of the Community."" In  Gaspar's opinion, Portugal profits from aligning itself with  Great Britain within the framework of the EU, for this  ""reinforces the tripartite center (France, Germany, United  Kingdom)...so enlargement will not negatively affect it."" Vegar  cites Gaspar's concern about a possible fragmentation of the  Union through the formation of subregional Scandinavian,  Iberian, or German blocs.    On the other hand, Vegar also cites Andre Goncalves Pereira,  former minister of foreign affairs, as saying that ""there is no  privileged relationship between Portugal and Great Britain."" An  alliance made sense when Portugal first entered the EC, given  the somewhat parallel Portuguese and English positions on  federalism at that time. However, following EC assistance to  Portugal, Lisbon's present stance is much closer to the official  EU position, which collides with London's traditional  antifederalism, Goncalves Pereira is cited as saying. Vegar then  cites Socialist Party (PS) luminary and former Minister of  Foreign Affairs Jaime Gama, who notes that ""it is to our  advantage to maintain an intense relationship with the United  Kingdom because we are partners in NATO and the EU.""  Nevertheless, Gama continues, the object of this alliance ""was  transferred from England to the United States, which  unfortunately never occupied this vacuum because it has a  different awareness of international issues."" Finally, Gama is  cited as claiming that the ""old theory of Atlantic versus  continental nations"" cannot justify Portugal's interest in  favoring a close relationship with Great Britain, for ""the world  is presently regulated by multipolarity, and a specific response  to each problem is needed.""

0,FT931-14276 ,"FT931-14276 _AN-DASCGAGDFT 930119   FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (5): Hang on to your passports - Goods will move more freely than people      By ANDREW HILL   DON'T throw away your passport. For the EC traveller, the barrier-free European market has not quite arrived. The lifting of frontier controls on goods and people was perhaps the most symbolic goal of the single market programme. However, for six months or more it has been obvious that at least one, possibly three, and perhaps all 12 member states will not achieve the second of those objectives before the end of 1993. Member states appear to have met the deadline for lifting frontier controls on goods. For all its alleged faults, the new 'transitional' regime for VAT and excise duty has done away with the need for basic administrative border controls on all products. Some 60m tax forms, and the people who used to fill them in, have gone too. On the other hand, there are lingering doubts about how a new frontier-free regime will affect certain products. In the case of bananas, for example, member states have just agreed a new quota regime, but it is unlikely to come into force for at least six months. There is as yet no definitive system for monitoring the cross-border movement of works of art or of 'dual-use' goods, which have both military and civilian applications. The most likely solution is a formal or informal 'cellule de crise' to deal with any problems which might occur between January 1 and the implementation of a new regime. Officials agree it is little more than a sticking plaster solution, but it has allowed frontier controls on goods to be lifted before the January 1 deadline. If member states keep their nerve - and do not allow the inevitable media scares about loopholes and errors to shake them into a hasty reimposition of controls - then free movement of goods seems more or less assured. The abolition of passport controls presents quite different problems, which are unlikely to be resolved before the end of this year, if at all. Nine months ago, the Community seemed to divide into three main camps on the question of passport checks. Britain has always been the member state most vehemently opposed to the lifting of border controls on people and its government's argument is relatively simple. The 1986 Single European Act, it says, does not oblige the UK to lift its controls on non-EC citizens. Consequently, Britain must maintain at least a minimal check to ensure that unwanted non-EC travellers do not slip through the EC passport lane at ports and airports. In the second camp are Denmark and Ireland. Denmark wants to maintain border controls, but has indicated in the past it might be prepared to lift them if sufficient safeguards are put in place. Ireland claims to be committed to the lifting of controls. But because of its geographical proximity to Britain, and the fact that most of its travellers pass through the UK under an existing free-travel agreement, it would find it difficult to loosen its controls without at least consulting the UK. Finally, the European Commission and the remaining nine EC countries, which are members of the Schengen free-travel agreement, dispute the British interpretation of the Single European Act and are committed to the lifting of border controls on people. Until recently, it looked as though the dispute between the Commission and the British government might end in the European Court. An individual court case - perhaps brought by a federalist MEP or ordinary free-travel zealot - is still not out of the question, but in the past six to nine months, a number of new elements have reduced the immediate threat of Commission court action: Euro-politics. Since the Danish and French referendums on the Maastricht treaty, Brussels has been increasingly reluctant to challenge member states on strongly held points of principle. Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, warned fellow EC interior ministers in June that pressurising Britain on passport controls could swing the UK parliament against the Maastricht treaty - it was a potent argument, according to observers. The refugee problem. Increasing immigration pressures and racial tension, particularly in Germany, have made the Schengen nine think twice about lifting their internal border controls as quickly as they had intended. The Schengen accord does commit them to abolish internal checks, but only when external frontiers have been sufficiently strengthened, and ancillary measures - such as a computer link between Schengen immigration authorities  -have been put in place. Neither has yet happened. Practical difficulties. Airports - most notably the busy Schiphol hub in Amsterdam - have won a deferral of the deadline for lifting controls, on the grounds that they cannot physically change their infrastructure before December this year to separate EC and non-EC arrivals. The result is that even the most enthusiastic countries are unlikely to lift their internal border controls on people before the middle of this year. Travellers in continental Europe will probably notice little change - cars will still be able to sweep through most internal borders without checks; airports will still check passports, although controls may get lighter as terminal infrastructure is adapted to cope with the new regime. Britain, on the other hand, is planning to retain its controls at airports and sea borders unaltered until Schengen decides to abolish its internal checks. When that happens, UK seaports will probably implement a version of the so-called 'Bangemann wave' - named after the current internal market commissioner - requiring EC travellers to show the cover of their passport to officials. Schengen's disarray on border controls let Britain off the hook as far as the January 1 deadline was concerned, but it seems unlikely that an eventual 'two-speed' solution to the question of passport checks will be acceptable to all continental European countries. According to Schengen, the Bangemann wave is too strict as a control on internal borders and too lax as a control on external frontiers. If Britain - or, indeed, Ireland and Denmark - decides to apply only minimal checks to travellers arriving from outside the Community then Schengen members may have to start examining the passports of passengers on flights and ferries from non-Schengen EC partners. That would be a strange and unhappy end to a project that was supposed to be built on mutual trust and partnership.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

According to Israeli sources, the Islamic  fundamentalist group is using England as a safe haven for  planning attacks and transferring funds and operational  instructions to its terrorist squads in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    Details of how Hamas operates in Britain -- in some cases  using Islamic social and charitable organizations as a cover for  planning operations, raising or laundering funds, then  transferring money and orders to the territories -- have all  been passed on to the relevant British security authorities.    This is not the first time such information has been passed  on to Britain. More than a year ago, the British authorities  were told that their country was a major base for Hamas leaders,  with direct links to the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads  here. This followed the arrest of two high-ranking Hamas  operatives, Muhammad Salah and Muhammad Jarrad. [passage  omitted]    Now, according to a well-placed source, in the wake of  increased Hamas terror activity and especially the bomb attacks  in 'Afula and Hadera, the British authorities are more likely to  take action. What is needed, according to the source, is formal  Israeli diplomatic representations to Britain, along the lines  of the diplomatic offensive by Israel and the U.S. to get King  Husayn to crack down on Hamas members and their activities in  Jordan. For the British authorities to act against Hamas under  Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, Israel will have to show  that Hamas engages in terrorist activity and that while Hamas  may not yet be carrying out terror attacks in Britain,  instructions, money, or logistic support for Hamas terror acts  elsewhere is being sent from Britain. This is now believed to  be possible in light of the fact that Hamas has openly and  officially boasted of its terrorist attacks and that detailed  information on the links between Hamas members in Britain and  the territories is now being made available.

Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, said  yesterday. He has ordered a two-year study into whether the  spending of billions to protect this country and its servicemen  abroad would be justified.    Mr. Rifkind added that a study was also under way to examine  the possible purchase of stand-off cruise missiles, another  expensive option. He emphasised that ballistic-missile  technology was not confined just to those countries that Britain  had ""traditionally regarded as threatening us"".    The need for a ballistic-missile defence system is based on  the assumption that such countries as Libya or Iraq, within  potential range of Britain, could pose a threat within ten years  or so. More than 20 countries are known to be buying or  developing ballistic-missile systems.    During the Cold War, Britain's strategy against a Soviet  missile attack was based on deterrence. The possession of  Polaris and its replacement Trident missile system was thought  sufficient to deter the Soviet Union from launching a nuclear  attack.    In the post-Cold War era, the threat could come from  countries prepared to call Britain's bluff and launch an attack,  gambling that the Government would not retaliate with a  strategic Trident missile. Partly to meet this threat, the  Ministry of Defence intends to convert some Trident missiles  into sub-strategic, shorter-range systems.    The new study will examine which countries are likely to  acquire effective missile systems, whether they pose a threat to  Britain, what warheads they might have (nuclear, chemical,  biological or conventional) and if a defensive system is  affordable. Although there is no estimate, a national system  could cost several billion pounds.    Addressing the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College,  London, Mr. Rifkind said ballistic-missile defence had moved  from the ""Star Wars"" projects of Cold War days to programmes  with more limited scope.

The move by Inmos, now owned by SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, follows prolonged speculation about the plant's future. Closure may end a controversial and often politically charged chapter in the history of the UK semiconductor industry. It would also mean the end of UK manufacture of the transputer, which is one of the few successful semiconductor inventions to come out of Britain - and one that had been hailed as a key to regaining British leadership in the computer industry. The plant's planned closure in a year to 18 months is likely to rekindle debate about UK industrial policy and its failure to keep strategic technologies in home ownership. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said the closure of the plant would mean 'yet more high technology redundancies and yet another British invention lost to British manufacturing for good'. Inmos said that because of the response to its decision it would now apply for aid to the Welsh Office. It said it had not applied before because several months of discussion had led it to believe that aid was unlikely. The result of its application could alter the decision to close the plant, Inmos said. Inmos was set up in 1978 by the Labour government in an effort to win a leadership position for Britain in microelectronics. The government invested huge sums in the company to enable it to develop the transputer, a semi-conductor which can process a large amount of data concurrently at very high speeds. While Labour looked to the transputer as a revolutionary device which could help Britain gain leadership in semiconductors, the succeeding Conservative government delayed funding and then sold Inmos to Thorn EMI in 1984. Thorn sold Inmos to SGS-Thomson in 1989. The transputer recently won a significant endorsement when IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, decided to use the device as a control mechanism. Inmos said, however, that it did not make economic sense for SGS-Thomson to invest the Pounds 50m or so needed to upgrade the Newport plant in order to satisfy volume production. The financially pressed group has recently made huge investments in other semiconductor fabrication plants. Production at Newport will be gradually wound down and transferred to SGS-Thomson plants at Rousset, in southern France, Agrate in Italy and Carrollton, Texas. There will be a limited number of redundancies among the 450-strong workforce in the next month, but there are no detailed plans for overall redundancies when the plant finally closes.

Mr Douglas Hogg, a Foreign Office minister, summoned Iran's charge d'affaires in London, Mr Gholamreza Ansari, to demand that Iran should urgently reaffirm its earlier commitment not to interfere in Britain's internal affairs. In a 20-minute meeting with the Iranian diplomat, Mr Hogg protested 'in the strongest possible terms' about a statement made on Tuesday by the Iranian chief justice, Mr Morteza Moqtadaei, that Moslems were obliged to kill Mr Rushdie for his alleged blasphemies against Islam in his book, The Satanic Verses. The British government 'took a very serious view of the statement and all other statements reiterating the fatwa (death call) and calling on Moslems to implement it,' the Foreign Office said. 'It appeared to call into question Iran's commitment to honouring its obligations not to interfere in our internal affairs.' The fatwa was originally issued by Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989. Mr Rushdie has since lived in hiding in Britain, but has lately made appearances in Germany and France to appeal for international pressure on Iran to lift the death edict. Diplomatic relations between Britain and Iran were broken off by London over the issuing of the fatwa, but were restored in September 1990. However, a round of tit-for-tat expulsions last summer resulted in a renewed deterioration in relations and put a stop to possible moves to exchange ambassadors.

It has borders with nine other countries. No wonder things get a bit heated down there. This reflection was provoked by the memory that it was three years to the day that I had attended a somewhat tense event which confirmed to me that the removal of the Berlin Wall was not going to do much good. In February 1990, I went to a student meeting that turned rowdy in what was still East Berlin to listen to lectures on the 'social market economy'. The West German government had shipped in lavish pamphlets and politicians whose job it was to demonstrate the delights that awaited the hitherto luckless locals. It would take six months or a year to get things right, people would fall into the new jobs in the service sector and with their high wages and new deutschemarks at one-to-one, the old GDR would boom. The students rightly did not believe it. A couple of months later my employers arranged a seminar on the new Germany where I said the whole thing would be a complete bust and eastern Germany would be a burden to the west, and everybody else, until about 2010. I mention this not because it demonstrates any great forecasting gifts, but because it was obvious to anybody who spent a few days in the country asking people how it worked and finding out that it did not. At the Lindenhof restaurant on Leninstrasse in the Calcutta-style industrial centre of Bitterfeld I asked for a menu at one o'clock and the waitress said, 'Not now. We're having our lunch.' Sitting above Europe at this moment I thought I would have a look at the shape of another ghastly thing to come. In Britain there has been a huge public debate on energy policy. This has touched on the question of French nuclear power which is cheap and when imported into Britain leads to the closure of coalmines. But one interesting thing that emerged from the privatisation of power generation in Britain was that it was impossible to sell nuclear plants to investors because the discounted costs of owning a nuclear plant were greater than the income to be derived from them. In other words, nuclear power is uneconomic and the plants are worthless because of the decommissioning costs. So today Britain has to subsidise its nuclear power in order to sell any. Since there is such a subsidy to domestic supplies, it has to be granted to already cheap French power as well - European Community rules permit no discrimination. (The consequent closure of British coalmines is deplored by large numbers of worthy people who only six months before were demanding that the British government take the initiative at the Rio Summit on the environment by demanding the elimination of greenhouse gasses. Such are the penalties of living in a country where public policy debate is ubiquitous, unceasing and uninformed.) No energy economist has explained to the British public why it is that their nuclear power is too expensive while the French is too cheap. The answer could provide the clue to the next European economic disaster. France relies on nuclear plants for three-quarters of its power generation. This has happened because France is the one working command economy the world has seen. It is organised by graduates of the so-called grandes ecoles. They are brilliant, they possess technical skills of the highest order, they think the same way and they control almost everything. It may sound like a recipe for disaster but the system has worked wonders. Nemesis may emerge in the nuclear power industry where, I assume, electricity is produced cheaply because decommissioning costs have not been included in the price structure. The 80-odd nuclear power stations were built by Electricite de France on borrowed money. The debt stands at FFr195bn (More than Pounds 24bn). The worry is not that there will be a Chernobyl, but that there will be a rumour of one, or something will go a little bit wrong. That would cause hysterics in Germany or Switzerland and even make some Frenchmen doubt the perfection of the original choice. If that happens many will wonder about EdeF debt, which is backed by the state, and think seriously about an investment that cost zillions and might have to be decommissioned and replaced at a cost of tens of zillions. There will be meltdown problem, not nuclear but financial. Maybe there is a simple answer as to why the economics of the French nuclear power industry are totally different from those of the British but nobody has told me. I tried on several occasions to talk to someone at EdeF about this but nobody answered the phone. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

The most comprehensive study of the sea, undertaken by  leading scientists from the eight countries surrounding it, has  found that concentrations of toxic chemicals are high enough to  cause tumours and breeding failures across a wide range of  species.    Ministers from all the countries concerned meet in  Copenhagen  this week to consider the conclusions of the Quality Status  Report of the North Sea, which took six years to complete and is  regarded as a conservative analysis of the impacts of pollution.    They are expected to respond with measures to curb illegal  dumping of oil from ships, pesticide pollution and over-fishing.    Conservationists warned that marine wildlife was facing  disaster in ""a synthetic soup of chemicals"" because governments  had failed to meet anti-pollution targets set three years ago.  Dr Sian Pullen, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said action  so far had failed to reverse decades of deterioration. ""The  commercial and environmental losses are enormous,"" he said.    The study, to which Britain contributed more than 5m,  says mammals are particularly at risk from thousands of  industrial chemicals that accumulate in body fat after getting  into the sea from rivers, waste tips and the air. Some,  including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), are thought to  suppress immunity to disease and damage ovaries.    Poisonous waste metals such as mercury have attacked the  kidneys and livers of minke whales, bottle-nosed dolphins and  grey and common seals. Tens of thousands of sea birds are also  dying each year in oil slicks from rigs and ships' tanks. Dr  Nancy Harrison, of the Royal Society for the Protection of  Birds, said: ""Accidents make headlines, but chronic oil  pollution is the biggest danger to wildlife and the health of  the sea.""    Some of the most startling impacts have been recorded in  fish. Contamination by tributyl tin, a highly-toxic component of  paints used on ships' hulls, has triggered sex changes in  whelks, often miles from shipping routes.    Vast numbers of cod have developed tumours on their gills  because of general chemical pollution and food and poisoning  from shellfish, including mild paralysis, is on the increase:  the report blames sewage.    Dr John Huthnance, a leading British oceanographer, said the  North Sea was especially vulnerable to pollution because it was  largely landlocked. Chemicals that might disappear in six weeks  in other seas could linger there for two years.    The study warns that fertilisers seeping into the sea from  rivers and underground channels have contributed to high levels  of phosphorous and nitrogen, which have fed blooms of toxic  algae.    The Thames Humber, Tees and Tyne are all identified as  important sources of industrial pollution. Metals swept  downriver sink into sediments where they are absorbed by tiny  organisms and gradually work their way up the food chain.    Britain's pollution record has been fiercely criticised by  other North Sea countries, particularly in Scandinavia, who  pride themselves on their environmental performance. They are  expected to complain this week that Britain has fallen behind  targets set for curbing several pesticides. The use of  dichlorvos -- one of the most toxic chemicals -- to deal with  lice on fish farms was due to be cut by half between 1985 and  1995, but has so far increased.    In Copenhagen, however, Britain is expected to accuse  Denmark  of taking grossly excessive catches of fish. The report says  that up to 40 of all commercial species by weight are  hauled  out of the sea each year. More than half the adult cod and  haddock in the North Sea were netted between 1986 and 1990, a  rate described as impossible to sustain.    Tim Yeo, the environment minister, said he regarded  excessive  spraying of pesticides on roadsides and railway embankments as  one of the priorities for the conference. ""We are committed to  reducing their use to the absolute minimum,"" he said.     "
0,FT933-5254 ,"FT933-5254 _AN-DIEAAABBFT 930904   FT  04 SEP 93 / Thousands 'at risk' from drug-resistant TB      By CLIVE COOKSON   TENS OF THOUSANDS of people in Britain could be at risk from drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, a leading TB specialist warned the British Association meeting at Keele University. Dr Tim Peto of Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine said some patients in the US could not be treated effectively with any known antibiotic. The UK has TB strains that are resistant to the best 'frontline' drugs but they do succumb to 'secondline' antibiotics. 'The impact of multi-drug resistant strains of TB in Britain would be immense,' Dr Peto said. 'The total cost of managing a major TB outbreak would be huge.' Infectious patients with resistant strains might need to be isolated for long periods. 'Intensive health care would be needed to ensure that patients complied with complicated drug regimens for many months in order to check the infection,' Dr Peto said. 'In recent years we have seen the impact of HIV disease on public awareness of the impact of sexual behaviour. It is difficult to predict what the effect on society would be if a serious infectious disease emerged which is spread simply by coughing, sneezing or talking.' He blamed 'the inequality of health care in the US' for the emergence of multi-resistant TB there. Those at risk in the UK - likely to be tens of thousands - would be those who did not have regular access to NHS facilities. The homeless were especially vulnerable. A number of once-vanquished microbes that are now making a comeback, the conference heard. Professor Michael Levin of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London said: 'In the past 20 years we have witnessed a dramatic and frightening re-emergence of infectious diseases as major forces against which mankind must struggle for survival.' He said many old diseases had returned and a host of new infectious diseases, which were not dreamed of 15 years ago, had appeared.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAIRO      A British-based journalist who had been investigating reports of a mysterious  explosion at a weapons complex near Baghdad was sentenced to death Saturday by  an Iraqi revolutionary court that found him guilty of spying.    Farzad Bazoft, a stateless Iranian exile working for Britain's weekly Observer  newspaper, was sentenced after a five-hour, closed-door trial that also  resulted in the conviction of a 52-year-old British nurse charged with helping  Bazoft.    The nurse, Daphne Parish, accused of driving Bazoft to the weapons facility 40  miles south of Baghdad, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. An unidentified  Iraqi also charged in the case received a 10-year sentence for communicating  government secrets to a foreigner, according to the British Foreign Office.    The sentences drew a swift and outraged response from the British government,  which monitored the trial and complained that no evidence was produced to  warrant the sentences.    ""We utterly deplore these harsh and excessive sentences. . . . They come ill  from a regime which is trying to show a more liberal face to the world,"" the  Foreign Office said in a statement.    Iraq has come under repeated criticism from human rights organizations, which  in recent months have reported that abuses ranging from arbitrary arrests to  torture and political executions persist in Iraq despite President Saddam  Hussein's recent moves toward political reform.    Observer editor Donald Trelford, in a statement Saturday, described the  sentences as ""barbaric and unjust"" and called for Britain to withdraw its  ambassador from Baghdad and cancel offers of export credit to Iraq.    ""The Observer proclaims the innocence of its reporter, who was only doing his  job,"" Trelford said.    Bazoft, 32, an Iranian native who had lived in Britain for several years and  traveled with British documents, was arrested at Baghdad airport Sept. 15 after  what his editors said was a working visit to Iraq at the invitation of the  Iraqi government.    While in Iraq, Bazoft, who had worked for the Observer since 1986, investigated  reports of an Aug. 17 explosion at the huge Al Iskandaria military complex.  Another British newspaper, the Independent, said the blast resulted in as many  as 700 deaths.    The Iraqis described the incident as a relatively minor explosion at a fuel  depot that killed only 19.    Bazoft had befriended Parish, a senior nursing administrator for the Irish-run  Ibn al Bitar hospital in Baghdad, according to British news accounts, and the  nurse was subsequently accused of driving Bazoft to the plant where the  explosion allegedly occurred.    Two months after his arrest, Bazoft, looking exhausted and strained, appeared  on Iraqi television and confessed to being an Israeli agent. In a subsequent  meeting with British consular officials, he continued to proclaim his  innocence.    Even before formal charges were brought, Iraq's official newspapers accused  Bazoft of spying for Britain and shrugged off Western criticism of the arrests.  ""What is Iraq to do?"" the daily Al Iraq asked. ""Offer him sweets and give him  an official send-off at the airport? Iraq is not a garden of the house of  Maggie, or a part of the British empire.""    But the Observer said Bazoft had sought official permission to visit the  military complex, had told the newspaper's foreign desk of his movements and  talked openly about the visit to his colleagues upon his return to Baghdad.    ""None of this conduct is consistent with espionage. It is entirely consistent  with journalism,"" Trelford said.    Britain's Press Assn. news service reported that British officials have already  forwarded a request for clemency on behalf of Bazoft and Parish.

By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LONDON      The Bush Administration's efforts to persuade major U.S. allies to help foot  the bill for the Persian Gulf campaign against Iraq reaped its first modest  results Wednesday as Britain agreed to contribute to a U.S. fund to aid Middle  East countries hurt by the embargo.    After a meeting between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S.  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, a spokeswoman for Thatcher said the prime  minister had declared that Britain ""would certainly contribute"" and would  announce the amount as soon as it could.    U.S. officials also said that French officials had told them earlier that they  would bring up the U.S. request for funds at a meeting of top officials of the  12-nation European Community on Friday. They said the EC also is expected to  react favorably to the idea.    The developments came as Brady, accompanied by a delegation of high-level  Treasury officials, left Britain and flew to Anchorage, Alaska, en route to  appointments Friday with leaders of South Korea and Japan.    President Bush ordered Brady and Secretary of State James A. Baker III to  approach America's major allies for financial help, both in underwriting the  U.S. deployment and in helping Middle East countries that were hurt by the  economic squeeze.    Baker left Washington late Wednesday evening for trips to Saudi Arabia and  Egypt before meeting Bush at Helsinki, Finland, for the superpower summit with  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Sunday. He later will visit Moscow,  Rome and Bonn.    Meanwhile, Treasury officials clarified figures given to reporters on Tuesday  on what the Administration wants the allies to pay for the U.S. military  buildup in the Persian Gulf.    A senior U.S. official defined those costs as those that go beyond what it  ordinarily would cost to maintain those same American forces at their home  bases in the United States. They estimate that these would total $6 billion  this year and $12 billion in 1991.    The estimate that the Treasury provided Tuesday said the United States was  seeking $15 billion by the end of 1990. The Treasury officials also said then  that Washington was seeking $10 billion to aid other hard-hit gulf states.    A senior Treasury official said Wednesday that Washington will continue to seek  help for gulf states, other than Iraq, that had been hurt by the global  economic embargo imposed against Baghdad and will ask the allies to pay all the  costs of deploying U.S. troops.    ""I think it is not unreasonable to ask the allies to pick up all of it,"" the  senior official said. ""After all, they couldn't buy this (military) capability  anywhere else in the world, and we have paid for it"" with America's investment  in a strong military.    ""We Americans have a right to expect the (financial) burden to be shared more  appropriately,"" added another senior official. ""This is an exercise in which  the whole industrialized world is going to benefit.""    Top Administration officials indicated that such comprehensive allied financial  support could thus ease the budget pressures that are building on the federal  government as a result of the massive deployment of American troops in Saudi  Arabia.    They said if the allies do agree to pick up the entire military bill, the  Pentagon will be better able to forecast its spending needs for the next year.  ""This burden-sharing will have an impact on the budget,"" one official said.    The U.S. officials who briefed reporters on Wednesday said Washington believes  that the gulf states that have been hurt by the embargo against Iraq --  primarily Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- will need a minimum of $3.5 billion in  aid this year and $7 billion in 1991.    They said the United States is pushing other nations -- notably France -- to  forgive the military debts owed to them by Egypt, as a sign of support for  Egypt's decision to oppose Iraq. Bush already has agreed to write off about  $7.1 billion in debt for arms shipments to Egypt.    Top officials also provided the first detailed list of nations that they plan  to ask for financial assistance either for the military buildup or for the  so-callled front-line states.    Besides France, Britain, South Korea and Japan, that list includes Taiwan,  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, West Germany, Italy and the European  Community as a group. They also will ask the exiled former government of Kuwait  to contribute. Kuwait still has large sums in banks.    Because both Britain and France have committed naval forces in the Persian  Gulf, Brady did not ask them to help in paying for America's military buildup.  Instead, he said, he sought -- and won -- their cooperation in providing  financial assistance for the other gulf states.    But senior Administration officials traveling with Brady said they do expect  big financial commitments to cover the military costs from both South Korea and  Japan, two of America's most successful economic competitors. Both are heavily  dependent on oil from the Middle East.    Brady plans to meet with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo in Seoul on Friday  morning and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu later in the day in Tokyo  before returning to Washington early Saturday morning.    Japan, the richest of the nations on Brady's itinerary, last week became the  first ally to make a specific pledge of financial assistance, when it said it  would provide at least $1 billion in aid in the region.    Still, senior American officials indicated they think Japan should provide more  help than that.    One official said that the $1-billion figure only represented ""a good start"" on  Japan's part. ""We are in a changing world. . . . We have been talking about  burden-sharing with Japan and with Europe for a long time,"" one official said.

The estimate that the Treasury provided Tuesday said the United States was  seeking $15 billion by the end of 1990. The Treasury officials also said then  that Washington was seeking $10 billion to aid other hard-hit gulf states.    A senior Treasury official said Wednesday that Washington will continue to seek  help for gulf states, other than Iraq, that had been hurt by the global  economic embargo imposed against Baghdad and will ask the allies to pay all the  costs of deploying U.S. troops.    ""I think it is not unreasonable to ask the allies to pick up all of it,"" the  senior official said. ""After all, they couldn't buy this (military) capability  anywhere else in the world, and we have paid for it"" with America's investment  in a strong military.    ""We Americans have a right to expect the (financial) burden to be shared more  appropriately,"" added another senior official. ""This is an exercise in which  the whole industrialized world is going to benefit.""    Top Administration officials indicated that such comprehensive allied financial  support could thus ease the budget pressures that are building on the federal  government as a result of the massive deployment of American troops in Saudi  Arabia.    They said if the allies do agree to pick up the entire military bill, the  Pentagon will be better able to forecast its spending needs for the next year.  ""This burden-sharing will have an impact on the budget,"" one official said.    The U.S. officials who briefed reporters on Wednesday said Washington believes  that the gulf states that have been hurt by the embargo against Iraq --  primarily Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- will need a minimum of $3.5 billion in  aid this year and $7 billion in 1991.    They said the United States is pushing other nations -- notably France -- to  forgive the military debts owed to them by Egypt, as a sign of support for  Egypt's decision to oppose Iraq. Bush already has agreed to write off about  $7.1 billion in debt for arms shipments to Egypt.    Top officials also provided the first detailed list of nations that they plan  to ask for financial assistance either for the military buildup or for the  so-callled front-line states.    Besides France, Britain, South Korea and Japan, that list includes Taiwan,  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, West Germany, Italy and the European  Community as a group. They also will ask the exiled former government of Kuwait  to contribute. Kuwait still has large sums in banks.    Because both Britain and France have committed naval forces in the Persian  Gulf, Brady did not ask them to help in paying for America's military buildup.  Instead, he said, he sought -- and won -- their cooperation in providing  financial assistance for the other gulf states.    But senior Administration officials traveling with Brady said they do expect  big financial commitments to cover the military costs from both South Korea and  Japan, two of America's most successful economic competitors. Both are heavily  dependent on oil from the Middle East.    Brady plans to meet with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo in Seoul on Friday  morning and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu later in the day in Tokyo  before returning to Washington early Saturday morning.    Japan, the richest of the nations on Brady's itinerary, last week became the  first ally to make a specific pledge of financial assistance, when it said it  would provide at least $1 billion in aid in the region.    Still, senior American officials indicated they think Japan should provide more  help than that.    One official said that the $1-billion figure only represented ""a good start"" on  Japan's part. ""We are in a changing world. . . . We have been talking about  burden-sharing with Japan and with Europe for a long time,"" one official said.

MEP's [members of the European Parliament] at a two-day  meeting in Brussels accused Great Britain of wanting to ""dilute""  the Union, of ""depriving the Treaty of Maastricht of its  meaning,"" and of seeking to serve domestic political interests  by refusing to adopt the decisionmaking process after the four  candidates join the Union.    The blocking minority within the Council of Ministers is at  present 23 votes out of 76. Logically enough, this should be  increased to 27 votes out of 90 following enlargement in order  to keep it at 30 percent of the votes.    Great Britain and Spain, for different reasons, are opposed  to this purely mathematical change in the blocking minority and  are asking for it to stay at 23 votes out of 90, which allows  two large countries and one small one to block any decision.    After having listened to European Foreign Affairs  Commissioner Hans van den Broek stress the negative effects of  any change to the membership timetable, the MEP's stressed that  no compromise was possible on an institutional retreat. The EP  considers a blocking minority of 27 votes to be absolutely  essential.    ""Even if a compromise is reached, it will always be weak and  unacceptable to the EP,"" stressed Raymonde Dury (Belgian,  Socialist Party).    Mr. van den Broek stated that the Twelve would try to break  the deadlock again at their informal meeting next weekend in  Ioannina, Greece. If they manage to reach an agreement on the  institutional question, the EP will have little time to approve  the accession agreements before the European elections in June,  thus allowing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden to join the  Union on 1 January 1995 as planned.

0,FT942-5946 ,"FT942-5946 _AN-EFBDVACEFT 940602   FT  02 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Scoring points with Essex man      By PHILIP STEPHENS   We should never have expected enlightenment. British election campaigns have long since lost the central democratic purpose of illuminating the choices before the electorate. That sort of politics is too complex for a generation weaned on the tabloid press and the 15-second television sound-bite. But even by the standards of the recent past, the European election campaign has been an unedifying spectacle. Around the country, candidates for the Strasbourg assembly have dutifully knocked on doors, climbed on to platforms in village halls and picked up babies in market squares. But at a national level the campaign has produced an entirely predictable game of charge and counter-charge in which important issues have been trivialised and trivial issues elevated. So far the voters have been offered a synthetic dispute about the national veto, a protracted row over begging and a fruitless argument about the definition of federalism. Other, real European issues have occasionally intruded - the social chapter, the path towards a single currency, the shape of Europe's future defence among them. But the tactics adopted by all three parties have ensured that rational debate is minimised in favour of cheap sloganising. So nobody should be surprised if, once again, the great mass of the electorate decides on June 9 that there is nothing, or nobody, worth taking the trouble to vote for. The Labour campaign understandably has lacked political focus. The death of John Smith left the party's leading figures pre-occupied with the succession. In any event Labour has yet to work out the difference between a strategy of attacking the Conservatives for leaving Britain in Europe's slow lane and a discriminating approach to the policies of other European Union governments. After some initial slip-ups, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have looked effective in promoting themselves as the party to beat the Conservatives in the south-west. But like Labour, the party has been wary of sounding too positive about Europe. It has looked more comfortable when attacking Mr John Major over domestic policy. On a technical rather than intellectual level the Conservative campaign cannot be faulted. The strategy has been to prevent a bad result from turning into a catastrophe. The judgment from the outset was that the party needed to counter the disgruntled apathy of its hard-core supporters. The instincts of these voters are those of the Tory Euro-sceptics. They are reflex chauvinists, suspicious of most things foreign and of all things emanating from Brussels. They believed Baroness Thatcher when she told them that a Britain free of the shackles of Europe could rediscover its past greatness. Coincidentally they also favour a hard line against beggars. To win them back, the Conservatives concluded their best role in this campaign was not that of a government but of an opposition party. The central message has been constant: Mr Major would persuade the Europeans from doing that, would veto this, and would opt out of whatever else proved unpalatable. If Central Office is to be believed, the strategy is working. Even those Tory MEPs who find the focus of the campaign distasteful are acknowledging that many of the punters like what they are hearing. It is against this backdrop that Mr Major sketched out the possibility of a multi-speed, multi-track Europe. This so-called variable geometry - a ghastly phrase first uttered in public by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - would allow a wider, more flexible union to operate with the grain of public opinion. All would participate in core activities such as the single market. In other areas - defence, monetary union, social policy - individual nations would choose whether or not to enhance co-operation. It is an idea with merit. In some respects it is a reflection of the status quo. In any event the cohesion possible among 12 states will not be so in a union of 20. But the context and tone in which such arguments are framed are as important as the actual words. In Mr Hurd's multi-speed Europe, Britain would play a positive part, setting the pace of co-operation in defence and foreign policy. Mr Major, locked in the poisonous embrace of his party's Euro-sceptics, appears more interested in opting out than opting in when the union reshapes its future in 1996. The national veto - threatened by nobody in Europe - has become a virility symbol. The prime minister is right to argue that Europe has changed during the past few years. But scoring easy points with Essex man sits uneasily alongside a pledge to keep Britain at the heart of Europe.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Clarke's reaffirmation of a personal commitment to a single European currency and to further deepening of co-operation in the European Union came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to head off a new outbreak of party infighting. The chancellor, speaking in Bonn, dismissed suggestions that the dispute over the presidency of the commission marked a fundamental shift in British policy. He called for Germany's Christian Democrats to join the Conservatives in promoting a common agenda for Europe's future. Mr Clarke's comments about a single currency kept just within the agreed government line that any decision must be taken by parliament. But the chancellor made no secret of his own view that Britain must be in a position to join a single currency if and when the occasion arises. He remarked that the government had twice signed up to the objective - when it joined the then EEC in 1972 and when it signed the Single European Act in 1976. He called on Britain and Germany to build on the intergovernmental arrangements in the Maastricht treaty to strengthen co-operation on foreign and defence policy. London and Bonn should also act together to promote further enlargement of the union and to push an EU-wide agenda favouring deregulation and liberalisation. In spite of approval for the speech from Downing Street, leading Tory Euro-sceptics responded with outrage. Accusing the chancellor of undermining the prime minister, the sceptics said the speech had in effect ended Mr Clarke's hopes of succeeding Mr Major. For his part Mr Hurd sought to assure a meeting of pro-European Tories that the government's decision to use its veto at the Corfu summit did not represent a lurch into the arms of the Euro-sceptics. Mr Hurd will use a speech later this week to develop the theme of a multi-speed Europe. Political Notebook, Page 15   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

If the strong Jewish lobby had not persuaded Congress to veto the sale of US F-15 fighters to the kingdom Britain would probably never have had the chance to negotiate the deal. Once the veto had been applied Britain was in a very strong position to supply the Saudis with advanced fighter aircraft. The UK had a long-standing defence relationship with Saudi Arabia, stretching back to the supply and maintenance of 46 Lightning aircraft in the 1960s. Baroness Thatcher, visited the kingdom when prime minister and made a strong impact on King Fahd. Personal relationships between leaders are very important in the Gulf. The French, the other potential suppliers, had no such pull. So in 1984-85, with the Gulf war between Iran and Iraq raging near their northern border and concerns about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism growing, the Saudis were keen to improve their defences as quickly as possible. The way was open for the UK to strike a deal. The three main British negotiators for Al Yamamah were Sir Colin Chandler, then head of the government's defence export services organisation (DESO), previously a marketing chief of British Aerospace and now chief executive of Vickers; Mr Dick Evans, the marketing head of British Aerospace and now its chief executive; and Lady Thatcher herself. Lady Thatcher did not have particularly close links to the BAe executives, although all involved were obviously keen to secure the order. It was Lady Thatcher's link to King Fahd which was the motor for the deal. The British team used Mr Wafic Said, a London-based Saudi, as the go-between, and he brought Lady Thatcher's son Mark into the deal. If his intention was to make sure of his mother's support, he need hardly have bothered, as the prime minister was keen on the idea anyway. One official involved at the time said: 'Mark certainly tried to generate the impression that he had influence. He was putting himself around a lot. But in practice I think he didn't have much pull.' A former director of BAe said: 'Mrs Thatcher's intervention was crucial, but she came in at the request of BAe, not as a result of Mark Thatcher's efforts.' The outline Al Yamamah deal was concluded in September 1985, with the full contract signed the following year. It was a government-to-government deal, with BAe nominated as the company primarily responsible for the business. Commissions were paid to middlemen as a result of the deal. Mr Said insists he was not paid a commission, but an ex-BAe director said: 'Commissions would have been paid on the deal. I do not know if Mr Thatcher received money, but I wouldn't rule it out.' Saudi Arabia agreed to buy 72 Tornado aircraft, a mixture of the air defence fighters and ground attack bombers, and 60 Hawk advance trainers and PC9 basic training aircraft. A big package of training and support services was included in the deal - BAe has had about 4,500 personnel in Saudi Arabia working on the Al Yamamah deal ever since. Instead of cash, the Saudis paid in oil - initially set at 400,000 barrels a day, which soon increased to 500,000 as the oil price weakened. The oil was paid into a central fund in the UK, controlled by a Saudi Arabian project office at the ministry of defence. The oil was sold on the market at the project office's discretion, and BAe could draw on the funds as it met milestones in the project. Since the contract was started in 1986 it has brought in more than Pounds 2bn a year to BAe. Because the oil revenues were sometimes insufficient to meet the project costs the fund has twice been topped up with cash - once in 1992 to the tune of Pounds 1.5bn. In 1988 a second contract was negotiated for a further 48 Tornado aircraft and associated training aircraft, as well as a large new airbase at Al Sulayil, which was to cover an area the size of greater London. However, oil prices continued to be weak and the plan for the air base was eventually dropped. As a result of budgetary pressures the second deal was not signed until January 1993, just six months before the Tornado production line was due to close. It was initially for the 48 ground attack Tornado aircraft, with training aircraft to follow. To pay for the extra equipment the daily oil output was increased to 600,000 barrels. The second batch of Tornado aircraft is due to be delivered between 1996 and 1999, and some of the Hawk and PC9 training aircraft to go with them were ordered at the Farnborough Air Show last month. BAe remains confident that Britain will retain a strong defence link to Saudi Arabia. The company even hopes to sell the Saudis its newest Eurofighter in time. Al Yamamah III, however, is still a long way off.   Companies:-  British Aerospace.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     SAZ  Saudi Arabia, Middle East.

0,FT933-2933 ,"FT933-2933 _AN-DIPCOADQFT 930916   FT  16 SEP 93 / Talks on the rocks: Chris Patten's confrontation with China could leave him isolated      By SIMON HOLBERTON   Mr Chris Patten has returned from his summer holiday to face the most testing time of his short governorship of Hong Kong. Talks that started in April between Britain and China about the colony's political development are going badly. After nearly 100 hours of negotiations about arrangements for local elections in 1994 and 1995 - the last before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 - the two sides appear no closer to resolving their differences. The whispers of British diplomats and Hong Kong government officials suggest that, unless there is some movement, the talks could collapse within months of their resumption next week. The result of failure would be to create uncertainty that would damage investors' confidence and exacerbate public fears about the transition to Chinese rule. A collapse of the talks would mean the UK 'going it alone' on Hong Kong's political development and trying to enact measures in the face of vigorous opposition from China. China would probably block strategic infrastructure projects - such as the colony's planned HKDollars 165bn Chek Lap Kok airport. Deadlock has arisen in spite of compromises offered by the British team on two of Mr Patten's most controversial reform proposals. First, for the selection in 1995 of nine new elected members of the 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's lawmaking body, Mr Patten initially wanted to give votes to nine groups of employees in different sectors of the economy, amounting to 2.7m people. But in negotiations, Britain offered to cut the number to just 1.3m. Beijing, however, envisages giving votes to only a few thousand. Second, Mr Patten has moved on the composition of an 'electoral college' to select a further 10 LegCo members. At first, he wanted it to consist of about 360 of the local government officials elected next year, but he has now agreed with Beijing that the college should comprise four broad-based groups, of which politicians would be just one. The sticking point is that Britain wants college members to be elected; Beijing wants agreed government appointees. Britain and China have always had conflicting objectives. Mr Patten wants the UK to leave behind an open society where values such as fair elections, the rule of law, and free speech have a chance to flourish. Beijing wants to ensure the 1995 elections will not create a political structure it cannot control. Early optimism in the colony about the talks resulted from a feeling that Beijing wanted a direct influence on events in Hong Kong before the British left. But since last month optimism has evaporated - mainly, it appears, because Hong Kong has become hostage to Beijing's internal politics. British diplomats suggest that the increasing frailty of Deng Xiaoping, 89, China's pre-eminent leader who has guided Hong Kong policy for more than a decade, has increased political uncertainty and so produced an impasse. Adding to Mr Patten's worries are signs that the pull of China on the colony is getting stronger. Anecdotal evidence that the Hong Kong Chinese are identifying themselves increasingly with the civilisation, if not the government, of China has come from several directions: Growing numbers of middle-class Chinese, though probably still a minority, who hold foreign passports now say they would be prepared to swap them, if necessary, for Chinese nationality. When Mr Martin Lee, a former president of the Hong Kong Bar, tried earlier this summer to bring a libel action against a Beijing adviser, he was rebuffed by 11 of the colony's leading firms of solicitors, who feared offending China. The honour of the legal profession had to be salvaged by the president of the Law Society, who agreed to represent him. Mr Simon Murray last month stepped down from the management of Hutchison Whampoa, a diversified conglomerate, partly because the company's controlling shareholder, tycoon Mr Li Ka-shing, had banned him from speaking publicly in support of Mr Patten. Mr Murray's support for the governor was not good for business, Mr Li had calculated. Mr Rupert Murdoch's sale of the South China Morning Post - Hong Kong's oldest English-language newspaper - to Chinese investors has cost Mr Patten a friend in the colony and may reverse the Post's support for the governor. Opinion polls still show high approval ratings for Mr Patten in the colony - nearly 60 per cent - but expectations of the UK and China reaching agreement are at a record low. The latest poll showed just 37 per cent believing the two countries could do a deal, compared with 63 per cent in April. If the talks do collapse, the price for both sides will be high. For Beijing, a smooth transfer from British to Chinese rule is at risk. Its international reputation would be tarnished if, after 1997, it rebuffed a democratically elected LegCo. For Mr Patten, to try to go ahead with his proposals without Chinese consent could backfire. British power is on the wane in Hong Kong and he may find that, when forced to choose between China and an engaging British politician, the people of Hong Kong will choose China.

Life expectancy for men jumped from 68.6 years in 1970 to 72.8 in 1990, and life expectancy for women from 74.9 to 78.2. In 1970 only 4.7 per cent of the population was aged over 75, but this had risen to 6.9 per cent 20 years later. Women still outnumbered men by 1.4m in 1990, although this was down from the 1.6m 20 years before. Average earnings rose more than tenfold, from Pounds 26 a week to Pounds 263  -but what a pound would have bought in 1970 would have cost Pounds 6.80 in 1990. The period also saw a growing taste for travel, both at home and abroad. Air travel showed the biggest increase - up from 2bn passenger kilometres in 1970 to 5.1bn in 1990. Overseas travel became more popular in spite of the fact that Britain showed signs of getting warmer. At home the average daytime temperature in England and Wales rose from 10.10C in 1970 to 11.10C in 1990. In Scotland temperatures rose from 8.30C to 9.30C. and in Ulster from 9.10C to 9.80C. Rainfall declined in England and Wales over the period, although the pattern was not consistent. There was 910mm of rainfall in 1970, rising to 979mm in 1980 before dropping to 814mm in 1989 and 838mm in 1990. Government Statistics 1992. United Kingdom in Figures.

In a 13-hour meeting that ended after midnight, EU foreign  ministers also narrowed the gap in an internal split over voting  rights which was threatening to block the entry of all four  applicants into the Union by January 1.    The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers,  Theodoros Pangalos, said: ""I think we can give out a message of  optimism to the people of Europe. It is a sign of strength that  Europe can work together well.""    Pangalos added that impetus had been given to proposals for  a  further enlargement of the Union -- initially to take in Cyprus  and Malta, then other applicants which include Hungary, Poland  and the Czech Republic.    The EU ministers hammered out a compromise deal to give the  EU's poorer countries, particularly Spain, limited access to  Norwegian fishing waters plus bigger catch quotas in other  fishing grounds.    The negotiations had been blocked earlier by Spain's  insistence on access to Norway's fish-rich waters as part of  Norway's price for EU membership, and Oslo's refusal to open up  its carefully-husbanded fishing grounds.    But the meeting could not overcome Britain's refusal to give  way in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial  councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take  account of the four new members.    The ministers agreed to meet again next Tuesday in their  fourth attempt to resolve the dispute amid signs that a  compromise might be in sight to let Britain back down without  too much political damage at home.    Pangalos warned that the Union would be in trouble if the  issue was not resolved. ""The whole of community life would be at  a dead end. I do not think this is possible,"" he said.    Britain, with some backing from Spain, was demanding that  the  entry of four small countries into the EU should not tilt the  balance of power in the EU by diluting the ability of bigger  members to block decisions they do not like.    The argument hinges on the system of weighted majority  voting  in ministerial councils. Under current procedures, 23 out of 76  votes divided up among the 12 members -- 30 percent -- are  enough to block majority decisions.    Such a blocking minority can be formed by one small and two  large countries. Most members want to keep the 30 percent  threshhold so that 27 out of 90 votes would be necessary for a  blocking minority after the four applicants join.    Britain and Spain objected because this would mean three  countries could no longer form a blocking minority, so that  London and Madrid would have a harder time defending their  interests.    But Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said Spain was  leaning towards the majority view on the issue. ""I can't see  Britain alone being prepared to shoulder the blame for  preventing enlargement (of the EU),"" he said.    Some diplomats suggested that the British opposition was  more  cosmetic than real, aimed at appeasing anti-Europe sentiment  back home which could be damaging to the government of Prime  Minister John Major.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there had been  understanding for the British point of view, despite the charge  from his Danish colleague, Niels Helveg Petersen, that London  was driving the enlargement drive into crisis.    Hurd suggested that progress might be made on Tuesday. ""We  want enlargement but we do not want that to weaken minorities,""  he said.    Pangalos proposed a compromise -- that the blocking  threshhold should be raised to 27 pending a major review of EU  rules in 1996, but that the interests of minority groupings  would be treated sympathetically in the meanwhile.    The dispute must be resolved by the end of March if the four  applicant countries are to have any chance of joining the EU by  the target date of January 1 next year.     "

The flood of foreign undergraduates is increasing the already stiff competition among British school leavers for the most favoured university places, because there is little incentive for the British to study abroad. Ruehl, in his second year at Queens' College, Cambridge, explains: 'My friends at German universities are scrambling for floor-space in lectures with 800 other people. Here, I get two hours' one-to-one contact with my professor every week.' Some nations seem keener on Britain than others. The Germans are becoming as ubiquitous on campus as they are in holiday resorts. Greeks are running them close, and both groups now outnumber the former leading nation, America. The French, however, are scarcely visible. Previously, continental Europeans have come to Britain as postgraduates, or as part of a course based in their home countries. But the recent increase is made up mostly of students choosing Britain for a first degree. They follow the same syllabuses as everyone else; they sit the same exams; many even come complete with British A-levels, taken at sixth-form colleges in the hope of improving their entry chances. Most importantly of all, under EC rules their fees are paid by the British local authority where they study. For the cosmopolitan, multilingual children of the European bourgeoisie, it is a bargain. 'British higher education is idyllic, Elysian compared to most European systems,' says Judie Cole of the German Academic Exchange Service, a London-based agency which advises those wishing to study in the UK. In an odd inversion of the normal rules, continental European students travelling across the English Channel are wafted from a struggling, utilitarian world of dormitory beds and plastic cutlery into a privileged, even sybaritic, existence of private rooms and personal tuition. The continental tradition of accepting for degree courses all who pass a school-leaving exam may be egalitarian, but it also brings overcrowded halls, impersonal teaching and, say many, academic mediocrity. 'You are just a number,' says Cole. 'Many have never spoken to their teachers.' Students must sometimes sit through a morning of lectures outside their subjects in order to be sure of a place for the afternoon. Unlike in Britain, drop-out rates are high. British universities' selectivity, as much as their comparative luxury, is the attraction for the bright and ambitious. 'A British degree marks you out from the crowd,' says Ruehl. 'German employers know it's tough to get in.' A three-year BA is a quicker way of showing your mettle than the traditional continental route of a further degree, rarely accomplished in under six years. Universities are happy - and perhaps slightly flattered - to welcome their clever new applicants. Dr Graham Richards, senior tutor of Brasenose College, Oxford, wrote in the university's magazine that they were 'likely to become a major part of our admissions' from which 'the university can only gain'. For British universities' traditional customers, however, the academic migrants are a threat. Every place for a continental high-flyer means one less for a British student. As yet, the numbers are too small to matter much, but Dr Richards predicts that 'if in 10 years, 25 per cent of our intake is from the continent, the British parent who has paid large public school fees in the hope of buying an easier route to Oxbridge may begin to squeal'. Dr Richards' forecast is a long way from fruition; 400 Germans at Oxford is still not many in a university of 13,000. But the cross-channel students, many destined for their countries' elites, already have an importance for Britain's European relations out of all proportion to their numbers. Ironically, however, the very factors which draw students to Britain in the first place are disappearing even as they arrive in increasing numbers. As high a proportion of the British student-age population now attends higher education as in the rest of Europe; and with the sector's breakneck expansion have come problems, albeit in embryonic form, familiar to any inmate of Bochum, Padua or Grenoble.

In a wide-ranging foreign policy speech at the Mansion House  in London, he lamented the narrowness of current political  argument in Britain, typified by the fracas over Maastricht and  voting rights in Europe.    Mr Hurd said: ""While we dispute among ourselves, we risk  failing to notice how the world is changing.""    He said the country ran the risk of ""intellectual shrinkage  -- as if we despaired of convincing anybody of anything, as if  we simply wanted to devise ways of protecting ourselves against  a Europe and a world which was bound to run against us.""    He said: ""This is negative and damaging nonsense. This  country has been, ought to be, can be, a powerhouse of ideas  about the future of Europe and more widely about the  relationship between states and international institutions. We  cannot pick and choose to which continent we belong. We cannot  stop the world in order to get off.""    Mr Hurd said Britain's influence remained strong across the  world -- in Europe, where ""our wholehearted involvement is  essential,"" increasingly in South America, in India and  Australasia, in southern Africa and in the Far East despite  recent disputes with China and Malaysia.    Mr Hurd said he wanted the European Union to be more than  merely a single market but one that defined its limits, was more  sensitive to its citizens and which stopped seeking to take more  powers to the centre.    The Foreign Secretary also made a renewed pitch for a  rapprochement with Malaysia, following the breach in trade links  caused by British press reports about alleged corruption in the  Malaysian Government.    The Trade and Industry Department hopes to send a  ministerial  trade mission to Malaysia before the end of the year as part of  a push for business in the Far East, Mr Richard Needham, the  trade minister, said last night.

Beijing yesterday gave its first  indications of dissatisfaction with the latest financing  proposal submitted by the British side more than a week ago.  Britain's fourth funding proposal in a year was believed to  have met China's demand for a bigger equity injection to cushion  debts incurred by the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and  the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). But Chinese  sources yesterday said the obstacles to agreement remained  two-fold.    The proposed equity injection of $60 billion is contingent  on  China's approval of an additional land grant. Britain wants 62  hectares of land along the airport rail link sold under a  gradual sell-off. The grant would be in addition to the annual  50-hectare ceiling for land sales stipulated in annexe three of  the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But the Chinese side  remains concerned about the effect of this on the coffers of the  post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.  Sources said the Chinese side was reluctant to change the  arrangement under which this land could be disposed of only by  the SAR government.    The other obstacle was the Chinese side's dissatisfaction  with what it regarded as Britain's failure to establish an  independent committee to monitor the cost of the airport  project. It maintained that the British side had persistently  circumvented the Airport Consultative Committee, a body set up  to oversee financing arrangements.    Despite China's concerns over the latest funding proposal,  it  is expected to propose a meeting of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group (JLG) Airport Committee next week. Chinese JLG  team leader Guo Fengmin yesterday confirmed that Beijing had  studied the fourth financing proposal, but that there were  problems which needed to be discussed. Mr Guo would not  elaborate. Three rounds of JLG expert meetings are expected to  be held in the next two weeks. Next week, the two sides will  try to resolve the impasse on the future of military sites in  Hong Kong after 1997.     "

Another five deaths were reported yesterday as figures  showed  178 cases of flu-like illness per 100,000 members of the  population, compared with the usual average of 40-50 per  100,000. ""I am willing to call it an epidemic,"" said Douglas  Fleming, director of the Royal College of General Practitioners'  flu monitoring centre in Birmingham.    The five deaths occurred among 23 elderly patients on one  ward in Ladywell hospital, Salford, of whom 14 caught the virus.  Deaths attributed to flu in any winter vary from 1,000 to the  25,000 estimated for the winter of the last epidemic in 1989.  Nine out of ten victims are over 65.    The rate of increase in flu cases is highest in the South,  where they more than doubled between October 31 and November 7,  to 145 per 100,000. But the numbers falling ill are still lower  than the 201 per 100,000 in the North, where the epidemic  started.    ""The rate of increase is not as rapid as in 1989, so I am  optimistic that this will not be as bad an epidemic,"" Dr.  Fleming said. At the peak of the 1989 epidemic, 580 cases per  100,000 were being recorded and, in 1969, the figure rose to  more than 1,000.    However, scientists could not explain why the virus strain  causing this year's illness -- Flu A Beijing -- is proving so  virulent. First identified in China in 1992, it arrived in  Britain last March but caused few problems.    The current wave of illness began in Mississippi in the  United States last August. It was first detected in the UK in  October. Alan Hay, director of the Influenza Research Centre at  the National Institute for Medical Research in north London,  said that this year's virus strain was little different from  that of previous years.

Sir, Observer neatly linked (April 22) the World Development Movement's delight at the prime minister's 'hope' - expressed in 1983  - that Britain would, in five years' time, achieve the aid target of 0.7 per cent of economic output) with the news that the WDM chief would soon become 'World Bank fat cat'. The point is surely worth a little adornment? Since the World Bank annual salaries will soon pass the Dollars 1bn mark and since the reported 100,000 expatriate experts in just Africa are said to be costing some Dollars 5bn a year, Britain will have to hurry to double its aid budget just to keep a few of the aid workers' salaries moving ahead in the time-honoured way. We can then spare a thought as to whether their activities add a single dollar of value to the economies in which they labour. Many claim the value added is negative and the experts say Africa is poorer today after 40 years of pursuing aid policies which change but little in the face of staggering failure. World Bank policies are now being challenged yet again on the entirely new grounds that they actually prevent the development of the private sector, the key to any progress. Why do we go on and on persisting with these failed polices? Simple. Aid is basically an international business and there are a lot of well-developed fat cats (WDFCs?) who understandably do not want the milk taken away from them. The developing countries would be well advised to look elsewhere for their salvation. Donald B Butcher, 12 Burgh Heath, Epsom, Surrey KT17 4LJ  The Financial Times   London Page 23  "

At the weekly press conference here this afternoon, Wu made  the statement when asked to comment on a lengthy report on  Sino-British relations issued on April 13 by the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the British House of Commons.    In disregard of the fact, Wu noted, this report confuses the  right and wrong and insists on supporting the erroneous policy  of the British Government on the issue of Hong Kong and  supporting its continued confrontation with China, thus fully  revealing the true intention of the British side to prolong its  colonial influence in Hong Kong by creating chaos there.    Wu stressed that Hong Kong will return to the motherland,  which no force whatsoever can stop.    The Chinese Government has the resolve and the capability to  resume exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled,  pursuing ""One Country, Two Systems"", implementing the basic law  and maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong  Kong, Wu said.    Wu pointed out that the report, while recognizing China's  economic success and the importance of its international role,  makes irresponsible remarks about China's internal affairs and  even made an attempt to meddle in them.    ""We would like to remind the authors of this report that one  has to have some sense of history and reality,"" said Wu, adding  that today's China is no longer what it used to be when it was  ""bullied and lorded over at will.""    He went on to say that people can ""never forget"" the role  Britain played on the issue of Tibet and can only hope it will  ""draw lessons"" from history and adopt a ""prudent attitude.""    Any attempt to create ""Two Chinas"" or ""One China, One  Taiwan""  runs counter to the principles governing the establishment of  the diplomatics relations between China and Britain and  therefore ""will meet our firm opposition,"" the spokesman said.

0,FT922-8566 ,"FT922-8566 _AN-CEMBDAACFT 920513   FT  13 MAY 92 / European freedom of movement may end at Dover: Britain's row with its EC partners on border controls      By DAVID BUCHAN   BRITAIN'S long-simmering dispute with the European Commission over frontier controls is coming to the boil, just in time to embarrass the UK government as it takes over the EC presidency in the second half of this year. As in so many aspects of Community policy, the issue boils down to a matter of trust. Will Britain trust its partners sufficiently to remove all controls on people and goods entering the UK from the rest of the EC? The short answer at the moment is: no. The dispute stems from the 1986 Single European Act's commitment to a single market defined, in Article 8a, as 'an area without internal frontiers' by the end of 1992. Britain contends that this freedom of movement only applies to EC citizens, and that, as Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, stressed this week, 'we are justified, indeed have the obligation, to maintain our controls on non-Community citizens'. But, technically, it is impossible to check the passports of non-EC 'goats' without also checking the credentials of the EC 'sheep'. Last week, the Commission delivered a long-expected legal opinion that Article 8a requires an end to all controls, and was confident that, if it had to take Britain to the European Court of Justice, it would win. Such a legal battle could take a long time. In the meantime, there are pressing and expensive tasks such as changing the infrastructure at EC airports, if there really is to be a EC-wide free travel zone. The Commission has been so absolutist in its interpretation of Article 8a, because it fears that if frontier controls remain for just one reason - checks on travellers - they can be used as an easy pretext for the return of checks on goods, for fiscal, security, health purposes. In fact, the UK Customs and Excise is busy preparing, like its counterparts elsewhere in the EC, to move its fiscal checks inland. Brussels has set aside Ecu400m (Pounds 280m) to retrain or re-employ the 250,000 customs agents who will be put out of work. From next year, truck drivers will no longer have to stop at intra-EC border posts (except perhaps on the Danish-German border) to file VAT and excise documents. There is far less progress in finding alternatives to other border checking activities such as controlling the movement of drugs, explosives, artworks, and hi-tech goods of military potential. Some problems appear intractable such as how to get rid of the quarantine which the UK and Ireland impose on the import of cats and dogs. Finding alternative ways of checking drugs, explosives and rabid animals, are essential if Britain is to stop controlling the entry of people from other points in the EC. However, of even greater concern is the need to improve controls on the EC's periphery. There is growing migratory pressure on the EC, traditionally mainly from north Africa, but now from eastern Europe. All 12 EC states are, in principle, ready to sign a convention 'on the crossing of external frontiers' of the Community. But the convention is held up by an Anglo-Spanish dispute about Gibraltar, with the UK wanting its colony treated as part of EC territory, but Madrid insisting that travellers from the Rock to Spain are crossing an 'external' frontier. The Portuguese presidency of the EC is trying to broker a deal. But this 'external' convention seems not to be enough for Britain to drop its 'internal' guard. It would set agreed rules for issuing visas to third-country citizens, for which a common policy is provided in the Maastricht treaty. It would lead to the Twelve exchanging information on undesirable aliens. It would also require each state to impose immigration controls on incoming aircraft, ships, cars and buses, which the other 11 could - but need not - rely on. The convention contains a British-inspired declaration that other (ie internal) controls can be maintained. The Dublin convention on the treatment of asylum-seekers has also been signed by the Twelve, though only ratified by Denmark and Greece. Absent from this convention is the trust apparent in the 1990 Schengen treaty setting up a free travel zone between Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the Benelux countries. (Greece now wants to join Schengen.) This far-reaching pact provides for elaborate co-operation between the eight countries' police and immigration forces. But it has not proved quite the trail-blazing treaty it was intended to be. Only France has ratified it, and it has run into difficulties in the Dutch parliament. None the less, in Brussels' view, Britain remains the main obstacle to a frontier-free Europe. True, Denmark is dithering about dropping controls because of its passport union with Nordic countries. But this will be eased once they join the EC. Ireland will probably follow the UK lead. Given Britain's island geography, it is 'plain common sense', Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former UK leader, used to say, for it to keep controls. But if other countries show they can enforce proper controls on their parts of the EC's external rim, it will become plain common sense for British officialdom to abandon Dover.

These attempts will never be realized, said a spokesman for  the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National People's  Congress (NPC) here today while commenting on a report related  to the relations between Britain and China before and after  1997, issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British  House of Commons on April 13.    The spokesman said the report advocated self-determination  of  Tibet in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs.    It is known to all that since ancient times, he noted, Tibet  has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory.    Before 1959, he said, a system of feudal serfdom was  practiced in Tibet, an insidious oppression darker and more  cruel than that of the Middle Ages in Europe.    The spokesman said old Tibet was one of the regions in the  world which suffered most seriously from violations of human  rights. After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march  down the road of national unity, economic development and people  living in peace and contentment.    This is a reform of epoch-making significance toward  safeguarding human rights and promoting social progress, he said.    But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind  of  change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners who  trampled human rights as ""guards of human rights,"" which he said  pokes great fun at human rights.    The purpose of making such claims is in fact to attempt to  sabotage China's reunification and national unity, he said.    The spokesman said: ""We advise them to take a cautious  attitude toward the issue of Tibet in light of what part Britain  has played in history.""    The spokesman said the British House of Commons also  suggests  strengthening the ties between the British Parliament and  Taiwan's ""Legislative Yuan"", calling on the British Government  to ease its restrictions on Taiwan.    He pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  and  Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the People's  Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing  China, which he said has been recognized by the world community.    The spokesman said that the points of view on the issue of  Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons run counter to the principles concerning the  establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Britain.    Its real aim is to create ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one  Taiwan"", which is firmly opposed by the entire Chinese populace  including the people of Taiwan, he said.    The report also has the ulterior motive to advocate ""China  threat"" so as to undermine the relations between China and its  neighboring countries.    It is known to all that China pursues an independent foreign  policy of peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world  peace and stability. So talk of ""China threat"" is totally  groundless and works in vain. The spokesman said that the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC attaches great importance  to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation  with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons.    The Chinese side does not do anything harmful to Britain and  the British Parliament as well as to Sino-British ties.    But, he said, some from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  British House of Commons have recently repeatedly done harm to  Sino- British relations while stressing maintaining and  developing Sino- British relations.    ""We should ask what their motives are and where they will  lead to in bilateral relations,"" he said.    It is certain that the views and suggestions against China  that the report has raised will bring harm not only to  Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term interests of  Britain, he stressed.    ""We believe that those who really care for and want to  safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral relations are not  willing to see such kinds of results,"" the spokesman added.     "

The warning is the latest move in the campaign by Beijing to persuade the UK to withdraw its proposals to extend the scope of democracy in Hong Kong. In the 1984 joint declaration, Beijing promised that the territory would be allowed to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years. The threat came after the Hong Kong stock market registered its largest one-day drop in share prices since June 1989, when the Tiananmen Square demonstration and the suppression of the Beijing democracy movement led to a fall of more than 20 per cent in the market. At the close yesterday, the Hang Seng index, the market's barometer, was 434.44 points, or 8 per cent, lower at 4,978.21. Since its peak three weeks ago, the index has fallen nearly 23 per cent. Selling was frantic, with turnover of HKDollars 5.3bn (Pounds 456m). A local investment banking group became the first casualty of the collapse of confidence when it was forced to withdraw its HKDollars 300m flotation. Other new issues appear likely to be postponed. The only outcome which would satisfy the business community would be for the governor, Mr Chris Patten, to drop his proposals immediately. But, even with the stock market down more than 1,000 points this week, there is little expectation this will happen. In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry said that the issue facing Britain was now 'whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the other agreements reached between the two sides are still needed'. The ministry added that the only way to solve the problem was for the 'British Hong Kong authorities to return to the agreements reached between China and Britain'. Last night the Hong Kong government said Britain had made clear it was 'prepared to hold discussions without preconditions' with China on matters relating to a smooth transition of sovereignty in 1997. It said it was committed to the full implementation of the joint declaration. The rapid deterioration in Sino-British relations has caused serious concern among the people of Hong Kong and their political leaders. Local legislators were critical of China's scare tactics and feared for the effect they were having on local morale. Further volatility in Hong Kong share prices appears inevitable. Already market conditions have undermined the new issues market, with South China Brokerage yesterday withdrawing its HKDollars 300m flotation due to be launched on Monday. Separately, the company has also become the first securities house in the current climate to invoke the force majeure clause in an underwriting agreement. The clause permits the withdrawal of an underwriting commitment in situations of material and unforeseeable change. South China had underwritten a HKDollars 72m covered warrant issue on China Light and Power shares; by last night, the shares were 22 per cent below the warrant's strike price.

The British Conservative government therefore, by resorting to  espionage in the Iranian Embassy, has violated the Iran's  sovereignty, too.    The British Government, which considers itself the vanguard  of international law, human rights, the fight against terrorism,  and other similar titles, has directly resorted to espionage  inside the Iranian Embassy in London. Almost simultaneously  with the exposure of the British espionage activity in our  London embassy, John Major's government, in order to provide a  cover for this huge disgrace, began some baseless propaganda on  contacts between Iran and the Irish Republican Army. This show  was not even effective in Britain, so much so that the British  press and media too confessed that these allegations are false  and vague.    Unfortunately Britain, this permanent member of the Security  Council and the so-called protector of international peace and  security -- the same as some of its western allies -- is  pursuing its anti-human objectives without care for any  regulations and law. This country's behavior in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue has exposed in the best possible manner  the true face of this so-called free democratic state. Britain  brings pressure to bear on any state which opposes its policies,  by resorting to such accusations as human rights violations,  attempting to obtain nuclear weapons, and terrorism. Whereas  Britain itself is classed as one of the major international  lawbreakers.     "

Speaking to Conservatives in Fife, Mr Portillo urged the party to ignore 'the clamour of vociferous minorities', and listen to 'the still, small voice' of its natural supporters. In a speech flagged as a personal political manifesto, Mr Portillo dwelt heavily on rightwing icons such as personal responsibility, self-improvement and law and order. Mr Portillo's tone was less sharp than his hard-hitting attack three months ago on the 'new British disease' of undermining institutions such as the monarchy and parliament. Yet the speech was seen at Westminster as the next step in his campaign to secure the rightwing nomination in any Conservative leadership election. Few of Mr Portillo's supporters think he could win the leadership at an early attempt by overhauling front-runners Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. But solid rightwing support could put Mr Portillo on track for the leadership in the next parliament, after a spell in a more senior cabinet role. Mr Portillo said the quiet majority looked to the Conservatives for secure defences, law and order, sound public finances, low inflation and economic policies that encouraged investment and job creation. He said Britain had much of which to be proud, including its export to the rest of the world of a free-market economic agenda of de-regulation, competition, privatisation, tariff reduction, and free trade. He said the quiet majority was 'dismayed' by aspects of modern Britain such as handouts to people capable of work and young offenders being sent on sailing cruises. 'In a world turned upside down, they ask where is the encouragement for self-reliance, where is the punishment for wrong-doing, where is the incentive to achieve?' he said. 'They look to the Conservative party to articulate their point of view, and through its policies and legislation to validate their way of life and underpin their belief.'

0,FT921-3464 ,"FT921-3464 _AN-CCNAEAAFFT 920314   FT  14 MAR 92 / Britain's superchip factory faces closure      By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO   INMOS, the semiconductor company which invented the transputer microprocessor - the 'computer on a chip' - plans to close its fabrication plant in Newport, South Wales, unless it receives government aid. The move by Inmos, now owned by SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, may end a controversial and often politically charged chapter in the history of the UK semiconductor industry. Closure would mean the end of UK manufacture of the transputer, which is one of the few successful semiconductor inventions to come out of Britain and one that had been hailed as a key to regaining British leadership in the computer industry. The plant's planned closure in 12 to 18 months, after prolonged speculation concerning its future, is also likely to rekindle debate about UK industrial policy and its failure to keep strategic technologies in UK ownership. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the closure of the plant would mean 'yet more high technology redundancies and yet another British invention lost to British manufacturing for good'. Inmos said, however, that because of the response in the UK to its decision, it would now make a formal application for aid to the Welsh Office. It said it had not applied before because several months of discussion had led it to believe that aid was unlikely to be forthcoming. The result of its application could alter the decision to close the plant, Inmos said. Inmos was set up by the Labour government in 1978 in an effort to win a leadership position for Britain in microelectronics. The government invested huge sums in the company to enable it to develop the transputer, a semi-conductor which can process a large amount of data concurrently at very high speeds. While Labour looked to the transputer as a revolutionary device which could help Britain gain leadership in semiconductors, the succeeding Conservative government delayed funding and then sold Inmos to Thorn EMI in 1984. Thorn sold Inmos to SGS-Thomson in 1989. The transputer recently won a significant endorsement when IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, decided to use the device in the control mechanism of its computers. Inmos said, however, that it did not make economic sense for SGS-Thomson to invest the Pounds 50m or so needed to upgrade the Newport plant in order to satisfy volume production. The financially pressed group has recently made huge investments in other semiconductor fabrication plants. Production at the Newport plant will be gradually wound down over the next 12 to 18 months and transferred to SGS-Thomson plants at Rousset, in southern France, Agrate in Italy and Carrollton, Texas. There will be a limited number of redundancies among the 450-strong workforce in the next month, but there are no detailed plans for overall redundancies when the plant finally closes.

0,FT932-13252 ,"FT932-13252 _AN-DDZBRAE1FT 930423   FT  23 APR 93 / UK hurdles remain for Maastricht approval      By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS      LONDON   THE finishing line is in sight for the British parliament's lengthy consideration of the Maastricht treaty on European union. But yesterday's completion of a marathon committee stage in the House of Commons does not guarantee Mr John Major's Conservative government a problem-free run to ratification. Four more hurdles have still to be cleared, starting with the Commons report stage which is likely to get underway early next month. Then will come the second Danish referendum on May 18, quickly followed - if the Danes vote Yes  -by what should be a comparatively untroubled 'third reading' debate. The government has promised that this will not happen until after the Danish result is known. After that, the bill moves to the House of Lords where Euro-sceptic peers spearheaded by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Lord Tebbit will press the case for a Maastricht referendum, which the Commons early yesterday rejected by a majority of 239 votes. The Commons would have the power if necessary to vote out any unwelcome amendments but this would require an additional debate that the government wants to avoid. Finally, if the measure is still on course, there is an outside chance the government could trip up in an eleventh-hour debate on the treaty's social chapter, due to come after Maastricht has been made part of British law. The critical question at next month's report stage is whether the opposition Labour party manages to engineer a vote on its amendment which would delete the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. This could be important as it is the only mechanism yet devised which might force the government to choose between the social chapter and the treaty without requiring at least some Tory Euro-sceptics first to vote explicitly for the chapter. The bill's passage through the Lords is arguably the least predictable obstacle still in the government's path. This is because its rules of procedure leave anti-Maastricht peers with virtually limitless scope to delay it. For example, any proposal can theoretically be voted on at the request of just four peers. Hundreds of amendments are expected to be put forward, as they were in the Commons. In practice, the flexibility of the Lords rules is rarely exploited to its limit. But with emotions running high and a passionate anti-Maastricht campaign in prospect, the government may have to bide its time for a month or two. If all else fails, Tory Euro-sceptics could conceivably make a last-ditch effort to derail the treaty by voting explicitly for the social chapter - which they loathe - in a separate debate due to take place after the bill has received Royal Assent. If they did so, Mr Major could be forced to choose - as Labour hopes - between accepting the social chapter, from which he took such pains to negotiate a British opt-out, and tearing up the treaty. Mr Major last night underlined his determination to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. He told a Conservative party dinner: 'Outside Europe Britain can survive; inside we will thrive'. Operating at the centre of the EC, the UK could press its case for a wider, free-trade, liberal community which would in turn render irrelevant the idea of a centralised European superstate, he said. 'The idea of a centralised Europe had resonance in a Community of six. But for 12, soon 16 and eventually 20 plus nations it is a grandiose doodle'. Mr Major said Britain had to take its 'rightful place' in the world. 'Though no longer a global power we still have global interests. We need to defend them with determination but also with subtlety. We cannot afford to subject ourselves to the despotism of nostalgia'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Not a debate generated by  the revanchist views of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- Russian  soldiers washing their boots in the Indian Ocean, nuclear  weapons dispatched with abandon. But a broader debate, about how  a country which used to be locked in superpower confrontation  should adapt to its changed circumstances, now that the Cold War  is over and the Soviet Union has collapsed.    Dean Acheson's pithy one-liner on post-imperial Britain --  losing an Empire without yet finding a role -- has echoes in  Moscow. It took Britain three decades to transform Empire into  Commonwealth. The Russians lost their empire in three years.    William Hayter was and remains an acute observer of the  scene. He was right when he wrote, in this paper some weeks ago,  that ""Russia today is in the same position internationally as  Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, a Great Power like  another, likely to play its part...in the concert of Europe.""    It is natural that Russia should want to act as the great  power it is. But there are limits, too, to those actions. The  government today is aware of popular constituencies which were  less obvious before the December elections. There have been  changes in the cabinet, and the government now is working to  match those changes in political circumstances with its foreign  policy priorities. For all of us in the West, that debate  produces both problems and opportunities.    The Russian role in Bosnia has been valuable. A more  vigorous and lateral-minded policy brought Russian troops from  Croatia into Sarajevo. That buttressed the ultimatum which NATO  had the previous week issued to Serb militia in the hills around  the city. It reinforced the admirable efforts of General Sir  Michael Rose to secure the cease-fire around Sarajevo. Three  efforts -- one by the UN commander, one by NATO members, one by  the Russian Government -- together brought stability and a  certain amount of sanity to Sarajevo. The Russians, together  with the rest of us, could not achieve success at Gorazde. But,  looking ahead in Bosnia, we can see that the Russians are now an  essential part of the international effort.    There are other parts of Europe, however, where Russia's  activity appears dubious or unacceptable. I recently visited  Riga for talks with the three Baltic foreign ministers. Russian  troops have already left Lithuania. Russia has undertaken to  withdraw its troops from Latvia by the end of August, and was  quick to correct its mistaken announcement recently which gave a  different impression. The Russians are engaged in negotiations  with Estonia to withdraw their remaining 2,600 troops, having  also set a date for withdrawal: the end of August.    I recognise the importance to Moscow of the Russian  communities in the Baltic states. It is important that their  rights are respected. But there is a basic fact that overrides  all others. These countries are sovereign. They have a right,  as independent states, to ask any foreign troops to go. This is  not something to which conditions can be attached. So the  August withdrawal dates from Latvia and Estonia must be kept,  since that is what both countries wish. We accept that Russia  has interests, both economic and political, in other parts of  the former Soviet Union. But these countries, no less than the  Baltic states, are sovereign and independent. They, too, are  entitled to ask the Russians to withdraw their troops; Moldova  has already asked. Equally, they are free to enter into  bilateral agreements with Russia on the stationing of forces,  and other issues, should they wish to do so. The key is freedom  of choice. This is something the Russians must respect, and  something we shall watch very carefully.    Conflicts in the former Soviet Union are a legitimate  concern  for Russia, but also for Britain and the international community  as a whole. We welcome Russian participation in UN and CSCE  efforts to bring about peace settlements to the conflicts in the  Transcaucasus. There are no special ""spheres of influence."" We  need to work together on this. But the British Government will  not underwrite any proposal to deploy Russian forces in the  former Soviet Union unless we are sure that peacekeeping forces  will not turn into occupiers. Andrey Kozyrev (the Russian  foreign minister) and I have thought hard about and jointly  described in public the kind of ground rules which should  dictate our responses to this kind of situation. We agreed that  respect for the sovereignty and wishes of these newly  independent states is central to the whole issue. We agreed  that any peacekeeping operation needs a parallel peace process,  a clear mandate for the forces sent in, and a clear exit  strategy once the mandate has been fulfilled.    Between now and the Russian presidential elections in 1996,  Britain and Europe must find ways of accentuating the positive  side of the new Russian engagement in international affairs, as  in Bosnia. As part of that, we need to find ways of helping the  Russian Government to convince its own electorate that this is  the wise and right approach.    Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace would  make a big difference. We are keen that Russia should play a  full and active part in this initiative. There is clearly a  great deal it can contribute, not least in involvement in the  peacekeeping-related activities envisaged under PFP [Partnership  For Peace]. Working closely with NATO in this way could do a  lot to build up understanding and co-operation, not only between  Russia and NATO but across the whole of Europe.    The Russian leadership and the Russian people have come to a  crucial point. They are debating among themselves what kind of  foreign policy they should pursue. I have no doubt that they  should be pursuing the policy of a great power -- but a great  power within the context of international law and norms. We  must watch to ensure that Russian policy conforms to these  criteria. There are plenty of voices in Russia urging, against  powerful opposition, the kind of foreign policy which fits in  well with our own and with the needs of their neighbours. We  must help them.

Later in the day, Iraq organised an unprecendented news conference by two of the Britons, but it was not immediately clear whether it pointed to any change in their status. 'It is clearly a political issue.  Iraq is doing an injustice by detaining them,' Mr Mark Le Goy, a consular official, told Reuter as he left for Jordan. Mr Paul Ride and Mr Simon Dunn, two of the prisoners, later told the new conference at a Baghdad hotel they were victims of circumstance. 'I am a victim of the situation whereby there is an area which is disputed.  I was allowed to proceed as a civilian into a military disputed area, without being advised that I was approaching it or Iraq,' Mr Ride said. The two men said Kuwaiti border guards had not stopped or warned them, but Mr Ride added: 'There is no point in apportioning blame.'  Mr Ride, Mr Dunn and Mr Michael Wainwright are in Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad.  Mr Ride is serving seven years and Mr Dunn eight for entering Iraq illegally from Kuwait. Mr Wainwright, serving 10 years for cycling in via Kurdish rebel-held areas in the north, did not attend the new conference.  'He is a little bit tired,' Mr Khalid Jarjees, the Britons' lawyer, said. Iraq last week released three Swedes jailed on similar charges, after Sweden's king had made a personal appeal to President Saddam Hussein. Iraq has demanded that Britain unfreeze Iraqi assets in British banks, in return for the three men's freedom.  Britain has ruled out any deal. AP adds from Nicosia:  Convicted PLO gunman Ian Daidson, a Briton imprisoned eight years ago for killing three Israelis here, was freed yesterday and put on a flight to London, officials reported.

His remarks will stir fresh debate on the opposition benches at a time when the Labour leadership has been trying to play down the issue for fear of alienating royalist voters. A straw poll of 100 Labour MPs in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday showed almost a quarter want a republic, 32 per cent a monarchy along Dutch or Scandinavian lines and only 14 per cent back the royal family continuing unchanged. Meanwhile, Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of York, said the religious make-up of the country had changed so much that the Church of England must debate the privileged position it held with the monarchy. On the BBC Heart of the Matter programme he said he believed the coronation oath, in which the sovereign pledges to uphold the Church of England, would have to be revised when a new king or queen ascended the throne. Mr Ashdown said on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme he believed it unlikely that Britain would opt for a 'bicycling monarchy' as witnessed elsewhere in northern Europe. But Mr Ashdown added: 'We could strip away some of the pomp and circumstance of the monarchy, bring it closer to the reality of life in Britain. 'I hazard a guess that that's a view held, for instance, by Prince Charles and perhaps her majesty herself.' Arguing that Britain looked increasingly out of date and also advocating the case for the disestablishment of the Church of England, he added that the royal family could easily perform its constitutional role by functioning on a more modest scale. The Liberal Democrat leader's comments add to the difficulties of Mr John Smith, who has intentionally sought to avoid entering into the controversy over the royal family's future. The Labour leader had been planning to make a speech on constitutional reform early next month, but has now postponed it.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-6157 ,"FT922-6157 _AN-CE0AWAB0FT 920527   FT  27 MAY 92 / Major drops visa requirement for Polish tourists to Britain      By PHILIP STEPHENS and BETHAN HUTTON      WARSAW, LONDON   MR JOHN MAJOR announced the abolition of UK visa requirements for Polish tourists yesterday and increased Britain's financial aid to Warsaw. The gesture was designed to underline his commitment to Poland's eventual membership of the European Community. After talks with Polish government leaders in Warsaw, Mr Major said he would use Britain's presidency of the EC in the second half of this year to commit the 12 to allowing Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to join the Community. Mr Major said membership of the EC was not practical in the short term. Poland is locked in twin political and economic crises, heightened last night when President Lech Walesa declared that he had 'lost trust in the present government'. All three countries are still suffering from the painful transition to market-based economies. Mr Major, however, emphasised his determination that the Community should not remain a 'rich man's club', suggesting that the EC should set the turn of the century as a firm target for their inclusion. His announcement, after talks with Mr Walesa and Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, that Britain will abolish visa requirements for Polish visitors to the UK ended a long-running dispute between the two governments. In the past, Britain has argued that, because of the large Polish communities in the UK, many visitors have stayed on as illegal workers. Some 200,000 Poles are resident in the UK. Many have relatives in Poland who want to visit. Complaints have centred on long delays in granting visas, excessive bureaucracy, the number of people rejected and the charge for visas, which at about Pounds 20 can be more than a week's wage in Poland. Last year, 47,350 Poles applied for UK visas, and 5 per cent were turned down. The announcement was welcomed by Polish community organisations in the UK. Mr Mieczyslaw Hampel, administrator of the Polish Social and Cultural Association in London, said: 'In general we are very pleased'. Mr Antoni Zniderycz, secretary of a branch of the Polish Ex-Combatants Association, said: 'Our main argument was that we who stayed by the side of England for many years during the war were the first to deserve that kindness from the British government.' Mr Hampel expressed some worries that young people might exploit the relaxation to work illegally, but other leaders played this down. 'If anything it would be a short-term problem, not a long-term problem. Everybody knows there is unemployment in this country,' said Mr Alojzy Gajdzik, chairman of the Polish Parish in south-east London. Mr Major flew to Prague last night on the second leg of his four-day tour of central Europe. At a joint press conference earlier with Mr Olszewski, he indicated that he intended to press for a much stronger political dialogue between Poland, Hungary and Czechslovakia and the EC. Foreign ministers from the three countries will be invited to a meeting of the EC council and the three heads of government will attend joint talks in London during the British presidency. Mr Major said the UK would increase financial aid for Poland by Dollars 14m. The money will finance small business development.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

O heroic Sudanese people:    When Britain sent Peter Streams as its ambassador to Sudan,  he felt the greatness of his responsibility in being sent to a  rebellious country, one that was difficult to shackle since it  had emerged from the well into which it had been thrown by its  own abilities. Streams was determined to equip himself with  [word indistinct] of his predecessors, (Ford), Kitchener,  Wingate, Gordon and Slatin.    He drew from his fertile imagination [word indistinct] entry  into Khartoum enveloped in the mantle of history and riding  haughtily in a strong saddle and surrounded by the crowds,  disbursing before him gifts and presents to the [?poor] [words  indistinct].    Why not? For he is a descendant of the resident of the first  palace and a man of action and will, in what they call the Third  World. Thus, the foundations of the British Embassy were weaker  than the ambassador's dreams [words indistinct].    His excellency the ambassador began the battle having  preceded it with a media campaign of defamation. It was  circulated at gatherings that his blessed advent would put an  end to the government of the National Salvation Revolution and  would arrange its end. The honor of the English nobility does  not permit the erasure of anything they have written with their  own pens, and no culture or civilization could be (?better) than  what they had. Politicians should not dismiss those who are  close to them, and their beloved ones should not be left out of  ministerial positions.    The British ambassador led an active campaign to discourage  Western ambassadors from attending the country's celebrations,  marking the fourth anniversary of the revolution, so as not to  give the government any legitimacy, according to Streams. He  promised them they would wait and see the death of the  revolution as a result of his efforts. The British ambassador  was the most frequent visitor to the camps of the displaced  persons. He would knock on their doors before dawn prayers,  when they undress in the afternoon and after the second evening  prayers [salat al-isha]. He shed tears at the demonstrations of  misery and wretchedness. He [word indistinct] the haphazard  housing like the poet in the days of ignorance. He described  the lake of the Jabal Awliya Dam as the heart of the desert. He  described the planning of new towns and town quarters as  deportation of supporters of a party he named which used to have  cordial relations with his leadership.    Ambassador Peter Streams expressed his readiness to amend  the  itinerary of the EC delegation to divert it to what he thought  would be displeasing to them. He wanted to influence the  delegation's reports, which he believed might otherwise be  useful to his enemy, Sudan. The British ambassador persevered  in writing fabricated reports to such an extent that he  established a particular image in the minds of the recipients of  his reports, in addition to their media. He was thus afraid  that the image would change every time a British delegation's  visit was imminent, out of his fear that the delegation might  see the truth and discover his lies. We see him using one of  the important loopholes of British politics, separating religion  from the state, and the call for secularism in government and  safeguards against the influence of faith.    He wanted to plug a loophole of interest to him, namely the  lack of clarity in his patched up reports. He went in a rush to  the speaker of the Transitional Assembly, and told him, making  it almost an order, that Streams should be the host of the  archbishop of Canterbury, that is, the Anglican Church. He  wanted to be host to him in his own house and to be the one to  draw up the visit's programs and meetings -- otherwise the visit  would have to be canceled.    He seemed to want to put the government in the embarrassing  position of acceptance or rejection. He obviously reckoned that  he would win the round. When he saw that the government would  not concede part of its sovereignty, he rushed off to Britain  [words indistinct] and that Sudan was imposing restrictions on  the archbishop's visit, fixing his program, and refusing to  allow the Sudanese Episcopal Church to be host to him. Moreover  the British Embassy was more deserving of his [word indistinct]  in the August presence of Peter Streams.    He claimed that Sudan was shutting the door in the face of  the visit. However, British wisdom pushed the archbishop into  Sudan through the back door (?to be the guest of) [word  indistinct] the agent rebels. Thus the visit had to take place  according to the wishes of Great Britain and not according to  the wishes of Sudan. In this way the aging empire struck the  final wedge in Western credibility, which had been filling the  world with talk of freedoms, human rights, democracy, and the  separation of religion and state. As for freedom: Look at its  creation of the Zionist entity in the Arab land. Human rights  are being practiced in Bosnia, with Britain's support. As for  democracy, they are opposed to it unless it gives birth to what  they love, and there is much proof of this.    As for the separation of religion and the state, this is  what  Peter Streams, the British ambassador to Sudan, has done. If  the separation is real, then what business does the embassy have  in the archbishop's visit when the embassy is the state? What  business does it have with the (?Episcopal) church and its  parishioners? Why should the visit become political, tarnishing  the name of Sudan as is being done by that Jewish radio in  London? Why was the visit directed to the zone of military and  political conflict where there are no civilian citizens? Is it  for the defeated rebellion to present its demands for arms from  the archbishop at a time when so many southerners have taken  refuge in their homeland in the north? When did the leaders of  the rebellion abandon the atheistic communist influence and  forget the era of the manifesto [as heard] and become apostles  of Jesus Christ?    But all this is nothing more than a lack of capability and  defeat, which destroyed those who were seeking support for a  crusade, as they suggested to the archbishop, while continuing  to fight among themselves as a result of the struggle for  leadership and interests, ethnic interests and the rancor of  desperate souls.    Pope John Paul was right when he came to Khartoum and  received a great welcome from its people. He met his followers  and prayed with them safely into the night -- yet in other  Christian countries he is surrounded by armored glass. He was  indeed a friend of Sudan.    As for Ambassador Streams, he should (?remember) Kordofan.  How it managed to extinguish the lives of a whole army in one  hour -- it was led by Kitchener [words indistinct]. Remember  the iron sword which reached the neck of the sacred General  Gordon [word indistinct] on that day of liberation in 1885, and  left so much grief in the heart of the foggy capital.    Had Peter looked to history it would have told him the  truth.  But he did not, preferring to send fabricated reports about the  Sudanese people. That is why he is returning to Great Britain  after having lost his bid. He has not succeeded in what he  promised his fellow ambassadors concerning changing the Sudanese  regime. He has revealed a lie which was earlier concealed --  the lie of separating religion from the state. This was urged  so much by Britain, and repeated by its parrots. The people of  Islam must rule their life. The Sudanese people should thank  God for the merit of our predecessors. The British Embassy will  continue to be a symbol of contacts between peoples in equal  measure, like other embassies, that is, if its people want to  have contacts without conditions, arrogance and conspiracy.  Sudan covets nothing from Britain because it is able to assess  Britain's situation and the notions of the past that it suffers  from, as well as the problems of its complicated present --  being overpowered by America and influenced by the Jews.    Long live the revolution, with its bright and dignified  banners on the brown masts of Sudan. Long live the unoppressed  people [words indistinct]. God is great and dignity to Sudan.     "

By ROBERT BARR, ASSOCIATED PRESS      LONDON      ""Mad cow disease"" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for  Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.    The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human  health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it  is transmitted.    ""I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,"" says Martin Raff, a  neurobiologist at University College, London. ""But they certainly are not zero.  I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.""    Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed  only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which  has been in Britain since the 1700s. The incurable disease eats holes in the  brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger  drunkenly.    The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which  used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.    The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and  later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal  cord in food for humans. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed.    In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market  value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed  with BSE.    ""I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that  the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be  likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation,"" said  Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.    The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. ""In the course of 24  hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and  totally disoriented.""    As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998  cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.    The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16  million for 1990.    Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been  confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of  Northern Ireland.    Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull  semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.    Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West  Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the  European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6  months.    David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of ""BSE hysteria""  in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is  ""remote.""    The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease.    A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford  University, reported last year that the cause of BSE ""is quite unlike any  bacteria or known viruses.""    The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy  animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies.    The Southwood report said it is ""most unlikely"" that the disease poses a threat  to humans. But the report added: ""If our assessments of these likelihoods are  incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious.""

Another form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea.    According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free  of scrapie.    ""It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect  of BSE on human health,"" a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture  Ministry.

Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said yesterday there was 'every chance' of Britain being able to achieve this rate of growth, in what he described as the one area of world trade where Britain's percentage share had recently contracted. His comments came as he set out the detail behind the two-pronged Budget announcement of fresh cuts in export insurance premium rates and Pounds 1.3bn of additional export credit cover in certain markets over the next three years. He said premiums had been re-evaluated to make sure Britain was competitive. But he warned: 'Obviously we are not going to be the cheapest in every market in the world.' The biggest reductions - of up to 45 per cent - were being implemented for Singapore and Taiwan. Cuts of up to 35 per cent will apply in Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia. Exporters to China, India, Indonesia and Oman will benefit from reductions of up to 25 per cent. Mr Needham said he could see no evidence 'at the moment' that Britain's commercial relationship with China was being damaged by differences over Hong Kong. Iran was one of a number of countries where premium rates were being increased - in its case by up to 10 per cent. This was attributed to problems regarding negotiations over sovereign loan guarantees. China and Indonesia were named as beneficiaries of the Pounds 1.3bn in extra export credit cover, of which Pounds 300m is to be available in the coming financial year. On the question of the lack of government arrangements for reinsurance against political risks after 1994, Mr Needham said the government did not want to be in the position of having 'inadequate' reinsurance cover, although it believed this should be provided by the private sector if possible.

The statement from BAe, at the time of purchase, that there was much synergy between aerospace and car manufacture ranghollow then and subsequent statements that Rover was a core business ring hollow now. All the talk about BMW investing in Rover and possible resurrection of the 'great names' from the past is probably just that. It is designed to minimise the outcry. Take Ford and Vauxhall as examples. Gradually, the engineering and design skills have been moved out of Britain and into Germany/US leavingBritain as little more than a location for low-cost assembly. The trouble with low-cost countries is that there is always another one coming up behind and companies have few qualms about shifting production elsewhere to remain competitive. Nobody is denying that the history of Rover/BLMC/BL/BMC is littered withmistakes and gross negligence, nor that much remains to be done (three of its models - the 800, the 200/400 and the Metro - are overdue for replacement). Nevertheless, Rover appears to be sound and worthy of further investment. That it should be starved of such investment by BAe shows up the latter's problems more than it does Rover's. I make no apology for saying that Rover should remain underBritish control. Once again, the failings of this administration and of the City are shown up. The mindless pursuit of short-term profit and cash to satisfy the latest five-year corporate plan and 'vision/mission statement' is distinctly at odds with managing for the long term. It is left to the Germans, the French and the south-east Asians not only to have a long-term vision but to holdto that vision and to ensure that, come the end-game, they will be around. Regrettably, Britain will not be and I despair of our prospects. S W de Looze, 2 Gables Close, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 0PR   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-407 ,"FT923-407 _AN-CI2B1AGOFT 920929   FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lamont wilts under Community fire      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   MR NORMAN LAMONT received a civic lesson in the new politics of the European Community yesterday. The British chancellor has become a hero among Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party after his pledge to follow a 'British economic policy and a British monetary policy'; but at the end of a bruising meeting of fellow EC finance ministers last night, he found out that this may not mean much if Britain intends to remain a member of the Community. In the face of a barrage of criticism, Mr Lamont retreated from earlier British calls for an overhaul of the Exchange Rate Mechanism following sterling's withdrawal. Now, it seems, he would be satisfied with a 'medium-term' debate on the ERM's weaknesses which would deal with 'technical' matters. This is well short of the fundamental reform which he and Mr John Major, his prime minister, set down as preconditions for sterling's re-entry into the ERM. Mr Lamont, who never disguised his discomfort with the restrictions which ERM membership imposed on British exchange rate policy, also signed up to a joint communique describing the European Monetary System as a 'key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe'. And, for good measure, he offered a qualified apology for some of the German-baiting followed in the British government and press. Clearly, a funny thing happened on the way to Brussels. The best explanation is that Mr Lamont discovered that the price of total isolation inside the EC on a matter of substance is something which no member is prepared to pay. Mrs Thatcher discovered this too when, in 1989, she reluctantly agreed to the conditions for ERM entry. For Mr Lamont, it was clear yesterday that Britain's criticisms of the ERM stuck in the collective craw of the Europeans. First, because of its high-handed decision to enter at an unrealistically high rate to the D-Mark in 1990; second, because its withdrawal was coupled with calls for a suspension of the ERM earlier this month. In response, all EC ministers mounted an emotional defence of the system as a bulwark of monetary stability, and promised to push ahead with ratifying the Maastricht treaty. All delegations committed themselves (on paper at least) to the path of fiscal and inflationary rectitude set out in the treaty as a pre-condition for entry into a monetary union. This solidarity produced some extraordinary scenes. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary of the German finance ministry, offered fulsome praise for Irish efforts to prop up the punt with higher interest rates - prompting Irish press releases proclaiming Dublin's determination to join the putative fast-track ot monetary union. Other delegations rubbished real or imagined British plans for using Birmingham as a means of delaying ratification of Maastricht - an indication of how the ERM mess poisons relations on the major issue facing the Twelve. And here is the nub of the matter. Britain has never been entirely trusted by her EC partners. Its on-off relationship in the post-war era makes this inevitable. But whatever their suspicions, most believed that Britain talked sense. After the U-turn on the ERM and the outburst of Bundesbank bashing in Britain, some EC countries are no longer sure.

[Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus opened his first  official visit to Great Britain since the establishment of the  independent Czech state with a meeting with British Prime  Minister John Major. Before the talks began, Prime Minister  Klaus said that the chief purpose of the meeting was to confirm  views on certain questions of a bilateral and Europe-wide  character. At the same time he said he shares the somewhat less  pro-federal view of British politicians on the future set-up in  Europe.    The talks betweem the prime ministers at 10 Downing Street,  where British prime ministers have had their residence since  1735, lasted about one hour. After the talks ended Prime  Minister Klaus said, among other things:    [Begin Klaus recording] As regards bilateral relations, we  considered that there are no significant problems which the  prime ministers should tackle. Therefore the subject of our  talks was of course Bosnia, Europe, European communities, the  gradual integration of our country in European communities, and  the Partnership for Peace, which the British Goverment really  regards as a mechanism for our entry into NATO. We discussed  the issue of the OECD, an organization which I believe offers a  more realistic way for our country's rapid entry into European  structures than some other organizations. [end recording]    [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus has also given a  lecture  at the British Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs on the  subject of the transformation of Czech society and its  Europe-wide context. He repeated his view that of all the  postcommunist countries the Czech Republic has gone the farthest  in its reformist endeavors. At the same time he said that in  this situation the West should not cease to seek an optimal  method for the integration of the postcommunist structures.    At this moment the Czech prime minister is meeting with the  chairman of the British Conservative Party, Sir Norman Fowler.     "

Unless unions start recruiting hard, Mr Laird writes in the union's journal, 'the current merger-mania will amount to little more than rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic'. The AEEU itself - recently formed through a merger between the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union - has seen engineering membership drop by 11 per cent over the past year. Mr Laird says unions have lost a total of 3.5m members since 1979. 'Unions in Britain are less effective than even our dwindling numbers would suggest,' he adds. 'Our 10m members are split into 20 large unions, dozens of smaller unions and hundreds of staff associations.' Arguing for further mergers, Mr Laird points to the problems faced by manufacturing employers who still 'have to deal with three or four manual unions and two or more staff unions'. Although union membership in Germany is lower than in Britain, effectiveness is increased by single unions in each sector, he adds. 'Here in Britain we are still trying to compete against Germany with a Victorian trade union set-up. Mergers have taken place in a random and unco-ordinated way,' he writes. In a barely disguised swipe at some of the poaching activities of his own electricians' section, Mr Laird says the union should not be 'interested in petty squabbles with the general unions about a few thousand members here or there on the periphery of industry', but should be 'reaching out and recruiting the unorganised'.

About 90 per cent of procurement spending went on British-made equipment, he said. The government did not object to a more open procurement policy, but other countries did not agree. UK procurement policies were therefore unlikely to change. Mr Rifkind was answering questions after making a speech at the Royal United Services Institute. Britain is considering a number of big procurement deals involving international competitors. These include transport aircraft for the Royal Air Force, attack helicopters for the army and a conventionally armed stand-off attack missile. Mr Rifkind commented that much of what President Yeltsin said at the United Nations on Monday, when he called for further nuclear arms reductions, seemed to relate to existing agreements. But the Yeltsin text should nevertheless be studied 'for any new nuggets'. The UK had always worked on the basis of a minimum credible nuclear deterrent, and had not been in competition with other countries. Mr Rifkind said in his speech to the institute that there was a 'quiet revolution' - assisted by the Front Line First review of costs - in the management culture of the Ministry of Defence. He said 17 defence agencies had been created in the past 10 years and there was a much greater emphasis on personal responsibility and accountability. A system of budget holders had been established which would produce efficiency gains. The ministry had needed to go beyond that, however, to meet the savings required by the government. The Front Line First programme had done this across services and departments. The Ministry of Defence yesterday sent unions a consultative document about changes to its procurement executive. About 500 jobs are likely to go in the wake of the Front Line First review because of the streamlining of management, transferring some work from contractors to staff, and the agency's move to Abbey Wood near Bristol.

Hong Kong  Governor Patten said that he wished to return home at the end of  his service here by taking off from the new airport. Now, it  seems that his wish will probably come to nothing. Unless there  is a dramatic solution of the dispute over the political system,  or the Chinese side can really handle political and economic  issues separately, there will be no chance of smoothly carrying  out the new airport project. Even though the two sides are  forced to resume talks, nothing will come of it.    Kai Tak Airport Was Built Half a Century Ago    The present Kai Tak Airport was built 50 years ago, and its  facilities and capacity have reached the limit. Last year, Kai  Tak Airport handled 24.5 million passengers, exceeding the  maximum figure originally set. If the new airport cannot be put  to use in three to four years, the load that Kai Tak will have  to face will be inconceivable. According to the figures  provided by the Civil Aviation Department, a total of 6,700  flights were refused landing at Kai Tak Airport last year, which  means 1.4 million passengers were unable to come to Hong Kong.  This is absolutely detrimental to the development of Hong  Kong's tourism, industry, and commerce.    Direct Flight Across the Taiwan Strait Will Ease the  Pressure on Kai Tak Airport    The Chinese side is not opposed to the construction of a new  airport. However, it is politically unacceptable to China if  the project is allowed to be completed before 1997 by Britain  and the Hong Kong Government, and there may be other factors for  consideration in terms of economics and practice value. First,  one of the major causes that made the saturation date of the Kai  Tak Airport come earlier than expected is that large numbers of  Taiwan and mainland passengers are travelling via Hong Kong, who  account for approximately 40 percent of all the passengers  arriving here. If Taiwan and the mainland can make certain  arrangements for direct flights, and mainland passengers can use  the Shenzhen airport which is close to Hong Kong and the Macao  airport which will soon go into operation as much as possible,  the pressure on Kai Tak will be considerably lightened. In a  period of time to come, the problems that have hampered  coordinated operations of Kai Tak and its nearby airports will  be reduced or resolved following the handover of Hong Kong and  Macao to mainland China one after the other. So long as the  transregional cooperation is smoothly carried out, the  saturation point of Kai Tak may be put off for some time, thus  providing sufficient conditions for the new airport to be  gradually completed after 1997.    Moreover, the official completion of the new airport project  after 1997 not only will bring honor to Beijing and the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Regional Government, but the  arrangements for the use of land after Kai Tak terminates  operations will be entirely in the hands of the SAR Government  and Beijing, as it will no longer be necessary to consult anyone  representing the interests of Britain or other countries. With  expensive land prices in Hong Kong, the vast area of Kai Tak  Airport and relaxation of building's height in the entire  Kowloon Peninsula will bring profits up to several dozen billion  dollars to the SAR Government. Naturally, the Chinese side will  not let the British side concern itself with these considerable  profits now when it still administers the territory.    The Chinese Will Not Make Concessions in the New Airport  Project    Taken politically or economically, the Chinese side will not  make concessions in the new airport project. Whether Britain  and the Hong Kong Government still cherish any illusions about  this will be judged by their future actions. Even though both  sides return to the negotiation table, they will be nothing more  than the nature of putting on performances. Perhaps, those  consortia waiting for contracts of project facilities and  supplies need more patience. At least, this spectacular and  controversial new airport project will not become a reality  until after 1997.     "

Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said  aid to Malaysia and 1 billion pounds in defence sales were  linked between March and June 1988 under a protocol signed by  the then Defence Secretary George Younger.    Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee:  ""There was a temporary, incorrect entanglement, but there is now  no link.""    And the Government accused Malaysia of being ""short-sighted""  in imposing its trade ban last week in response to British press  allegations surrounding the Pergau dam project and arms sales to  the former colony.    Labour later claimed Mr Hurd's evidence, during a grilling  by  MPs which lasted almost three hours, was ""incredible"" and that  the link between aid and arms sales must have continued after  June 1988.    Britain contributed 234 million pounds to the dam  construction, believed to be the largest amount of overseas aid  for a single project in British history, while the Ministry of  Defence discussed a 1 billion pound defence with Malaysia [as  received].    Premier Mahathir Mohamad, angered by reports on the affair  in  Britain which included corruption accusations, has banned UK  firms from applying for contracts for Malaysian Government  business in a return to its Buy British Last policy. [passage  omitted]    Earlier, John Major accused the Malaysian Government of  being  ""short-sighted"" for freezing out British firms. In a radio  interview, the Prime Minister said Malaysia owed much of its  economic development to British trade and investment and its  interests would be equally badly affected.    He told BBC Radio 4's ""Today"" programme: ""I don't believe  that what the Malaysian Government has done to British companies  is remotely justified."" Malaysia was ""within striking distance""  of achieving its ambition to become an industrialised country.  He added: ""I believe it is short-sighted to have acted as they  have done, and I believe that over time they may be seen to have  damaged the Malaysian interest as much as the British.""    Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad drummed home the  message later in a speech to businessmen from the Asia-Pacific  advisory group in which he warned that Malaysia had missed its  target and was hurting ""its friends."" Mr Goodlad said British  exports to Malaysia were worth almost 1 billion pounds last year  alone but added: ""Trade benefits both partners. It should be  encouraged, not blocked."" [passage omitted]    In his appearance before the committee, Mr Hurd criticised  the ""swirl of speculative allegations"" about the dam project,  adding: ""To the best of my knowledge, most of these stories are  creatures of fancy."" He said Britain was keen to increase trade  with Malaysia in 1988 and the Ministry of Defence had been  negotiating a 1 billion pound defence deal.    A protocol signed by Mr Younger, now Lord Younger,  ""reflected  the Malaysian wish"" for British aid equivalent to 20 percent of  the defence deal, Mr Hurd said. The link was broken three  months later when the Ministry of Defence realised it was  incorrect.    The Malaysians were informed in a letter from Mr Younger but  the committee heard that Malaysia was given a commitment for 200  million pounds in British aid in a different letter on the same  day.    Labour's Dennis Canavan asked Mr Hurd how he thought the  Malaysians would have viewed this. ""Would you not even have the  tiniest bit of suspicion there was a link between these two  messages, or would you just think it was Christmas?"" he asked.    Mr Hurd stressed the Government had ""learned from the Pergau  experience"" and procedures were tightened. But shadow foreign  secretary Jack Cunningham dismissed his evidence as ""inadequate,  contradictory and incredible.""    He said: ""There can only be one explanation for the fact  that  the Prime Minister John Major and the Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd ignored the clear advice of their accounting officer that  the dam project was `an abuse of the aid system.' That is that  the two projects continued to be linked, despite the denial by  Conservative ministers to the House of Commons, the Public  Accounts Committee and now the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.    ``The fact that British trade and British jobs are now at  risk is entirely the fault of the Conservative Government and  Conservative ministers and their disreputable deals.''

0,FT922-4649 ,"FT922-4649 _AN-CFDA4ADOFT 920604   FT  04 JUN 92 / Nato studies Europe peacekeeping role      By ROBERT MAUTHNER      OSLO   NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Oslo to discuss a wider European peacekeeping role for the alliance in the knowledge that the crisis in the European Community, brought about by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty, can only enhance Nato's position as Europe's principal security organisation. The extent to which future European defence arrangements should be linked to Nato or the European Community was already the subject of dispute between France and Britain and though nothing can prevent the EC member countries from pursuing their original aim, under Maastricht, of turning the nine-nation Western European Union into a more effective instrument for their own defence, the absence of an international treaty framework could hamper the process. Any relief at the new lease of life given to the alliance will not, however, make it easier for Nato foreign ministers to reach agreement on a wider peacekeeping role. No-one wants Nato to become 'a pan-European policeman,' as Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, put it this week. But the US, Britain and some other European allies want it to answer specific requests to carry out peace-keeping activities by international organisations such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and the United Nations. In sharp contrast to the US, which would like the European members to make a new commitment to Nato to justify the administration's policy of maintaining a military foothold in Europe, France wants any peace-keeping requests to be made to individual member nations and not to Nato as an organisation. Nato foreign ministers are also due to sign a new arms-control document, together with representatives from the Commonwealth of Independent States, under which the CIS states, individually, will undertake to carry out the arms cuts agreed on by the former Soviet Union when it signed the conventional forces in Europe (CFE) treaty in Paris at the end of 1990.

Relations between the two countries were soured again last May when Britain decided to extend territorial waters to 200 miles around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, neighbours of the Falklands, and to introduce a fishing licence system there to halt overfishing by third countries. Argentina claims sovereignty over the two islands, as well as the Falklands, where Britain has operated similar restrictions since 1987. Last year Argentina introduced a cut-price licensing system for vessels operating in its waters which has poached many of the Falklands' best customers. Mrs Shephard said yesterday, on the eve of a week-long trade promotion trip to three south American countries, that there had been discussions on the issue of fishing limits at European Community level, with Spain particularly interested in fishing for squid and hake in the South Atlantic. 'We need agreement between the respective authorities to conserve fish for the mutual benefit of all parties,' she said. 'Fish stocks there are fragile and limited.' She will also urge Argentina to lift its ban on imports of British cattle for breeding purposes. Argentina is one of the 17 countries that still ban cattle imports because of the 'mad cow disease' outbreak in the 1980s. Mrs Shephard said the Paris-based Office International des Epizooties, the international animal health organisation, had agreed there was no longer any problem with British cattle exports. Her visit to Argentina, accompanied by a team of British businessmen and agricultural experts, follows separate trips by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, earlier this year. Her first stop today will be Paraguay, where she expects to meet Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy, the first freely elected civilian president. She will then visit Uruguay and lastly Argentina. The objectives of the trip are to promote British food and drink, as well as agricultural expertise and machinery.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

In an interview with the media on the last  day of his stay in Australia, he went so far as to say that  Chinese officials do not understand the international status and  importance of Hong Kong so their criticism of him does not  conform to reality, adding that Hong Kong is an ""international  asset"" as well as China's asset.    What is the purpose of Chris Patten's trip to Australia?  Though he repeatedly argued in his defense that he did not go  to Australia in search of support for his constitutional  package, the fact he talked a great deal about his  constitutional package and requested Australia to pass on  ""genuine democracy"" to Hong Kong reveals that he visited  Australia to seek international support for this constitutional  package, of which the first part will be put to the vote, after  his constitutional package had drawn sharp criticism and came in  for questioning at the British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs  Committee hearings. The Australian Government and public,  however, gave him and his constitutional package the cold  shoulder and many media units and Chinese organizations even  severely criticized him. Only one or two government officers,  who do not know anything about the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law, supported him verbally. When  commenting on this, a Chinese official pointed out: While Patten  is playing the international card, it is extremely inappropriate  for Australian Government officials to make irresponsible  remarks. This criticism hit the vital spot. In reponse, Patten  showed his ignorance and arrogance, once again proving that the  British Government is bent on making the Hong Kong issue an  international one before evacuating Hong Kong and changing Hong  Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity,  to extend the influence of its colonial rule.    Sovereignty Over Hong Kong Cannot Be Evaded    Ostensibly, some people feel Governor Patten's remarks,  quoted at the beginning of this article, were made in praise of  Hong Kong and in defense of Hong Kong's international status and  its importance. However, a rough analysis shows the matter is  not so simple. In saying Hong Kong is an international asset,  Patten intentionally evaded the problem of to whom Hong Kong  belongs. According to Patten, since Hong Kong is an  ""international asset,"" it belongs to the international  community, namely, it is shared by every country in the world or  at least it is an independent or semi-independent political  entity, over which China cannot exercise sovereignty. Does this  not clearly show that China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was  evaded or even denied?    How can China's sovereignty over Hong Kong be evaded! Since  ancient times Hong Kong has been an inseparable part of Chinese  territory. This is a fact known to all. Hong Kong was ""ceded""  and ""leased"" by the corrupt Qing Government to the ""Great  British Empire"" when the latter sent in overpowering warships  and cannons in its invasion of China, so it was in fact ""stolen""  or forcibly ""occupied"" by Britain.    Though Britain has ruled over Hong Kong for one and a half  centuries, the fact that Hong Kong is China's sacred territory  will never change. The Chinese nation has gone through a good  deal, so the Chinese people value the country's sovereignty all  the more. The Chinese Government and people have never  acknowledged the unequal treaty signed at the point of a  bayonet. It is for this reason that Deng Xiaoping has said on  many occasions: ""China refuses to yield an inch on the  territory problem. To put it bluntly, sovereignty is not a  problem for discussion."" These sonorous and forceful remarks  most vividly highlight and express the common desire of the  Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots.    Attempt To Turn Hong Kong into International Wrestling Ring    Before the Chinese people, who refuse to be bullied again,  Patten's attempt to evade and deny the fact that Hong Kong  belongs to China by saying Hong Kong is an ""international asset""  is of no avail.    What merits attention is that this was not the first time  Patten has referred to Hong Kong as an ""international asset.""  In early May last year, he openly alleged that Hong Kong was an  ""international asset"" in a speech in Washington. To echo this  assertion, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in both  Singapore and Jakarta last July that Hong Kong had become a  ""political city."" The two used different terms but they meant  the same thing. They tried to change Hong Kong into an  international political wrestling ring in a bid to throw Hong  Kong into confusion, cripple Hong Kong's superiority as an  international financial center, and rely on international forces  to prevent China regaining sovereignty over Hong Kong.    Patten's allegation that the Chinese side does not  understand Hong Kong's ""international status"" is entirely  nonsense. How can Patten be compared with the Chinese Government  where the understanding of Hong Kong's international status and  its importance are concerned. It is because the Chinese  Government has a profound and accurate understanding of Hong  Kong's past and present state, and its international status,  that it was able to advance a series of principles and policies  including ""one country, two systems,"" ""allowing Hong Kong people  to administer Hong Kong and enjoy a high degree of autonomy,""  and so on to solve Hong Kong problems. The fact that the  Chinese Government included the series of principles and  policies into the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was made  known to the world, giving them concrete form and putting them  on a legal basis in the Basic Law, vividly indicates that the  Chinese Government has a penetrating understanding of Hong  Kong's ""international status."" Undoubtedly, a city's  international status and functions are entirely different from  the issue of to which country it belongs. They are different  concepts and cannot be lumped together. Hong Kong is ranked  among the biggest international cities and has become one of the  international economic, trade, financial, and shipping centers  but this will never change the fact that it is part of Chinese  territory. The same is ture of New York, Paris, and Tokyo:  They are international big cities but nobody can deny that they  belong to the United States, France, and Japan respectively.    Clearly Patten has an axe to grind in preaching the  ""international asset"" theory. By falsely alleging that the  Chinese side does not understand Hong Kong's international  status, he obviously was trying to shift public attention, cheat  the media, and lure the international community into meddling in  Hong Kong affairs, thus finally attaining the goal of  internationalizing the Hong Kong issue.    The British Side Has Attempted To Prolong Colonial Rule for  a Long Time    Internationalizing the Hong Kong issue is one of the British  Government's important plans to continue its colonial rule over  Hong Kong after 1997 and is also one of its concentrated  examples of going back on its word after signing the  Sino-British Joint Declaration.    Britain has been unhappy, unconscious, and even unwilling to  return Hong Kong to China. At the beginning they said ""the  three treaties remain effective,"" later they suggested  ""exchanging sovereignty for administrative power,"" and then they  proposed ""Sino- British joint administration."" All these showed  their reluctance to give up colonial rule and return Hong Kong  to China.    Former British Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher laid bare in her  memoirs Britain's three-step strategy for handling the Hong Kong  issue. First, insisting that Britain enjoy sovereignty over a  part of Hong Kong; second, exchanging sovereignty over Hong Kong  for long-term administrative power; and third, developing a  democratic structure with the aim of granting Hong Kong  independence or autonomy in a short period in the same way they  treated Singapore, if the above two steps proved unworkable.    Before the Chinese people, who had risen to their feet, the  first two steps have gone to the wall, so they are now stepping  up implementation of the third step by taking advantage of their  administrative power. People are now clear that everything,  including the ""representative government system,"" ""the right of  abode in the United Kingdom,"" the ""formation of the court of  final appeal,"" and ""introducing the committee system into the  Legislative Council"" was closely related with to the third step.  What Patten has said and done since he arrived in Hong Kong,  including the ""international card,"" has been designed to  meticulously carry through the third step laid down by the  British Government. This is exactly what is meant by the  Chinese saying: He who has come, has come with ill intent,  certainly not on virtue bent. This is the soft tactic Britain,  which was a great empire over 100 years ago but is now on the  wane, is forced to apply when it can no longer be insufferably  arrogant before the giant in the east--the powerful People's  Republic of China. According to Percy Cradock's memoirs, Mrs  Thatcher once spoke of the need to appoint a politician as the  last Hong Kong governor. This was because only a politician can  achieve a certain political objective; can be impudent and break  his promises; can contradict himself and chop and change; and  can stop at nothing and risk danger in his desperation to carry  out his plan. Patten has acted this way since he came to Hong  Kong. Therefore, Patten's behavior is not personal but reflects  a change in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong.    If anyone says Mr Patten has loafed around and wandered  about  doing nothing since he arrived in Hong Kong, this is unfair.  Over the last two years, making nothing of the hardships, he  has traveled to many countries to enlist support for his  constitutional package in a move to internationalize the Hong  Kong issue. During his recent trip to Australia, apart from  saying that Hong Kong was an ""international asset,"" he claimed  that for various countries to support Hong Kong in expanding  democracy is not equivalent to interfering in China's internal  affairs. He also called on the international community to see  to it that China honor its commitment after 1997 and alleged  that Britain bears a ""moral responsibility"" for Hong Kong, and  so on. All this thoroughly exposes Britain's plan to  internationalize the Hong Kong issue.    Nevertheless, it is internationally accepted that while the  Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and Britain before  1997, it is purely a Chinese internal affair after 1997. So any  attempts by Patten and Britain to make the Hong Kong issue an  international one are doomed to failure.     "

Ratification was completed when Sir Patrick Fairweather, British ambassador to Italy, deposited the necessary instrument at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs just after 3pm. The Foreign Office said the necessary documentation had been sent to Italy by diplomatic bag over the weekend. The move, which made Britain the 11th of the 12 European Community states to ratify the treaty - Germany is the last - marked the end of the road for Tory Euro-sceptics who had fought tenaciously to kill Maastricht off in an epic 18-month parliamentary battle. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will be hoping the government can finally draw a line under what has been an immensely damaging episode for the Conservative party. But Euro-sceptics are already threatening a fresh revolt when the government brings forward legislation implementing an agreement to increase national governments' contributions to the European Commission in November. Euro-sceptic leaders were yesterday in defiant mood with Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford, arguing that Britain should not have ratified a treaty whose heart was 'torn out' with the 'collapse' of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Michael Spicer, the MP for South Worcestershire, said it was 'a matter of supreme irony that on the day that the ERM collapses we ratify a treaty whose objective is to create fixed exchange rates forever, with all the economic misery that this has been seen to entail'. Lord Rees-Mogg's lawyers said he had decided not to appeal against Friday's High Court ruling which rejected his claim that the government was acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without parliamentary approval. Gouldens, his solicitors, said his decision had also been influenced by the ERM crisis which had 'removed one of the key pillars to Maastricht'. It continued: 'In those circumstances, an appeal is not necessary; indeed there is not much of the union treaty left standing.' Lord Rees-Mogg and his backer the international financier, Sir James Goldsmith, had agreed to go no further, Gouldens said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9211 Courts.

President of Coke's northwest European division, he is picking up Great Britain and Ireland (north and south) at the turn of the year. They join France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Denmark in his portfolio. He takes over from Penny Hughes, Coke's president of Great Britain and Ireland, who has decided not to return from maternity leave after her baby arrives in April. One of the highest flying female executives in the UK, Hughes, 35, wants to concentrate for a while on family rather than business commitments. Darby, 38, is moving from Brussels to London to manage his expanded brief. This will be the fourth configuration of countries Coke had managed from London within 10 years, he said. 'We often group divisions around the experience of the leader and I've spent half of my 10 years with Coca-Cola in the UK,' he says. With strong teams of country managers, it is easy to make such shuffles, he added. Born in London and educated at Manchester University, he worked in the UK for Spillers Foods and SC Johnson before joining Coke in 1984. Coke remains the largest single UK grocery brand with grocery sales of about Pounds 260m, according to Nielsen, the market researchers. Darby says the biggest task for him - and indeed Coke anywhere - is to get more people to drink its soft drinks rather than other beverages of any kind. 'Competing for the consumption occasion' is the phrase that gets Coke pulses racing. In per capita consumption terms, the UK and other European countries are still virgin territory for soft drinks compared with the US. Another adrenalin-inducing phrase might be Virgin Cola, launched recently by Richard Branson and Cott Corporation. But Darby says competition helps stimulate the whole market and anyway Coke always gets the lion share of any growth. With Branson likely to have a glass of his own in his hand in every picture, the competition could be brisk. But Darby's not bothered. 'We always feature Coca-Cola as the hero, the star.'

Because Britain was late to join the ERM, 'we were late in the battle against inflation and under Mr Major and Mr Kinnock, we will be late to join a single European currency. But join we must,' he told a rally in Leeds. He is expected to make clear at the weekend that the Liberal Democrats would insist on a more pro-European stance if they were to form a government with either Labour or the Tories. The Liberal Democrat leader will use a trip to Bologne tomorrow, where he will meet other European Liberal party leaders, to set out his party's policy on Europe and indicate how he would use any negotiating muscle he has after April 9 to push for Britain to back a single European currency. Mr Ashdown also heightened yesterday the priority he would attach to Scottish devolution in a hung parliament. 'It is inconceivable that we would agree to a programme for the next parliament which did not include a commitment to legislate for a Scottish parliament,' he said. He described Scottish home rule as 'the first step' in the reform of the UK political system. But he again insisted that law for PR at Westminster remained the overriding condition for a post-election pact. His comments at a press conference in Edinburgh came as opinion polls showed a further slip in Liberal Democrat support in Scotland to 7 per cent compared with 19 per cent at the 1987 general election.

The scare arose after a ruling in the European Court of Justice that the UK government was wrong to deny family credit, which is designed to supplement low incomes, to the wife of a civil servant who worked in Northern Ireland but lived in the Irish Republic. The court held that the UK's arguments would impede freedom of movement for workers - a right that is one of the EC's principal long-term goals. The ruling means that people who travel to work in Britain leaving dependants behind in their home states will be able to claim family credit on behalf of their families. The ruling is believed not to apply to other benefits. 'We are not expecting a flood of successful claims costing the Treasury millions,' The Department of Social Security said. 'You have to be on a low income to qualify for it, and most EC workers either bring their families with them or are single people with no dependants.' The maximum permitted income for a successful claim is at present Pounds 11,180. That would rule out most people from other EC states who work in the UK. A family on that income with one child aged between 16 and 17 would be entitled to Pounds 1.47 a week. Nevertheless, the DSS said it shared the concerns of the German government, which is worried about additional pressure on already tight social security budgets. The DSS said it believed UK nationals working in other member states would not enjoy reciprocal benefits.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

It is the first attempt by ministers and leaders of the pharmaceuticals industry to take advantage of Britain's successful bid to house the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. The agency will manage the European Union's new system of medicines licensing that comes into force next month, and its location in London could prove a magnet for new pharmaceuticals investment. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and a team of senior representatives from the pharmaceuticals industry will visit Japan in March to try to sell the message of Prescribe UK, a joint inward investment campaign being launched by the government and industry today. Mrs Bottomley and the industry team will also travel to the US in the spring, but Japan is seen as the main target for their efforts. She said yesterday: 'We have to demonstrate that the factors which have led to successful Japanese manufacturing investment in the UK apply even more strongly to pharmaceuticals.' Britain's drugs industry is already substantial by world standards, and includes many subsidiaries of overseas companies. The UK market for medicines totalled Pounds 4.9bn last year, while 10 of the world's top 35 prescribed medicines were discovered and developed in the UK. Britain accounts for about 12 per cent of the international export market in medicines, and a third of all European biotechnology companies are located in the UK. The Prescribe UK team believes Britain has extra advantages to offer pharmaceutical investors that are sometimes overlooked. These include the National Health Service - the world's biggest healthcare organisation - which by its size offers unique opportunities for research and teaching in the use of new drug techniques. Mrs Bottomley said: 'The government worked with the industry to win the medicines evaluation agency for Britain. Many of the arguments that helped our success in that campaign, like our excellent communications and the use of English as the international language of the pharmaceuticals industry, also make a strong case for greater inward investment in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.'

His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall over how US policy on Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton. Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK so long as that is backed by a majority of its population. Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start political talks, in-volving Unionists, nationalists, the British and Irish government after the local elections in the province on May 19. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less specific role. As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Molyneaux raised proposals set out in his 'Blueprint for Stability' on Northern Ireland - an agenda that accepts the case for a new assembly in the province but says that, in its absence, the government should improve local democracy. Sir Patrick has not visited the US before as secretary of state and is keen to meet members of the Clinton's administration. On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston he will meet members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media. Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. There is also concern in London about the possibility of the US granting visas to leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, for propaganda trips.

They say Britain, by propounding such a claim, thinks it can  ruin relations between Iran and Europe.    International relations analyst Farhad Azimi, in his  interview on Wednesday, says that by alleging an Iranian link to  the Northern Ireland issue, London intends to give plausibility  to its age-old hostile propaganda against Islamic Iran.    ""Prime Minister John Major would do better to realize the  realities in Iran and discontinue London's efforts at  antagonizing Europe with Iran, and watch out against playing  into the hands of certain notorious elements,"" he added.    According to Azimi, the Islamic Republic must revise its  relations with those governments that are unable to realize the  factual realities in Iran.    College professor and Britain-watcher Dr. Reza Farahmandi  told IRNA today that since the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the British Government has consistently pursued a  fraudulent policy in its dealings with Iran.    He said British arms sales to Iraq during the almost eight  years of the Iraqi war (1980-88) against Iran, Britain's aids to  the terrorist grouplets with the idea of them subverting the  Iranian Government as well as the recent voicing of such  irrelevant claims as Iran having collaborated with the Irish  Republican Army (IRA) are all typical examples of Britain's  schemes for waging a political war with the Islamic republic.    ""The triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 in  fact ended the history of foreign domination in Iran as well as  any cause for succumbing to any foreign pressure for yielding to  external threats,"" he added.    Dr. Farahmandi said another goal behind the scheme is for  the  British Government to divert attention from the shabby state of  affairs at home and direct public attention outside of England.    He commented that Iran's lobbying at international forums  for  the aggressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its exposure of  grim realities about the discriminative polices of Britain,  Europe and the U.S. against the continent's native Muslim  population, has raised doubts about London's claims of  commitment to human rights and other international conventions  that disallow the massacre of innocent people of whatsoever  religious faith, origin and race.

The plan indicates that the United States may agree  to the withdrawal of all the 12 million barrels of oil from the  pipeline on the condition that Ankara ""temporarily"" use 100  percent of the profit from its sale.    Considering Iraq's sensitive approach on the embargo,  however, Ankara wishes to resolve the pipeline problem in a way  that will also be acceptable to Baghdad. Any consensus between  Turkey and the UN Security Council must also take into account  Baghdad's approach. It will be recalled that Iraq has rejected  the UN condition for the sale of $1.6 billion worth of oil on  grounds that it infringes on its sovereignty.    Only 3.8 million barrels of the oil in the pipeline belongs  to Turkey. There is no problem on how Turkey's share will be  used after it is drained. However, 60 percent of the profit to  be made from the sale of the remaining 8.2 million barrels of  oil will have to be transferred to the fund which will be under  UN control. Another 30 percent will be registered with the UN as  profit. Meanwhile, the remaining 10 percent will be used to  provide humanitarian aid to Iraq.    The United States wishes to block any approach that may be  regarded as violating the embargo on Iraq. In view of that, it  seems that it is prepared to have Turkey use the profit from the  sale of the 8.2 million barrels of oil and pay it back to the UN  later on the basis of the 60-30-10 percent formula. However,  Britain has informed Washington that it is opposed to that  approach. It called for the use of only 60 percent of the profit  to be made from the sale of all the oil in the pipeline.    Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs Bilgin Unan has  held talks with British officials on the pipeline problem. He  has left Britain for Moscow after being informed that London  will agree in principle to the removal of the oil in the  pipeline.     "

Sir David opened the CBI debate on UK economic recovery by saying the government could not 'go soft' on inflation, but it should cease to be the dominant theme of policy. He told delegates: 'The battle we need to win now is against the lack of confidence which is holding back growth and investment in the UK economy'. He called for a package of measures in the Autumn Statement to release the economy from 'the grip of a vicious recession that shows little sign of abating'. Sir David indicated that the CBI has decided to press for the improvement of investment allowances. He said next year threatened to be the fourth consecutive year when investment in plant and machinery would be lower than in the previous year. The CBI is thus renewing its call for depreciation allowances to be doubled to 40 per cent. Sir David said the move would involve no fiscal cost in 1993-94. The later impact on public finances would be 'a price worth paying'. He emphasised that, if the government found it necessary to raise taxes to cut borrowing, tax increases for the business sector had to be avoided if Britain was to emerge from recession. Continuing divisions of opinion on the value of higher investment allowances were reflected in the debate. Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive of Rentokil, the environmental and property group, rejected the 'old chestnut' of allowances, pointing out that Britain now had the benefit of what was in effect a devaluation in the currency of 15 per cent and the lowest interest rates in Europe. Mr Thompson, who voiced fears that further big cuts in interest rates would stoke inflationary pressures, called instead for lower rates of corporate tax to encourage entrepreneurs and small businesses to expand and create jobs. Mr Andrew Buxton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, said Britain should still aim to rejoin the ERM once the economy had improved and stabilised. He asked whether any company seriously believed that a 15 per cent devaluation, with the consequent threat of a rise in inflation, could be good for the UK in the longer term. However, it could kick-start the economy. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth of John Livingston, the north-east engineering group, said industry needed a clear statement of government economic objectives and a long-term commitment to help rebuild Britain's industrial base. His view was echoed by many other speakers in the debate, but none went as far as Mr Alf Gooding, chairman of the Gooding investment and management group, who called for a coalition government united by a single objective - the revival of the British economy.

He said in a communique that he regretted that ""a technical  issue, the size of the blocking minority, destroys our joy at  seeing Norway join the other countries (Austria, Finland and  Sweden) that have signed agreements on procedures for their  admission to the EU.""    Britain, with some backing from Spain, demands that the  entry  of those four countries should not dilute the ability of bigger  EU members to block decisions they do not like.    Currently, 23 out of 76 votes divided up among the present  12  members are enough to block majority-approved decisions. Most  members want to maintain this 30 percent level, but Britain and  Spain think this would go against their interests, since those  two countries could no longer combine with one smaller member to  constitute a blocking minority. Other members favor a shift to  27 out of 90 votes.    The Danish prime minister said that Denmark could not agree  with the British stand ""because a successful conclusion to  enlargement (of the community) is an absolute condition for  letting the European Union meet the next and decisive challenge:  integration of the new democracies in Central and East Europe.    ""The future of Europe is at stake here, neither more nor  less. We expect the British Government to recognize the fact  that the next meeting of (EU) foreign ministers, in Brussels on  March 22, is really becoming a last-chance meeting.""    Earlier in the day, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen called the British stand ""untenable,"" adding that ""I  don't like to use the word `crisis,' which has been overused in  the past, but this time the EU really finds itself in a deep  crisis"" because of the British demand.    Opposition leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, a former foreign  minister, joined the criticism, saying that ""It is  incomprehensible that Great Britain has chosen to isolate itself  in a corner by adopting an indefensible attitude that weakens  the power of decision of a Europe enlarged by several members.    ``The British cannot at the same time be firm advocates of  enlargement and make the EU's decision-making process even more  difficult.''

'It seems to me likely that it will fall to be resolved by the European Court of Justice at the end of the day,' he said. He added that the European Commission was proposing to extend the use of such assessments to cover proposals and policies put forward by EC governments. An announcement on the new proposals extending the principle to governments will be made in two weeks' time, he said. At present the directive applies only to large individual projects. 'It is now clear that this is not enough. It is essential that policies, plans and programmes are also subjected to environmental impact assessment.' He envisaged that this would also apply to EC policy at a later date. Mr Ripa di Meana renewed his strong criticism of the British government for pressing ahead with large schemes which he had asked to be suspended because environmental assessments had not been properly made. The reaction of the British government and some parts of the British media 'have left a bitter taste in my mouth,' he said. 'There has been absolutely no victimisation of the United Kingdom, no singling out to the exclusion of other member states.'

Britain had wanted the option of dumping the Royal Navy's  decommissioned nuclear submarines on the sea bed. There are  already six out-of-action vessels, and by the end of the century  a further 11 are expected to be taken out of service.    But with three days to run before a treaty deadline expires,  Mrs Shephard said that the UK would accept a formal ban under  the London Convention. When 45 countries met in London last  November a large majority voted for the ban, but Britain,  France, Belgium, China and Russia reserved the right to file an  objection by 21 February and ignore it. Belgium and France have  since sided with the ban.    In a written answer to Labour's environment spokesman, Chris  Smith, Mrs Shephard said Britain had not dumped any radioactive  waste from ships since 1983. The UK was already committed to a  moratorium on sea dumping until 2008 under a different treaty.    ""The scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea, carried  out under controlled conditions, causes no harm to the marine  environment and poses no threat to human health,"" she said.  ""This has been confirmed by careful monitoring over many years  and studies have shown it to be the best practicable  environmental option for the disposal of certain types of  radioactive waste.""    ""Nevertheless, the UK recognises that the weight of  international opinion on this matter means that such dumping is  not, in any event, a practical proposition. We have, therefore,  decided to accept the ban,"" the minister added.    Mrs Shephard pointed out that there would be a scientific  re-evaluation of the ban in 25 years. ""The UK will be ready to  reopen discussions in the Convention at any time, should the  weight of opinion change in favour of accepting the scientific  conclusions.""    Bridget Woodman, a Greenpeace campaigner, said: ""It's a bit  of good news. But if they can bow to international pressure on  radioactive waste dumping, why can't they respond to all the  international concern about the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant  and stop it from opening?""

He pointed out that most of the species that have existed on the planet are already extinct - the difference is that in the past 100 years the rate of extinctions has been 100 to 1,000 times as fast as it is in the fossil record. In Britain there have been some isolated successes, such as the reintroduction of the red kite and the sea eagle. But many other species were in danger of extinction. Farmland birds such as the tree sparrow, the linnet and the partridge are in precipitous decline, and a host of insects and invertebrates are vanishing fast, he said. Dr Jeremy Thomas of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology told the conference that if present trends continued, one third of the UK's butterfly species would disappear within 50 years. Prof May, one of the world's leading population biologists, said the main species under threat in the UK were birds and invertebrates. Most of the mammals remaining in Britain were safe from extinction, although most of the really exciting ones which once lived in the UK - such as the wolf, the beaver and the bear - had been extinct for hundreds of years. Prof May said there were proposals to reintroduce wolves on the island of Rum, in the Inner Hebrides, where there were enough free-living deer to support a viable wolf population. Beavers, which would improve several wetland habitats could be introduced on a much wider scale. However, at present there were no definite plans to reintroduce either species. According to Professor John Lawton of Imperial College in London, our present nature reserves are 'too few, too isolated, and frequently too poorly managed' to allow effective conservation. The decline in the butterfly population is as severe in nature reserves as it is elsewhere.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9512 Land, Mineral, Wildlife Conservation.

The  authorised Beijing version told a story of imperial cunning, in  which Britain's whole conspiratorial purpose had been to prolong  her influence through delayed-action detonation of chaos  wherever the Queen's writ had once run. Now, allegedly, we are  doing the same in Hong Kong.    It's a bizarre view of our colonial history: a history in  which we laid down the imperial burden with so little fuss and  such genial intentions to install and safeguard the institutions  of a plural society.    In Hong Kong, we are bringing the story almost to an end.  Hong Kong, of course, is unlike our other colonies. Though no  one could doubt the capacity of this great city, it has never  enjoyed the prospect of independence. History and geography  have spelt out another future, the assumption of Chinese  sovereignty in 1997. This has determined and constrained  political and institutional development in the territory. While  it has been governed under the eyes of Parliament at  Westminster, its own democratic evolution has been limited by  its historic destination. In the 1940s and 1950s, proposals  that would have given Hong Kong similar democratic institutions  to those being established elsewhere in our Empire were rudely  halted by noises from the north which warned against any  political course of action which might encourage the community  to think that it could determine its own future.    So democracy was never really on the agenda until we came to  negotiate the terms of the transfer of sovereignty. At the  heart of those negotiations was the promise that, while China's  flag would be run up over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, the  community itself would enjoy a high degree of autonomy and would  keep its way of life. 'One country, two systems' was Deng  Xiaoping's vision--a goal which Hong Kong and Britain could  readily share.    The Joint Declaration -- the treaty signed by Britain and  China -- spelt out Hong Kong's freedoms and values and the way  to secure them. It promised an executive answerable to the  legislature, and a legislature wholly composed through election.  Admittedly, it did not say those elections should be open and  fair. Could anyone at the negotiating table have thought  otherwise? Nor did it spell out how these elections should be  conducted.    Here lies the nub of our present argument with China. Some  people--including almost every directly elected legislator  here-- think we should be arguing with China about quickening  the pace of democracy in Hong Kong. I understand why they think  this, but do not believe that this would have been a possible  option so late in the day. The principle of a growing degree of  democracy is already agreed with China, and set out in the Basic  Law--China's mini- constitution for Hong Kong after 1997. What  we are in effect debating is whether or not the agreed process  of democratisation should be credible and fair. It was with  that aim that we put forward in October 1992 very modest  proposais (which we were always willing to discuss with China)  on the detailed electoral arrangements for Hong Kong in 1994 and  1995.    Let me summarise where we are, just over a year after we  first put forward these ideas. We did not dream up this issue  at the last moment. By mid-1992, the precise voting  arrangements for the last elections under British sovereignty  had not been agreed, presumably because they were extremely  difficult. According to independent legal advisers giving  evidence to the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, our  plans are wholly consistent with Britain's agreements and  understandings with China. In over 160 hours of talks with  Beijing, we have offered conditionally to change our proposals  but have seen no similar offer of concession or accommodation  from the other side of the table. Now, with time running out  and the first of a three-part series of elections less than a  year away, we have introduced legislation to deal with the least  contentious parts of our plan. Despite Chinese hostility to a  course of action which they know is necessary to meet the  legislative timetable, we still want to continue negotiating  about the more awkward items of the electoral arrange ments on  which, alas, no progress has been made in seven months of  negotiation.    Through a year of harsh statements from Beijing, the  majority  of people in Hong Kong have remained calm and supportive of our  approach. And opinion in Britain -- in Parliament and outside  it -- has remained largely supportive, too. But some criticisms  have been raised--as you would expect in an open and free  society--both in Britain and Hong Kong.    First, there are those who argue that somehow our  difficulties with China all coincided with the arrival of the  author as Governor of Hong Kong. I acknowledge that I have a  vested interest here, but have to beg to differ. It is no  criticism at all of my predecessor to point out that the log-jam  of issues in the Joint Liaison Group, and the difficulties over  Hong Kong's new airport, pre-dated my hatless disembarkation.  Indeed, most would say that the current uneasy relationship  with China goes back to Tiananmen Square and the reaction of  Hong Kong people to that event.    Second, some contend that we should not imperil the wider  Sino-British relationship -- particularly the trade relationship  --by disagreements with China over Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is  the largest single component in that relationship, and the most  important one. Our responsibilities to Hong Kong's citizens  must come first. In the longer term, our standing in China and  Asia is likely to be strongly affected by how decently we  undertake our responsibilities in Hong Kong. There is no  reason, in any case, why disagreements over Hong Kong should  affect the wider relationship. China would be foolish indeed if,  as she seeks to enter the Gatt, she were to choose to  discriminate against British trade. China's President Jiang  Zemin rightly argued to President Clinton at their recent summit  that politics and trade should be kept separate; what's true in  Seattle is just as true in Beijing.    Nor should we think that there is an arithmetical  relationship between diplomatic harmony and economic benefits,  desirable as both may be. From the mid-Eighties until last  year, we actually saw a steady fall in our exports to China and  a rise in China's exports to Britain. A surplus for Britain has  turned into a two-to-one surplus for China. In 1993, at last,  our exports actually started to rise sharply again.    Third, some people suggest (a touch undiplomatically) that  China is capable of behaving thuggishly if she doesn't get her  own way; and that we should therefore do whatever she wants  after a suitably decorous effort to put our own point of view.  If necessary, we can always mask retreat on a matter of  substance with some gracefully opaque form of words. You don't  have to summon from history craven examples of this attitude to  reject it. We have responsibilities to Hong Kong. They are  incorporated in the Joint Declaration. When ministers signed  the Joint Declaratio n-- and Parliament endorsed it -- they took  the view, reasonably enough, that it meant what it so eloquently  said. The gradual development of democracy in Hong Kong has  been a consistent aim of the British Government since 1984. As  Richard Luce put it in the House of Commons in December that  year: `We all fully accept that we should build up a firmly  based democratic administration in Hong Kong in the years  between now and 1997.' Or as Geoffrey Howe expressed it in  1989: `We have always sought to develop representative  government in line with the wishes of the community as a whole  and to ensure that what is achieved under British administration  is firm and durable.' I take that view too, and am trying to  make sure this treaty, to which Britain put her name, is  implemented--to the letter and in the spirit.    Fourth, it is argued that if only we weren't having today's  argument with China, all in Hong Kong would be peace and  harmony. But how much stability would we have earned ourselves  through a rotten deal which compromised Hong Kong's electoral  arrangements? We could have spent our last years of sovereignty  defending the indefensible against every pro-democracy  politician in Hong Kong and against critical or cynical opinion  at Westminster and world-wide. Events between now and 1997 would  have made life increasingly uncomfortable for a government which  would have lost its authority.    Fifth, there is the patronising argument that people in Hong  Kong are only interested in money; that they don't care about  democracy; and that clean elections are irrelevant to Hong  Kong's long-term prosperity as her economy converges with that  of the Chinese hinterland.    Naturally, Hong Kong families want peace and quiet, like  families everywhere else. But whenever they have been given the  chance they have voted for more democracy, not less. Their  aspirations are modest and they are moderately expressed, yet  they clearly recognise that what makes Hong Kong special, what  makes it unique, is the rule of law and the freedoms of a plural  society. A decently elected legislature is a part of that  fabric. If there is no level playing- field for the  legislature, what chance of a level playing-field elsewhere --  in business, for example? The promise that Hong Kong people  will run Hong Kong after 1997, with a substantial degree of  autonomy, hardly squares with efforts to install an electoral  system which would give Beijing tight control.    We hear one other argument against behaving decently. It  tends to come from those who used to urge Britain to stand  taller for democracy, until, that is, China started to shout the  odds. What matters, we are told, is freedom not democracy --  freedom of speech, freedom of economic choice, freedom under the  law. Standing up for fair elections may risk these freedoms.    But what sort of freedom would Hong Kong have if its  citizens  didn't have the freedom to make a real choice in the  polling-booth? What fair economic choice is there when there is  no fearless legislative opponent of corruption? Can we really  expect freedom of speech and of the press to survive long if  there is no freedom to express political views in a fairly  elected legislature? It is not the argument for democracy which  these critics regard as a step too far, but the determination to  stand up for Hong Kong.    We will continue to try to persuade the Chinese to return to  the negotiating table. If we fail, we shall have to work out  with the people of Hong Kong, through the Legislative Council,  the best arrangements for securing limited democracy. We won't  be able to go further than they are prepared to go, but nor  should we go less far. Of course, it is true that we could put  in place arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 elections and see  them cast aside by China after 1997 in its first act of  sovereignty. Beijing officials last month once again threatened  to do precisely this--in blatant contradiction of their own  post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong. But the argument that  China may act against Hong Kong's interests (and its own) in the  future cannot be a persuasive argument for us to do the same  today. Moreover, if we have a credible system, why should China  want to remove from elected office in 1997 men and women who  will have been elected by their fellow citizens? This is hardly  the best way of winning hearts and minds.    Hong Kong has been a spectacular success story--largely the  result of Shanghainese and Cantonese entrepreneurialism combined  with the values of a plural society. Provided this combination  survives the transition through 1997, Hong Kong should be  uniquely placed to contribute further to China's successful  opening up to the world. Hong Kong should be able to play a  similar role for China at the beginning of the next century to  that played by New York for the United States at the opening of  this one. It is set to be the merchant bank and the business  centre for the region; if, that is, China learns to trust Hong  Kong and not to treat it with truculent suspicion.    In the next three and a half years, we still have to try to  dispel that cloud of suspicion while China itself is going  through a period of accelerating change. That task will not be  easy. I believe we can do it, so long as we are prepared when  necessary to stand up for Hong Kong and not assume that its  interests in either the short or long term are best served by  bending to every wind from the north.

But in a withering attack on the prime minister from the floor of the Conservative conference, Lord Tebbit threatened to plunge the party into civil war. After a heated debate in Brighton which also saw Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warn Tory activists that the party could 'break itself' over the issue, the prime minister won a four-to-one majority. Senior colleagues said Mr Major was now determined to bring the Maastricht legislation back to the House of Commons by the end of this month, even if the detailed examination of the bill had to be deferred until early next year. But during the angriest exchanges seen at a Tory conference for more than a decade, Lord Tebbit exposed the divisions which have dogged the Conservatives since they forced the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's resignation two years ago. In a vituperative performance which played to the nationalism of the Tory party faithful, Lord Tebbit threatened at one point to turn the conference against Mr Major. More than a third of the representatives rose to their feet to cheer his demand that: 'This conference wants policies for Britain first, Britain second and Britain third.' In scenes reminiscent of the battles over Rhodesia which engulfed the Conservatives during the 1970s, Lord Tebbit delivered a stark warning to Mr Major that his battle with the party's Euro-sceptics would be protracted and bloody. As Mr Major sat grimly on the conference platform, Lord Tebbit won a standing ovation from large sections of the audience for a speech which derided the prime minister's economic policy and flatly condemned Maastricht. His intervention followed a similar attack on Maastricht earlier in the day by Mr Kenneth Baker. The former home secretary, who has now emerged at the head of opposition to the treaty in the House of Commons, said he would vote against the agreement that he had backed as a cabinet minister. The Euro-sceptics' stance was comprehensively rebutted by Mr Hurd in what was widely judged as a brilliant speech. It won him a standing ovation from many of the same representatives who had cheered Lord Tebbit. Mr Hurd warned that any move to renege on Maastricht would shove Britain and its government on to the 'sidelines' of Europe: 'Let us decide to give that madness a miss'. The foreign secretary announced that alongside the declaration on 'minimum interference' or 'subsidiarity' expected from the EC summit in Birmingham next week, Mr Major was seeking a commitment from his European counterparts to much greater openness in decision-making. Last night Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, joined the fray on the side of the prime minister by pouring scorn on the 'blind alley' into which opponents of Maastricht wanted to lead Britain. The government would no longer have a voice in international affairs if it opted for 'splendid political isolation'. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Clarke stressed that Maastricht would lead the Community not in the direction of a European 'superstate' but along the road of decentralisation and enlargement in the Community. He insisted that the government was winning the argument over the future direction of Europe. Senior ministers said the government had been shaken by the force of Lord Tebbit's attack. But it had also reinforced Mr Major's determination to use his closing address on Friday to reinforce his support for the treaty. That would follow a speech tomorrow by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, setting out the central planks of the economic policy which will replace the European exchange rate mechanism.

The work, unveiled at this week's Royal Show, England's biggest agricultural event, involves genetic engineering of rape varieties to change the mixture of oils they contain. If the research results in commercial production it could reduce dependence on imports of coconut and palm oil for detergent manufacture. Britain imports 400,000 tonnes of these oils a year. 'We're to all intents and purposes growing palm trees at Aberdeen,' said Mr Kerr Walker, an agronomist with the college's Agro-Industrial Research Services unit in north-east Scotland. Oilseed rape is one of the most important crops grown in the UK for industrial purposes, which means it can be cultivated on land that farmers are paid to take out of food production. Last year, 500,000 hectares of arable land were set aside in the UK, a figure that could double by 2000. At present only erucic acid is available from rapeseed. This is used in specialised industrial detergents, but is becoming better known as an agent for making polythene wrapping malleable. Calgene, which developed the non-rotting 'Flavr Savr' tomato, has asked the Scottish researchers to investigate varieties with high lauric acid content, which produces oils similar to coconut and palm oil. 'There's interest from other companies,' said Mr Walker. 'They really would like to get their hands on these materials. But the varieties are very definitely Calgene's property and have been patented.' He said the oils could be on the market in North America next year, according to the American Oil Chemists Society. Their commercial development in Britain depends on the gradual relaxation of Department of Environment regulations on the release of genetically engineered organisms. It also requires public acceptance that stringent precautions have been taken to ensure such releases are safe. The genetic engineering involves slotting a small piece of genetic information into the plant cell, which then produces a different oil type. Mr Walker said: 'It's absolutely vital the public are kept informed about this and that it's done slowly and sensitively'.   Companies:-  Calgene Inc.

0,FT942-9655 ,"FT942-9655 _AN-EEPB4ACMFT 940514   FT  14 MAY 94 / Facts fall victim to the butcher's knife: Quentin Peel and Alison Maitland examine the dispute over British beef exports to Germany      By QUENTIN PEEL and ALISON MAITLAND   The sign pasted up over the meat counter in the Stussgen supermarket in a Bonn suburb this week said it all. 'Buying meat is a matter of trust,' it declared. 'We sell only German quality beef.' To any German consumer, the message is clear: it means there is no British beef on the counter. For in the minds of most German consumers in recent weeks, the words British beef have become synonymous with a fear of human infection with 'mad cow disease' - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The Bonn butcher was relaxed enough: 'I've been getting questions from my customers all right, wanting to know where the beef was from. But since we have had the sign up, I think they have been reassured. They know we only sell fresh local meat.' Yet statistics for all beef sales in Germany in recent weeks suggest otherwise. The German wholesale meat traders' association claimed yesterday there had been 'a dramatic slump in sales'. The butchers' federation in Frankfurt said the decline was at least 5 per cent in the past few weeks, since Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, first suggested that a selective ban on British beef imports was needed to protect the public against the threat of BSE. The row threatens to blow up into a serious confrontation, not just between Britain and Germany, but also between Germany and the rest of the European Union. The European Commission has until now accepted that Britain has done enough to control BSE, and prevent any danger of its spreading to other member states. It is considering tougher enforcement, but nothing so drastic as an import ban. Yet that is what Germany is threatening to enact unilaterally if there is no compromise agreed by agriculture ministers by May 30. The battle over BSE looks like becoming a classic reconfirmation of national prejudices in Britain and Germany: the former complaining of German fanaticism and high-handedness, the latter of sloppy British standards in vital areas of public health and environmental awareness. Yet the experts on both sides are far more divided than the battle-lines suggest. In Germany, the farmers' union has sharply criticised Mr Seehofer for threatening to go it alone in his battle with Brussels. They fear that the backlash will hit far more important interests - like their campaign for more money from Brussels for German farmers who have been forced to slaughter some 800,000 pigs because of swine fever in the past six months. There is also a widespread recognition that German consumers are notoriously prone to overreaction in anything concerning food health - an overreaction compounded when politicians get involved. On the other hand, in Britain there are a number of scientists who would support the German health minister in his contention that as long as there is the slightest possibility that BSE might cause human infection, the strictest possible controls should be enforced. In spite of the BSE scare, total British beef exports rose 51 per cent last year to Pounds 407m, which the British Meat and Livestock Commission attributes to successful marketing and the devaluation of sterling. Some Pounds 355m of that went to the EU, with France by far the largest importer  -to the tune of Pounds 189m - and Germany the smallest, taking only 900 tonnes, worth Pounds 2.6m. The British government says the German debate has not only hit beef exports  -they totalled 2,000 tonnes to Germany in 1992 - but lamb and pork sales as well. But the real British concern is the domestic beef market, which earned British farmers Pounds 1.85bn last year. German observers are quick to point out the irony of the situation. 'I am amazed that even while there are thousands of animals still being slaughtered in the UK because of BSE, the British consumer does not appear to be concerned,' said Mr Richard Brucker, head of the livestock section in the German farmers' union (DBV). 'Yet here in Germany, where we really don't have the problem at all, the consumers are all up in arms. It's quite contradictory.' The BSE scare in Germany is only the latest in a string of food health scares. One of the most startling was the thread worm crisis which threatened to devastate the German fish market in 1987: a single television programme suggesting that fresh fish contained live worms when they got to the fishmonger's slab caused a dramatic slump in consumption. Per capita, the level dropped from 13.2 kg in 1986 to 11.8 kg in 1987, as panic spread through the fish-buying public. 'There was an hysterical outcry to begin with,' said Mr Matthias Keller, chief executive of the Hamburg-based fishing industry association. 'But the consumers listened to reason in the end.' That was not until the European Commission, the German government, and the industry had launched a big and costly public relations exercise. Another good example of Germany's special sensitivity was over the fall-out from Chernobyl. Watercress growing along the German bank of the river Rhine was torn up and destroyed. The same plant on the French bank was cheerfully harvested and sold - some of it to Germany. BSE looks to be another case where Germany is determined to be stricter than all its neighbouring states. Mr Brucker blames politicians in general, and Mr Seehofer in particular. 'He has set himself up as the great consumer's protector,' he said. 'But he is risking his neck in this confrontation with the Brussels Commission.' If Mr Seehofer is under attack on his home front, Mrs Gillian Shephard and the British Agriculture Ministry are also open to criticism. Dr Stephen Dealler, a microbiologist at York District Hospital who has researched BSE, says the Germans are right to want to take action to protect their consumers. 'If you sit and wait, you're taking a risk of unknown proportions,' he said. 'The Germans are saying 'We're not going to take this risk, it's too high.' They're right.' Scientific tests on other animal species and his own calculations, based on agriculture ministry and other scientific data, suggested the risk that BSE could cross the 'species barrier' from cows to humans was high, he said. Cattle become infected when very young but the incubation period is four to seven years, he said. The risk of infection grows as the incubation period advances. 'For every cow we're slaughtering with the disease, we're eating five to six others while they're incubating it but showing no signs of it,' he added. Now it is up to the EU agriculture ministers to find a compromise. They will be hard put to do so. For the real difference between Britain and Germany is not about scientific evidence. It is about different public perceptions of what constitutes a food danger to health. It is a question of culture, not of fact.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said continued low inflation and faltering retail sales left Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, 'no economic reason not to cut' rates. Setting out Labour's pre-Budget document, Mr Brown said it was 'totally wrong' for the chancellor to postpone a cut in rates until after the Budget. He also urged the government to extend capital allowances for investment, offer grants to help small businesses boost investment and develop new technology, and set up a task force to accelerate private involvement in infrastructure projects. The document - Rebuilding Britain - sets out a 10-point plan to create jobs, including the phased release of local authority capital receipts for homebuilding and a one-year holiday from national insurance contributions for employers recruiting the long-term unemployed. Mr Brown said the government faced a choice between allowing the Budget to continue the 'short-term stop-go economics of drift' and implementing radical measures to boost investment. Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, said there was a growing consensus that tax on investment spending was not fair at the moment. He said the government's refusal to allow tax relief for investment financed from retained earnings had an impact on investment proposals equivalent to up to 2 percentage points on interest rates. Mr Smith called for the government to start urgent consultations on the tax treatment of investment to establish a consensus on reform. Labour would undertake a consultative review involving industry, commerce and professional organisations to draw up options for government action. He added: 'If a significant increase in productive and profitable business investment could be secured by reform, as studies have suggested, every effort must be made to bring it about . . . It is important that as wide as possible a consensus is established on the best way ahead.' Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said government attempts to involve private capital in infrastructure projects had been a spectacular failure. She said 'a real sense of urgency' was required to identify projects which were in the national interest.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-16269 ,"FT944-16269 _AN-EJND7AB3FT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives at Bournemouth: Brittan and Howe hit back on EU      By JAMES BLITZ   Two of the leading pro-Europeans in the Conservative party yesterday hit back at calls from rightwing Tories for Britain to distance itself from Europe, arguing that this could lead to the government's defeat at the next general election. In another sign of the divisions over the European Union which have resurfaced at this week's conference, Sir Leon Brittan, one of the UK's European commissioners, and Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, angrily denounced a recent string of attacks on Brussels by the right of the party. They were joined last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who reasserted his call for Britain's place to remain at the heart of Europe. Sir Leon, addressing a fringe meeting of the Conservative Group for Europe, issued a thinly veiled attack on Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, describing his recent call for Britain to leave the EU as 'damaging and dangerous'. He said: 'People have been indulging in fantasy. If things go on in this way, we are on the road to extremism and xenophobia'. He did not refer by name to Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, who made a powerful attack on the EU in his conference speech this week. However, Sir Leon warned that there were leading anti-Europeans in the party who did not admit that they wanted the UK to leave Europe, 'but who are acting to pull us in that direction whether they say so or not'. In a speech to the Tory Reform Group last night Lord Howe attacked Mr Lamont's 'complacent assertions' about Europe and mocked calls by rightwing Tories for the adoption of a clear anti-European stance against Labour. 'Wrapping ourselves in the union jack would simply be a prelude to burial at sea, in clear blue water, somewhere out in the mid-Atlantic,' he said. He added that any move to reduce the UK's links with Europe would not be accepted by the British people or by industry. 'There is no majority in Britain for isolation or independence on those terms, however deceptively packaged in the Europhobes' rhetoric of self-government,' he said. Both speeches added to speculation that the party could face a serious split in the run up to the European inter-governmental conference in 1996, which will map out the EU's institutional structure. However, Lord Howe also argued that the party was on the verge of a tough internal battle over how to respond to Mr Tony Blair's recent election as Labour leader, and that it would be dangerous to move any further to the right. In the first admission by a senior Tory figure of the threat posed by the Labour leader, Lord Howe said that Mr Blair's election 'could prove the most important political event in the last two decades'. He added: 'Its long-range effect could rank with Margaret Thatcher's re-definition of the centre ground in 1975-79 as one of those periodic shifts that radically alter the terms of political debate in Britain. 'The best way of meeting and beating the Blair challenge is emphatically not by pressing on regardless to the right,' he said. 'Establishing as much clear blue water between ourselves and Labour is the Pavlovian response of a party on a suicide mission.' Mr Heseltine, in a speech to a fringe meeting, listed what he called Britain's clear interests and objectives in the EU's development. 'We must recognise that the European Union is here, is going to remain and has been responsible for an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity on our continent,' he said.

Thus, cooperation between  China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue became completely  impossible, and the door to reopening the talks was tightly  closed by the British side. The Chinese side solemnly stated  that the three-tiered political structure formed according to  the legislation of the British Hong Kong authorities under the  condition of no agreement being reached by the Chinese side and  the British side would not be extended beyond 30 June 1997. At  that time, the Chinese side would reorganize the three-tiered  political structure according to the Basic Law and the Joint  Declaration in order to realize the political ideal of ""one  country, two systems"" and Hong Kong people's exercise of  administration in Hong Kong.    Yesterday, at the party to celebrate the coming of the new  spring held by the Preliminary Work Committee for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administration  Region, State Council Premier Li Peng made an explicit  statement. He said that, henceforth, the Preliminary Work  Committee would shoulder heavier duties and play a more  important role. This indicated that the transitional period in  Hong Kong had entered a new stage.    Yesterday, Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, also announced in  Beijing that, because the British side deviated from cooperation  with the Chinese side, the Chinese side had no other option but  to ""build another kitchen"" according to the provisions of the  Basic Law and the Joint Declaration.    That is to say, before China resumes sovereignty over Hong  Kong on 1 July 1997, each of the two sides may go its own way  and do what it likes in shaping Hong Kong's political structure  in the remaining transitional period of some three years. The  British Hong Kong Government will adopt Patten's original  package, while the Chinese side will rely on the Preliminary  Work Committee and other institutions to unite the vast majority  of Hong Kong compatriots to make preparations in all fields for  Hong Kong's return to China strictly in accordance with the  spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.  It is expected that the work in this period will be arduous and  difficult, but it is also a sacred task of which we are proud.    In the fierce dispute between the Chinese side and the  British side, the Hong Kong compatriots have gradually come to  clearly see the fact that Britain has never been willing to  honestly return sovereignty over Hong Kong to China. After the  4 June incident in 1989, the British Government changed its  policy and appointed Patten the last British governor of Hong  Kong. Patten then dished out his constitutional reform package  and had no scruples about taking the out-and-out ""three  violations"" path in an attempt to plant pro-British forces in  the political structure at all levels beyond 1997 and thus  influence the administration of the Special Administrative  Region [SAR] so that the future SAR Government might become an  extension of the British Hong Kong Government. This was only a  pipe dream of the old colonialists, and it was certain to fall  through.    The Sino-British Joint Declaration has been in force for  over  eight years. In theory, the signing of the Joint Declaration  indicated the beginning of the transitional period of Hong  Kong's return to China. As long as China and Britain acted  according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law, they would certainly be able to harmoniously  cooperate and jointly maintain Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity, thus effecting a smooth transition. By doing this,  Britain would also be able to wash away its dirty name of being  the last colonialist in the world; moreover, this would be the  beginning of a new stage of long-term friendly cooperation  between China and Britain. The British authorities did not want  to act in this manner, however. Being represented by Patten,  they retrogressed from their cooperative position across the  board and obstructed China's efforts to resume sovereignty over  Hong Kong. Patten even traveled to Europe, America, and Oceania  to encourage the Western powers to interfere in Hong Kong  affairs in order to politically internationalize Hong Kong's  position. This further laid bare the British authorities'  unwillingness to return Hong Kong to China.    If the so-called ""democrats"" who are loyal to the British  Empire enter the Legislative Council and even take the ""through  train"" to enter the SAR Legislative Council after 1997 according  to the arrangements of Patten's reform package, then there will  be no tranquility whatsoever in Hong Kong's politics, and the  political unrest will also shake the economic base and the  social order. Then, the stability of the mainland may also be  disrupted by pro- British politicians in Hong Kong. Didn't the  activities of some pro-Western politicians, who claimed to be  ""champions of democracy,"" at the time of the 4 June incident  provide evidence for this?    The Chinese side has now decided to build another kitchen,  and it was forced to do this by Patten's thorough ""three  violations."" In order to ensure the implementation of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and to  guarantee the realization of ""one country, two systems"" and Hong  Kong people's administration in Hong Kong after 1997, more Hong  Kong people have seen through the nature of Patten's ""three  violation"" constitutional reform farce, which is not only  unfavorable to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability but also  directly undermines this prosperity and stability.    Thanks to China's economic growth, Hong Kong's future has  become increasingly intertwined with China. China's reform and  opening have been welcomed by the whole world. Over a short  period of only three years, Patten is still trying to further  his perverse acts and push his reactionary policy. No wonder he  has caused concern and condemnations among British people at  home. We believe that certain changes will occur within the  British Parliament, and more and more people of insight will  oppose Patten's practices and protect Sino- British friendship.    How should we approach the breakdown of the talks on Hong  Kong's political structure? The Hong Kong people are full of  confidence. As Premier Li Peng said, no matter what happens with  the Hong Kong issue, China is no longer in the year 1840 but is  in 1994. The wheel of history is rolling on, and no one will  obstruct it!     "

The published text of an agreement between the four countries suggested the pledges won by Kiev were little different from the standard promises made by nuclear countries to non-nuclear states under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ukraine formally joined yesterday. Western diplomats declined to comment on whether any private or informal undertakings had been given in addition to the published text. The accession of Ukraine to the NPT is a diplomatic breakthrough which clears the way for the Start-1 treaty, providing for the elimination of 9,000 US and former Soviet nuclear warheads, to enter into force. The break-up of the Soviet Union left Ukraine with the world's third largest nuclear arsenal on its soil, and only last month did the Ukrainian parliament formally renounce the aspiration to wrest control of these weapons from Russia. Ukraine's adherence to the NPT was sealed during a European security conference in Budapest by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and the leaders of the US, Russia and Britain, which were the original architects of the treaty. President Kuchma thanked his three co-signatories for their understanding of the 'unique situation' of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine and their 'readiness to give security' to his country. Under the published text of yesterday's deal, the US, Russia and Britain pledged to respect Ukraine's borders, to refrain from using or threatening force against Ukraine, and to seek help from the UN Security Council if Ukraine is threatened with nuclear aggression. In an unusual declaration, reflecting Ukraine's nervousness of Russian commercial power, the three co-signatories pledged to refrain from infringing Kiev's sovereignty through economic coercion. Russian foreign policy experts have called openly for the use of their country's superior financial muscle to take over as much as possible of the Ukrainian economy. At the signing ceremony, President Bill Clinton hailed the 'arrival of a new and safer era' in world affairs. 'Ukraine has taken a bold move away from the nuclear precipice,' he said.

Brussels dropped legal actions against the Twyford Down project and four other UK building projects for alleged breaches of EC environmental rules. The move should reduce UK accusations that Brussels interferes too much in environmental policy. Brussels officials denied the decision marked a climbdown to avoid embarrassing the UK during its presidency of the EC. The other four projects are: the Channel Tunnel rail link, including the King's Cross terminal in London; the M11 link road at Hackney, east London; an incinerator at South Warwick Hospital; and a soft-drinks plant and can-making factory at Brackmills, Northampton. Last October the then-EC environment commissioner Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana provoked a row between Brussels and London when he said work on the five projects should be halted because surveys on the environmental impact, required by a 1985 EC directive, had not been done. The UK has since convinced the Commission that the environmental impact had been adequately considered. Mr David Croker, chairman of the Twyford Down Association, who has campaigned to preserve the beauty spot, said :'It looks like the end of an era.' The European Commission still disagrees with London over the scope of EC rules and yesterday moved toward bringing legal action against two other construction projects where it says Britain did not follow proper procedure  - the East London River Crossing through Oxleas Wood and the extension of a British Petroleum refinery in the Scottish city of Falkirk. Brussels will now issue a Reasoned Opinion  - the second of three steps leading to a court case  - and will give the government two months to argue that proper procedures were carried out. It could take Britain to the European Court of Justice if agreement is not reached. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'We strongly maintain that there has been no breach of EC law.'

Low-level ozone -- caused by sunlight acting on nitrogen  oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by cars and, to a  far lesser extent, industry -- has doubled in Britain this  century, the report shows.    High concentrations of ozone have been shown to damage the  lungs in people who take heavy exercise. Ten per cent of the  population are extra sensitive to ozone, and in them the  pollution may trigger respiratory diseases.    Scientists say that ozone at these levels is likely to cause  billions of pounds of damage to paint and building materials,  disease in trees and plants and crop damage of more than  34  million a year.    The report, which shows that peak levels of ozone pollution  reach the same levels in the south of England as in smog-ridden  Los Angeles, will inevitably add to pressure for tougher curbs  on car emissions.    Prof David Fowler of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's  laboratory near Edinburgh said that ozone pollution -- half of  which is drawn in from the Continent -- was ""a European problem.""    The first maps of ozone exposure to be compiled by the  Photochemicals Oxidants Review Group show that parts of England  and Wales are exposed to harmful levels of ozone for up to 800  hours each year. Levels of exposure either exceed or are very  close to safe limits, thought to be 60 parts per billion for  humans and 40 parts per billion for plants and crops.    The study also shows that levels of nitrogen oxides,  produced  by cars and power stations, are now double the level of sulphur  pollution in Britain. Britain exports 75 per cent of its  nitrogen oxides to the Continent.    Professor Fowler said that present reductions in pollution  from cars expected as a result of new standards for cars in 1996  ""will not be sufficient"" to improve air quality after the year  2,000.

The mission, led by Mr Ian Taylor, the trade and technology minister, will include representatives from the leisure, construction and manufacturing industries, and is the first official visit by a British minister in more than 20 years. The officials said the visit could lead US business to put pressure on their government to relax or remove the 32-year economic embargo before they 'lose all opportunities' for business with and in Cuba. 'We are open for business, and the world is realising this,' said a Cuban government official. 'We have a business climate which is better than that in most other countries of our size and our state of development. We have workers who are highly educated and are eager to work.' The Cuban government is also laying great store by recent changes in economic policy which officials say will attract investments and trade opportunities from Britain and other European countries. They point to the free use of foreign currency on the island, and investment regulations which allow the retention and repatriation of profits, and efforts to encourage private individual and co-operative business ventures. Infrastructural problems and deficiencies in utilities such as power and telecommunications are being mended, they say. The British mission, in Cuba from Monday to Wednesday, will be encouraged to explore business opportunities in the form of joint or wholly-owned ventures in tourism, manufacturing, biotechnology and the marketing of a range of Cuban agricultural exports. 'Fidel (Castro) said recently that if the United States does not end the embargo soon, there will not be even one grain of sand left here for American business,' said the Cuban spokesman.

In this month's National Institute Review, three researchers emphasise the relative inferiority of British workers in skill levels. Comparisons of manufacturing plants found Dutch productivity at least 30 per cent higher in engineering and more than 15 per cent higher in biscuits. The researchers - who include Mr Sig Prais, the institute's senior research fellow - highlight three contrasts: higher emergency downtime in British plants, reflecting poor standards of machine maintenance and diagnostic skill; greater difficulty in maintaining product quality; and higher shopfloor manning levels in Britain because of a comparative shortage of workers able to switch between products and tasks. The researchers say that Dutch schools place greater emphasis on 'early systematic preparation for a career'; they achieve markedly higher standards in maths and science; and offer a vocational route which about a third of Dutch children follow after the age of fifteen. The Dutch require companies to give all those aged 16 to 17 two days' leave a week to attend college - but that affects only a minority because three quarters of students aged 17 to 18 remain in full-time education, half at intermediate-level vocational colleges. 'Dutch education has a much greater variety of secondary schools with highly differentiated curricula for pupils of different career ambitions and aptitudes,' they emphasise. The conclusions are similar to the institute's comparisons of British and German productivity. Explicit parallels between the Netherlands and Germany are drawn in the latest paper, which describes the Dutch model of full-time vocational schooling as 'a successful variant' of Germany's 'dual system' of apprenticeship training.

KRUGMAN is professor of economics at Massachusetts  Institute of Technology.      The idea of European unity -- the transmutation of the European Community from  a free trade area to a full-fledged economic union and eventually to a federal  political system -- has become virtually unstoppable, even in Britain.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wanted to stop the process with trade; she has  been an ardent opponent of British entry into the so-called exchange rate  mechanism of the European Monetary System, which stabilizes exchange rates  within Europe. But she has effectively lost that struggle; Britain is now  expected to join the exchange rate mechanism in the very near future.    And this is a more pregnant move than a decision to join five years ago would  have been, because the European Monetary System has clearly become a way  station on the route to a common European currency. And as the Germans have  just reminded us, a currency union is not much different from a political  union.    What is ironic is that Thatcher, who gained a reputation for leadership by  putting her economy through incredible punishment in the 1980s, now looks weak,  foolish and silly for clinging to a position that makes considerable economic  sense. On purely economic grounds, the case against a common European currency  is actually quite strong.    Why should one ever want to have separate national currencies? Because  sometimes it is very helpful to be able to change the value of one currency  relative to another.    Suppose, for example, there is a sharp drop in worldwide demand for goods made  in Britain. To cope with such a shock, Britain must both make its goods cheaper  and attract new industries to replace the shrunken old ones. The only quick way  to do this is to reduce British wages, to make its labor more competitive.    But how can all British wages be reduced quickly? In the face of sustained high  unemployment, workers might be persuaded to accept lower wages, and the whole  wage structure could gradually be squeezed down to a competitive level. But the  economic and social cost of reducing wages by, say, 15% would be huge. In  contrast, a 15% devaluation of the pound on foreign exchange markets would  accomplish the same thing instantly and almost painlessly.    Conversely, imagine a surge in demand for British products. This would bid up  the prices of British goods and services, possibly building an inflationary  momentum that would later prove hard to stop -- unless Britain accommodated the  surge by allowing the pound, instead of the price level, to rise.    The point is that it can be very convenient to change the value of your  currency rather than experience painful inflation and deflation. Once Britain  has accepted a common European currency, as it may well do this century, that  option will be gone.    Of course the argument is not that one-sided. If it were, then not only should  every country have its own currency, so should each region within a country.  Why not a Southern California dollar, or even a San Diego dollar? There must be  some kind of trade-off. And there is. Having your own currency brings costs as  well as benefits.    Most importantly, it is more difficult to do business when the contracting  partners keep their books and pay their workers in different currencies. So  keeping your own currency acts as a barrier to potentially beneficial  international trade and investment.    The economic theory of the ""optimum currency area"" says this trade-off gets  less and less favorable as the size of the economic unit shrinks. An  independent currency for San Diego would not make sense. On one side, residents  of San Diego do so much business with other Americans that the costs of keeping  track of a separate currency would be huge.    On the other side, changing the value of a local San Diego currency would  probably be ineffective as a way of cutting or raising wages because workers in  such a tiny currency area would almost surely want to index their wages to some  outside standard. So it only makes sense to have an independent currency for an  economic unit large enough to do most of its business with itself, and to have  some prospect of an independent wage- and price-setting process.    But how large is this optimum unit? Nobody knows -- and it is not at all crazy  to imagine that Europe might be better off economically with four or five  regional currencies than with only one.    For example, it is all too likely that in the next several years Germany will  be a boom economy, as it gets most of the business from the reconstruction of  Eastern Europe. To fight inflation, the German central bank will keep interest  rates high; these high interest rates will depress other European economies,  notably Britain's. There will be a clear economic case for devaluation of  Britain's currency against the German mark. Yet this will be difficult under  the European monetary system and impossible once a common currency has been  established.    Against this one might use the example of the United States -- 260 million  people living with only one currency. We're doing fine, aren't we? Not  necessarily. During the first half of the 1980s, when the United States was  fighting inflation with high unemployment, the harshest burden of that  unemployment was concentrated in the Midwestern industrial heartland. Had there  been a separate Midwestern currency, it is arguable that inflation might have  been controlled at significantly lower cost. Right now, as the economy of the  Northeast fights a serious slump, one wonders whether we wouldn't all be better  off if Mario Cuomo could devalue a regional currency.    But of course the idea of separate currencies within the United States is  unthinkable, for the same reason that a common European currency is now  inevitable. Whatever the strict economies of currency union, a common currency  is a potent political instrument: a symbol of unity.    And this symbol may be most important when it makes the least economic sense.  In terms of economic geography, Canada makes no sense as a currency area: each  province's natural business linkages are with the U.S. regions to its south,  not with fellow Canadians. Yet Canada needs an independent, unified currency to  exist as a nation. (In the long run, it may cease to exist anyway; but, as John  Maynard Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead.)    As the 20th Century nears its end, the idea of European unity has finally  become real, and to symbolize that idea, Europe must have a unified currency.  The common currency may not do much economic good; it may even do some harm,  but that is beside the point.

Britain had wanted the option of dumping the Royal Navy's  decommissioned nuclear submarines on the sea bed. There are  already six out-of-action vessels, and by the end of the century  a further 11 are expected to be taken out of service.    But with three days to run before a treaty deadline expires,  Mrs Shephard said that the UK would accept a formal ban under  the London Convention. When 45 countries met in London last  November a large majority voted for the ban, but Britain,  France, Belgium, China and Russia reserved the right to file an  objection by 21 February and ignore it. Belgium and France have  since sided with the ban.    In a written answer to Labour's environment spokesman, Chris  Smith, Mrs Shephard said Britain had not dumped any radioactive  waste from ships since 1983. The UK was already committed to a  moratorium on sea dumping until 2008 under a different treaty.    ""The scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea, carried  out under controlled conditions, causes no harm to the marine  environment and poses no threat to human health,"" she said.  ""This has been confirmed by careful monitoring over many years  and studies have shown it to be the best practicable  environmental option for the disposal of certain types of  radioactive waste"".    ""Nevertheless, the UK recognises that the weight of  international opinion on this matter means that such dumping is  not, in any event, a practical proposition. We have, therefore,  decided to accept the ban,"" the minister added.    Mrs Shephard pointed out that there would be a scientific  re-  evaluation of the ban in 25 years. ""The UK will be ready to  reopen discussions in the Convention at any time, should the  weight of opinion change in favour of accepting the scientific  conclusions.""    Bridget Woodman, a Greenpeace campaigner, said: ""It's a bit  of good news. But if they can bow to international pressure on  radioactive waste dumping, why can't they respond to all the  international concern about the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant  and stop it from opening?""

Answering questions raised by local reporters after  attending  a seminar here on Friday night, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director  of the XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch, disclosed a letter  agreed between China and Britain on the Sino-British talks,  which was excluded in the white paper.    The letter was handed over to British Ambassador to Beijing  Robin McLaren by the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu  on April 7 in reply to a March 30 British request for reopening  talks with China. The letter contains the following five points:    -- It is China's consistent position to resolve Sino-British  differences through negotiations. China has made great efforts  to this purpose and the British side should be sincere about the  talks.    -- The Sino-British talks must be held on the basis of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence  with the Basic Law and the observation of agreements and  understandings already reached between the two countries.    -- The talks are matters between the Chinese and British  Governments and should be conducted with only one Chinese and  one British official present at the talks. Other officials  should attend as advisers or experts.    -- If the British side tables the political reform bill to  the Legislative Council for discussions before the two sides  reach agreements, it will show once again that the British has  no sincerity about the talks and it means the termination of the  talks.    The letter also suggested the version of a news release to  announce the talks.    The British side had agreed with these points and it was on  the basis of the five-point document that China and Britain  opened the talks on April 22, 1993, Zhang said.    ""Why was the document excluded in the white paper? Has the  British side abided by the understandings set in the document?""  Zhang asked.    By concealing such contents about the Sino-British talks,  Zhang said, the British side is trying to mislead the public  opinion and shift its responsibility for undermining the talks  on China. ""China will surely respond to the British move at a  proper time,"" Zhang added.     "

Chris Smith and Simon Hughes, environment spokesmen for  Labour and the Liberal Democrats, said the loophole consists of  describing waste exports to developing countries as substances  intended for recycling or as foreign aid in the form of  recoverable materials.    They said much of the waste was simply dumped, and called  for  the loophole to be closed.    In 1993 Britain exported 105,000 tonnes of waste, half of it  to South-east Asia, three times more than three years ago.  According to Customs records, 65 countries outside the developed  world's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  received waste from Britain last year.    On March 31 the countries which have signed the Basel  Convention, which includes all the members of the European  Union, will meet to discuss controls on the toxic waste trade.  Denmark has proposed a ban on all exports of waste from the 25  OECD nations to non-OECD countries, whether described as for  recycling or otherwise.    Greenpeace, in a letter to John Gummer, the Environment  Secretary, said this call was supported by more than 100  developing countries and at least 12 industrialised countries,  but opposed by Britain. Six other countries, including the  United States, Germany and Japan, want the loophole to remain  open. These are the countries that export most waste.    At Mr Gummer's request, Greenpeace has sent files in which  the damage done by British toxic waste exports is catalogued.    Greenpeace said in its letter: ""Our report on the export of  lead battery waste shows very high levels of contamination in  the Philippines and Indonesia, where British waste has been  exported. These recycling operations cannot be considered  environmentally sound.""    Mr Smith said the Government should sign up for the ban.  ""Exporting toxic waste to the developing world amounts to  dumping our environmental problems in someone else's back yard.  It is immoral -- promoting profits for multinational companies  at the expense of human health. It is ecological  irresponsibility. And it is economic nonsense, costing jobs in  the UK.""

Addressing a delighted audience at a Conservative party rally in Edinburgh, he said: 'The future of Scotland and the Union which bind the United Kingdom together is under threat as never before. All our opponents want to change Britain. 'They want a different Britain. A Britain on the sidelines. A Scotland diminished. A Britain broken.' The Scottish Nationalist party offered Scotland the straight choice of separatism and socialism. It was a 'cynical creed which spells destruction, division and disunity'. Labour and Liberal Democrat support for devolution was a cynical move to save their votes from the SNP, he said. Devolution would produce another layer of bureaucracy with higher taxes and a worse climate for investment. Independence would destroy Scotland's ability to influence the big decisions in Nato, in Europe and in international economic forums. Nationalism was on the march and was producing 'extremism in France, riots on the streets of Marseilles, fascism on the rise in Germany' and ethnic hatred, racial bitterness and social turmoil in eastern Europe. German nationalism had nearly destroyed the UK. 'Scotland couldn't have stopped Hitler alone,' said Mr Heseltine. 'But nor could England or Wales or Ireland. None of us. Together we did. This union of ours did.' Labour's devolution was to assemblies, councils, unions, committees, working parties and pressure groups. The real devolution was to the 'real Scottish people' through the purchase of their council houses, the choice of school to which to send their children and control of schools through school boards, all of them Tory innovations.

Who, at Maastricht, fought for and won concessions to enshrine subsidiarity and to reserve a position as to whether Britain should join a single currency bloc? With the hindsight enjoyed by most of his critics, perhaps Mr Major should have foreseen that his position in the ERM was precarious. However, he did try to play the game with a 'straight bat' within the rules as they were understood to be at the time. It seems quite possible and even desirable that the 'greater German' bloc should emerge. I very much doubt if the French will relish the thought of their economic management being dictated by an 'independent' central bank and thus will most likely opt to wait until Britain, France and Italy have converged sufficiently with Germany to allow a joint politically controlled central bank by the participating countries. Again Mr Major's instinct for caution in rejoining the ERM follows logically. Some commentators like to portray this as a sop to the so-called Euro-sceptics. If this is so then truly we would all be Euro-sceptics, which we are not. His insistence that a return to the ERM will not be in the foreseeable future seems only common sense. The Conservative party is, of course, representative of the feelings in Britain as a whole. The Conservative government has achieved its Maastricht goals with the consent of parliament and I am sure that the Conservative party conference will give Mr Major a strong vote of confidence.

The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' argued whether Britain or  any other Western country had the right to question Iran's  actions regarding adherence to internationally accepted  conventions.    ""From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have  repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which  regulate relations between individual countries,"" said the paper.    The editorial said the 1961 and 1963 Vienna Conventions  requiring the observance of mutual diplomatic rules among  nations have been openly ignored by the West through their overt  and covert support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in  their countries.    ""Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead ignorance  when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups  they harbor in the West.""    The paper noted that the Iranian Government has been under  increasing domestic public opinion pressure for not allowing  Bader-Meinhof, Direct Action or the IRA to have offices in  Tehran while anti-Iranian terrorist groups enjoy almost full  diplomatic rights in Bonn, Paris and London.    ""The Iranian public opinion is consistently questioning the  government why it adheres to international conventions regarding  aiding and abetting terrorists when Western countries so openly  and flagrantly ignore the same conventions.""    The daily termed the latest baseless British protest over  the Iran-IRA contact as a ""smoke-screen to hide the fact that  Western based anti-Iranian terrorists are providing material and  personnel to the Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside  the Islamic republic.""    Commenting on the same subject the Persian daily  `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that apparently Tehran-London ties  would never be stable because evidence shows that the Britons  have constantly tried to mar mutual ties by taking advantage of  the status quo.    It added that a review of Tehran-London political ties over  the past 15 years reveals that not only such relations could  never be relied on, the London government would occasionally  misuse the ties under various pretexts.    The paper called on the Iranian authorities to bring the  ties  with London to the lowest possible level, especially in economic  field.    It also recommended the decision-making bodies in the  country  to look into the new British game and not allow London to take  advantage of such a political-propaganda ploy.     "

The basic impetus for the deals struck at Edinburgh was a recognition by all 12 leaders that the price of failure was too high. But the prime minister provided the skilful chairmanship which allowed each delegation to dress up collective compromises as individual successes. Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, described Mr Major's handling of the summit as 'elegant and effective'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, offered a similar judgment. Even President Francois Mitterrand allowed himself a grudging compliment. Mr Major intends to capitalise on the plaudits - and on the substantive deals struck in Edinburgh. Doubts over Maastricht and Black Wednesday handed the initiative to the Tory Euro-sceptics. Now Mr Major thinks he can regain it. The balance sheet he will present to the Commons later today will list a string of successes for his brand of pragmatic Europeanism. British ingenuity ensured that Denmark had another opportunity to move forward with the rest of the Community. The declaration on subsidiarity met demands that Brussels give substance to the commitment to decentralise authority. All 12 governments are pledged to push ahead with negotiations to enlarge the Community, initially to include Austria, Finland and Sweden. Mr Major defended successfully the British budget rebate. With the eventual help of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he resisted demands that he set a firm timetable for ratification of Maastricht at Westminster. He found time also to settle long-standing disputes over the sites of the EC's main institutions and to give Germany extra European MPs to reflect unification. The balance sheet carries its minuses also. The Tory sceptics seized yesterday on the concessions which he was forced to give on the size of the budget. They will make much of the concession to Brussels 'profligacy' during the interminable New Year debates at Westminster on Maastricht. For many other European leaders subsidiarity is a useful but essentially unimportant concept. Negotiations on enlargement may begin before Maastricht is ratified but progress remains contingent on the treaty coming into force. On the admission of some of the participants the economic initiative drawn up by the finance ministers will do little to dispel the gloom over European growth prospects. There was no doubt though that Edinburgh was a summit shaped much more by Mr Major's pragmatism than by the European idealism of Mr Mitterrand or Mr Kohl. That will give the prime minister a powerful weapon in his attempts to detach from the irreconciliable Tory critics of Maastricht a much larger group of waverers. His message now to his party will be simple: the great mass of the Conservative party wants a decentralised, wider, Community with the bureaucratic wings of Brussels clipped. He can deliver it. The Tory doubters in return must ensure that Britain retains its voice in Europe by ratifying the treaty. If the Danish people vote Yes in a second referendum the message will be unanswerable. The Maastricht treaty could well be on the British statute book by the end of July. Mr Major's problem is that all-important 'if'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, acknowledged that the government would abandon ratification in the wake of a second Danish No vote. He accepted also that the other 10 probably would push ahead with a new version of the treaty from which Britain as well as Denmark might be excluded. The uncomfortable implication is that Britain's future in Europe for moment may rest with the tiny Danish electorate.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Much of the difference between the sexes is accounted for by the gap in the state pension age - 60 for women and 65 for men. Just 4 per cent of women over the age of 65 are still working. The reason that women commonly continue working may be linked to the fact that far more retired men than women receive pensions. Separate government figures have shown that 69 per cent of retired men aged 65-69 were receiving an occupational pension in 1992, compared with 40 per cent of retired women aged 60-64. The report on the Labour Force Survey figures concludes that the 'decline in labour market participation of older people in Great Britain and in other European countries has slowed down, and, in the case of older women in Great Britain, has been reversed.' Since a similar survey in 1987, there has been an increase in economic activity among women aged 50-59 from 60 per cent to 62 per cent; for those aged 60-64, the figure has risen from 19 per cent to 23 per cent. Among men, there has been a fall since 1987 of those working aged 50-59 from 85 per cent to 84 per cent; the proportion of men aged 60-64 still working fell from 55 per cent to 53 per cent. All the latest Labour Force figures are for spring 1992. Older women are far more likely than men to be working part-time: 66 per cent of women aged 60-64 are part-time workers, compared to 14 per cent of men. Over the age of 65, 83 per cent of women still working are part-time, and 65 per cent of men are part-timers. Older workers, by Jennifer Dibden and Angelika Hibbett, Employment Gazette, June.

That was the message Mr John Major gave the voters of Bristol last night. The prime minister used his first mass rally of the European election campaign to tell a hand-picked audience of 600 Tory activists in this affluent but recession-touched south-western city that Conservative policies would produce 'a strong Britain in a strong Europe'. This was quite different from the federal European superstate that the 'Liberals' and 'socialists' wanted to see. 'A Labour or Liberal vote would be a vote for a weak Britain in a federal European superstate,' Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, told the faithful while they awaited the arrival of the man of 'principle' and 'integrity' they had come to see. The two men were preaching to the converted, although the standing ovation the prime minister's speech generated was polite rather than ecstatic. The verdict was that Mr Major's pragmatic vision had struck a good balance between underlining the importance of Britain's relationship with Europe and standing up for its interests. 'I thought he outlined a good vision of Europe from the British point of view: we don't want to lose our sovereignty but we cannot afford to be isolationist,' said Ms Ann Armstrong, a local party worker. Mr Geoff Gollop, another Tory activist, said: 'John Major's points on the fact that we can be European and British are just so important; I believe he epitomises that view.' The only discordant note was struck by a small bunch of demonstrators brandishing a sign saying 'Honk if you hate Major' in the street outside. The majority of drivers duly obliged. The west country is a vital electoral battleground. From Doone country to Hardy country, Tory incumbents are under threat from Liberal Democrats on a roll after their local election successes. The Tory party must prevent this rebellion from spreading too far east if it is to stave off its second electoral embarrassment in two months. Much of what Mr Major said - and his catchiest slogans  - were aimed at the Liberal Democrats. 'Think before voting Liberal,' he urged his audience. 'And if you think before voting Liberal, you will find it unthinkable to vote Liberal.' When he appeared on the stage, serenaded by his familiar Purcell theme tune, Mr Major was in relaxed mood, pledging not to resort to party political slogans. But it was not long before he played the nationalist card, arguing it was essential that Britain retained its veto in the European Council of Ministers if it was not to lose all manner of things, including an independent foreign policy and its own rules on immigration. He devoted a long passage to the need to open markets and cut red tape in order to tackle unemployment. To seek to regulate was folly.

A study by the London-based World Development Movement says that there has been a significant fall in British aid going directly to the world's poor in the past five years. Over the same period, there has been an increase in aid spent on British consultants and industry. The report also criticises the level of UK aid. Between 1980 and 1992 Britain's aid to sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, fell by 2 per cent in real terms, when for all donors there was an average increase of 55 per cent. The UK aid budget has fallen to two-thirds of the 1979 level as a proportion of GNP, and by 12.5 per cent in real terms, according to the report. It notes that Britain is the sixth largest aid donor after Japan, the US, France, Germany and Italy, but in 1993 UK aid amounted to 0.31 per cent of GNP. Using this yardstick, it was 13th out of the 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development aid donors. Technical co-operation - consultants, training and research and development at UK institutions - provides the bulk of the project aid. The remainder is used to win commercial contracts, such as the Pergau dam in Malaysia under the aid and trade provision (ATP). Although spending on agriculture has risen by 40 per cent in the past five years, it still received less than 8 per cent of total project aid in 1992-3. In that year, says the report, 'three times as much was spent supporting British companies working in agriculture through the ATP, than on direct financial assistance to farmers'. Almost half of Britain's bilateral aid from 1987-8 to 1992-3 was spent on technical co-operation, says the report, including the ATP. Funding for non-governmental organisations is included in this budget and took up little over 10 per cent of the total in 1992-93.

0,FT942-6335 ,"FT942-6335 _AN-EE4DFAC5FT 940531   FT  31 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Britain's voice in Europe   Britain's performance in standing up for the country's economic policy interests in the European Union has been at best patchy during recent years. The government's successes in European bargaining have generally been negative, shown by its 'opt-outs' over economic and monetary union (Emu) and social policy at Maastricht in 1991. The UK's tactical position has been weakened by setbacks such as sterling's exit from the ERM and, more recently, the fruitless tussle over prospective changes in majority voting rules. The government likes to declare that the 'tide of argument' in Europe has been moving in Britain's favour. Yet such pronouncements are less than convincing as long as the UK remains impeded - partly because of the Tory Eurosceptic minority in the House of Commons - from proposing firm policies to set the EU agenda. Britain undoubtedly made a significant contribution to agreement on the single market, but it has had less effect in assuring that the programme's precepts are properly enforced. In another field of special interest, the UK has been unable to prod its partners into forging a consensus on necessary cuts in subsidies in areas like steel. In view of this less-than-impressive track record, today's letter in the FT from leading UK industrialists is a timely reminder of the important areas where Britain ought to be able to muster strong EU support. Important passages of this mini-manifesto would find as much assent from industrialists in Germany, France or the Netherlands as from those in the UK. Labour deregulation On policies aimed at promoting further integration and improving prosperity and employment, there is more agreement than often imagined between the UK and its EU partners. This was underlined by yesterday's report from Franco-German experts proposing far-reaching labour market deregulation - even though the text was pointedly described as 'provisional' by the Paris government. Some of this common ground, admittedly, is often obscured by sharp differences over Europe's long-term goals. Last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was certain a single currency would one day be realised, while Mr John Major restated his scepticism. German opinion polls and shifts in Mr Kohl's own statements since 1991 make clear, however, that establishing a single currency has slipped well down the Germans' list of priorities. On social policy, the UK business community says, with justification, that full enactment of European employment legislation would damage the outlook for jobs. In spite of 11 EU countries' support for the social chapter, it is difficult, however, to detect enthusiasm among member governments for further action in this field. Policy realism Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, has expressed disquiet about deregulation throughout the EU. Yet far from signalling a new wave of legislation, Mr Delors is demonstrating that countries which sign the social chapter are in no way barred from improving labour market flexibility. The apparent agreement, reported today, between the UK and its EU partners on flexible application of labour legislation to contracting-out is another sign of new social policy realism. Across the EU, electorates' desire to promote a Europe a la Maastricht has fallen during the last three years, partly as a consequence of recession. As a result of a series of elections, European policies in many EU capitals are likely to take on a less federalist hue during the next 18 months, more in keeping with British instincts. In 1989-90, the UK government was concerned by changes in the post-cold war balance of power in Europe. Since then, it has not been able to give Britain a leading role in assuring a sound EU balance of policies. As the time approaches for the 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty, the UK has a good chance of increasing its weight in the councils and congresses of Europe. First, however, it will have to do more to convince its partners that it wants to make a positive rather than simply a spoiling contribution.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But they also agreed, at the insistence of Nato's European members, that the UN must retain its veto over any hardening of tactics by the Atlantic alliance. An informal meeting of Nato defence ministers, attended for the first time since 1966 by France, heard calls from Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, for much tougher action against Bosnian Serbs. He told his colleagues Nato's political credibility had been damaged by the fact that five aircraft were apparently needed to destroy one tank near Sarajevo last week. In a spirited exchange, the European allies agreed there was room for some stiffening of Nato's stance but insisted that British and French generals on the ground should retain the last word. Diplomats said France showed slightly more sympathy than Britain for the US position that an immediate toughening of tactics was necessary. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the use of airpower so far had been more symbolic than substantial and said Nato could 'go a bit further'. He called for a more vigorous response to 'unacceptable behaviour' such as firing on UN aid convoys or relief flights. Mr Leotard said he was sure Bosnian Serb behaviour in recent weeks reflected a systematic strategy to reimpose their grip on Sarajevo, rather than unrelated incidents. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence minister, said it was still an open question whether recent violence amounted to a conscious strategy. While Britain and France both stressed the need to consult UN commanders on the ground, diplomats said, Mr Rifkind put more emphasis on this than his French colleague. Supporters of the Bosnian government have been complaining that Nato's air raids so far have been little more than pinpricks. Senior officials in Russia's arms exporting enterprise have criticised the US for 'discrediting' Russian weapons in international arms markets and forecast a continuing rise in arms sales, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.

By ERNEST DRUCKER, Ernest Drucker is founder and executive director of the  drug-abuse treatment program at Montefiore Medical Center and a professor of  epidemiology and social medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in  New York.      For more than 60 years, Britain has stubbornly insisted on making up its own  mind about the best way to deal with its drug problem.    Drug ""misuse,"" as the British call it, is substantial in the United Kingdom.  With a population one-fifth the size of the United States, Britain is believed  to have between 50,000-100,000 intravenous drug users, mostly of opiates and  amphetamines. (In the United States, the National Institute on Drug Abuse  estimates there are 1.2 million intravenous drug users). There has been some  use of cocaine (as elsewhere in Europe), but it is not widespread and ""crack""  is rarely available.    In 1926, a committee headed by Sir Humphrey Rolleston, president of the Royal  College of Physicians, set the course for British policy: Drug addiction is a  disease. Doctors supply addicts to ""maintain"" (not cure) them so that they can  ""lead fairly normal and useful lives.""    Until recently, American physicians have shunned ""addiction medicine,"" a blend  of psychiatry, clinical pharmacology and, since AIDS, infectious-disease  control. The British have been practicing a version of it for decades. Because  Britain's National Health Services, instituted soon after World War II,  reimburses physicians who treat drug addicts, doctors are more willing to  specialize in the field.    Nonetheless, addiction treatment in Great Britain has always been vaguely  disreputable. The physician is frequently painted with the same brush as is the  addict-patient. In part, this image is the result of a handful of doctors  over-prescribing drugs to line their pockets in the 1960s and early 1970s. The  abuses led to tighter regulations, special licensing for physicians treating  addicts and the attachment of drug-dependency units to hospitals.    These changes still gave British physicians wide latitude in devising treatment  plans to help addicts gain control over their drug habit. If these patients  were able to hold steady jobs, have a family life and manage their drug use,  treatment was considered successful. But treatment is still quite limited, and  the newer multiple-drug users are more difficult to treat. This, in part,  explains the rise in registered addicts, from 2,500 in 1970 to 15,000 in 1985.  Yet this rate of increase was comparable to that in countries where drugs were  illegal.    Before World War I, there were drug-maintenance clinics in several U.S. cities.  One in New York had 7,000 patients on morphine. But the Harrison Narcotics Act  of 1914 criminalized drug addiction and forbade maintenance treatment, thereby  driving most doctors from the field. Some American physicians tried to continue  their work in the 1920s -- and went to prison for their efforts. That  effectively put an end to the development of addiction treatment in the United  States until methadone-maintenance programs emerged in the 1960s.    The British experience has generated a range of programs, including methadone-  maintenance and detoxification clinics, and drug-free therapeutic communities.  In addition to prescribing injectable drugs, physicians are now experimenting  with smokeable forms of cocaine and heroin to reduce needle use and the AIDS  risk, the focus of current treatment.

By ERNEST DRUCKER, Ernest Drucker is founder and executive director of the  drug-abuse treatment program at Montefiore Medical Center and a professor of  epidemiology and social medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in  New York.      For more than 60 years, Britain has stubbornly insisted on making up its own  mind about the best way to deal with its drug problem.    Drug ""misuse,"" as the British call it, is substantial in the United Kingdom.  With a population one-fifth the size of the United States, Britain is believed  to have between 50,000-100,000 intravenous drug users, mostly of opiates and  amphetamines. (In the United States, the National Institute on Drug Abuse  estimates there are 1.2 million intravenous drug users). There has been some  use of cocaine (as elsewhere in Europe), but it is not widespread and ""crack""  is rarely available.    In 1926, a committee headed by Sir Humphrey Rolleston, president of the Royal  College of Physicians, set the course for British policy: Drug addiction is a  disease. Doctors supply addicts to ""maintain"" (not cure) them so that they can  ""lead fairly normal and useful lives.""    Until recently, American physicians have shunned ""addiction medicine,"" a blend  of psychiatry, clinical pharmacology and, since AIDS, infectious-disease  control. The British have been practicing a version of it for decades. Because  Britain's National Health Services, instituted soon after World War II,  reimburses physicians who treat drug addicts, doctors are more willing to  specialize in the field.    Nonetheless, addiction treatment in Great Britain has always been vaguely  disreputable. The physician is frequently painted with the same brush as is the  addict-patient. In part, this image is the result of a handful of doctors  over-prescribing drugs to line their pockets in the 1960s and early 1970s. The  abuses led to tighter regulations, special licensing for physicians treating  addicts and the attachment of drug-dependency units to hospitals.    These changes still gave British physicians wide latitude in devising treatment  plans to help addicts gain control over their drug habit. If these patients  were able to hold steady jobs, have a family life and manage their drug use,  treatment was considered successful. But treatment is still quite limited, and  the newer multiple-drug users are more difficult to treat. This, in part,  explains the rise in registered addicts, from 2,500 in 1970 to 15,000 in 1985.

In a speech to the Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce, the prime minister promised to work unceasingly for a wider Europe that would embrace the emerging democracies of eastern Europe. His appearance in Scotland marked the first in a post-election series of visits to fulfil a pledge to make government from Westminster less remote from the people of Scotland. While reiterating his promise to 'take stock' of the pressures in Scotland for more self-government, he reaffirmed his absolute opposition to legislative devolution. Attacking the 'narrow nationalism' of the Scottish National party, he warned that devolution would be a 'step half-way across a chasm'. He linked Scotland's past and future prosperity to the role that Britain played in the EC. Separation would relegate Scotland from the heart of Europe to, at best, its outer fringe, depriving it of investment and influence. Mr Major, who used a trip to central Europe last to back the claims of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary for EC membership, said that a wider Europe was vital to the peace and prosperity of Europe. 'It is not an optional extra.' He insisted that the government would not be content with arguing its corner defensively in the Community but would set out its own vision of the future. Britain would take as its starting point that the cardinal principle of the Community must be the free market. It would use its presidency to ensure that the single market was completed and then move on to try to limit the burdens the EC placed on business.  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

Unless unions start recruiting hard, Mr Laird writes in the union's journal, 'the current merger-mania will amount to little more than rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic'. The AEEU itself - recently formed through a merger between the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union - has seen engineering membership drop by 11 per cent over the past year. Mr Laird says unions have lost a total of 3.5m members since 1979 and there are now just under 10m union members, representing 38 per cent of the directly employed workforce. 'Unions in Britain are less effective than even our dwindling numbers would suggest,' he adds. 'Our 10m members are split into 20 large unions, dozens of smaller unions and hundreds of staff associations.' Arguing for further mergers, Mr Laird points to the problems faced by manufacturing employers who still 'have to deal with three or four manual unions and two or more staff unions'. Although union membership in Germany is lower than in Britain, effectiveness is increased by single unions in each sector, he adds. 'Here in Britain we are still trying to compete against Germany with a Victorian trade union set-up. Mergers have taken place in a random and unco-ordinated way,' he writes. In a barely disguised swipe at some of the poaching activities of his own electricians' section, Mr Laird says the union should not be 'interested in petty squabbles with the general unions about a few thousand members here or there on the periphery of industry', but should be 'reaching out and recruiting the unorganised'.

The first of a series of presentations to manufacturers and distribution companies will be held tomorrow in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The ports used to promote separately but started talking last year about trying to make Humber-Rotterdam the principal trade route between Britain and the European mainland. Although the ports compete for deep-sea traffic they believe there is scope to co-operate on roadborne freight needing North Sea passage. The Humber is Britain's busiest estuary. It carried 60m tonnes of cargo last year - surpassing the Thames for the first time, with about 40,000 shipping movements. Its main ports of Hull, Immingham, Goole and Grimsby are supplemented by 10 river wharves and about 100 other berths. It accounts for 17 per cent of the UK's seaborne trade and this share is expected to rise to 25 per cent in six years. Humber traffic has increased by 50 per cent in the past 10 years. A principal attraction is the UK's motorway network, which puts 40m people - most of Britain north of London and the south-east - within a day's return lorry drive. Rotterdam handles 300m tonnes of cargo a year and offers direct links into European markets of 320m people within 24 hours' drive. The advent of the Channel tunnel has spurred co-operation. Both Rotterdam and Humberside authorities say the tunnel will have little impact on their operations because it will initially handle only about 8m tonnes of freight. This compares with about 15m tonnes of container traffic through the Humber and 60m tonnes through Rotterdam - the market where the tunnel is hoping to compete. The tunnel is, however, making shippers think afresh about North Sea trade and evaluate alternatives. The Humberside Partnership - a joint venture of local public and private sectors - is emphasising Britain's London transportation bottleneck and the convenience of Humber-Rotterdam for roadborne freight to and from continental Europe for Scotland, northern England, the Midlands and Ireland. Rotterdam Port Promotion Council, the partnership's Netherlands equivalent, says the ports can offer 'considerable' economic benefits to businesses.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This was a remarkable piece of writing and a very good negative  example which may serve as a lesson. The fourth part of the  White Paper, ""Conclusion and the Way Forward,"" says: ""Many of  the individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves,  technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides  was simple."" This remark is quite true; however, the British  side's description of the ""fundamental difference"" was  absolutely absurd. According to its White Paper, the difference  was that the British side's proposal on the political structure  was prodemocratic, but the Chinese side's proposal was  antidemocratic. Here, facts were simply stood on their head,  and things were turned completely upside down.    The differences between the Chinese and British sides were  absolutely not about whether there should be democracy or how  much democracy should be adopted. What Britain is now  practicing is a system of constitutional monarchy, and the  British people themselves may judge whether such a system is  good or bad. Britain, however, has no right to impose its  system on other countries. Hong Kong is a place that belongs to  China, and China will soon resume sovereignty over Hong Kong.  It is a matter of course that Britain has no right to demand  that China also adopt its system in Hong Kong. The appointment  of a failed politician by the British ruling authorities to be  governor in a territory forcefully occupied by Britain was  itself not an event representative of democracy at all, and this  is self-evident. When Chris Patten took office as governor of  Hong Kong, he decided to play tricks like he did in the British  political circles and stir up trouble in Hong Kong. The  so-called democratic political reform was just a fig leaf.  Proceeding from some Westerners' prejudices, he blamed China  for not practicing democracy and not allowing Hong Kong to  practice democracy. Using the Western mass media to spread this  point of view was Patten's primary method for deceiving the Hong  Kong people. However, British Foreign Secretary Hurd said in  the preface for the White Paper: ""The Sino-British Joint  Declaration of 1984 and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, which  will come into force as of 1 July 1997, between them set the  pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no  argument about that."" Here, Hurd slapped his own face as well  as Patten's. Since the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law have  already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, why did the  British not adopt a constitutional package which converges with  the Basic Law, and why did the British authorities abet the  Legislative Council members they had appointed to attack such  convergence by saying that ""the theory of convergence is our  enemy""? Obviously, the British side had another intention, and  what they actually hoped was to extend colonial rule under the  pretense of seeking ""democracy.""    People have often pointed out that the fundamental  differences between the Chinese side and the British side lay in  whether one should keep one's promise in international  relations. Hurd admitted that the Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, but  the British authorities still perversely went against the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law. The consultation mechanism  specified by the Joint Declaration was also cast aside by the  British authorities. Hurd avoided mentioning the seven letters  he exchanged with the Chinese foreign minister in early 1990 on  the election arrangements in Hong Kong and the agreements and  understandings reached by these letters. The White Paper even  said that the seven diplomatic letters ""did not reach any  agreement (on the 1995 election arrangements)."" What Patten did  in the first 18 months after he took office in Hong Kong showed  that the British completely disregarded the basic norm of acting  in good faith in international relations, and moved as far as  shamelessly denying that the process of democracy in Hong Kong  had been specified by the Joint Declaration and the seven  diplomatic letters and insisting that Patten's ""three violation""  package be arbitrarily enforced in the last months of British  colonial rule. Britain is a major power, but it still can  behave so shamelessly as ignoring diplomatic documents which it  had already signed. What international credibility will such a  country maintain? The behavior of the British authorities since  Patten become governor of Hong Kong only recorded their perfidy.  This time, they violated the principle of keeping the talks  confidential and unilaterally published the White Paper. This  just added one more page to the record of their dishonor. Will  they still be able to really bring any democracy to Hong Kong in  the last 40 months of their rule? By contrast, the Chinese  Government always faithfully honors its international  commitments, and this is a fact admitted by the international  community.    The British side behaved perfidiously under the pretense of  ""democracy."" What was their real intention? Patten's package  and the political structure that the British side tried to  impose on Hong Kong beyond 1997 as revealed by the White Paper  showed that they were unwilling to give up the territory that  they had occupied for over 150 years. That is to say, London  was trying by every possible means to extend its rule in Hong  Kong. The British authorities have been attempting to simply  return Hong Kong to China in a formalistic way and continue  their de facto control over Hong Kong. This was self-evident.  Approximately 10 years ago, Mrs Thatcher tried to impede China  from resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and  she inevitably ran into snags. Deng Xiaoping made it clear to  her: ""Sovereignty is not a question which is open for  discussion."" In July 1984, when meeting with then British  Foreign Secretary Howe, Deng Xiaoping showed his foresight and  pointed out: ""We hope that the British Hong Kong Government  will not set up a body in order to impose it on the government  of the Special Administrative Region."" Patten's constitutional  package was precisely a plan for unilaterally setting up a body  in the transitional period in an attempt to impose it on the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This represented a  serious challenge to China's sovereign power. Sovereignty is  the crucial issue and the essence of the fundamental nature of  the Sino-British fundamental differences over Hong Kong's  political structure. On this issue, the British side was unable  to advance further arguments and justify itself and had no  strength to confront itself with China. Patten and his ilk were  as ridiculous as an ant trying to topple a giant tree.     "

But the family has been made very welcome, even if we don't speak proper English.' As managing director of the European subsidiary of Contico International, a Missouri-based manufacturing group, Mr Farrar is responsible for the company's Pounds 4.3m investment in the Cornish town. His factory opened a year ago to make a range of plastic household products for sale across Europe; the plant is cramped and within two years the 71-strong workforce should rise by more than half again. Contico had considered other European locations. But in spite of worries that British workers would reject a 24-hour-a-day production regime, the comparative ease of setting up shop, generous grant aid and the English language - notwithstanding any transatlantic variations - gave Redruth the edge. But if 36-year old Mr Farrar feels isolated he can take comfort from the ranks of expatriate managers like him, supervising the colossal sums which foreign investors have injected into the UK's industrial base during a period of unprecedented inward investment activity. News that Mercedes-Benz, traditionally a hallmark of German engineering excellence, is actively considering Britain as the site for its planned small car manufacturing plant has caused considerable excitement in Whitehall. But there is also concern in industry and government that Britain's best days as a magnet for industrial investment may even now be over; foreign investment, which has helped supplement the damaging domestic shortfall in home-grown manufacturing capacity and technological skills, could increasingly be directed elsewhere. A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research in London underlines the importance of foreign direct investment. It concludes that nearly one-fifth - more than Pounds 40bn - of the Pounds 220bn invested in UK industry in the past five years has come from overseas. The percentage of foreign-owned assets in the UK in relation to its total net assets - not including oil and financial services - now approaches 20 per cent. Five years ago, the figure just topped 13 per cent. Of all non-EC companies with operations in the Community, nearly 40 per cent of them have opted for the UK. Both the US and Japan, the biggest external investors in European industry, have invested more in Britain than in any other EC country. Last year, according to the Department of Trade and Industry, overseas companies initiated another 303 projects in Britain, aided by Pounds 100m of regional grants. The electronics, automotive, food and service sectors have proved the most active; the inventory of foreign investments so far involves 3,500 US, about 1,000 German and more than 200 Japanese manufacturing businesses. Overseas-owned companies provide some 16 per cent of all UK manufacturing jobs. In spite of the political debate over whether Britain's success in winning foreign investment is rooted in its alleged 'sweatshop economy' or in more positive characteristics such as deregulation and low corporation taxes, the UK appears to have left the European competition standing. But are things set to change?. While global recession has inevitably cut from its 1990 peak the level of inward investment, the fear is that other pressures might permanently undermine Britain's success. According to Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry: 'The task of attracting inward investment on the scale we have seen in the past five years will become increasingly difficult.' Mr Davies' prediction seems safe, with some of the biggest investors refocusing their overseas activities. The US, which makes one-third of all its European investments in the UK, could be looking much closer to home. 'The US preference for the UK is changing,' says Mr Martin Gerra, president of Global Affiliates, the Washington-based international business consultancy, and a former manager of international economics at International Business Machines. He says that closer trade links between the US, Mexico and Canada, even before ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, will give rise to a big increase in cross-border investment. 'Over time, US investment in Europe, relative to total foreign investment, will inevitably decline.' Japan, the second largest investor in the UK, remains keen to invest in a country offering an EC foothold and which Japanese companies say has been welcoming and supportive. But the rush of activity which has made Japanese names commonplace on industrial estates in towns such as Telford could be over. 'Japan had a lot of catching up to do, which led to their investment boom,' according to Prof Douglas McWilliams, formerly chief economic adviser to the CBI and founder of the Centre for Economics and Business Research. 'In 1981, only 4 per cent of its assets were overseas, against 30 per cent for the US. But big Japanese companies have moved fast to raise the figure to an average of 15 per cent and now the pace has slowed. The UK will remain popular with them but investment is likely to decline over the next few years.' A study by accountants Coopers  Lybrand concludes the UK also risks losing out on further, high-quality foreign investment. Mr Vince Taylor, one of the authors, says: 'The UK could be squeezed during the remainder of the 1990s between higher cost, but more centrally-located competitors within the EC, and the emerging economies which can undercut our cost base and which now appear able to match the UK in terms of quality.' Though there is no evidence that inward investors are more likely to close down plants than local owners, companies are also intensifying the search for economies of scale as the European market becomes less fragmented. For example, CPC (UK), a subsidiary of the US food group, recently announced a switch in production of Knorr brand soups and stock cubes from Scotland to France and Italy. 'Where you close down will be as important as where you open up,' emphasises Mr David Rees, head of Ernst  Young's European location service: 'There could be good, strategic reasons for siting second and third investments away from the first.' Britain's position, he emphasises, is not helped by its continuing image as a less than wholehearted EC member, though ratification of the Maastricht treaty might help allay such perceptions. Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location International, the Brussels-based location consultancy, offers another view: 'If not signing (Maastricht's) social chapter means Britain's cost structures continue to provide a competitive edge over many of its European partners, then its record on inward investment should be safe.' Competition to attract inward investment looking for a home within Europe is also escalating, with the number of investment promotion agencies working on behalf of regional authorities and local councils multiplying. Coopers  Lybrand calculates agencies worldwide have doubled in five years. Mr Christopher Priston, director of the Invest in Britain Bureau, an arm of the DTI, claims it is 'still easier to put up a brass plate in the UK' than in most EC countries. But some such as France - previously giving low priority to attracting overseas investors - are working hard to make up lost ground. Mr Priston, whose bureau handles 4,000 inquiries annually on everything from the incidence of earthquakes to membership of exclusive London clubs, warns that Britain must 'continue to improve transport infrastructure to help compensate for its location in Europe and also to raise skills training'. Britain will also have to be demonstrably supportive to companies which have already set up shop. According to Prof McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research: 'You cannot underestimate the importance to inward investors, particularly the Japanese, of feeling the government is prepared to bat on their behalf.' With some new investors into the UK privately complaining of being feted before their arrival, only to be promptly abandoned afterwards, the IBB is now contacting 1,000 established foreign companies to see if it can help solve any problems they may have. A decision by Mercedes-Benz to choose Britain would inevitably be greeted by politicians as further proof of Britain's magnetic lure to world-class manufacturing companies. Potential new investors, however, will not like being trampled in the rush by those anxious to win their favours. The mere prospect of Mercedes making cars in Britain led initially to an unco-ordinated scramble by companies and organisations to help secure the deal. 'Mercedes would be a real propaganda coup and we cannot afford to shoot ourselves in the foot,' says a DTI minister. 'It would give a very timely boost to an inward investment programme which we cannot allow to falter.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's minister, rejected a Commission compromise on subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker. Senior commissioners and the Belgian presidency of the EU warned that the impasse would be highly damaging not only for Europe's ailing industry, but for the new Union itself. Italian opposition to a 2m tonne capacity cut at Ilva now seems likely to be discussed, at least informally, at the EU summit in Brussels on December 10. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, called it a 'black day' for the EU, and Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgium's industry minister, who chaired the meeting, said the outcome did not bode well for the relationship between the Union's institutions. Mr Wathelet said he would only call a follow-up meeting of ministers, on December 17, if there was a chance of a deal. The British industry, however, which has already cut jobs and capacity severely, welcomed the fact that ministers had resisted agreeing other restructuring plans which Britain believes insufficiently strict. The Commission had asked ministers to give their political blessing to Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in east Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal - in exchange for 5.5m tonnes of capacity cuts. Final agreement on subsidies must be unanimous. There was friction between Germany and Britain over UK opposition to a new hot rolling mill at Ekostahl, east German steel producer, 60 per cent of which is being offered for sale to Riva, a private Italian company. The Treuhand, the privatisation agency handling the Ekostahl sale, will today set a deadline of Tuesday for Riva to answer 'crucial questions' about the new mill before the sale can be concluded. British Steel welcomed the tough line taken by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK minister, saying that by allowing subsidised new capacity at Ekostahl, Brussels had not grasped the nettle. Mr Sainsbury had told fellow ministers 'no agreement would be better than a bad agreement' on subsidies. Denmark, Luxembourg and France are understood to have some objections to the east German and Spanish plans.   Companies:-  Ilva.     Ekostahl.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

He now  divides his year between Tokyo, where he is an editorial writer for the Japan  Times, and London, where he is correspondent for Tokyo Business Today.      There are two aspects of the Margaret Thatcher phenomenon -- neither of which  is addressed in this splendid British biography -- that every thinking American  needs to keep in mind when assessing the achievements of this remarkable woman.    First is her contribution to global diplomacy. A quarter of a century after  Dean Acheson's remark that ""Great Britain has lost an Empire and has not yet  found a role"" (as Truman's secretary of state he would have known), Thatcher  has created a noble task for her country: keeping American foreign policy on  course.    When the Bush Administration was struggling to acquire its sea legs earlier  this year, it was Thatcher who traveled to South Africa to urge reform on P. W.  Botha and patience from the front-line states. It was she who went to Germany  to try and win Helmut Kohl's cooperation in the modernization of NATO's  short-range nuclear arsenal. Above all, Thatcher demonstrated that the  psychological advantage in the arms-reduction stakes was not the exclusive  possession of Mikhail Gorbachev.    Our need for her persists. Never was this more evident than during her recent  trip to Japan. As the result of Ronald Reagan's departure from the White House  and Mike Mansfield's from our embassy in Tokyo, America and Japan have begun to  drift toward the Pacific's worse diplomatic crisis since the autumn of 1941.    At this sensitive hour, the world's free-trading system and the Western  alliance have suffered for lack of an eloquent and forceful voice to speak in  defense of that system and that alliance. Here, as elsewhere, the British  leader has attempted to fill the breach.    The second feature of the Thatcher revolution that Americans should ponder is  how she has exercised power. Contrary to jolly talk by American conservatives  about electing Thatcher President here, her reign (the word is not used  lightly) demonstrates the profound gap between American and British conceptions  of the limits of state power. To the notion of Thatcher as an ""elected  dictator,"" I shall return.    This is a frankly revisionist view. It sees Thatcher as the new Metternich (the  19th-Century master of the diplomatic finesse), as a power-driven politician  and as a militant Puritan. In this same revisionist mold, Hugo Young, the  distinguished British journalist, has performed a brilliant dissection of the  notion of Thatcher as a conservative icon.    In ""The Iron Lady,"" Young traces the winding staircase of fortune that  transformed the younger daughter of a provincial English grocer into the  greatest woman political leader since Catherine the Great. It is without  question the best of a bevy of new Thatcher biographies that set out the often  surprising, always dramatic story of the British political revolution of the  1980s.    It also will leave the thinking conservative scratching his head. To read Young  is to discover that certain suspect analogies have informed the American  perception of Thatcher as a conservative heroine.    Neither the assumption that Thatcher's road to Damascus parallels Ronald  Reagan's own timely evolution from New Deal enthusiast to conservative  idealogue, nor the thesis that the Iron Lady took the Tory party by storm in a  political coup a la Barry Goldwater, survives Young's analysis.    In ideological terms, the author makes it clear that, her paternal education in  conservative sentiment aside, not only did Thatcher come to the true faith much  later than Reagan, but that between 1959 (when she first entered Parliament)  and her crucial battle with Edward Heath for leadership of the Tory party in  1974, Thatcher had barely two conservative ideas to rub together. No fully  armed Athena emerging from the head of F. A. Hayek was she.    Young makes a persuasive case for the view that Thatcher's less-than-true-blue  ideology was mirrored in her policies. As minister of education in the 1970-74  Heath government, she was not only a vigorous abolisher of private schools but  also one of the great spenders of taxpayers' money. Later, as shadow  environment secretary, her ideas were distinctly interventionist.    Even after Thatcher became party leader in 1975 -- almost by accident --  realism and power politics, not conservative ideals, defined her program. The  Tory campaign manifesto drawn up for the 1979 election that made Thatcher prime  minister, in Young's words, ""openly contemplated the perpetuation of the  comfortable welfare state."" The only company nominated by Thatcher's team for  denationalization was the National Freight Corp., and this from the people who  much later made ""privatization"" one of the household words of the age.    What transformed Thatcher into a conservative revolutionary was the capture of  power. Cunningly seized, then almost lost in the run-up to the 1982 Falklands  war, it was only finally secured in the triumphant aftermath of her smashing  1983 victory at the polls.    In this twilight struggle for domination, it was not only the party's  influential ""wets"" who stood in Thatcher's way but also Britain's formidable  higher bureaucracy. Young observes that ""There was a genuine clash of cultures,  between an almost Cromwellian impatience with the status quo (on the part of  the Thatcherites) and the mandarin world of Whitehall, in which skepticism and  rumination were more highly rated habits of mind than zeal or blind  conviction.""    The motif of ""Cromwellian impatience"" bears brooding on. Cromwell was the  17th-Century Puritan general who shattered royal power in Britain. By spilling  the blood of Charles I, Cromwell hammered home the doctrine of parliamentary  supremacy. He helped make Britain a ""more perfect"" unitary state: a nation with  but a single supreme unit of government.    For American conservatives, this is more than a lesson in foreign history. It  was against Cromwell's legacy of centralized power that our forefathers  revolted in 1776, but this same Cromwellian inheritance, adapted to modern  circumstance, has been a crucial instrument in Thatcher's drive to force the  British to be free.    Thatcher's achievement of almost dictatorial powers since 1983 forms the key  chapter in the secret history of her reign. The implied paradox has been nicely  captured by a recent British assessment of the last six years titled ""The Free  Economy and the Strong State: The Politics of Thatcherism"" by Andrew Gamble.  Pace our conservative-minded pundits, this is not the American way.    More to the point, it may not be the British way much longer. Despite  Thatcher's own ambition to go ""on and on,"" Young argues that in fact her era  has come and gone. The most revisionist thesis of all holds that Thatcher's  place in the history books is gloriously secure, but that it also is time for  Britain to look elsewhere for leadership.

This has given people the wrong impression, as if only he  wants to develop ""democracy"" in Hong Kong. He even asked:  ""What is wrong with expanding democracy?"" and ""Why is China  opposed to it?"" In fact, he feigns ignorance. As everyone  knows, over the past 150 years the British Empire has not  allowed Hong Kong people to enjoy democracy. Why is it so  interested in ""democracy"" now? There must be more to this than  meets the eye.    I. From Margaret Thatcher's Original Concept to Chris  Patten's ""Constitutional Reform Proposal""    As far back as the early 1980's, the then British Prime  Minister Mrs. Thatcher had a concept, which was: ""We should  develop Hong Kong's democratic structure. Our objective is to  allow Hong Kong to become independent or practice self-rule  within a short period of time.... This makes it necessary to  set up in Hong Kong a government with more distinctive Chinese  characteristics in which Britain will increasingly become  subordinate. We also should possibly consider a referendum as  an acceptable system there"" (see Margaret Thatcher's memoirs  ""The Downing Street Years""). This passage clearly shows that  Britain has long wanted to turn Hong Kong into an independent or  semi-independent political entity to continue the British rule  there in a disguised form after 1997. However, given the firm  stand of the Chinese Government and people that all sovereignty  over Hong Kong must be recovered in 1997, she had to retreat and  eventually agree to sign the ""Sino-British Joint Declaration on  the Question of Hong Kong"" and other relevant agreements. The  joint declaration explicitly stipulates: ""The Chinese  Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997."" ""The Government  of the United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to  the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997."" At the joint declaration  signing ceremony, Mrs. Thatcher also solemnly announced: ""I  pledge that the British Government will do its best to make the  agreement a success."" The signing and ratification of the  ""Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong""  has delivered the whole territory of Hong Kong from British  colonial rule and set it down permanently as China's territory  in terms of law. After the Hong Kong Basic Law was promulgated,  the British Foreign Office issued a statement of confirmation,  calling it an ""important milestone."" Subsequently, on many  occasions, the British side has also pledged to cause Hong  Kong's constitutional development to converge with the Basic Law.    However, with the approach of 1997 and unwilling to withdraw  from the historical stage, the British Government has suddenly  made a U-turn in its stand toward the question of Hong Kong and,  through the new Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, dished out the  ""three violations"" ""constitutional reform proposal."" The ""three  violations"" refers to violation of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the relevant agreements and understandings reached  between China and Britain, and the principle agreed upon by both  parties of the convergence of Hong Kong's political system and  the Basic Law.    It should be pointed out that before Chris Patten took up  his  post as Hong Kong governor in July 1992, a ""Mission to Hong Kong  By the International Jurists Commission"" headed by William  Goodhart of Britain, engaged in extensive activities in Hong  Kong in June 1991. After returning to Britain, the delegation  wrote a 100,000-word report entitled ""Countdown to 1997--Report  of a Mission to Hong Kong"" (hereinafter the ""Report"").  Reviewing the British Hong Kong policy from politics, law, and  other aspects, the ""Report"" launched an all-out attack on the  Basic Law and, in conclusion, put forward 45 ""conclusions and  suggestions."" Whoever leafs through the ""Report,"" especially  its ""conclusions and suggestions,"" can see that Britain has  never given up the aforesaid original concept of Mrs. Thatcher.  That is the fundamental reason why the Chinese and British  Governments have failed to reach any agreement despite 17 rounds  of talks, held between 22 April and 27 November 1993, on the  question of the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements in Hong  Kong.    II. ""Countdown to 1997"" Provides a ""Reform Prototype"" for  Patten's ""Constitutional Reform""    To better understand the contents and objectives of Patten's  ""constitutional reform proposal,"" it is necessary to examine it  in tandem with the ""Report.""    First of all, the ""Report"" reviews the greatest error in the  British Hong Kong policy, holding that ""before holding talks on  and before signing the joint declaration,"" the British  Government should have held a `referendum' in Hong Kong, and  that it also ""gave open, customary, indolent, and tacit consent""  to the Basic Law (see ""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 5 and p  115 of the original report). On this count, the authors say  with great sympathy: ""Given the current situation, it is no  longer practical to exercise the right to self-determination  effectively."" (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 7). What,  then, is to be done? The authors suggest that, first, we  ""should replace the 18 appointed Legislative Councillors whose  terms of office end at the end of 1993 with directly elected  councillors from 18 geographical constituencies"" (""Conclusions  and Suggestions"" No. 15) and ""implement an overall geographical  constituency electoral system in the 1995 Legislative Council  [Legco] elections"" (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 13). In so  doing, the authors have completely abolished the functions of  functional constituencies and the Election Committee in the 1994  and 1995 elections as agreed by both parties, deliberately  violated the provision of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] that the SAR's first Legco should be  composed proportionately of councillors elected by functional  groups, those elected through the Election Committee, and those  directly elected in geographical constituencies, and violated  the commitment repeatedly made by Britain that the Hong Kong  constitutional development should converge with the Basic Law.  This is absolutely identical with what Patten is doing now.    What is particularly interesting is that the ""Report""  authors had long expected that in doing so there would probably  be no ""through train."" But the ""Report"" categorically states:  ""The benefit of the `through train' to Hong Kong is not the  most important one and should not be taken as a reason for  giving up comprehensive democratic elections in 1995""  (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 16). You may well see how  harmonious they are with each other. Readers are likely to ask:  Since there is no `through train,' what is the point of the  British Hong Kong authorities insisting on such an election as  suggested in the ""Report""? In fact, there is great  significance. Mrs. Thatcher has laid bare the secret with her  aforesaid remarks. In truth, they want to make Britain  ""subordinate"" in the remaining 2 to 3 years and produce a Legco  fully elected by Hong Kong compatriots to pursue a series of  ""reforms"" in opposition to the Basic Law and thus create chaos  and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and peaceful  transition. In doing so they can fish in troubled waters and  even stage a comeback someday.    We can have a complete understanding of this point if we  look  at the series of ""suggestions"" listed in the ""Report."" First,  the ""Report"" directs the spearhead of its attack at the  relationship between the central people's government and the  future Hong Kong SAR. It is opposed to the provision in the  Basic Law that the chief executive is to be appointed by the  central people's government, calling for a ""chief executive  directly elected by the masses"" or ""making a choice between a  directly elected chief executive and a directly elected  government"" (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 17); says that  ""the chief executive should be responsible to the SAR  legislature"" rather than ""responsible to the PRC"" (""Conclusions  and Suggestions"" No. 18); and calls for ""restricting the  provision that the courts of Hong Kong shall have no  jurisdiction over acts of state such as defense and foreign  affairs"" (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 19) as laid down in  Article 19 of the Basic Law. It also negates the role of the  Basic Law as the future SAR's constitution, claiming that the  power of interpretation of whether the clauses of the Basic Law  are applicable to the SAR and whether Hong Kong laws contravene  the Basic Law ""should be shifted from the National People's  Congress [NPC] Standing Committee to the Hong Kong courts""  (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 20). They have made a clean  breast of their intentions in those few points. We should like  to ask: If the chief executive is neither appointed by, nor  responsible to, the central people's government but is only  responsible to the Hong Kong legislature; if the right of  adjudication and the right of interpretation of such things as  whether the laws formulated by the Hong Kong legislature  contravene the Basic Law and whether the clauses of the Basic  Law are applicable to the SAR are not vested in the NPC Standing  Committee but in Hong Kong courts, will not Hong Kong turn into  a political entity completely independent of the central  people's government? What is there in common with Hong Kong as  an SAR of the PRC? Will not the provision in the ""Sino-British  Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong"" that the ""PRC  has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  with effect from 1 July 1997"" come to naught?    Although Chris Patten still dares not make such suggestions,  he has spread the news that ""before and after 1997  administrative work should be responsible to the legislature.""  What a phrase ""before and after 1997"" is! This is by no means  a slip of the tongue. If the Hong Kong executive organ is  responsible only to the Hong Kong legislature after 1997, will  this not coincide with the aforesaid suggestion in the ""Report""?    III. Let's See What Actions Chris Patten Will Take in the  Next 2 to 3 Years?    In addition to making ""suggestions"" about the 1994 and 1995  elections and the relationship between the future chief  executive and legislature and the central people's government,  which are totally out of keeping with the Basic Law, the  ""Report"" also sets a keynote for the ""reforms"" Patten should  accomplish in the next 2 to 3 years.    People know that even though Hong Kong compatriots have  acquired ""British Dependent Territories Citizens"" [BDTC] status  in the past, it is very difficult for them to secure British  nationality and the right of abode in Britain. Contrary to  previous practice, the ""Report"" authors now suggest that as  regards all BDTCs in Hong Kong: ""No matter what practical  difficulties it has, Britain has in principle the obligation to  let them enjoy the right of abode in Britain proper or an  acceptable third country"" (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 9).  Why do they make such a suggestion? Because it was stipulated  in the ""British Memorandum on the 1984 Sino-British Joint  Declaration"" that all persons who are BDTCs before 30 June 1997  ""will cease to be BDTCs with effect from 1 July 1997"" ""without  conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom."" It is  also stipulated in the Chinese Memorandum that ""under the  Nationality Law of the PRC, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots,  whether they are holders of `BDTC' Passports' or not, are  Chinese nationals."" Obviously, the ""Report"" authors hold that  such a practice will considerably reduce Britain's influence in  Hong Kong after 1997. Originally, China and Britain had reached  initial agreement on the nationality and right of abode of BDTCs  and this has been overthrown by the ""Report"" authors.    The ""Report"" suggests: ""The Hong Kong BDTCs of non-Chinese  origin who have no right of abode outside Hong Kong should be  immediately granted British nationality and right of abode in  Britain"" (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 10); the Hong Kong  BDTCs of Chinese origin, including those who applied for  naturalized BDTC after the signing of the joint declaration on  19 December 1984, should be given right of abode (""Conclusions  and Suggestions"" No. 11); and that the deadline for going  through such a procedure may be extended to six years after the  transition of Hong Kong sovereignty in 1997 and can be further  extended if necessary (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 12).  Very obviously, in making such suggestions, the ""Report""  authors want to rope in large numbers of Hong Kong people,  encouraging them to have a free hand in acting according to  Britain's will before and after 1997. If they should finally  find it really impossible to muddle along they need not worry as  they have a place of retreat in Britain.    In addition, the ""Report"" also takes ""human rights"" as an  important weapon against the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong by the PRC. The ""Report"" especially stresses the  importance of the British Parliament formulating the  ""Regulations for Implementing the Bill of Rights"" and placing  them above the Basic Law. It claims that they should not be  rescinded or restricted even after 1997 (""Conclusions and  Suggestions"" No. 34) and that, if all or some of the current  statutes contravene the regulations, they should be rescinded or  amended (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 33). Obviously, the  ""Report"" authors seem to forget that the British Hong Kong  Government's rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997 and  that the legal basis for maintaining their power after that date  will disappear. By that time, ""the system, policies, and laws  practiced after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR will be  based on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR"" (Resolution from  the Third Session of the Seventh NPC); ""the law previously in  force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity,  ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary law shall be  maintained, except for any that contravene this law and subject  to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR""  (Article 8 of the Basic Law). We should like to ask, is there  any reason to place the regulations formulated by the British  Parliament above the Basic Law and extend their validity beyond  1997 without subjecting them to examination? The ""Report""  authors also suggest that, before 1997, it is necessary to  ""spare no effort in implementing"" the regulations (""Conclusions  and Suggestions"" No. 35); ""set up a powerful Human Rights  Commission"" in Hong Kong (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 37);  and that ""Britain should accept the jurisdiction of the  `Optional Protocol on the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights' on behalf of Hong Kong"" (""Conclusions and  Suggestions"" No. 42). It even suggests that ""the International  Jurists Commission or the International Federation of Human  Rights Organizations should speedily set up an independent body  to supervise progress in Hong Kong's human rights situation""  (""Conclusions and Suggestions"" No. 41) and so on. Obviously,  using ""human rights"" to interfere in another country's internal  affairs is a special weapon of hegemonists in recent years and  the ""Report"" authors do not forget to use it either. Hong Kong  compatriots should rest assured that, in line with the Basic  Law, all Hong Kong compatriots will enjoy much fuller human and  civil rights than they have done during the rule by the British  Empire. Naturally, if a small number of people who, with  ulterior motives, take advantage of human rights to engage in  sabotage activities in a vain attempt to pull Hong Kong onto the  path of independence and separation, this will be impermissible  under the Basic Law and will not be tolerated by the future Hong  Kong SAR. As everybody knows, as far back as 1982 when starting  talks with Britain on the future of Hong Kong, the Chinese  Government explicitly stated: After resuming sovereignty over  Hong Kong, China will pursue the principles and policies of ""one  country, two systems, `Hong Kong people running Hong Kong,' and  ""a high degree of self-autonomy."" After 1997, Hong Kong will  practice immeasurably better democracy than that under British  rule. Over the past 100 years and more, the governor has always  arrogated all authority to himself and there has been absolutely  no democracy to speak of in Hong Kong.    As stated above, the ""Report,"" which is entitled  ""Countdown,""  helps people, to a certain extent, understand Britain's current  and future policies toward Hong Kong, as well as Patten's  ""constitutional reform proposal."" People will wait and see how  Patten acts next.    IV. Concluding Remarks    Hong Kong bears witness to the history of colonial  aggression  in which the Western colonialists were the first to open China's  gate and the last to leave China. The fact that the Chinese  nation has suffered humiliation and oppression at the hands of  Western powers over the past 150 years has something to do with  this. The day to thoroughly cleanse all remnants of colonialism  in China will finally arrive soon. At this historical juncture,  as the elite of Hong Kong society, Legco members who assume  heavy historical responsibility, should first stand out and  boycott Patten's ""constitutional reform proposal"" so that all  his plans will come to naught. Only in this way can they have a  clear conscience toward their forefathers and future  generations. All Hong Kong compatriots loving the motherland  should fight in unity and make persistent efforts to boycott all  ""separate elections"" Chris Patten may launch. Let Patten and  his like ""count down"" because their countdown can only result in  ""zero,"" while before us is a more thriving and prosperous Hong  Kong and a more thriving and prosperous great motherland. With  hands and hearts linked together, let us usher in the arrival of  the great historical date of 1 July 1997!     "

But I'm not too convinced that German unification, though often cited as the culprit, is the fundamental problem. Sure, this has led to German interest rates, both short and long, remaining high at a time of cyclical downturn in output and demand - but only because of what the Bundesbank considers excessive fiscal expansionism by Bonn (justifiably when you consider current German inflation). It need not have been so had Bonn evolved a more thought-out policy towards unification. But this is like saying that the Germans, who panic when confronted by anything so organisationally imperfect as the former East Germany, should not be German. The crisis in western Europe stems more from the simple fact that a cheap labour area has opened up to the east. This is akin to flying China over by helicopter and dumping it on top of the formerly frozen communist world the other side of the Berlin Wall. There are few west European industries that are so non-labour intensive that they can compete with the wage costs in east Europe. These are well below the equivalent of DM5 a month, compared to DM40 in west Germany, and around DM30 elsewhere in the EC, according to the IW Institute of Cologne. Perhaps it is time for west Europeans to realise how uncompetitive they have been. Perhaps it is time to wake up to the world's real challenges - environment, famine, Aids, underdevelopment - and begin to confront them in a more responsible manner. One thing Britain has to realise in this whole equation is that it is no use getting out the paddles and rowing off toward the US. Britain may be separated by water from the Continent, but its industries face precisely the same challenges. It is high time, therefore, for the UK government to cease jeering from the sidelines and construct policies, not separate from, but in common with its European partners.

Trident's total explosive power would be 'not much changed' from Polaris, he said. He set a ceiling of 96 nuclear warheads per submarine, however, twice the maximum number on Polaris boats. In a keynote speech on nuclear policy in London he said the actual number deployed could be 'significantly fewer' than 96. Previously the maximum was set at 128 warheads per submarine - eight for each of 16 Trident missiles. The new policy 'should lay to rest comments and speculation about Trident representing a major growth in the size of the UK's nuclear armoury,' Mr Rifkind added. When Trident was fully in service the UK's nuclear stockpile would be 25 per cent lower than in 1990, he said. He denied that financial considerations influenced the decision and said savings would be 'very modest indeed' compared with the Pounds 10bn overall cost of the Trident programme. He did not believe the change would directly affect jobs among the 6,700 employees of the Aldermaston-based Atomic Weapons Establishment. But the recent abandonment of plans to develop a new air-launched missile would bring 'a change of focus' there. Mr Rifkind also made the clearest statement to date of government support for a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests. The UK was ready 'to participate fully and constructively' in negotiations to secure a ban, he said. The proposed ban, regarded by some scientists as threatening the UK's capacity to design nuclear weapons, is seen as an important gesture by the nuclear powers in their effort to secure renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995. Mr Rifkind said Britain would press for an indefinite extension of the treaty, designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Although complete disarmament was 'a desirable ultimate goal', Mr Rifkind said it was essential for Britain to keep full-scale strategic nuclear arms and less potent sub-strategic weapons. Trident would be adapted to fulfil both both functions. Mr Rifkind, who emphasised growing nuclear co-operation with France, said Nato should not abandon the right to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles now facing UK companies British officials displayed a stiff upper lip in response to Malaysia's action yesterday. Aides to Mr John Major, the prime minister, dismissed talk of retaliatory sanctions, insisting it was 'far too early' to say how Britain might respond. 'The British government does not tell the British press what to write, and our trade relations with Malaysia really have nothing to do with what the British press decides to print,' said a senior official. However, Downing Street is uncomfortably aware that Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has placed successful bets on this course before. Attention in Britain has focused on the 'Buy British Last' row in the early 1980s, when Malaysia instituted a near-boycott of UK goods in retaliation for London's decision to end subsidies for foreign students. The dispute was eventually ended after a long campaign for better relations by Mrs Margaret Thatcher (now Baroness Thatcher), who was then the British prime minister. Lady Thatcher later described her close relationship with Dr Mahathir: 'I hope that I am not presuming in describing him as a friend, whose counsel I have found invaluable, as well as a very skilful and tough negotiator for Malaysia's interests.' But that row was over an issue of substance - the cost of sending Malaysian students to London. The new row, triggered by Malaysian dislike of British press reports, has more in common with two other disputes. which had different endings. The first blew up in 1990, when Dr Mahathir took offence over a fictional drama series, called Embassy, broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The series, set in an Australian embassy in a fictional south-east Asian country called Ragaan, was filmed in Fiji and did not mention Malaysia. Nevertheless, Dr Mahathir interpreted the programme as an insult to Malaysians, and threatened to retaliate with a trade boycott against Australia. Initially, Mr Bob Hawke, then Australian prime minister, took a similar line to Downing Street - that the government was not responsible for what the ABC chose to broadcast. But the row escalated until Mr Hawke went to Kuala Lumpur in 1991 to deliver what was seen in Australia as a demeaning apology. Last year Malaysia made life equally uncomfortable for Mr Hawke's successor, Mr Paul Keating, who was unwise enough to describe Dr Mahathir as 'recalcitrant' for refusing to attend a Pacific Rim summit in Seattle. Dr Mahathir imposed restrictions on contacts with Australia and hinted that he might downgrade diplomatic relations. Again, the row was ended by an Australian apology, reluctantly delivered by Mr Keating. Then, as now, Dr Mahathir, chose to lay most of the blame on the media: 'Some newspapers made me out to be a difficult person and very unpopular and that Malaysia was about to burst into racial violence,' he said. 'How can Australia claim to be part of Asia when Australian journalists lack manners?' But Mr Keating eventually wrote a personal letter to Dr Mahathir and twice publicly expressed regret for his remark. Nonetheless, it was felt in Australia at the time that damage had been done to business confidence in the relationship. Aides to Mr John Major know that there would be great political dangers for the British prime minister if he was forced to deliver anything approaching an apology to end the row. Whether Dr Mahathir will push the dispute that far is not clear. But his brinkmanship with Australia shows his determination to avenge anything seen as a slur. 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous,' he said last year. 'In order to be known, you have to be nasty.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.

Statistics from the General Administration of Customs show  that the total trade volume between China and Japan last year  reached 39.04 billion U.S. dollars.    Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland's biggest trading partner in  1992, now is second on the list, followed by the United States.    The mainland's trade volume with Hong Kong and the United  States last year was 32.54 billion U.S. dollars and 27.65  billion U.S. dollars respectively.    The figure for Sino-U.S. trade in 1993 rose by more than 10  billion U.S. dollars over the preceding year.    The volume of indirect trade between the Chinese mainland  and  Taiwan province rose to 14.39 billion U.S. dollars, placing the  province fourth on the list, one position ahead of Germany.    China's trade ties with Germany developed at a steady pace  and bilateral trade volume last year surpassed 10 billion U.S.  dollars for the first time. Germany is also China's largest  trading partner among the European Economic Community countries.    Although trade volume between China and the Republic of  Korea  (ROK) last year failed to reach 10 billion U.S. dollars as was  expected, ROK still has become China's sixth largest trading  partner, surpassing Russia, which dropped from sixth to seventh  place.    The trade volume between China and ROK last year was 8.22  billion U.S. dollars, some 540 million U.S. dollars more than  the figure for that between China and Russia.    The eighth and the ninth trading partners of the Chinese  mainland in 1993 were still Singapore and Italy, with which  China's trade increased steadily.    Canada, China's tenth largest trade partner in 1992, was  replaced by Britain on the list. Trade between China and  Britain last year was 3.59 billion U.S. dollars.    According to customs statistics, China registered a trade  deficit with all top ten trading partners except for Hong Kong,  the United States and Britain.    The Chinese mainland faced a deficit of 11.47 billion U.S.  dollars last year in its indirect trade with Taiwan province,  while its trade deficit with Japan was 7.47 billion U.S. dollars.    The statistics also show that China enjoyed a favorable  balance of trade with Hong Kong, the United States and Britain.    China's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the United States  last year was 11.58 billion U.S. dollars and 6.27 billion U.S.  dollars respectively.     "

Mr Anthony Galsworthy, Britain's senior representative within the Sino-British airport committee, said 'they criticised most aspects of (the) proposals, but they put forward no ideas of any kind of their own'. Britain had suggested injecting an extra Dollars HK40bn (Pounds 3bn) in revenue from land sales connected to the airport infrastructure, in an adaptation of China's own proposals. China's main concerns were over the possibility that Hong Kong might be saddled with airport-related debt after 1997 when sovereignty of the colony reverts to China. The latest proposals were viewed as a more cost-effective strategy, which would at least buy the support of China. The only interpretation of China's latest refusal to play ball is that the discussions are now purely about politics and not economics. There had been little expectation of any resolution of the dispute before Governor Chris Patten's visit to Beijing next week. The proposals had been met with a barrage of criticism from pro-Beijing newspapers that only weeks before had been offering similar ideas as a workable solution. Mr Galsworthy indicated that Britain would not be calling for a further meeting. 'I think it is impractical for the British side constantly to produce new proposals which the Chinese side then reject. If they don't like our proposals, we would expect them to produce some ideas of their own,' he said. Mr Patten has said that if China wanted to go ahead, a decision could be reached in a morning, over a cup of coffee. But he has six weeks to get to the coffee table before the close of the deadline for the Dollars 9bn airport site formation contract. Beyond November, this contract might have to be re-tendered, resulting in the escalating costs that the Chinese negotiators claim to be most anxious to avoid.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Just hours after accusing the police of gambling with  peoples' lives over the Heathrow airport mortar attacks, the  Provisionals said there had to be discussions if there was any  chance of an end to the violence.    The IRA was prepared to be flexible and positive in  exploring  potential for moving the peace process forward. But the lines  of communication between the two sides would have to reopen.    In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA said: ""The  continued opportunity for peace should not be squandered. There  is an urgent need to re-focus attention and to move the peace  process forward.""    Although the Provisionals have yet to make a definitive  response to the Downing St declaration reached between Mr Major  and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds three months ago, this  is as close as they have come to acknowledging that the  agreement clearly is not enough to persuade them to stop their  campaign.    The bomb attacks at Heathrow effectively confirmed that, but  the terrorists said they were still interested in trying to  reach a settlement with Britain.    Secret contacts between the IRA and the Government stopped  last November after disclosures that the two sides were in  discussions.    The Provisionals claimed they had been prepared to call a  fortnight's ceasefire the previous May to try and help reach  some sort of settlement.    But they alleged the Government walked away from the offer  of  a truce because of the need for Ulster Unionist support to  survive the Maastricht vote.    Tonight, the IRA tonight said its attitude to the peace  initiative between the SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party]  leader John Hume and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was  positive and flexible. It was also abiding and enduring.    But there was a responsibility on Britain to move from what  it described as ""its current negative stance."" The people of  Britain and Ireland deserved better, they claimed.    The statement said: ""We, our supporters and activists have a  vested interest in achieving a just and lasting peace in  Ireland. We are prepared to be flexible in exploring the  potential for peace. All concerned should leave no stone  unturned. Our objectives which include the recognition and the  exercise of the Irish people's right to national  self-determination are well known.

Viswam: ""A Highly Successful Mission""]    [Text] New Delhi, March 17--""Mission accomplished""--could  well be the sentiment governing the outcome of the Prime  Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's ""highly successful"" visit to the  United Kingdom, from where he flew home on Thursday to continue  the implementation of the ""middle path"" in India's economic  reforms.    Mr Rao's visit to Britain was reciprocal in nature. He was  returning the visit to India paid by his counterpart, Mr John  Major in January 1993. Since it was made at a time when  Indo-British relations are marked by an unexpected absence of  rancour or recrimination, it was also in the nature of a  goodwill visit. The current phase in bilateral relations is  characterised by a new level in mutual understanding and  cordiality. That by itself is noteworthy as an example of a free  nation and its erstwhile colonial master working together in the  global arena.    There were no political problems to be sorted out which  necessitated a prime ministerial visit. Therefore, the mission  to London had another objective, namely, to elevate and broaden  the economic cooperation between the two countries. British  media described the visit as a business-oriented one and talked  in glowing terms about how London was taking or planned to take  full advantage of the economic liberalisation programmes of  India.    British big business looked at the visit with a kindly eye  and good favour. Mr Rao's mission to do the spadework for  attracting more and more British investment in India can be said  to have been successfully achieved. In Mr Rao's own words, a  positive and constructive thrust had been given by his visit to  Indo-British political and economic cooperation.    One noticed that throughout his four-day stay in Britain,  the  contentious issues which normally form the subject of high-level  discussions during any interaction between India and countries  of the West were either absent or were touched upon only  peripherally. Even the present-day controversial themes like  human rights, Kashmir, Pakistan and nuclear non-proliferation,  over which India is usually at the receiving end were raised and  got out of the way quickly, without their impact being felt on  bilateral relations.    Instead, the accent was more on investment and how the two  countries would like to play the game, almost a new one for  India, of investing and reaping profits. It is not without  significance therefore that the Indian co-chairman of the  Indo-British Partnership Initiative (IBPI), Mr J.J. Irani of  TISCO [Tata Iron and Steel Company] described the current status  of the initiative as ""the wicket is full of runs"" and the  British co-chairman, Sir Robert Evans of British Gas responded  by declaring that the IBPI had a good innings and ""we intend to  stay at the crease.""    Symbolising this mutual desire to continue the partnership  is  the emergence of the unique document signed during Mr Rao's  visit--Indo-UK bilateral agreement on promotion and protection  of investments. It is unique because this is the first time in  India's post-Independence history that it has entered into such  an agreement with any country. It is also unique because the  current size of Indian investment in Britain--a dozen or so  joint ventures--would not have warranted the demand for  protection. There is a certain measure of logic for Britain to  seek such protection. India is a new entrant to the free market  and its entry is not marked by across-the-board political  endorsement in the country. Knowing that the outcome of the  elections in India can never be predicted, and that there is  always the possibility of the ballot returning to power a party  which may not want to remain in the free market, Britain has  good reason to seek protection for its investments in India. The  agreement gives them that guarantee and assures them there is no  danger of their investments being nationalised or their profits  denied repatriation. The agreement itself is a comprehensive  document covering a wide range of investments including  Intellectual Property Rights. It would ensure that the foreign  and domestic investors were treated at par in so far as  compensations to investors in specific situations were concerned.    Though IBPI has had extraordinary success during the first  year of its operation, the exchange of views between a  delegation of Indian businessmen and British industrialists  during Mr Rao's visit to London showed that the British continue  to have reservations about the course of the economic reforms.  For instance, the Indian labour laws generated considerable  interest. Some British participants pointed out that India  should not take its superior competitiveness in some areas for  granted as over-manning led to increased costs which eroded  competitiveness. Dr Irani said that labour relations in India is  an extremely sensitive subject which had to be handled with  care. In other words, while he appreciated the British concern,  he could not guarantee an exit policy which would suit the  investors. Similarly, British businessmen who were interested in  the opening of the insurance sector in India wanted to know  whether the Government of India would be open to suggestions  from them with regard to further reform and whether the  liquidity ratios would be favourable to foreign insurance  companies.    Mr Narasimha Rao appears to have returned home convinced  that  Mr John Major would encourage and bless the private sector  investor to go to India on a much larger scale than they are  coming now. The implication of his prognosis of improved  Indo-British economic cooperation, therefore, means that he  found the climate favourable for attracting a greater volume of  investment. A good beginning in this direction was made during  his visit. The names of the companies involved in the MoUs  signed speak for themselves. They are all stable and powerful  industrial units like Rolls Royce, GEC, GPT and Peebles  Electric. Their involvement in India would add prestige to  Indo-British economic cooperation. When big companies come in on  their own assured of a fair return, medium and small-sized  companies are sure to follow.    Thus, it would seem that Mr Rao's visit generated among  British businessmen the necessary confidence in the direction of  the economic reforms and the soundness of the current policies.  This is a major gain from the visit. It is not everyday that a  British Premier hosts a lunch in honour of a visiting Prime  Minister and the guest list shows a preponderance of both Indian  and British businessmen. The very fact that the two Prime  Ministers jointly received the progress report of the IBPI from  the two co-chairmen automatically gave the venture full official  backing. This was reassuring to Indian and British businessmen  alike.    On the political front too, there were gains. Terrorism  needs  to be deplored, wherever it occurs. But the mortar attacks by  the Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorists on Heathrow,  necessitating the diversion of the Prime Minister's aircraft to  Gatwick for his arrival, and the choice of a Royal Air Force  (RAF) air base for his departure, underlined a point India has  been making for the last several years. Terrorism's targets,  whether they are Indians or British, are equal sufferers. As the  Prime Minister pointed out, being themselves the victims of  terrorism, the British were in a better position now to  appreciate India's concerns. The implications of Pakistan's  abetment of terrorism in the Kashmir Valley, therefore, did not  have to be explained by Mr Rao to his hosts nor did he need to  be apologetic about the pressures he is under in Kashmir.    The British position on Kashmir has been well known to  India.  Three points constitute this position: (I) resumption of a  substantive Indo-Pakistan dialogue on the basis of the Shimla  Agreement; (II) initiation of the political process in Kashmir;  and (III) cessation of external support to militants. This  position, first outlined by Mr Douglas Hurd in October 1992 has  since been reiterated several times both at the official and  political levels.    The Kashmir issue was not on the agenda of the summit  meeting  this time in London: it came up in passing, by way of  information-sharing on the current situation. And the British  were satisfied by Mr Rao's confirmation that preliminary  measures are already on hand to initiate the political process  in Kashmir. Mr Rao has returned home reasonably assured that  the British are unlikely to make a song and dance about Kashmir  and Indo-Pakistan relations in the near future.    The British role in Geneva at the time of the voting on  Pakistan's resolution was particularly helpful to India. Britain  and Germany were able to prevail upon the other members of the  European Union not to support Pakistan. Even on the human rights  issue, the British position is mild compared to the strident one  of the United States. Thus, on the whole, the stage has been set  by Mr Rao's visit to Britain for not only enhanced cooperation  between the two countries but also for better mutual  understanding. Frequent high-level contacts always result in  this, and Mr Rao's just-concluded visit has been no exception.       "

It was the first time Mr Milosevic had expressed unequivocal backing for a peace initiative designed by the 'contact group' of five big powers. The group's foreign ministers conferred in Geneva at the weekend and pledged to ratchet up punitive measures against the Serbs, both in Bosnia and in Serbia, unless the plan was accepted. These did not include a lifting of the ban on arms sales to Bosnia's Moslem-led government, an idea strongly supported in the US. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday that Britain still opposed rescinding the embargo but would not veto the move if other countries insisted on it. He reaffirmed that Britain would pull out its troops if arms sales to Bosnia were authorised and said there were already serious concerns about the safety of the UK contingent. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has praised the Serbian president for helping the peace process. However senior British officials said the Milosevic administration was continuing to supply the Bosnian Serbs with fuel extracted in Serb-controlled areas of Croatia and then refined in Belgrade. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, complained that the measures announced in Geneva were too mild to force a change in Serb behaviour. The five ministers pledged to tighten sanctions against Serbia, and ensure tougher enforcement of the exclusion zones designed to protect Bosnian Moslems. This could eventually lead to an intensified use of Nato air power to protect Moslem safe havens. It might also lead to the establishment of more 'exclusion zones' - where heavy artillery are subject to air strikes - besides the two which exist already. The ministers said they would insist on closer monitoring of Serbia's borders, especially the frontier with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, through which goods have been passing. Mr Izetbegovic deplored the fact that the ministers made no explicit reference to military action against the Serbs, and questioned the effectiveness of economic measures.

Despite recent opinion polls, and the assumption between the lines of these two books - that the Tory Party has been in office so long that it is bound to fall in the next general election  -I would not bet against Major his producing an all-time record. The case for him is not easily acceptable to students and practitioners of politics. It is the case for weak government: incompetent, contradictory, but generally keeping the show on the road. Harold Wilson, with whose prime ministerial performance Major's has so much in common, described it thus: 'The best style of government is like rowing  - the ideal solution is to get the boat along as quickly as possible without turning it over.' Meanwhile, Wilson might have added, life goes on. So it is with Major who began by saying that Britain was at the heart of Europe, that the Maastricht treaty was 'game, set and match to Britain' and retreated into trying to hold his party together. One could say the same about British membership of the exchange rate mechanism: Major as chancellor took Britain in, Major as prime minister defended staying, and Major still as prime minister took Britain out. None of that is particularly to denigrate Major: Britain is clearly a hard country to govern, as Wilson discovered. Perhaps it is governed too much, not too little. It is also quite hard to write contemporary history. How contemporary is contemporary if it is to be considered history, and when do journalists shade into historians? The editors and writers of The Major Effect have made a decent attempt. Their aim was to examine how much or how little has changed in the British political system since the departure of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Yet there must be some reservations about their achievements. One is a tendency to look over the shoulder at the last opinion poll and forward to the next in case it produces a shift. There can be no assured judgments from writers like those. There are also some follies. Thus William Wallace writes in his essay on foreign policy that under the ownership of Conrad Black The Spectator 'revived to become the leading political weekly of the right'. One wonders about the size of the competition. The most intellectually distinguished piece is by Peter Jay, the economics editor of the BBC, on the economy; yet, as Jay admits, it has little to do with the theme of the book: it is a restatement of his own opposition to fixed exchange rates. Still, this must be one of the few published essays to pay tribute to Norman Lamont as chancellor. Jay thinks that Lamont was too loyal to Major in going along with ERM membership in the first place: he was Cardinal Wolsey to Henry VIII. Moreover, it was Lamont who introduced the unified budget - one of the biggest changes of the Major period and indeed in postwar budgeting. This week Lamont fought back. The most interesting piece is on law and the constitution by Simon Lee, Professor of Jurisprudence at Queen's University, Belfast. Lee points out that the courts and judicial reviews are gradually surpassing parliament in their political importance. There is, too, the challenge from Brussels and the European Parliament, with which Westminster has yet to come to terms. Both books are a little too kind to the Conservative Party to be considered wholly objective. The much longer Conservative Century draws its title from the number of elections the party has won in the last 95 years. One is reminded of looking at the results of the Boat Race: at a certain period Cambridge seemed dominant, then relentlessly Oxford began to catch up. More seriously, the book fails to distinguish between conservatism with a small and large 'c'. It is perfectly possible to regard Labour as more conservative than the Tories, which may explain the present threat from Tony Blair. Moreover, the writers take little account of chance and political cock-ups. The sequence of electoral victories might have been quite different (say) if Attlee had held on in 1951 when the economic boom could have come to Labour's rescue, if Harold Wilson had delayed a bit in 1970, and if Edward Heath had not gone to the country in February 1974. Above all, it fails to point out that the continued electoral success of the Conservative Party has partly depended on the existence of two oppositions. This was as true at the beginning of the century as it is now. Why Labour and Liberals do not learn from this is another matter. The Tories have usually had the edge on propaganda, but even there they do not always win. As Richard Cockett describes, in 1929 - well before Saatchi  Saatchi - the party employed JH Benson's, well known for its advertisements for Guinness. They came up with the very conservative slogan 'Safety First': the Tories lost.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.   Types:-  TECH  Products  Product use.

It emerged yesterday that the Ministry of Defence has turned down a request from Argentina to allow a limited supply of UK-manufactured spare parts to the Argentine navy, begun during the Gulf war, to continue. Whitehall has also vetoed a plan for an Argentine military transport aircraft to fly to Britain next month to collect some cargo assembled by the naval attache's office at the Argentine embassy in London. Argentine officials insist the cargo would have involved nothing more than a few boxes filled with books and military research periodicals, as well as brochures of British defence companies, normally sent via the diplomatic bag. But the planned trip by an aircraft which is normally used by the Argentine navy to transport military equipment would have almost certainly fuelled stiff opposition from the Falkland islanders and from MPs opposed to any suggestion of a 'sell-out' over the islands. Military ties between the two countries have been governed officially by an arms embargo imposed by Britain on Argentina following the outbreak of the Falklands war in 1982. During the Gulf war, however, London agreed to the supply of Rolls-Royce spare parts to the Argentine navy which operated with the allied forces. The parts were for Argentina's German-built destroyer Almirante Brown, which is powered by Rolls-Royce Olympus and Tyne gas turbines. They were drawn from Royal Navy stocks. Argentine officials had hoped the waiving of the arms embargo would pave the way for a more open policy on military relations. The Argentine navy is believed to be cutting the operational hours of vessels to minimise the use of equipment for which replacement parts are needed.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

It was announced last night in Washington by US officials that the US and Russia were today expected to issue formal invitations to the foreign ministries of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and to Palestinian leaders to resume Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington on April 20. But Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi told Reuters in Jerusalem that the talks would remain deadlocked as long as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, reserved the right to deport people. Israel deported 415 Palestinians to southern Lebanon in December and has so far refused to implement fully UN Security Council resolution 799 which calls for their immediate return. Mr Abdel-Shafi's assessment of the peace process came shortly before Britain added its diplomatic weight to efforts to get the talks restarted by meeting representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in London. Mr Douglas Hogg, minister at the Foreign Office, ended a two-year British ban on top-level contacts with the PLO in talks with Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian in the occupied territories, Mr Hael Fahoum, who heads the PLO European section in Tunis, and Mr Afif Safieh, its London representative. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said yesterday his government would not be following the British example because of disappointment at the PLO's failure to be of assistance on terrorism issues. Britain informed the US in advance that it was resuming ministerial contacts with the PLO and did not encounter any opposition. Israel, however, complained about the resumption of British contacts, arguing that it would damage the peace process. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, hoped that the British move and an earlier Belgian decision to upgrade the Palestinian mission in Brussels signalled a more positive European role in the peace process. Mr Hogg said after his meeting with the three Palestinians that they understood the importance of resuming bilateral negotiations with Israel. 'Further movement on the question of deportation would greatly facilitate their ability to come back into the talks,' he added. Mr Safieh described the meeting with Mr Hogg as 'warm, constructive and very promising'.   Countries:-  XNZ  Middle East.     ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT932-6997 ,"FT932-6997 _AN-DEZCHAC1FT 930526   FT  26 MAY 93 / Personal View: Britain wrong on human rights      By ANTHONY LESTER   September 3 is the 40th anniversary of the coming into force of the European Convention on Human Rights. There is much to celebrate. The convention is the jewel in the crown of the Council of Europe, an enlightened instrument for the collective enforcement of fundamental human rights. But a cloud hangs over the festivities, for the convention system is in danger of collapse, and the British government is hampering the reforms needed to save it. The crisis concerns the convention's enforcement machinery - the avenue for individuals to take their cases to the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg if their rights have been violated. The facts speak for themselves. It typically takes between five and six years from the time when an individual complains to Strasbourg until the court gives judgment. Since the claimant must have exhausted all effective remedies in his or her home country before complaining, the subject matter of the complaint may be six or more years old before it even reaches Strasbourg. A period of some 10 or more years in which to obtain a remedy for a violation of fundamental human rights is grossly excessive and constitutes a denial of justice. If a contracting state permitted delays of this length in national legal proceedings, it would be in manifest breach of article 6 of the convention. These problems will become even worse. From 1960 to 1983 the court gave a total of 76 judgments. In 1989 and 1990 alone the court gave 53 judgments. Within the past five years, the number of complaints made to Strasbourg has trebled. Five years ago, about 2,000 complaints were received annually; currently some 5,500 complaints are being received each year, and there is now a backlog of about 2,500 applications. The convention was conceived when the Council of Europe consisted of 10 member states. Future enlargement of the council to 35 or even 45 member states threatens its very existence as an effective enforcement mechanism. Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland have recently accepted the right of individual petition under the convention. Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia - the newest members - will doubtless follow suit. The list of new democracies from central and eastern Europe applying for membership includes Albania, Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine. A conservative forecast, based upon present experience, suggests that the number of complaints and registered cases is likely to double, if not treble, within the reasonably foreseeable future. The existing machinery cannot conceivably cope, and tinkering or half measures will not be enough to enable it to do so. Since 1985, two main reform proposals have been developed. First, there is a plan, supported by two-thirds of the member states of the Council of Europe, including France and Germany, to create a single, full-time European Court of Human Rights in place of the present two-tier system. This court would take over and absorb the functions of the Commission of Human Rights, which currently decides whether complaints are admissible. Second, there was a scheme put forward by the Netherlands and Sweden for a two-tier jurisdiction, with the commission operating as a court of first instance and the court acting as an appeal tribunal, subject to leave being granted. The case for a permanent and full-time court is cogent and compelling. A two-tier modification of the present system would not tackle the central weaknesses. It is likely that recourse to the second stage would become the rule, not the exception; and there would be continuing problems of wasteful duplication and unreasonable delay. Realising this, Sweden and the Netherlands have abandoned their two-tier scheme and now support the establishment of a single permanent court. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the UK government has procrastinated and prevaricated. At first it argued that there was no need to reform the present system in any significant way and that increasing resources would be sufficient. Now Britain professes support for reform but is backing the cumbersome and inefficient two-tier system. We all rejoice at the emergence of the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. It would surely be more fitting for the UK government to give a high priority to strengthening the effective legal protection of human rights in those countries and at home. The UK is now as isolated on this issue in the Council of Europe as it is on the Maastricht treaty's modest agreement on social policy. What matters now is that the necessary political support should be mobilised in Britain and across Europe to enable the court to meet the needs of the peoples of Europe. Otherwise, the convention system will soon collapse under its own weight. It is vital that a new protocol amending the convention system is agreed when the Council of Europe's governments meet in Vienna in October. The UK government should give unequivocal support for a single and effective permanent European Court of Human Rights. Britain should be in the vanguard of the reform movement together with its European partners, rather than seeking political compromises to limit or dilute those reforms through a combination of English insularity and bureaucratic narrow-mindedness.

Dublin wanted to reconcile its 1983 constitutional ban on abortion with the sort of case that recently arose when a 14-year-old Irish girl, pregnant after being raped, was initially denied the right to travel to Britain to get an abortion, but was later allowed to do so after a Supreme Court ruling. Mr David Andrews, foreign minister, suggested Ireland might have to delay the referendum on the Maastricht treaty planned for June to clarify the abortion issue. The insistence by Germany and France yesterday that the Maastricht treaty be left untouched reflects increasing nervousness that if even one part of the treaty were unstitched, the rest might fall apart under other demands for re-negotiation. Yesterday's move also has implications for Britain's position on the treaty. The Labour party would want to sign up to the EC social chapter on working conditions if it wins Thursday's UK election. However, it would now be difficult for Britain to renegotiate legally the opt-out on social policy. The only revision open to a Labour government would probably be the sort of interpretative 'solemn declaration' offered to Ireland yesterday. In what turned out to be a self-inflicted embarrassment, the Irish government insisted on adding to the Maastricht treaty a formal protocol, stating that nothing in the treaty would negate its constitutional ban on abortion. However second thoughts set in this year with the case of the 14-year-old. While finally allowing the girl to get an abortion in Britain, three of the Irish Supreme Court's five judges said that, in general, the rights of an unborn child took precedence over the (EC-enshrined) freedom to travel. What the Irish government was seeking yesterday was to add a sentence to its protocol, upholding its citizens' right to travel and to receive information on services legally available elsewhere in the EC.

Its action prompted President Bill Clinton to order the US Department of Energy, which is responsible for nuclear warheads, to prepare for a 'possible' resumption of testing. China was explicitly rejecting a plea made last month by Mr Clinton to suspend its plans and join the other recognised nuclear powers - the US, Russia, France and Britain - in a moratorium. China said it favoured a global test-ban treaty by 1996. But it is feared that yesterday's test could set a precedent and undermine prospects for a comprehensive ban, on which negotiations are set to start in January. This in turn would cast a shadow over the future of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the international instrument for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, which is due for renewal in 1995. China's action may be privately welcomed by officials in the other nuclear powers who have been arguing the need for further tests of their own. Russia first announced a moratorium two years ago, followed last year by France and then the US. Britain is bound by US policy since it uses the Nevada test site. The US moratorium, extended in July for at least another 15 months, is conditional on no other nation conducting tests. Mr Clinton said in July that if another country broke the moratorium he would order additional US tests. However, resumption of US testing in response to a single Chinese explosion is thought unlikely, and would face strong opposition in the US Congress. The test, recorded by foreign monitoring stations, took place at around 0200 GMT at the Lop Nor test site in Xinjiang province, some 1,500 miles west of Beijing. Mr John Lanchbery of the London-based Verification Technology Information Centre said it was a relatively small device with a yield of between 20 and 40 kilotons, roughly twice that of the 1945 Hiroshima bomb. France is also considering whether to resume testing at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific. Early today New Zealand, which has opposed the French tests, accused Beijing of 'a callous disregard of world opinion' and of irresponsible behaviour.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

In a speech at Hull University, Mr George questioned both the timetable for European economic and monetary union, and the credibility of the proposed European Central Bank. The remarks by Mr George - a noted sceptic on Emu - may influence MPs ahead of next week's Commons debate on the Maastricht treaty, which last December set the general framework for a move to union later this decade. Mr George also held out little prospect of any early move by the government to reduce base rates further, following last week's 0.5 percentage point reduction to 10 per cent. In the longer term he hinted at the possibility of bringing UK rates lower than those in Germany, on condition that Britain kept its inflation low and retained the confidence of the financial markets. On Emu, Mr George said practical difficulties meant the schedule as set out at Maastricht looked ambitious. Under the Maastricht plan, the final stage of Emu will start up with or without Britain by 1999. The problems included converting national currencies into European currency units, and producing the necessary coins and notes. Another was establishing Ecu payments systems. Mr George was particularly sceptical about the operation of the proposed central bank. It is planned that in the final stages of Emu the bank would administer the single currency and set pan-European interest rates. He said that the central bank might be 'vulnerable to misjudgment and to outside influence'. In terms of determining the correct level of interest rates, the central bank would be faced with huge problems in monitoring how factors such as financial liberalisation affected the pan-European economy.

In a strongly-worded speech to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr Morris Abram, US ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said yesterday many such crimes fell within the jurisdiction of domestic courts or military courts-martial. 'Trial before an international tribunal is another possibility,' he said. Mr Abram, a veteran civil rights campaigner who was on the team at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, said countries were reluctant to take effective action against those abusing human rights. 'The standards and laws are out there, all that is required is action - in particular, action against those who commit acts of genocide and torture.' Mr Abram was speaking ahead of a two-day session of the Human Rights Commission, starting tomorrow on human rights violations in the Yugoslav republics. A US-drafted resolution to be put to the 53-member Commission, which has support from other, so far mostly western, countries, condemns 'widespread, massive and grave violations' of fundamental human rights and the practice of 'ethnic cleansing'. It calls for appointment of a special rapporteur to investigate abuses, the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained and immediate access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to all detention camps and prisons. The resolution also reminds countries of their obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular that individuals are responsible for their actions and that states are accountable for rights violations committed by their agents on another state's territory. This would pave the way for possible action against Serbia for atrocities perpetrated by Serbian forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Some 36 Yugoslavs were deported from Britain last month, the Home Office confirmed last night. They had come via other countries where they had already claimed asylum and were being returned to those states in accordance with the international convention on the treatment of refugees, an official said. About 4,000 Yugoslavs a month were being allowed to enter Britain as visitors.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

By CATHY CURTIS      Item: British crafts people who gambled a chunk of money to fly overseas and  rent booths at ""Chelsea Comes to California,"" a Festival of Britain event at  South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, watched glumly while a trickle of visitors  gawked politely at what they assumed was a museum show.    Apparently, no one had informed Orange County viewers that the jewelry,  clothing, furniture and objets d'art on view, selected by a panel of British  crafts professionals, were for sale. Although the confusion eventually cleared  up, a week after the event opened several booth occupants were only guardedly  optimistic about whether the event was worth the trip.    At the original Chelsea Crafts Fair in London, named for the chichi district  where the event has been held for the past decade, there is no confusion.  People come to buy, just as they do at any other crafts fair.    It is amusing that the Festival of Britain -- whose marketing folks kept  insisting they were putting on a real arts festival, not a just a consumer  goods promotion -- managed to obscure the straightforward commercialism of  ""Chelsea"" in a misty haze of high culture.    Item: About half of the objects in ""British Design 1790-1990"" -- an exhibit of  British crafts organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London -- were  made during the past two years, and many were lent directly by the designer or  manufacturer, not the museum.    Since the 1988 appointment of Elizabeth Esteve-Coll as director of the museum,  the revered institution -- founded in 1852 and known for its extraordinary  collection of medieval-to-modern objects and preparatory studies for works of  art -- has suffered radical changes.    The changes include exhibitions revealing closer -- some would say incestuous  -- ties with commercial firms, a far greater stress on pop culture and  contemporary life in general (the current show is a 40-year retrospective of  couturier Pierre Cardin), and a reorganization of the staff that overrides the  expertise of trained and experienced curators.    In a 1989 article in the New York Review of Books, ""The Fall of a Great  Museum,"" eminent scholar John Pope-Hennessey, a former director of the museum,  accused Esteve-Coll of being ""a relentless vulgarizer,"" an administrator  (rather than an academic) who is merely a tool of the philistine trustees of  the museum, appointed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.    For an annual visitor to Britain, the notion of a Festival of Britain poses a  conundrum: Which Britain are they celebrating -- the real one or the fond  concoction of some PR office?    Is it the average American tourist's rose-colored set of half-truths -- a land  where a Queen still rules, tweedy individuals with fancy titles own rambling  country estates packed with chintz-covered furniture, universities are  ivy-twined bastions of plummy privilege, people drink tea and pick daintily at  clotted cream and crustless sandwiches every afternoon, judges in the courts  still wear wigs, fancifully costumed guards stand at attention at the Tower of  London and trilling accents make every word sound like Shakespeare?    Or is it the Britain where centuries of stuffy privilege have ceded authority  to a legion of go-getters and self-starters? A country where, as many critics  allege, Conservative Party leadership has introduced a cynical dog-eat-dog  mentality -- in which government funding of social welfare and arts  organizations is dramatically slashed, a poll tax is levied on homeowner and  poverty-level renter alike and yuppie greed has replaced altruistic concern?    Is it a country fighting a civil war with inhabitants of Northern Ireland? A  country serviced by Third World street cleaners and dishwashers? A land where  artistic vitality is fueled at street level by the descendants of '70s punk  bands and the dogged survival of anti-Establishment ""fringe"" theater groups?    Unsurprisingly, the noisiest emphasis in the festival was on hoary tradition  and snazzy contemporary trends.    The rose-colored crowd got its ""300 years of British pomp and pageantry"" at  South Coast Plaza in the guise of a group of ceremonial royal robes, a sampling  of teatime treats, a Rolls-Royce balanced on Wedgwood teacups, an ""authentic  London taxicab"" and a visit from Princess Alexandra.    The Orange County nouveau riche contingent -- who'd likely be Thatcher  supporters if they lived Over There -- presumably got their jollies from  various consumer goods events, including the British design show, a model house  equipped with British goods, and a series of lectures on business-related  topics.    But anti-Thatcher voices were in notably short supply, despite their  significant role in British arts today. We heard from their corner only in  indirect ways.    Tony Cragg's sculptures at Newport Harbor Art Museum are often made of  fragments of industrial refuse, sometimes resembling distorted natural forms or  science lab tools. With the exception of his vast wall relief, ""Riot"" -- a  brilliantly ""common"" reconceptualizing of a type of imagery found in ancient  Roman reliefs, using bits and pieces of old plastic objects -- Cragg's work may  appear to be apolitical.    But despite the diverse appearance of the sculptures Cragg has produced over  the past 15 years, his work overwhelmingly indicates a belief in a  relativistic, unpredictable universe, knowable only by direct personal  experience.    Some of the sculptures are made of humble castoffs reimagined into new forms.  Other pieces are large-scale bronzes that -- contrary to the solid majesty of  the medium -- have a loosely experimental quality. In his refusal to  acknowledge hierarchies of subject matter and materials or assumptions of  stylistic integrity, he flies in the face of the conservative preference for  works of art (and social groups) that are neatly defined and know their place.    Gordon Onslow-Ford, whose visionary paintings (in ""Pursuit of the Marvelous"" at  the Laguna Art Museum) have as little as possible to do with things of this  world, loathed the strictures and stuffiness of England of the 1920s, as he  said in a recent interview. As a young man he happily turned his back on his  native land for the delights of Paris, Mexico and Northern California.    Stanley William Hayter, a painter and experimental etcher also in ""Pursuit of  the Marvelous,"" was an avowed leftist who used his art to support the  Loyalists' cause during the Spanish Civil War. He died in 1988, a year before  Thatcher took office.    Calum Colvin and Ron O'Donnell, showing installations and large-scale  photographs at Cal State Fullerton, send up some ingrained attitudes of their  fellow Scots in gentle ways. But the biting edge of Scottish nationalism, the  barely controlled fury at what is perceived as economic favoritism of Southern  Britain, is not discernible in their work.    The one imported British theater offering, Alan Plater's ""Sweet Sorrow"" at the  Irvine Barclay Theatre, performed by the Hull Truck Theatre, had a distinctly  literary theme (the poetry of Philip Larkin) without significant political  overtones.    And of course the tripping melodies and devilishly clever rhymes of Gilbert and  Sullivan's ""The Mikado"" and ""The Pirates of Penzance"" -- the D'Oyly Carte Opera  Company's offerings at the Performing Arts Center -- are products of the 19th  Century. Even back then, the benign anti-Establishment digs that pepper the  lyrics were perceived as simply jolly good fun.    It looks like the only place we can hope to hear the authentic voice of British  liberals looking for a return of basic values will be South Coast Repertory's  West Coast premiere of David Hare's ""The Secret Rapture,"" which I saw a couple  of years ago in London.    At the center of the play is a genuinely saintly woman, Isobel, who owns a  small commercial art firm. Her sister Marion is a coldly calculating junior  minister in the Conservative Party; Marion's husband is an impossibly unctuous  born-again Christian who runs an outfit called Christians in Business. When  Isobel's and Marion's alcoholic mother needs help, everyone's true colors are  revealed.    Hare has said that he doesn't see the play in political terms, which doesn't  mitigate its power: Art is most effective when it doesn't clobber viewers over  the head with a bag full of propaganda. But Isobel's painfully lonely position  -- her refusal to make life easy for herself by capitulating to the  opportunistic folks around her -- says a lot about the temper of the times in  today's Britain.    Maybe you're thinking it would have been unrealistic to expect a festival  partially sponsored by the British government and British corporations to bite  the hands that feed it. But that's one of the difficulties of having a cultural  festival enrobed within a retail promotion (in itself, a concept that reeks of  Thatcherism).    Had the festival been the brainchild of a cultural group or a Peter  Sellars-style impresario, had it been conceived solely as an arts event -- with  input from a broad range of British arts groups, large and small, radical and  mainstream -- we'd have stood a better chance of understanding the real  Britain, and the overwhelming social tensions confronting it today.

The prime minister used the last Tory rally of the campaign to spell out issues on which the two main opposition parties were 'damagingly wrong'. Addressing 500 party activists in a west London hotel, he spoke of his 'passionate conviction' that Britain should play a part in shaping Europe's future and described 'this European Union of ours' as 'a very great venture'. But in a carefully-balanced speech he again conjured up a vision of a flexible, multi-speed Europe with member states free to act in their own way and at their own speed. Flanked by Union Jacks, Mr Major was firm on defence, saying there was no need 'for the Commission to be involved in the defence of Europe'. He sought to undermine opposition charges that the government had broken its promises on tax, saying that the Tories always planned for the long-term good of the country - even when taking decisions that were unpopular. Mr Major said Britain's EU veto, which the Tories would fight to keep, was just one of the subjects on which Conservative views were different from those of the other two leading parties. Others included: deregulation, which the Tories stood for, while the other two parties supported 'more regulation' and 'more powers' to go from Britain to Brussels; the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, which Labour and the Liberal Democrats wished to impose; a single currency, which the other two parties 'urged us to agree to . . . without leaving it to parliament to decide'; taxes; EU spending; and Britain's EU rebate, which Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, 'says he would renegotiate'. Mr Major was supported by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, who cautioned against the view that the Liberal Democrats represented 'some middle way' on Europe. In defiant mood, Sir Norman said Liberal Democrat policies were just as 'extreme' and 'damaging' as Labour's. Mr Major's recent comments about 'aggressive begging' were much closer to the views of the general public than the response of the Liberal Democrats, he said.

The plan was that low inflation would bring low interest rates and lead to prosperity. But due to the special circumstances of German unification we have high interest rates throughout Europe, which are inappropriate given the weak economies of many countries. 'With the UK still in recession, most economists would agree that base rates at 10 per cent are too high. Britain should cut interest rates by 2 percentage points and see what happens. If the pound fell below its ERM limit, and direct intervention failed to move sterling back within its bands, then the UK should either devalue or leave the system altogether. In Britain at the moment, as in other countries such as France and Denmark, all you get for lower inflation is more pain.' 'I DO NOT accept that a reduction in inflation takes 100 per cent priority over other objectives. There is an alternative to existing policies. There is no sign of any recovery in the economy and unemployment is still rising. I don't believe there will ever be a recovery fast enough to reduce unemployment if there is not both a devaluation and a reduction in interest rates. 'I deny that a devaluation, if large enough, would result in higher interest rates. If the ERM is an obstacle to devaluation, Britain should withdraw. Experience does not support the view that devaluations are ineffective. The depreciation of the early 1980s was accompanied by falling inflation and improved competitiveness. Devaluation would add something to inflation but perhaps not all that much with unemployment so high and rising.' 'MEMBERSHIP of the ERM has been used to prolong the biggest monetary squeeze in Britain since the 1930s. Britain needs a cut in interest rates of at least 3 percentage points. To allow this, Britain should suspend its agreement to support sterling within the ERM. That would mean allowing sterling to fall to a value set by the market. We must get away from the idea that there is a 'correct' value for the pound. Other European countries would perhaps try to make us feel guilty. 'But Britain has got to be tough and follow its national interests. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might well be damaged by a decision to leave the ERM. But they are faced with a tough choice: either pull out or end up in a nasty situation due to the deteriorating economy.' 'REALIGNMENT of sterling within the ERM would make things worse. History shows that currencies realigning downwards in the ERM have higher interest rates. Floating the pound is a more serious option. But with government budget and balance of payments deficits and underlying inflation over 4 per cent at present, the UK would have to take tough measures to gain credibility for such a policy on the foreign exchange markets. 'So staying where we are is the least worst option. But if the recession intensifies, while German rates stay high, Britain will need to find a way of decoupling UK rates from those in Germany. The best way would be to float the D-Mark until the strains of unification have subsided. If that proves politically impossible, floating the pound may yet have to be reconsidered.' 'TO ONE side in this debate, floating exchange rates possess magical qualities: to the other side fixed rates are an absolute imperative. Such disputes are theological. Policy should depend on the practical circumstances of the time. It was right for sterling to join the ERM at a testing exchange rate. Without this we could not have reduced inflation. 'But now it is falling, it is dangerous to stick with this same policy, when the risk facing Britain is not inflation but slump. The best solution would be a D-Mark revaluation. Britain should be working for this behind the scenes. It was dismaying to hear Mr Major apparently ruling this out. Failing this, if by December the UK economy shows no recovery, German rates show no sign of coming down and UK inflation is low and falling then we should devalue.' 'THE LBS remains strongly opposed to a devaluation in itself. But in the circumstances of the recession, a case can be made for combining devaluation with a large cut in the public sector borrowing requirement. This package was ruled out for electoral reasons, but may now be politically feasible. 'Our (economic) model simulations suggest that the benefits of devaluation, even with the above measures, are far from clear. But devaluation may also be consistent with low inflation provided that the PSBR cuts are deep enough and if credibility can be helped by an independent Bank of England. Since political pressure for devaluation may increase if the ERM comes under strain, this increases the case for giving priority to an independent Bank and fiscal consolidation.' 'A FREE float for sterling, which would succeed in getting base rates markedly lower, would now be such a political setback for the chancellor and the prime minister that it would only be contemplated in the most extreme economic circumstances, probably involving a systematic collapse in the financial sector. 'These dire circumstances have not arrived yet, and are unlikely to do so until next year at the earliest. The outlook is for continuing political discontent, but discontent which is not powerful enough to force any of the possible ERM resolutions in the near term. This is likely to leave the financial markets permanently fretting that a sterling devaluation or free float may be just around the corner until there is much firmer evidence of economic recovery.' 'IF BRITAIN left the ERM, overseas investors would find it difficult to trust the UK government's word in the future. Without the promise of government action to support sterling, the pound would lose its friends in the investor community. The large selling of sterling would force much higher UK interest rates. Without these, there would be the danger of the pound falling so low that it became a non-currency. 'Britain must stick with the ERM, taking the French route of gradually building up credibility in its currency. German interest rates are going to remain high for some time because of the circumstances of unification. Britain has had two years of recession. We may have to go through a few more years of penance to atone for the high borrowing boom conditions of the late 1980s.'  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

0,FT922-2026 ,"FT922-2026 _AN-CFSBAAANFT 920619   FT  19 JUN 92 / Beijing opposed to cabinet posts for Hong Kong Democrats      By SIMON HOLBERTON      HONG KONG   CHINA yesterday made its most direct intervention yet in the politics of Hong Kong when a senior official said Beijing would oppose the appointment of any member of Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats to the colony's Executive Council, or cabinet. Mr Guo Feng Min, the Chinese head of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), said in Beijing yesterday that such appointments would not be conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Mr Guo was speaking after the 23rd meeting of the JLG, a meeting which was noteworthy for the Chinese departing from the agenda to remind Britain that the Basic Law - the Chinese-drafted constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 - would not be amended before the handover to provide for more directly elected seats to the colony's legislature. Mr Guo's remarks were an attempt to limit the room for manoeuvre by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor-designate, before he arrives in the colony on July 9. Mr Patten was widely expected to bring Mr Lee and some of his colleagues into his cabinet. The Democrats represent most of the democratically elected politicians in the colonial legislature following last September's elections. But Mr Guo's remarks make plain what many have long suspected: that Beijing sees no role in Hong Kong's political life for the Democrats, whose involvement in anti-Chinese government activities after the June 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising has made Beijing deeply suspicious. Last night, the Hong Kong government issued a brief riposte. A spokesman said that 'appointments to the Executive Council were entirely a matter at the discretion of the governor.' China's intervention in local politics came on the day when four members of Hong Kong's cabinet broke ranks with the government and issued a paper calling for cuts to one of the core projects in Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport development. The decision by the four, all members of a conservative grouping known as the Co-operative Resources Centre, will give added comfort to Beijing which is arguing with Britain about the cost of the airport. This week's meeting of the JLG produced no sign of when and where China proposes to meet Britain to discuss the issue of airport finance. Mr Allen Lee, Mrs Celina Chow, Mrs Rita Fan and Mr Edward Ho joined 16 other members of the CRC to call for cuts of HKDollars 5.5bn (Pounds 380m) in the cost of construction of a railway that is planned to link the urban areas of Hong Kong with the colony's new airport at Chek Lap Kok. Their proposals would cut the cost of the railway from HKDollars 22.2bn to around HKDollars 17bn in March 1991 prices. Their call marks a reversal by the four who, as members of the governor's cabinet, approved the financing plans for the airport and related projects earlier this year. Mr Ho is also a director of the MTRC, the government-owned entity which has contracted to build and finance the railway. Their break with government policy throws into question their continuing membership of the cabinet. It also undermines the position of those who have been objecting to Mr Martin Lee's membership of the cabinet on the grounds of his refusal to observe 'collective responsibility'. The government said it would study the CRC's paper and consult the MTRC as to its feasibility. An MTRC executive said last night that the changes proposed would damage the financial viability of the project.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT941-5388 ,"FT941-5388 _AN-ECGC1ACPFT 940307   FT  07 MAR 94 / Personal View: Mercantilists are treading on thin ice      By GUY DE JONQUIERES   It is starting to look as though Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has unwittinglydone the British government a political favour by banning UK bidders from public contracts in retaliation against press reporting of the Pergau dam affair. As well as eclipsing the domestic controversy over who did what in the affair, the ban has made it easier for ministers to defend their conduct by asserting that they were simply batting for UK plc in a ruthless world market. This stance may prove popular, to judge by recent letters to this and other newspapers. Business leaders have closed ranks to insist that Britain cannot afford to alienate customers who can choose from plenty of other suppliers. That companies with commercial exposure to Malaysia should seek to limit the damage in this way is understandable. However, it is quite another matter to suggest, as some have done, that export-dependent countries such as Britain can pay their way only by subordinating other priorities and principles to the greater goal of a concerted foreign sales drive. The neo-mercantilist lobby typically takes as its model Japan, whose postwar economic success it ascribes to seamless co-operation between government and industry. However, such arguments fly in the face of the very evidence adduced in their support. Not only have leading Japanese companies such as Honda and Sony thrived precisely because their exclusion from this nexus of power forced them at an early stage to seek most of their business overseas. The institutionalised collusion and indulgence of special interests at the heart of the Japan Inc. system is now exacting a massive political price, in the form of the country's biggest peacetime crisis this century. If the system has any parallel in Britain, the nearest is probably with the arms trade, where the government acts as producers' biggest customer, financier and salesman. Some may say that proves the virtues of a helping hand from Whitehall. After all, is not defence one of the few manufacturing activities in which UK companies still enjoy world-class excellence in engineering and technology? However, the industry's 'strategic' status and monopoly privileges in most countries mean international competition is as much between governments as between companies. In most other sectors, commercial risks and rewards are geared more directly to straightforward rivalry on quality, delivery and price. Few people would dispute that governments can assist by gathering information, opening doors and otherwise smoothing exporters' path in foreign markets. That is particularly valuable in developing countries, where foreign companies' credibility gains from a show of confidence by their governments. But the line between encouragement and second-guessing commercial judgments can be stretched dangerously thin if governments go much further. Beyond a certain point, moral hazard comes into play. How many bad debts have been accumulated by companies which over-zealously obeyed injunctions to export or die, in the belief that their governments would pick up the tab if things went wrong? Nor does a narrow national focus on chasing foreign orders necessarily yield the expected rewards. In the 1960s, the Duncan Report recommended that Britain's embassies abroad downgrade classic diplomatic activities in favour of export promotion, a view enthusiastically accepted by the Wilson government. Yet the following decade, inadequate political reporting left Britain wholly unprepared for the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, support for whom had been at least partly influenced by his regime's importance as a customer for British exports. But perhaps the most objectionable feature of the neo-mercantilist fallacy is the idea that successful exporting requires avoiding any action which might offend foreign governments. In its most extreme form, this comes dangerously close to implying that countries which respect freedom of expression and the rule of law should bend their principles to please those which do not. In Britain, those who believe themselves victims of libel may seek redress in the courts. Dr Mahathir has not explained why he has not yet done so. Perhaps he does not believe he would receive a fair hearing. More likely, he refuses to treat with a system so closely identified with the 'western values' which he has condemned as selfish and decadent. In this view, many individual liberties guaranteed by western-style democracy are irrelevant - if not, indeed, inimical - to economic progress. The argument is false. Hong Kong, though not historically a parliamentary democracy, is blessed with a judiciary of unimpeachable integrity, an apolitical civil service and a free press. Its population also enjoys Asia's highest standard of living after Japan. Last week, Mr Richard Li, a prominent Hong Kong Chinese businessman, told a London conference: 'The cornerstone of Hong Kong's commercial success, and its ability to create wealth-creating capital, has certainly been the existence of an independent and impartial legal system. 'Coupled with a sound administration, it has provided entrepreneurs and investors, whatever their origin, with a level playing field. It is for that reason one of the most significant contributions to Asia's development, and is very much to Britain's credit.' Dr Mahathir - and those in Britain who appear so anxious to appease him in the name of economic self-interest - should take note.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

His decision, which was made at the EU's social affairs council, annoyed his ministerial colleagues from the other 11 EU member states who had believed that the UK had been willing to agree to a compromise settlement over the part-time workers' measure. The proposal will now be re-written by the Commission and it will be much tougher than the watered-down version rejected by Britain yesterday. The final directive will be presented in the early part of next year to European employers and trade union organisations to see whether they can reach a consensual agreement on its details. If this fails, then the EU governments - without the UK - are expected to agree on a directive on part-time workers which will then come into force. Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU's social affairs commissioner, said he was 'disappointed' at the British government's decision to block the part-time workers' directive. 'I thought what we were proposing was a bare bones minimum measure but even then the UK maintained a negative approach' he said. The social affairs council meeting was also unable to reach agreement on a draft directive covering posted workers. Britain was strongly opposed to the directive in principal, but there was also serious criticism from a number of other countries, nobably Portugal, Greece and Italy. The measure is designed to ensure companies carrying out contracts in member states other than their own have to pay their employees at the rates of the host country. Doubts were raised about the scope of the directive, what issues it should cover and whether it applied to workers employed for less than one week. Mr Flynn said that he hoped that there would be an agreement on a posted worker directive on December 21 when the ministers are due to meet again. 'I believe there is a willingness to compromise on all sides over this measure,' said Mr Flynn. 'It is about extending the free market in services and not part of any Social Chapter.' Mr Portillo was also alone to reject the German government's proposal to press for greater economic and social convergence through the creation of minimum labour standards.

0,FT931-13172 ,"FT931-13172 _AN-DAYB1AD0FT 930125   FT  25 JAN 93 / The greatest years may lie ahead      By MICHAEL PROWSE   It is fashionable to argue that the US is a superpower in relative decline. Since the publication in 1987 of historian Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, a succession of pundits has compared the US's position today with that of Britain in the late 19th century. Distracted by global military and diplomatic responsibilities, the argument runs, the US has neglected its economy and ignored festering social problems. The result, as with Britain a century earlier, is a prolonged decline in economic competitiveness that now threatens the US's ability to provide global leadership. In his inaugural address, President Bill Clinton seemed to accept much of this 'declinist' thesis. Speaking metaphorically he said the US was in 'the depth of winter'. He spoke of drift and deadlock, of stagnant wages, of shaken confidence and of increasing inequality. It was time, he claimed, to 'force the spring' and heal a fractured economy and society. Hardly anybody doubts that there is a lot wrong with contemporary America. Lack of access to healthcare, appalling inner-city poverty, racial discrimination and levels of crime far above those in other industrialised countries are all signs of a seriously malfunctioning society. But the broader 'declining superpower' thesis is less compelling. The US has lost economic ground relative to other industrialised countries since 1945, when it produced about half of world output. But this is less a reflection of US decline than of the distorting impact of the second world war, which boosted the US economy while devastating those of Europe and Japan. Once allowance is made for an initial catch-up, the evidence for continuing US decline is, at best, mixed. Surprisingly, the US share of the industrial output of the 24 rich members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is larger today than in 1970. If allowance is made for 'purchasing power parities' (differences in domestic costs), Japan was the only country to advance relative to the US during the 1980s. And OECD calculations suggest Japan's per capita gross domestic product was only about 80 per cent of the US's by the end of the decade. After adjusting for internal purchasing power, the leading European countries failed to make any headway relative to the US in the 1980s; (west) Germany, the most prosperous, ended the decade with living standards about 15 per cent lower than in the US. The US, like other advanced countries, has experienced slower productivity growth since the early 1970s. But it has retained a large absolute advantage. This is true even in manufacturing industry, although Japan and Germany are challenging its dominance in particular sectors. America retains many other socio-economic advantages. It is still easily the least crowded of the large developed economies, with a population density less than 10 per cent of Japan's. This means it can continue to reap the economic benefits of relatively liberal immigration policies. It has a younger population than Japan or most European countries, meaning that it faces less acute fiscal challenges as a result of population ageing. It is better endowed with raw materials and physical capital than most of its competitors. And it has the world's most extensive (and arguably best) system of higher education, which partly compensates for flaws in US high schools. Perhaps the least appreciated US advantage is the fact that it has the lowest per capita tax burden of any OECD country, bar Turkey. This means that the supposedly intractable fiscal problems are not really intractable. If it chooses, the Clinton administration can reduce the budget deficit, increase investment and tackle social problems without imposing tax burdens higher than those already faced by most citizens of most advanced democracies. There is a lot of fiscal wiggle room, even if this is not often apparent to US politicians. So why is there so much fear of decline? It partly reflects a confusion between growing inequality and economic decline. Many families have lost ground because the benefits of economic growth have accrued mainly to the top 30 per cent of the population. This in turn reflects the tighter link between pay and productivity (which reflects education) in an increasingly competitive global economy. 'Declinism' may also be partly media- driven: for 12 years academics and journalists (many of whom are Democrat sympathisers) had an incentive to denigrate the US as a way of discrediting Republican presidents. With their man in the White House, it would not be surprising if the mood now grew more upbeat. Rather than comparing the US with Britain at the end of the 19th century, it might make more sense to compare it with Britain in 1815 after the victory over Napoleonic France. The US, after all, has just won a lengthy and debilitating war against communism. This sapped its economic strength and distorted its national goals, just as did Britain's long struggle for supremacy with France. With a new, energetic president, and with the same party controlling both White House and Congress, the US now has a chance to flower economically, politically and socially. The next 50 years could be its heyday rather than a period of painful decline.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.   Industries:-  P96  Administration of Economic Programs.

0,FT911-307 ,"FT911-307 _AN-BEMAUAB8FT 910513   FT  13 MAY 91 / Hard Ecu plan to be reviewed: UK may back down after concession on single currency timing      By PETER MARSH and DAVID BUCHAN      LONDON, LUXEMBOURG   BRITAIN MAY back down on its hard Ecu plan following an important concession on the timing of a single currency proposed at a meeting of EC finance ministers. The hard Ecu is a central plank in the British government's ideas for European economic and monetary union but the idea has gained few supporters in the rest of Europe. The proposal will be reviewed by senior UK officials in the next few weeks with the option of dropping it as a goodwill gesture to Britain's partners. Such a turnabout could raise political difficulties because the Conservative government has long insisted that its hard Ecu alternative has been generating interest abroad in spite of Labour scepticism. According to the concession proposed at the weekend meeting in Luxembourg by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, Britain could sign a treaty on Emu later this year without agreeing on the final goal, to which the UK attaches strong reservations, of a single European currency and a new European central bank. That would mean Britain could join the other EC nations in stage two of Emu but leave open the question of further involvement until the late 1990s. According to some countries' schedule, the third and final phase of Emu would begin around 2000, and usher in the full operation of a new, single currency and the new central bank. The general feeling from the meeting, said Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, was that 'no country should be allowed to stop others advancing to Emu and that no country could have a single currency imposed on it'. The proposal was supported by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner. 'It could be made clear that the UK was formally reserving its position, not just on when, but on whether, it accepts a single currency,' Sir Leon said. The British government reacted cautiously to Mr Delors' proposal. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the suggestion was 'constructive but not a dramatic breakthrough'. There were still 'a million questions', many of them posed by other countries, that had yet to be answered about Emu. Downing Street also made clear that the option was just one of many coming out of the negotiations. Tory MPs appeared divided on the issue although, at first sight, the Delors plan may appeal to the leadership on the grounds that it should largely remove the controversy within the party on the Emu issue in the run up to a general election that most now believe will come in the autumn. However, there is also considerable concern that acceptance of the compromise might be seen as tacit endorsement of a 'two-speed' Europe - something the government has always vigorously opposed. The hard Ecu, proposed two years ago with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's support, was designed partly to keep Britain in the mainstream of the Emu debate. The proposal is for a new currency with anti-inflationary characteristics, which would be used by European businesses alongside existing national currencies. It would be separate from the existing basket Ecu - the notional currency which the European Commission hopes will evolve ultimately into a new single financial unit for Europe. The hard Ecu strategy is to be discussed by the main Whitehall committee responsible for the approach to Emu. The committee is chaired by Mr Nigel Wickes, a second permanent secretary at the Treasury, and includes representatives from the Foreign Office, the Bank of England and the prime minister's policy unit. In the light of the less than wholehearted support received from the rest of Europe, the hard Ecu could be abandoned, although Britain would probably continue to press for some of the basic tenets behind the proposal, such as the need to fight inflation. Apart from the main discussions, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, sought to smooth over differences with the Germany on the timing of the formation of the European Central Bank. His officials spoke only of an institutition 'pre-figuring' the bank being set up in 1994. However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, remained insistent that it should be formed only on the eve of a single currency. Two-speed Emu, Page 3  The Financial Times   London Page 1 Photograph Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister, yesterday showed off a French idea for Ecu coins at a press conference in Luxembourg. At the weekend meeting of EC finance ministers, Mr Beregovoy said the Emu treaty 'must be written so that it does not pre-empt a UK decision, while at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead'.

Warning Baghdad not to be 'misled into repeating the mistakes of the past', President Bill Clinton said the US had taken 'necessary precautionary steps'. Iraq should not make the mistake of thinking the US was too involved in its military mission in Haiti to pay attention to Kuwait, from which Iraqi troops were expelled by a US-led force after they invaded in 1990. A US official said Mr Clinton had put 'less than 15,000' troops on alert for possible duty in Kuwait and ordered four warships carrying 2,000 US Marines to move north from the southern Gulf. Britain said it was sending HMS Cornwall, a frigate. The Pentagon was also sending an aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, and two ships equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles to the region. Up to 12 fully loaded US military cargo ships in the Indian Ocean and Pacific have been ordered to either move towards Iraq or stand by for orders. According to US officials at the United Nations, Iraq could soon have nearly 60,000 troops, equipped with some 700 T-72 tanks and 900 armoured personnel carriers, near Kuwait. A Pentagon official said an Iraqi armoured division of about 10,000 troops with ammunition and supplies had moved from the north 'very close' to the Kuwait border and another division was *something in here (HP) * on the move. 'We are robusting our intelligence and reconnaissance assets . . . we see a full up Republican guard unit very close to the border, a matter of tens of clicks (kms) . . . their most forward position we've seen,' he said. Republican Guards, possibly as many as 20,000 troops and 300 tanks, were said by diplomats in Kuwait to be heading towards the border. Iraqi divisions are smaller than in many Western armies, where they often comprise about 12,000 troops, the diplomats said. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the troop movements were 'not routine and they're not typical of what we've seen in the past, and therefore they do cause us some concern'. In a statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency last night, Baghdad denied the movements were a prelude to an invasion. 'Peace-loving Iraq . . . has no aggressive intentions,' it said. Diplomats say Iraq made numerous movements of forces after the Gulf war and these had been correctly interpreted as political posturing. However, Kuwait yesterday called an emergency cabinet meeting, called up some army reservists and requested allied assistance. British, French and US jets are based at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, from where they enforce a 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq. In a statement Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said: 'We view with concern the troop movements in southern Iraq and the recent hostile statements by Iraq. If Iraq believes that its threatening behaviour will achieve anything, then it is making a serious error of judgment.' The troop movements took place as Iraq sharpened its rhetoric against the UN embargo on oil exports, imposed after its invasion of Kuwait, warning it would take unspecified 'measures' against its 'enemies' unless the Security Council 'immediately' eased the ban. The Security Council last night held emergency consultations. It is due to consider a report from Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN special envoy, next week, on the readiness of systems for monitoring Iraq's weapons. Mr Ekeus is expected to declare the monitoring systems virtually in place. France, Russia and China have said they believe Iraq should next be given a 'probationary period' of six months for monitoring, after which the Security Council should discuss lifting sanctions. Britain and the US oppose any such timetable. Food rations, upon which Iraqis have relied for 60 per cent of their basic food needs, were recently cut by up to 50 per cent. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the international community to examine the 'iniquitous and illegitimate situation' under which he said one or two large major powers were preventing the lifting of the sanctions.

Both parts of Chris Patten's so-called democracy reform bill  were tabled under the circumstance where no agreement was  reached between China and Britain despite the fact that the  Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in the past 17 rounds  of the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue.    The Chinese side has repeatedly warned that any unilateral  action taken by the British side in this aspect before an  agreement is reached between the two sides is in gross violation  of the joint declaration, the Basic Law as well as the  agreements and understandings reached between the two countries.    Wong Siu-yee, a local member of the Urban Council, said that  the real intention of the British side by unilaterally tabling  Patten's reform bill was to continue the British influence over  the territory, which it took away from China by armed forces in  the late 19th century, after it is returned to China in 1997.    Another local public figure, Rita Fan, said that the British  side claimed, on the one hand, that the door for the  Sino-British talks was open, while, on the other hand, it had  slammed the door by taking unilateral actions.    Fan, a female member of the Preliminary Working Committee,  said that one can not entirely depend on the cooperation of the  British side in the other fields as Britain has taken an  uncooperative attitude towards the political issues.    Wong Siu-lun, a professor from the Sociology Department of  Hong Kong University, said that under the situation in which the  basis of the Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue  has been ruined by the British side, the Chinese side should  work closely with the local residents and be prepared for the  long-term development of the future special administrative  region.

Japan's ""Keidanren"" is  an organization for the Japanese major capitalist class. It is  the behind-the-scenes boss of the ruling Liberal Democratic  Party of Japan and influences the government through the ruling  party.    In 1978, the State Council organized a governmental  delegation to visit Japan. The delegation leader was Vice  Premier Gu Mu, and I was the assistant delegation leader. In  Japan we met with three former and current Prime Ministers and  several major corporation leaders. When we met with Konosuke  Matsushita, who is called the ""God of Business,"" the elderly man  said with pride ""We keep the best talent in industry for our own  use; and send only the second best talent to government."" This  illustrated the influence of the major capitalist class on  government in Japan.    Liao Chengzhi also told me that Deng Xiaoping shared his  view. This showed that the Central Committee had considered  that: 1) Political power in Hong Kong is primarily influenced by  the capitalist class; and 2) if there is to be a political party  it must consist of an organized capitalist class not of  individuals of the capitalist class. Liao Chengzhi ordered me to  support a certain tycoon in activities to organize a political  party. This indicated that the Central Committee leaders  advocated the organization of a political party. The certain  tycoon wanted at that time to organize a political party and had  even thought of a name similar to that of Britain's Conservative  Party. Later, problems developed and he shifted his support to  another group. In my activities in Hong Kong, I had urged  individuals from the upper and middle classes to ""get organized""  and organize a political party. I had discussed this with Yang  Sen, Luo Kang-rui, and Szeto Wah and with Y. K. Pao and Li  Kashing. But enthusiasm was low among the upper class. I thought  of using the Hong Kong Macao International Investment Company as  a fledgling form to organize the major Chinese capitalists,  especially the major capitalists with various types of  influence, but in the end, they had no interest in cooperating  and had to ""disband.""    Some people critized me for being too conservative and  leaning towards the capitalist class. I felt that the special  circumstances of Hong Kong were: politically, there really was  unequal capitalist political power. Political power at the  moment was still in the hands of the British and the Hong Kong  British government primarily protected the interests of the  capitalist class. But economically, the policies and approaches  it adopted were all relatively suited to providing ""fair""  opportunities for development. Thus, in the drafting of the  Basic Law, we wanted to maintain with little change the policies  of the current Hong Kong government which allowed for ample  economic freedom with little or no government interference. The  development of political ""fairness,"" or the course of  democratization, would be on the principle of proceeding in an  orderly fashion, or one step at a time. The development of  political structure in Hong Kong would have to be adapted to  ""getting organized,"" and to the process of the Hong Kong people  gaining an understanding of and experience with democracy. It  could not influence the stability or economic prosperity of Hong  Kong. It would not benefit anyone for the Hong Kong economy to  ""collapse.""    The debate surrounding the course of democratization in Hong  Kong was exceptionally intense as could be seen in the multitude  of proposals put forth by various circles. The stand-offs among  the different political proposals began when the business  community put forth a 57-person proposal and, in rebuttal, the  extreme democratization faction put forth a 19-person proposal.  Before long, the middle faction put forth a 38-person proposal.  The 57-person proposal evolved into an 89-person proposal. The  19-person proposal developed into the ""190"" proposal. The  British Government promoted ""mutual recognition"" and added  ""double investigation,"" ""double recruitment"" and ""4,42."" After  ""4 June"" there were many proposals lined up.    Because the compromise among the different political  proposals and the passage of the Basic Law did not happen until  after ""4 June,"" these events could not avoid the influence of ""4  June."" For convenience of narration, I will address these issues  in the later chapter ""The Storm of 4 June.""    (During the drafting phase of the Basic Law, the Hong Kong  people had many opinions on political issues. The points of  dispute mainly surrounded the speed of the development of  democracy in Hong Kong. This referred to the proportion of seats  for different classes of people in the legislative body and the  rate of development towards direct elections. Another area of  debate was the relationship between the legislative body and the  administration and how the head official of the administration  would be chosen. During the early phases of the drafting of the  Basic Law, society divided those with different views into the  ""democracy faction,"" the ""business faction"" and the ""middle  faction."" The so-called ""190 Proposal"" was a political system  proposal jointly suppported by 190 individuals and groups in  society. The views of this faction represented the thinking of  those of the ""democratic faction"" of the time. Their main demand  was that the political system design, including the election of  legislative representatives and administrative officials,  develop in the direction of universal suffrage with one  person-one vote.)    The ""business community's 89-person proposal"" was the  political system suggestion supported by the business and  professional members of the Advisory Committee. The final draft  was supported by 89 members of the Advisory Committee and thus  was termed the ""89-person proposal."" The thrust of the proposal  was the establishment of a ""great electoral body"" with persons  from various circles. The electoral body would select  administrative officials and part of the legislative  representatives. Representatives from the business and  professional communities would occupy most of the seats in the  electoral body.    The ""38-person proposal"" was the concept of 38 members of  the  Advisory Committee. They combined the characteristics of the  various factions and found compromise among the views of the  different factions. For example, the nomination of  administrative officials would be done by a nomination body. The  officials would then be elected by one person one vote. They  also took a middle ground approach to the proportion of seats in  the legislative body, a compromise between the positions of the  ""democratic faction"" and the ""business faction.""    The content of these proposals changed constantly during the  drafting stage. Later, even more proposals emerged, but  generally speaking, all primarily addressed the issues of the  proportion of seats in the legislature and the extent of direct  elections. [End of Installment No. 57]    [1 Jul 93 p 2]    Temporary Cooperation. I Discuss the ""Political System"" With  Youde.    [Text] The formal signing of the PRC-UK Joint Communique by  the head of both governments marked the beginning of a period of  cooperation and negotiated resolution of Hong Kong issues by  China and Britain.    Cooperation between Britain and Hong Kong during this period  was demonstrated mainly in two areas:    First: During the drafting of the Basic Law, China respected  and made every effort to include Britain's suggestions. Of  course there was debate but there was mainly cooperation and  compromise.    Second: Both sides cooperated on the issue of maintaining  prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.    During this period, I got along very well with both Governer  Youde and Governor Wilson.    On May 1 1985, Youde visited Shanghai and Jiangsu province  at  my invitation. I returned to Nanjing the day before so that I  could greet Youde at the airport with Jiangsu Governor Gu  Xiulian. Youde stayed at Nanjing's Zhongshanling No. 5 Hotel.  This was built during the ""Great Leap Forward"" to accomodate Mao  Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Building No. 1 was reserved for Mao  Zedong's exclusive use. Building No. 2 was for Liu Shaoqi and  other authorities of the Central Committee. Both are separate  villas with complete suites, built among ancient trees towering  overhead between the tomb of Sun Yatsen and ""Ming Xiao Ling,""  the tomb of the Ming Taizu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. After the 13th  National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, they  were opened to the public and used to accomodate honored guests  and foreign businessmen. Responsible individuals of the Jiangsu  provincial government accompanied Youde to visit the scenic  areas and factories of Nanjing and to brief him on Jiangsu  province.    Youde was revisiting old haunts. In the late 40's, Youde was  a Counselor in the British Embassy to China. According to our  information, he was a senior intelligence agent of the British  Government. On 1 April 1949, the People's Liberation Army of  China forced its way across the Chang Jiang River, occupied  Nanjing and other large and medium cities, and controlled the  Jiangyin fortress at the passage to the lower reaches of the  Chang Jiang. At that time, the British warship the Amethyst was  on the river near Nanjing to provide assistance to the  Kuomintang. Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping issued an order to  seal off the Chang Jiang and not allow the Amethyst to ""escape.""  Youde obtained this intelligence. The British Embassy ordered  him to find a way to tell the warship to take the risk of  breaking through the blockade on the night of the 22d. Youde  received honors and an award for this.    At that time, I was a political committee member of the 88th  Division of the 29th Army of the People's Liberation Army. I was  the leader of a vanguard camp. On the night of the 21st, I was  in a wooden boat on the eastern stretch of the river campaign  battleline, and we stormed the shore at Changshan in Jiangyin  County. On the night of the 22nd, we were pressing towards Wuxi  when we suddenly heard artillery fire towards Jiangyin behind  us. A line in the sky several dozen miles long glowed up red  with artillery fire which finally ceased after about one hour.  Only on the next day did we know that the Amethyst had ""broken  through the blockade"" and ""escaped.""    In Hong Kong, Youde and I had talked of his desire to visit  the ancient cultural city of Yangzhou. When he was stationed at  Nanjing in the past he had regretted not being able to visit  Yangzhou. On this trip special arrangements were made for him to  visit Yangzhou, including allowing him to enjoy the artistic  treasures of the ""Eight Yangzhou Eccentrics,"" famous painters  from the Ming and Ching dynasties. Afterwards, we crossed the  river at Zhenjiang and went to Wuxi and stayed in the Li Garden  Cottage on the edge of Lake Tai. This was the former home of Fan  Li, a doctor of the Kingdom of Wu during the Warring States  Period.    Youde's visit to Jiangsu happened to occur during the market  season for the Chang Jiang herring. During the season around  Chingming Festival, when the willow cotton flurries from the  trees, the Chang Jiang herring swims upstream from the mouth of  the Chang Jiang to spawn and this is the time when the flesh is  full and tasty. When I invited Youde in Hong Kong to make this  visit, I promised him an opportunity to taste this fish. I went  to Nanjing a day early and asked the head of the tourism bureau,  who was responsible for the visit arrangements, to have some  Chang Jiang herring for the banquet. In the end, however, Youde  did not eat herring in Nanjing because during the previous few  years, the Chang Jiang had been subjected to much industrial  pollution. Overfishing had also helped cause an annual decrease  in production so that the market supply was very low. I  expressed my apologies and promised to make up for it in Wuxi.  Who would have expected that even in Wuxi we could not achieve  our wish.    After we arrived in Shanghai, Mayor Wang Daohan held a  banquet for Youde at the Jinjiang Hotel. At the banquet, herring  unexpectedly appeared on the table, causing me great  embarrassment. I could only try to explain away my awkwardness  by saying to Wang Daohan, ""You Shanghainese have money and  means. A Jiangsu product cannot be found in Jiangsu but is found  in Shanghai!"" Everyone laughed. Later I asked Wang Daohan and  found out that they had especially sent someone to buy the fish  directly from a fishing boat. [End of Installment No. 58]    [2 Jul 93 p 2]    [Text] I Discuss the ""Political System"" with Youde;  Deep Sorrow at the Sudden Death of Youde  When Youde visited Jiangsu, Britain was already implementing a  parliamentary system in Hong Kong and there were already  conflicts between Britain and China. I exchanged views with  Youde in Wuxi on this issue. With an interpreter for each of us,  we spent about two hours talking.    I initially expressed my appreciation for success of the  Hong  Kong British government's economic policies and advisory system.  After 97, when the new special district government is designed,  these experiences will be worth studying and preserving as much  as possible. Because Hong Kong has not had a democratic  tradition, the implementation of democracy, especially ""direct  elections,"" should not be done too quickly but one step at a  time. The future special district government will have to  protect and balance the interests of different classes. The  major owners of capital in Hong Kong are most concerned that  those involved in democratization will change the Hong Kong  government's current tax system of low taxes and narrowly  applied taxes. We must give the major capitalists time to  organize and participate in elections.    Youde explained in response to my comments that they were  designing an essential political system and would not concern  themselves only with the interests of the capital owners. On the  question of ""direct elections,"" the Hong Kong government had  made detailed calculations and felt it could maintain ""control""  and that the Chinese Government could rest at ease. ""Our  attitude is very cautious,"" he said. I did not critique his  essential political system as a colonial dictatorship  representing the British capitalist class but said only ""I hope  that Britain will not use the same methods in Hong Kong as those  used in withdrawing from other colonies."" Hong Kong's conditions  and qualifications are not the same as those of other colonies.  Particularly on the economic front, both Britain and China share  the same desire to maintain economic prosperity in Hong Kong.  Furthermore, Britain would only withdraw after 12 more years. We  wanted to join with Britain to strive for unity among all  circles in Hong Kong and avoid social divisiveness or the  creation of negative effects. I used terms like ""we hope that  Britain will not violate empiricism."" Although our views were  diametrically opposed to each other, our purpose was cooperation  and the atmosphere was always friendly.    Later, when I discussed Hong Kong political reform with  newly  appointed Governor Wilson, I also used the expression ""don't  violate empiricism.""    While Youde was visiting Jiangsu, he casually mentioned that  he and his wife were both very interested in ancient Chinese  culture. I suggested that they visit Xi'an to see the recently  unearthed Qin Dynasty terracotta army. Youde was very pleased  and indicated that he wanted to find an opportunity to make that  visit. After returning to Hong Kong, Youde was very busy with  official duties and did not have time to go, but his wife wished  to go without him. I asked the authorities in Xi'an to issue the  invitation and make the arrangements.    When Youde died, his wife was touring Xi'an, accompanied by  Deng Lianru. When the news arrived, I was in Beijing  participating in a meeting of the Hong Kong Macao Office.  Everyone felt that it was terribly sudden, because on the  previous evening, Youde had attended a banquet with Ji Pengfei  at the Diaoyutai Guest House. I was also present. His health and  mood appeared fine. He even drank several glasses of Maotai  liquor. I heard that he had a heart attack during the night and  was found lying on the floor. Some people guess that he had an  attack and was going to get some medicine, but it was too late  and he collapsed. I felt great sorrow that he died this way. I  attended his funeral after returning to Hong Kong. Having been  adversaries with him for some time, I felt that we had come to  know each other well and he was a person with whom I could  communicate.    [Text] Joint Rescue of the Stock Market; Hong Kong  and Britain Jointly ""Rescue the Market"" Through Pu Weishi    On October 19, 1987, the United States New York stock market  crashed, and the world stock market crisis hit Hong Kong. The  Hang Seng Index lost about 1,000 points in one day. It was  called ""Black Friday."" The Hong Kong stock exchange Chairman Li  Fuzhao announced that the market would close four days. All the  stockholders in the market were in a constant state of anxiety,  and it was a miserable scene.    On that day it happened that Beijing's Vice Mayor Zhang  Baifa  was in Hong Kong seeking donations to prepare funding for the  Asian Games. I had invited a group of commercial magnates to a  banquet at the Meilihua Hotel, intending to ask them for  generous donations at the banquet. At that time I knew about the  stock market crisis, and we were discussing it endlessly even  before the meal. Furthermore, I knew that many among the guests  had experienced great losses. Although they attended the event,  they looked as if their thoughts were elsewhere and they were  simply forcing themselves to fulfill their obligations to  attend. I intervened with Zhang Baifa, ""Don't bring up the  question of donations at the banquet today. Leave it for another  day."" Zhang Baifa indicated that he understood and agreed.    I asked stock expert Xiang Zhiqiu, known as the ""Great  Knight  Xiang,"" for advice. He suggested: ""The Hong Kong government  should come out to rescue the stocks."" He briefly explained his  reasoning. Although I did not completely comprehend, I grasped  the phrase ""the government can come to the rescue.""    Two days later, Jiang Wengui, Chairman of the Hong Kong  Macao  Management Office of the Bank of China, called and asked to see  me concerning an urgent issue relating to the stock market. I  asked him to come over immediately. He told me that Hui Feng  Chairman Pu Weishi had asked the Bank of China to work with him  to rescue the stock market. Pu had indicated that this was also  the desire of the Hong Kong British government. A total of two  billion Hong Kong dollars was needed. Three parties would  contribute the funds. The Hong Kong government would provide one  billion, Hui Feng would provide 500 million, and the Bank of  China would give 500 million. Jiang asked for my view. I  immediately convened the economic leadership team of the Working  Committee to discuss this. Everyone agreed that relations  between China and Britain were very friendly, and since this  request had come from the British Government, we could agree to  cooperate in rescuing the market. Hui Feng, however, had a much  larger volume of business in Hong Kong than the Bank of China  and a much larger interest in the stock market. The Bank of  China should not be asked to carry as large a burden. At the  same time, ""rescuing the market"" would also include a certain  risk which someone would have to carry but not the Bank of China  alone. The Bank of China would not demand interest, regardless  of the amount provided. All at the meeting agreed that ""Society  would know that the Bank of China had joined in the `rescue of  the market.' This would indicate the Chinese Government's  support of the Hong Kong stock market with greater political  influence than economic influence."" [End of Installment No. 59]     "

Maybe you are in the market for a fleet of used excavators or a crawler-crane capable of lifting 200 tonnes? One careful owner, and it must all go. Vast amounts of civil engineering machinery and surplus materials left over from building the Channel tunnel, which opens officially on May 6, are attracting possible buyers from Malaysia, Denmark, Abu Dhabi and the US. Some 85 per cent of the project's second-hand equipment has already been sold, raising more than Pounds 30m for Eurotunnel, the operator, and Transmanche, the consortium of five British and five French contractors which designed and built the tunnel. Still for sale is one of the 8.72-metre diameter tunnel-boring machines, the biggest of some eight machines used to cut the 50km-tunnel linking Britain and France. The machine, built in Glasgow by Howden Group, cost Pounds 7.5m and could fetch up to Pounds 2.5m on the second-hand market, according to agents Henry Butcher, who are handling the British end of the sale. Possible purchasers include builders of the proposed Channel tunnel rail link between London and the Kent coast. Other equipment may be bought by construction companies building London Underground's Jubilee Line extension. The agents have already sold a smaller tunnelling machine to build a stormwater drainage system at Brighton. Other tunnel-boring machines, which met mid-Channel, will remain entombed under the seabed. It would cost too much to dismantle and remove them. One of the French machines used to bore a section of tunnel from the French landward side is to be exhibited at the Eurotunnel terminal near Calais. Another may be shipped to Britain to be exhibited. Mr Peter Harriman, a Henry Butcher partner, says the agents have raised more than Pounds 16m from British sales. Purchasers have included tunnellers building the Boston metro in the US and the 18-km Storebaelt link in Denmark who have bought locomotives and muck wagons. A Hong Kong developer building hospitals in Malaysia paid Pounds 500,000 for desalination plants previously used in the cooling system during construction of the Channel tunnel. A 200-tonne crawler-crane was sold to Abu Dhabi. Others were sold to the US, Singapore and Portugal, raising Pounds 2.5m, said Mr Harriman. Mr Philippe Laboise, cost control and administration manager for the French works, says French sales have recovered about 12 per cent of the value.   Companies:-  Eurotunnel.     Transmanche Link.

Yusuf Sha'ban ""never said that he had placed the bomb in the  Pan Am plane"" that killed 270 people, state prosecutor Munif  'Uwaydat told AFP.    ""But he said that under torture he was ready to confess to  anything, even the Lockerbie bombing, if asked to,"" 'Uwaydat  said, noting Sha'ban's comments were not logged in court records  because they were not connected to his trial.    The state prosecutor charged that statements attributed to  Sha'ban on Monday were ""deformed on purpose to embarrass  (Lebanese) justice,"" and he ruled out any investigation into the  claim.    Sha'ban, according to the state-run news agency ANI, told a  court here that he was responsible for bombing the plane.    The 29-year-old member of Abu-Nidal's hardline Fatah  Revolutionary Council (FRC) was being heard in the murder trial  of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah who was shot  dead outside his Beirut home in January.    Sha'ban faces a possible death penalty.    The United States said it had no evidence to corroborate  Sha'ban's claim and reiterated its demand for the extradition of  two Libyans who have been indicted in both Britain and the  United States for the attack.    Barbara Bodine, the State Department coordinator on  counter-terrorism, said that Sha'ban ""was not a suspect.""    ""We feel very strong evidence against the two indicted  Libyans, but we are serious in following up this lead to see if  there is any veracity in it at all,"" Bodine said.    London and Washington have for three years been trying to  force court appearances of 'Abd-Basit al-Mijrahi and Al-Amin  Khalifah Fahimah, who are charged in the bombing.    Britain also renewed its demand that the two Libyans be  brought before a Scottish or a US court to answer the charges.    Al-Mijrahi and Fahimah's Libyan lawyer, meanwhile, sent a  letter to the Lebanese judicial authorities urging them to  further interrogate Sha'ban on the Lockerbie bombing.    Ibrahim Legwell asked that lawyers defending the Libyan  suspects be allowed to take part in any investigation, according  to a copy of the letter received by AFP in Tripoli.

Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in a telephone call that the US was lifting its ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein representatives. A senior administration official said this was 'the beginning of a relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no official contacts for 25 years'. Mr Gore's telephone call appeared designed to raise contacts with Mr Adams to the highest level possible without offending the British government by a meeting at the White House. Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a more conspicuous meeting with President Bill Clinton or Mr Gore, officials said he had not made any formal request for such a meeting. Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low key, with officials emphasising that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they receive Mr Adams. But moderate unionists complained that the move was improper and premature. 'They would have been wiser to wait until Sinn Fein became a normal political party,' said Rev Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast. Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman. The British government is analysing with great care remarks made by the Sinn Fein president during his second visit to the US this year. London has promised to begin dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence It is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for good. But senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism. A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Mr Gore. In a letter to Mr Adams confirming today's meeting, Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's principal national security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's 'role in bringing about the IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for peace'.

Intending  to conduct strategy talks in London with British Prime Minister  John Major and senior cabinet ministers, Mr Patten reiterated a  stern warning to China not to mix politics and economics.    He intimated China might have more to lose than Britain if  it  did so. ""China has pretty well a two-to-one trade surplus with  the United Kingdom,"" Mr Patten said. ""China has attempted to  join the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), an  application which has the United Kingdom's and, of course, the  Hong Kong Government's enthusiastic support. And countries  which join Gatt don't behave in the sort of way that has been  suggested by one or two Chinese officials.""    Since the Sino-British negotiations broke down, Mr Patten's  relations with Beijing have been strained and acrimonious.    Britain has now embarked on unilateral constitutional reform  in Hong Kong, but he stressed that the door to negotiations on  the contentious issues surrounding the final elections under  British rule was still open. With the first part of his  constitutional reform package now before the legislature Mr  Patten has made it clear the remainder will not be introduced  until after that bill is approved. The bill needs to be  approved by the end of the month, leaving the way clear for the  remainder of the constitutional reform package to be introduced  in March.    Mr Patten will seek cabinet backing to take this course of  action when he meets senior ministers in London on Monday. ""I  don't think you should expect any dramatic announcements,"" he  said. ""The position is one I think the community well  understands. We want to go on talking to Chinese officials  about the three outstanding contentious issues (surrounding the  1995 Legislative Council elections). ""We're happy to go on  talking until that moment when we have to begin legislating on  the remaining matters which have to be resolved for the 1995  elections. We hope that the talks can be resumed, and if that's  not the case we will have to try with the Legislative Council to  put in place arrangements which are acceptable to Hong Kong,"" Mr  Patten said.    Today, he will begin his strategy talks with the British  Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, and the minister  responsible for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad.     "
0,FT922-5600 ,"FT922-5600 _AN-CE2ATAFDFT 920529   FT  29 MAY 92 / Chambers warn on fax directory fraud      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent   SUSPECTED fax directory fraud on British companies is being fuelled by the advent of the European single market because of companies' anxiety to become more widely known internationally, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce has warned. The association, which has been co-ordinating information on international fraud for the past three years, says there is evidence that some fax or telex directory frauds are used as fronts for money-laundering. Companies are persuaded to pay for entries in directories that will be published only in token editions, if at all. The frauds are difficult to combat since each involves at least three countries, and the payments - large numbers of small sums - can divert banks' suspicions from other payments, representing the laundering of drug money or other criminal funds. The latest suspected fraud is being run in Britain from Hamburg for a classified fax directory. An invoice-cum-order form offers insertion in 'The TVV Business Directory' for Pounds 390. Companies are targeted from The Fax Book, BT's directory, entry in which is free. There is no telephone number for the company, only a fax line. Ms Jocelyn Jackson-Matthews, who co-ordinates anti-fraud activity for the chambers, said a legitimate operator would state the directory's target audience and print run on the form. It would then invite the order. The Hamburg form disclaims liability to publish on any date, and does not specify the size of the print run or distribution of the directory. The form also reserves to the operator the right to design and illustrate directory entries. The forms have been posted from Prague in Czechoslovakia, giving the sender the benefit of cheap bulk mailing rates while muddying any legal trail by adding a third jurisdiction to those of Britain and Germany. 'The forms are illegal under the Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 and 1975,' said Ms Jackson-Matthews. 'Even if the directory is published, no one is obliged to pay. Alleged debts will be entirely un-enforceable under UK law.' Similar fax directory offers in the past two years have led to her dealing with hundreds of complaints from companies. Many people became seriously worried last year when one Swiss fraudster started printing his own counterfeit English court enforcement orders for payment. Mr Otto Kiehl, of Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said that although the latest fax directory operation was illegal in Britain and contrary to his chamber's code of ethics, no criminal offence was being committed against German companies. The police were therefore powerless. 'The only course is for any victims to sue in the German courts', he added. UK police estimate that each individual directory fraud nets up to Pounds 2m for the criminal. A typical mailing involves 100,000 fake invoices with an average demand for Pounds 500. Police think up to 4 per cent of 'invoiced' companies pay. Chances of police action are slight. West Yorkshire Police said yesterday: 'It is difficult to be effective against this type of offence because of different jurisdictions being involved and the law being different in the countries concerned.'

0,FT933-9515 ,"FT933-9515 _AN-DHJCNAATFT 930810   FT  10 AUG 93 / The Hard Ecu and All That: a Good Thing?      By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent   WHAT is the hard Ecu? It is an idea for a new, parallel European currency dreamed up by Britain in 1990 as its contribution to the debate over European monetary union. It was dropped after opposition from the rest of the EC which believed it to be a diversionary tactic aimed at camouflaging Britain's lack of interest in Emu. But with the Maastricht process thrown into disarray by the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, the hard Ecu could come back on to the agenda. Why would anyone want hard Ecus? They would bridge the gap between national currencies, such as the D-Mark and sterling, and a new single currency for Europe to be ushered in later. They would be used by business people, tourists and anyone buying and selling goods and services in different parts of Europe. Circulating in parallel with national currencies and freely convertible, hard Ecus would perform a function similar to Esperanto in languages. Who is backing the hard Ecu? The Institute of Directors, a free-market UK pressure group, thinks it great news for businesses, especially small ones. The Treasury and prime minister's office are playing it cool. Mr Norman Lamont, the accident-prone former chancellor, is an enthusiastic backer - which may not do much for the currency's chances. More positively, supporters of the currency reckon Mr Edouard Balladur, who took over as French prime minister earlier this year, said nice things about it while in opposition. What about critics? If the hard Ecu ever took off, banks would lose a fortune by the reduction in money-changing fees. So don't expect too many plaudits from them. The Bundesbank does not like the hard Ecu either. In its view, there is a strong, freely circulating currency that could be used across Europe - the D-Mark. Who would issue hard Ecus? This could be a job for the European Monetary Institute, a souped-up committee of European central bank governors, which is due to be set up on January 1 in an as-yet undecided location. Under the Maastricht guidelines, the EMI is due eventually to become Europe's central bank, in charge of pan-European interest rates and a single currency. But what would happen to the Ecu already in existence? The existing Ecu (European currency unit) was invented in 1979 and is a purely artificial currency based on a 'basket' or set weights of national currencies. At present the D-Mark accounts for about 30 per cent of the Ecu and sterling 12. Although banks, big corporations and governments use Ecus for settling international transactions and for borrowing money, the currency has never caught on as a spending unit in the real world. Less than 1 per cent of EC trade is paid for using Ecus. You cannot use Ecus (worth 75.2p) in shops. So how would hard Ecus differ from 'basket' Ecus? The governments behind the hard Ecu would guarantee that it would never be devalued against the strongest national currency - essentially the D-Mark. They would use their foreign currency reserves and set interest rates to keep the hard Ecu strong. This is a completely different system to the one governing the basket Ecu - which no single body administers and whose value changes over time. Why is Mr John Major, the prime minister, dusting off the hard Ecu files? Reviving the proposals could help Britain maintain it has a solid set of proposals to help in the aftermath of the ERM fiasco. By underlining the pragmatic nature of the proposal that is basically to do with helping business, Mr Major could steer a middle way between the warring factions of the Conservative party over Europe. What happens now? Britain is expected to start detailed conversations with the rest of Europe over the hard Ecu in the autumn. Like the 1960s England soccer player Martin Peters, the hard Ecu could be a phenomenon ahead of its time, but which eventually is a hard act to beat.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT932-1458 ,"FT932-1458 _AN-DFWCJAGUFT 930623   FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (2): The metamorphosis of Manchester - Britain's bid for the Games is about much more than sport      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY   MANCHESTER'S bid for the 2000 Olympic Games symbolises important changes which have been taking place in Britain in the past 15 years. The bid - by Manchester on behalf of north-west England and Britain as a whole - is confirmation that Britain's regions are increasingly able to stand on their own feet. Britain remains a highly centralised country, with main roads and rail lines leading to London, where political power is at its most concentrated. But the dependence of the regions on London has been changing, particularly since the recession of 1980-82. Indeed, over the past three to four years, while the south-east has borne the brunt of the most recent economic downturn, the impact in Britain's regions has been less serious. Unemployment has risen less rapidly; average house prices in Greater Manchester have held steady and the prices of some types have risen. In the south-east by contrast, prices have fallen sharply. There appear to be three main reasons for these trends. First, London priced itself out of regional markets, for many financial and professional services in the 1980s, encouraging growth in these sectors in the regions, especially in Manchester and Leeds. This, in turn, has created tens of thousands of professional and white-collar jobs, and helped to turn Manchester into an important financial and professional centre in its own right. The second reason is infrastructure. The completion of the M62 between Liverpool and Hull has meant that not all main roads now lead south. An intra-regional trading economy has developed along the length of the M62 - directed through the Humber, which now matches the Thames in total cargoes. The Humber faces good northern European regional markets across the North Sea. The other infrastructure element is Manchester Airport, which - since its designation as an international gateway and Britain's official northern hub in the mid-1980s - has trebled in size to become the 18th largest in the world and plans to leapfrog five places up the world league table by 2005. The third force driving change has been economic and physical reconstruction. City centre dereliction has been tackled by creating new uses for old buildings, such as museums. A disused Manchester railway station has been turned into an exhibition hall and arena, and ship canal docklands have been transformed into a mixed residential-commercial quarter, Salford Quays. In Liverpool, the north west's other great city, the Albert Dock, a huge brick Victorian dockside warehouse built in the age of sail, now houses the northern branch of the Tate Gallery. Mr Anthony Goldstone, chairman of the North West Tourist Board, says: 'All this has started to change the image of smoking mill chimneys, dereliction and pollution. More than 5,000 mill chimneys have been knocked down. Tourists spend Pounds 1bn a year in the region.' At the same time, small and medium-sized business development - the seed corn of economic revival - has been fostered by the UK's most comprehensive regional network of enterprise agencies. Manchester's venture capital and corporate finance communities are strong, with power to syndicate their own deals, without the need to go to London. All these factors have enabled Manchester to mount a credible bid for the Olympic Games, even though many in southern England still believe only London is capable of winning such a prize. The bid is being driven by four people: Mr Bob Scott, whose vision it was; Mr Craig Reedie, chairman of the British Olympic Association and an unwavering supporter; Mr Howard Bernstein, deputy chief executive of Manchester city council, who fulfils the functions of finance director and general manager; and Mr John Glester, chief executive of Central Manchester Development Corporation, the government regeneration agency for the centre of the city. This makes him Whitehall's proxy in the team. Supporting them are the politicians. They start with Mr Graham Stringer, the pragmatic and widely-respected Labour leader of Manchester city council, and they finish with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, who has been active publicly and privately lobbying IOC members. The prime minister wants Manchester to succeed, and has made the most decisive contribution so far by guaranteeing funding, and by committing more than Pounds 75m of public money to clearing sites and building facilities. Amec, the construction group, is already building a velodrome and Bovis an arena. Manchester has as a result secured approval from the IOC's 12-member technical delegation, enabling the city to concentrate on selling itself, as a gateway to a Britain which can be easily reached via a transportation infrastructure already largely in place. As a further bonus, London is easily accessible to visitors. When Atlanta won the 1996 Games, it followed the securing of similar technical approval. Its final campaign was able to sell Dixie and the romantic US south. Manchester made a bid for the 1996 Games and lost - but it learned from the experience. If it wins this time, it will be because it won its heats at home, not only knocking London out of the running but persuading the government that staging the Games made serious economic sense and deserved some up-front spending. This is not just because of the Pounds 4bn of added value which the Games would be likely to generate, with more than 11,000 jobs created, but because holding the events in the north west would speed the regeneration of a difficult part of east Manchester blighted by a former coal mine, a gasworks and canalside dereliction which is a legacy of the industrial revolution. Long term, these problems would have had to be tackled anyway, as would Manchester's growing problem over student accommodation, which subsequent use of the Olympic athlete's village will partly solve. The Olympic bid has, therefore, provided a focus. Winning the Games will give Manchester a chance of emerging as one of Europe's most important cities in the 21st century. Manchester is already capital of the north. Economically, the north-west alone is bigger than Greece or Portugal. Mr Stringer thinks Europe will have room for only about a dozen big regional centres in the next few decades and Greater Manchester, a conurbation of 2.5m people in a north of England populated by 14m, is already well on the way to becoming one of them. Mr Stringer says it should be compared with Lyons, Barcleona, Milan, Stuttgart or Munich to appreciate its European potential. The Games would therefore help change the structure of Britain and the balance of economic power between north and south. They are concerned with much more than 17 days of sport in seven years' time.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7997 Membership Sports and Recreation Clubs.

This is absolutely true. One example is that the report  attacks Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law as ""a  serious hidden threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the implementation of the  Joint Declaration.""    The spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  National People's Congress (NPC) replied to this, pointing out  that these provisions of the Basic Law were a concrete  expression of the Chinese Government resumption of the exercise  of sovereignty on 1 July 1997. It was totally unreasonable for  the report to attack these provisions. Such an attack precisely  reveals the real motive behind the British side's attempt to  extend Britain's control and influence over Hong Kong.    Article 18 of the Basic Law states: In the event that the  Standing Committee of the NPC decides to declare a state of war  or, due to turmoil within the HKSAR which endangers national  unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of  the Region, decides that the Region is in a state of emergency,  the Central People's Government may issue an order applying the  relevant national laws in the Region.    Article 158 states: The power of interpretation of this Law  shall be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC.    The importance of these provisions to realizing and  safeguarding China's sovereignty is self-evident.    China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong in 1997 is not just a matter of changing flags. The HKSAR,  which will be directly under the Central People's Government,  must be established in accordance with the decision of the NPC;  the Basic Law of the HKSAR approved by the NPC must be  implemented; foreign affairs must be administered by the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs; national defense must be the  responsibility of the Central People's Government; the chief  executive and principal officials of the executive organs of the  HKSAR must be appointed by the Central People's Government; the  declaration of a state of emergency of the HKSAR must be decided  by the NPC; and the power of interpretation of the Basic Law  must be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC. All these  represent the expression of China's resumption of the exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong and are also an expression of the  principle of integrating upholding the country's unity with  ensuring a high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR. The NPC is the  highest organ of state power, and it exercises state sovereignty  in a unified manner. China's resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong will inevitably be reflected in the  participation of the NPC and its Standing Committee in the  handling of Hong Kong affairs. How can we talk about upholding  the principle of sovereignty if the NPC and its Standing  Committee cannot exercise even the power of declaring a state of  emergency in Hong Kong or the power of interpreting the Basic  Law? Britain is opposed to these two articles of the Basic Law.  Is this not a brazen challenge to China's sovereignty?    We really cannot understand why the NPC's possession of  these  two kinds of power can constitute a ""serious threat"" to the  HKSAR. Suppose the NPC declares a state of emergency in the  HKSAR because the Region is threatened by war, or by reason of  turmoil within the Region which endangers national unity or  security and is beyond the control of the government of the  Region, and this enables Hong Kong to avoid aggression and  ensures the unity and security of the state -- does this  represent a ""serious threat?"" If some people attempt to tamper  with or distort the meaning of the provisions of the Basic Law  and attempt to create chaos in Hong Kong, and the NPC Standing  Committee interprets the relevant provisions in order to ensure  the correct implementation of the Basic Law, does this represent  a ""serious threat?"" The right to enjoy a high degree of  autonomy is invested in the HKSAR by the NPC, and this can be  realized only if the Basic Law approved by the NPC is correctly  implemented. According to the report, Britain, which is opposed  to the Basic Law, seems to have become the defender of the  HKSAR's autonomy, while the Chinese NPC, which resolutely wants  to implement the Basic Law, seems to constitute a ""threat"" to  this autonomy. Has anyone ever heard such logic?    That the NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned  above  is entirely a guarantee of the realization of ""one country, two  systems"" and is a guarantee for the prosperity and stability of  Hong Kong. To the several million Hong Kong residents who love  their country and Hong Kong, this can only produce a ""sense of  stability"" and a ""sense of security,"" and will not produce any  ""sense of threat.""    Only the following types of people will have a sense of  ""threat"" and even ""serious threat"": People who have all along  been opposed to the Basic Law and who intentionally attempt to  tamper with or distort the Basic Law; people who hope that Hong  Kong will become an ""independent"" or ""semi-independent""  political entity; and people who are ""opposed to anything put  forward by China"" and who are dead set on regarding China as  their enemy. As a matter of fact, these kinds of people can be  put under one category, a category of people who willingly  grovel at the feet of the British and serve the colonial rule.  The number of people in this category is not large. That the  NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned above will  certainly constitute an enormous obstacle to their perverse  acts, and, therefore, this will naturally cause a sense of  ""serious threat"" among them. When the British parliamentary  report attacks the Basic Law, it is absolutely speaking for  these people, and the motive is evident.    When the Basic Law was approved by the NPC, the British  Foreign Ministry made a statement saying that the Basic Law was  an important milestone in Hong Kong's future, it reflected the  spirit of the Joint Declaration, and was welcomed as a  constitution. Only four years have passed, and the Basic Law  has not yet been implemented, but Britain has changed from  ""praising"" the Basic Law to opposing it. Chris Patten, who kept  on saying that he ""read the Basic Law more often than the  Bible,"" also said a few days ago that Britain pointed out long  ago that the Basic Law was harmful to the Joint Declaration.  What does that mean? Did Britain say one thing and mean  another in the past or is it playing tricks today? Either  alternative shows Britain's hypocrisy and ulterior motives.     "

Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi who made the  above remarks in an interview with IRNA here today, said the  talks between the United Nations secretary general and foreign  ministers of the contact group of the Organisation of the  Islamic Conference (OIC) on the Bosnian crisis, confirmed for  the first time in UN history, that the Security Council's  problem of making decisions for solving disputes has not only  been the characteristic of the Cold War era and the East-West  dispute, ""but the standard and the yardstick has been the  interests of the permanent members of the Council that has made  decision-making difficult and sometimes impossible.""    He added that the OIC contact group with political and legal  reasoning drew the attention of the Security Council to the  tasks it has for peace and defending the rights of the peoples  on the basis of the principles and goals of the UN Charter. The  group criticized that failure to meet those goals has led to the  weakening of sovereignty and the ethnic-cleansing in Bosnia.    The group maintained that in the post Cold War era following  the previous policies is unjustifiable.    According to Mohammadi, the second issue is that the  Security  Council for the first time during two years of bloodshed in B-H  and the efforts of the 51 Muslim countries and their solidarity  in defence of Muslim rights, realized the presence of some new  form of racial discrimination in the west similar to South  African apartheid, and the frankness in the speeches of OIC  ministers to which the secretary general has referred, naturally  cannot be without effect in activities and future decisions of  the Security Council.    Asked by IRNA whether the West intends to weaken the  solidarity of Muslim states, he said obviously the establishment  of this kind of Islamic solidarity in defending the Muslims of  B-H was unexpected both for the Security Council and certain  western states.    The spokesman said Iran has always made efforts at the OIC,  the UN and the Non-Aligned Movement as well as in bilateral  relations with other countries to prevent the savage ethnic  cleansing and violations of international norms.    ""Certain Muslim countries, too, have been harmonious with  such positions and the formation of the OIC contact group at the  UN in New York was based on the same common positions and  Islamic solidarity,"" he added.    He commented that public opinion in the Islamic world is  opposed to the inaction of international bodies against the  crimes of Serbs and thinks that some type of new apartheid in  the West is being formed which unlike the past is not only based  on racial discrimination but also includes some sort of belief  discrimination and for this reason they have the right to  support those who share the same religion with them.    Questioned whether the British Government's allegations that  Iran is supporting the Irish Republican Army (IRA) could colour  Security Council decisions, he said: ""Obviously that is not  without relation. because Britain is among the permanent members  which has always tried to consider the issue of Bosnia outside  of the Security Council and by negotiation between the aggressor  and the aggressed. This measure will cause both the lengthening  of the time for decision making against the aggressor party and  also the loss of many concessions and much human loss for the  people of Bosnia- Herzegovina.""    The public opinion of the Muslim world has been much aroused  due to the deterrent policies of Britain in the Security Council  and even NATO against the crimes of Serbs, he added.    ""The judgement of Muslims about Britain is that the policy  makers in London are the factor responsible for defeating any  measure against the Serbs and opposed to any plan that  guarantees the rights of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina of  which David Owen's plans are some typical examples,"" said the  spokesman.    He said ""London's unfounded claims emanate from internal  problems and from the weakness to overcome those problems.  Therefore, the traditional practice of these countries at the  time of internal crisis is to show the foreign relations as  being acute and divert the public opinion from the internal  situation to the external situation in order to whitewash  (internal) problems.""    According to Mohammadi another incentive of British  authorities for bringing up such false matters is the fruitless  efforts of London and Washington for isolating Iran.    ""After this much investment we see that the common policy of  the United States and Britain has been isolated among Europeans  and Japan. Therefore, the propaganda machinery of Britain,  simultaneously and awkwardly comes up with the propaganda of  Iran having connections with the Irish Republican Army, and the  training of Japanese nationals for terrorist operations in  Europe.    ""The main goal of such propaganda, is to affect the  cooperation based on mutual interests of the Islamic Republic of  Iran with those countries,"" he added.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the London sources know  well that the Islamic Republic of Iran is opposed to terrorist  operations and violent acts in their various forms, and even  cooperates with some countries in the direction of fighting this  dangerous phenomena that was created by the West.    Asked to comment on the invitation to Iran for negotiations  with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] that was in the communique  of the joint session of the U.S. secretary of state and the  countries of the Persian Gulf the spokesman said:    ""We have always announced our readiness to remove  misunderstandings with UAE, without any preconditions, within  the framework of the letter of the head of the state of UAE  Sheikh Zayed to the president of Iran.    ""We consider bilateral talks for strengthening of good  neighborly relations and provision of collective interests in  the region which has united our security and interests.  However, since we believe that outsiders seek their interests  in creating unrest in the region and the surfacing of disputes  between Muslim states, to involve them in the task of removing  misunderstanding will not help solve the problem but it will be  in the direction of their filthy intentions.""    Asked for latest information about the status of Iranian  diplomats kidnapped in Beirut way back in 1982, he said the  Foreign Ministry through the Iranian ambassador to Beirut had  officially called on the Lebanese Government to precisely  consider the fate of the four Iranians, the longest held  hostages in Lebanon.    Mohammadi said the measures have been taken in the wake of  the arrest of Phalangist militia chief Samir Geagea, and the  Lebanese Government, too, has assured to investigate the issue  which, he said, is reason for hope on the Iranian side.

0,FT941-764 ,"FT941-764 _AN-EC2DQABUFT 940329   FT  29 MAR 94 / Brussels backs Britain over 'mad cow disease'      By DAVID GARDNER   The UK has won strong backing from Brussels over Germany's threat of a unilateral ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The European Commission told Germany it would take legal action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban. Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon. Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover for action against the UK. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, complained yesterday that 'the hysterical reaction in Germany' had already caused 'measurable damage to British trade'. In January and February beef exports to Germany had fallen to less than one eighth of annual levels two years ago. But Mrs Shephard said the damage had spread to include cancelled contracts for British pork, lamb and even whisky. There was also, she said, a knock-on effect into neighbouring countries such as Belgium, where a fast-food chain had just cancelled a large order of British beefburgers. Mrs Shephard did not rule out the possibility of seeking legal redress. Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. The commission has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans. A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which Britain and the commission say are working. In 1990 certain bovine offals, such as brain and spleen, were banned for human consumption. Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of live cattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows. In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years. British officials say that the EU market will be disrupted unless all member states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat of unilateral action risks an EU-wide collapse in beef consumption similar to the fall that followed the 1990 BSE scare. A British agriculture official said: 'We feel we have a sound case and other member states and the commission agree with us.'   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

[Heseltine] It is apparent that worsening relations between  the two economic giants will bring benefits to nobody.  Solutions to trade problems should be sought in GATT  multilateral trade negotiations. I rate highly Japan's  concessions in the GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  talks because they greatly contributed to the successful  conclusion of the talks.    [Sakai] How do you assess Japan's market-opening efforts?    [Heseltine] Japan is still a protectionist nation. It  should open its door wider to investments and trade. Its  discriminatory tariffs on Scotch whisky is a good example. It  is also very difficult for foreign companies to gain access to  the Japanese trading market unless they are associated with  major Japanese trading firms through capital participation.  Japan entered the world market in the 1860's and integrated its  more controlled society and culture with a capitalistic system.  I think the capitalistic system in Japan is different from  capitalism.    [Sakai] Do you meet opposition from bureaucrats to  deregulation?    [Heseltine] Yes, some of them are opposed to deregulation.  But we intend to keep intact regulations related to health care,  the environment, and social affairs. What should be abolished  are the regulations that prevent creativity and investments. It  is also important for the administration to have bureaucrats  constantly review their own structure according to changes.  What politicians should decide is whether the government should  promote deregulation while placing priority on the benefits of  manufacturers or those of consumers and markets.    [Sakai] Against the wishes of Honda Motor Company, British  Rover Group is to be acquired by BMW of Germany.    [Heseltine] I understand how Honda feels. But the future  success of Rover Group will be advantageous to Honda in auto  parts supply. I hope other parts suppliers also should not have  negative feeling. Forty-one percent of Japan's entire  investments in Europe are made in Britain. Japanese companies  are welcomed here. I think they are fully aware of their  capability to manufacture competitive products.    [Sakai] The sale of Rover Group to BMW means that Britain  entrusts automobile production to a foreign country.    [Heseltine] Britain has also a large share in possessions  and management of major European companies. Industrial  nationalism is now less important compared to the past.     "
0,FT933-7856 ,"FT933-7856 _AN-DHSCEABZFT 930819   FT  19 AUG 93 / Low prices hit recycling      By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent   A COMPANY that buys waste newsprint in central Scotland for recycling has told councils it can no longer afford to pay for the paper they collect, because of low prices in the waste newsprint market. Stirling Recycling, of Gartcosh, near Glasgow, is no longer paying for the waste newsprint it takes from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Falkirk district councils. The councils collect old newspapers and magazines which local people have put in recycling banks and pass them on to Stirling Recycling, which sells them to newsprint processors. Mr David Symmers, chief executive of the Independent Waste Paper Processors Association, said: 'This sort of problem is happening all over Britain - some companies are charging councils for taking the newsprint off them. 'The market is weak because Europe is flooded with surplus waste paper from the subsidised German recycling system.' The oversupply of waste newsprint in Britain and the increasing unwillingness of the companies that take it to pay for it means that the cost to local authorities of running newsprint recycling schemes will escalate. If Edinburgh District Council receives nothing from Stirling Recycling up to the end of this financial year, it will forgo income of Pounds 26,000 - or Pounds 10 per tonne - and still have to pay to collect the paper. 'It can cost companies up to Pounds 30 per tonne to collect, bale and clean the waste newsprint,' said Mr Symmers. 'Yet they may only be getting Pounds 25 for selling it.' Germany, where both producers and consumers are legally obliged to pay for the recycling of waste paper and packaging, is blamed for flooding the European market with surplus waste. Other European Community countries are trying to persuade Germany to change its recycling policies. Mr Symmers said that the UK needed more plants such as the one proposed in Aylesford by SCA Group and Mondi. 'We badly need one in Scotland,' he added. A project spearheaded by North British Newsprint, part of Stirling Recycling, to build a Pounds 220m recycled newsprint mill at Gartcosh has been stalled since 1991 when Abitibi-Price, the Canadian paper company, pulled out. Mr Christopher Wilkins, chairman of North British Newsprint, said it would review its plans for the plant in the light of events at Aylesford. 'The project is fully developed and a major company is currently contributing towards it,' he said. 'We are waiting for the appropriate time to start.'   Companies:-  Stirling Recycling.

Intending  to conduct strategy talks in London with British Prime Minister  John Major and senior cabinet ministers, Mr Patten reiterated a  stern warning to China not to mix politics and economics.    He intimated China might have more to lose than Britain if  it  did so. ""China has pretty well a two-to-one trade surplus with  the United Kingdom,"" Mr Patten said. ""China has attempted to  join the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), an  application which has the United Kingdom's and, of course, the  Hong Kong Government's enthusiastic support. And countries  which join Gatt don't behave in the sort of way that has been  suggested by one or two Chinese officials.""    Since the Sino-British negotiations broke down, Mr Patten's  relations with Beijing have been strained and acrimonious.    Britain has now embarked on unilateral constitutional reform  in Hong Kong, but he stressed that the door to negotiations on  the contentious issues surrounding the final elections under  British rule was still open. With the first part of his  constitutional reform package now before the legislature Mr  Patten has made it clear the remainder will not be introduced  until after that bill is approved. The bill needs to be  approved by the end of the month, leaving the way clear for the  remainder of the constitutional reform package to be introduced  in March.    Mr Patten will seek cabinet backing to take this course of  action when he meets senior ministers in London on Monday. ""I  don't think you should expect any dramatic announcements,"" he  said. ""The position is one I think the community well  understands. We want to go on talking to Chinese officials  about the three outstanding contentious issues (surrounding the  1995 Legislative Council elections). ""We're happy to go on  talking until that moment when we have to begin legislating on  the remaining matters which have to be resolved for the 1995  elections. We hope that the talks can be resumed, and if that's  not the case we will have to try with the Legislative Council to  put in place arrangements which are acceptable to Hong Kong,"" Mr  Patten said.    Today, he will begin his strategy talks with the British  Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, and the minister  responsible for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad.     "

Day after day and  night after night, he carries on an endless series of dialogues  in Brussels, making every effort to convince his interlocutors  with reasonable arguments. As president of the negotiations, he  had to tolerate how his impatient German colleague, Klaus  Kinkel, took over the reins and, sometimes rudely, put pressure  on those who would obstruct taking on board Norway, Sweden,  Finland, and Austria as new EU member states.    Now, however, it looks as if the planned enlargement of the  European Union by 1 January 1995 is a big mistake and a big  misunderstanding. Pangalos himself thinks that this is the  case. The EU would have been better off with an internal  reorganization aimed at making mutual cooperation stronger, and  not taking on any new members until the end of the decade, the  minister said this week, just after returning to Greek soil.    Has Pangalos gone crazy? Or is he right? The intended  enlargement to include Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria had  already caused deep splits in the EU, even before the European  Parliament had received all the texts of the agreements. Great  Britain and Spain are mercilessly threatening to explode an  institutional time bomb with their refusal to give up any of  their voting weight in an enlarged Union. [British Prime  Minister] Major can hardly make a move, hunted as he is by the  Euroskeptics in his own rank and file and the media, which never  stops recalling the glory days of former Prime Minister  Thatcher, who, all on her own, had the rest of Europe on its  knees in the debate on reimbursing EC contributions.    On the continent itself, the reliable Franco-German axis has  shown signs of overheating, following the controversial  statements made by the French ambassador in Bonn concerning the  all too assertive role which Germany wants to play in Europe.  Elsewhere, too, distrust is raising its head. ""Germany wants  to complete the enlargement of the EU as soon as possible so  that it can seize its opportunities in Central and East Europe.""  That is how Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans interpreted  Kinkel's enthusiasm in Brussels.    So what happens now with the enlargement? Diplomats in  Brussels have no idea how the impasse over the ""blocking  minority"" during the decisionmaking process -- i.e., should it  be 23 or 27 votes in the EU? -- can be resolved by next Tuesday  when the foreign ministers of the 12 EU member states meet  again. Various formulas are making the rounds whereby the  decisionmaking process would be interrupted for, say, two months  in order to reach a consensus, but so far this looks like it has  little chance of succeeding.    This means that there is a real threat of an enormous  crisis,  and this seems to prove Pangalos even more correct. It would  have been better if the EU had given itself more time to  ""digest"" the Maastricht Treaty. The European Commission also  felt that first there should have been talks on ""deepening"" and  then enlarging the Union, but the European heads of government  decided otherwise at their summit in Lisbon in the summer of  1992, recalled a Commission spokesman suddenly when asked for a  reaction to Pangalos' statements.    That decision in Lisbon can be attributed to the amazing  outcome of the first Danish referendum in spring 1992.  President Delors' plans to produce ""a political, intellectual,  and institutional shock"" with his report on the impact of the EU  enlargement were quickly consigned to oblivion. Nobody needed a  shock. So instead, Great Britain got all the support for  recommending that enlargement negotiations should begin as soon  as possible, without first discussing the institutional  adjustments. London feels that the larger the Union, the more  noncommittal the cooperation.    The remarkable thing is that Great Britain is now provoking  an institutional discussion through demanding more  decisionmaking weight as a large member state, and thus is  threatening to block the enlargement. This is precisely the  reason why Germany is keeping its powder dry and wants to wait  until the intergovernmental conference in 1996 before tabling  its claim for more weight in the European Council of Ministers.  Bonn first wants to ensure that the enlargement is secure, and  then lean back and advance the thesis that 10 votes for 80  million inhabitants is not very much, compared to the 10 votes  which, say, France and England, each have for around 58 million  inhabitants in their countries.    Pangalos -- the man who made the wrong decision - still has  the task of finding a way out of the impasse next week, with the  help, of course, of the always obliging Kinkel.     "
0,FT943-10163 ,"FT943-10163 _AN-EHGAUAC8FT 940806   FT  06 AUG 94 / Deep burial 'best way' to rid Britain of N-waste: Extend cooldown period for old stations, says report      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   Deep burial remains the government's preferred way of disposing of the radioactive waste generated by Britain's nuclear power stations and research installations. In a consultation document on radioactive waste management policy released yesterday, the Department of the Environment said this provided the safest, and most economical, permanent solution to the more dangerous forms of waste, such as spent fuel rods and contaminated equipment. It also said that the period over which retired power stations are allowed to cool down before final dismantling could be extended from 100 to 135 years, in some cases. The document was welcomed by the nuclear power industry because it stressed both commercial and safety factors at a time when the two state-owned nuclear power generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, are hoping to be privatised. Mr Roger Hayes, director-general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, the trade group, said it showed the industry was on the right track. But it was quickly condemned by opposition parties and the environmental movement for putting financial factors above environment and safety. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said the government was 'trying to cut down the cost in order to get shot of the problem'. The 100-page document forms part of the government's review of nuclear policy. Although much of it reaffirms existing policies, the results will have a key bearing on whether Britain builds any more nuclear power stations as ageing reactors are shut down. The government's preferred method of dealing with high level nuclear waste from Britain's 30 nuclear sites is to use a process called 'vitrification' to transform it into a kind of glass. It will then be left for 50 years to cool before being consigned to a permanent deep store several thousand feet underground. But the paper also says that nuclear operators can leave the spent fuel to cool in a dry store, if it makes more commercial sense. The main shift in policy hinted at in the document is allowing nuclear operators to decommission spent power stations over a longer period. Both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear have been pressing for this. Stations could be left to cool down for 35 years after closure, and then left for another 100 years before final removal, rather than doing the whole job in 100 years.

They do this as it  is their custom, which history has made us accustomed to, as  they are barbaric and savage peoples who have not ceased to  attack us from one century to another out of injustice and  hostility.    We, along with the whole world, do not belive that the  problem is the so-called Pan Am or Lockerbie incident. This is  only an excuse. When one of these countries -- namely Britain,  which is one of the great powers confronting us now, confronting  this small nation -- wanted to occupy an Arab country, Egypt in  1882, Britain said there was a fortress [tabiyah] in Alexandria  that was in conflict with Britain's security and should be  removed and that Egypt's building a fortress in Alexandria  constituted a threat to Britain's security.    When 'Urabi [Ahmad 'Urabi, an Egyptian nationalist who  fought  against British occupation] refused to remove that fortress,  Britain attacked Egypt on the pretext of self-defense. This  mockery was recorded in history, and convoys of martyrs became  victims of it.    Matters such as these are what made important sections of  the  Libyan people, such as writers, artists, religious jurists, and  lawyers, along with great masses of revolutionary people in all  the places I have visited [sentence as heard]. Because they  realized that the issue here is an attempt to seek unjust  aggression and find justification for this aggression.    What adds to our steadfastness and strengthens our stance is  that the struggling forces against injustice and insolence in  all parts of the world stand by us. We salute today the  presence of representatives of peoples and international  organizations who raise their voices and say that America,  Britain, and France are states that are transgressors and  aggressors and have no right in anything they do against the  Libyan people. The Libyan people are innocent people who have  been wronged, and consequently, they deserve that all strugglers  and honorable people stand by them. This is the reason of their  presence with us today. [passage omitted]    France rejects the Security Council, the so-called Security  Council, resolution. It refuses to resolve its problem with  Libya. It refused to solve the problem although the Security  Council calls on Libya to respond to investigations by France.  Libya responded but France refused to cooperate with Libya to  resolve its problem concerning the French UTA plane.    This is a clear violation by France of the Security Council  resolution. The Security Council should hold a session and try  France, which violated that resolution and refused to implement  it. Sanctions should be imposed on it according to Article 7,  since we are talking now about Article 7. It is false.    This festival is taking place in conjunction with an  international power to support the Libyan people's rights and to  demonstrate clear international condemnation of the aggressive  policies of Western states. It is taking place in the shadow of  a type of mourning, sorrow, and pain that is cast over Tripoli,  Benghazi, and Libya as a whole. Tens of families lost their  children, on a day corresponding to today in 1986, when America  and Britain violated UN resolutions prohibiting the use of force  or threats for the use of force in international relations after  World War II.    They perpetrated unjustifiable barbaric aggression and a  blatant violation of Article 7. This article should have been  implemented on America and Britain. The UN Security Council  could not implement this as long as the assaulting countries are  the ones that can veto the Security Council resolutions.  Therefore, what kind of a Security Council we are relying on?    Brothers, from the legal aspect, this meeting is that of  defiance. This is a nice thing and a law on facing force. We  see it only as a meeting of defiance of a people, of an  important part of a people who are exposed to injustice,  attacks, and hostility. [passage omitted]    After Western capitalist imperialism becomes a tyrant and  wants to impose the impossible on the world, confrontation is no  longer between money and law, but between money and blood. It  said it was inevitable that blood replaced law. Exactly the  amount of blood offered by peoples in their struggle in  defending their dignity, humanity, and their right to life and  existence becomes the deterrent law. There is no hope at all in  this respect to resort to the UN charter. The UN charter has  been destroyed. The 1986 raid on Tripoli burnt the UN charter.  They had lied to us. America, France, and Britain had lied to  us, and also the Soviet Union in the Stalin era. They had lied  to us and said the United Nations is good news to the peoples of  the world. [passage omitted]    They told us that this is the United Nations Organization,  come and join us. So, we the poor and good people came. Then,  we found that this organization was a sword brandished over our  necks and that nations are not equal. [passage omitted]    Brothers, who would now dare to say that we are deceived and  let's get out of the United Nations? We say it now. We  (?explain) getting out of the United Nations because it has  proved to be a lie. In the name of the United Nations,  thousands of Iraq's children are dying.    Children of Iraq were burnt (?in the occupation of Kuwait).  Do Iraqi children still occupying Kuwait deserve to die by the  thousands in the name of the United Nations? (?We) have left  Kuwait and all of us said it was unjust and an invasion, and we  were against all the things Iraq's ruler did in Kuwait. All was  condemned.    We are facing, without Kuwait, the same fate of Iraq. Did we  occupy Iraq? We are facing the same tragedy. Did Korea occupy  Kuwait? Is North Korea the only state on the earth that reached  nuclear energy and thus makes them attack it, threaten it, and  bomb it? It is the last state to reach nuclear energy, if it  has reached it, that is.    What is this abuse, law, and ethics. There is no such thing.  When the Soviet deterrent came to an end, the Western states  appeared in their true colors without any fear or shame and  appeared barbaric and savage.    When Khrushchev and Brezhnev were present, the Western  states  had ethics, and they respected international law within the UN  framework because they were afraid of the missiles of Khrushchev  and Brezhnev. Since the deaths of Khrushchev and Brezhnev and  the demise of the Soviet Union, America, Britain, and France  have no more ethics, human rights, or humaneness. [passage  omitted]    Can they answer why they killed dozens of children of Libya  (?in a day like this one)? Who can even interview them? Let us  go and submit it to the United Nations and inform Libya's  delegate at the United Nations tomorrow to submit, on the  occasion of this sinister anniversary, the following question:  Why did America and Britain kill dozens of children while they  were asleep?    When they submit it to the UN Security Council tomorrow,  America, and Britain will put their conditions because they have  the right of veto. How can we be reassured about the UN and the  UN Security Council? What is this Security Council?    [Passage omitted] If there was a law, my brothers, do you  think it would have been possible for America, Britain, and  France, the plaintiffs, to vote in the Security Council? Never.  In the Lockerbie case, they do not legally have the right to  participate in the vote because they are the plaintiffs. They  are not neutral towards Libya. [passage indistinct] If they  vote, and they are the plaintiffs and have the right of veto,  what is the meaning of the Security Council, what is its set-up  and decisions that [words indistinct] Arabs adhere to. We, the  Libyan people, condemn Arab governments that adhere to that  resolution. The sanctions against Libya are Arab.    Why don't they say that this is rubbish, this aggression.  These are controlled [qararat manzura] resolutions that cannot  be recognized, or they can at least be tolerated for some years  after which Arabs should say enough. We should defy the  deformities [a'hat]. Next to us are Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan,  and Egypt. Let them bring their planes to us and Libyan planes  go there. The sanctions will end, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,  too.    Saudi Arabia is preventing the pilgrims. Mecca has become  part of the sanctions. The house of God has become part of the  sanctions. [passage indistinct] Is it possible for the house of  God to become part of the sanctions? If a Libyan plane should  take off with pilgrims, Saudi Arabia should say that it was a  plane carrying pilgrims and allow it to land. But if it was for  trade, tourism purposes, or carrying other passengers, I would  abide by the sanctions. Saudi Arabia has the right to adhere to  America's Security Council resolutions.    Pilgrims cannot land in Riyadh or even in Jeddah. We can  [words indistinct] in Medina and then have to go by foot to  Mecca. They are pilgrims, but Saudis say no, Mecca is part of  the sanctions. Didn't you bring American troops -- who did not  have any control on Mecca and Medina -- on to the peninsula.  Here you are, [word indistinct]. The American resolution has  proved that it has control over Mecca and Medina. These are  facts.    But we cannot blame our brothers in Saudi Arabia for not  defying Security Council sanctions. They may be wishing to be  with us, and indeed we and them talk to each. We talk about  American injustice, American tyranny, American contempt to the  Arabs and all the peoples that want to liberate themselves. The  poor, they cannot. Saudi Arabia does not dare defy America.  Impossible. It is its destiny. Americans change governments,  borders; they change, they assassinate, they unleash the CIA in  the world to destroy at will. People raise a hue, a cry over the  KGB and remain silent over the CIA. What is the difference  between this and that, they are all evil. There is a law,  gentlemen. America and Britain should not vote at the Security  Council in this precise case [Lockerbie]. Besides, there is also  this contempt for the world. Is not there justice in the world  except in America and Britain? We said to them: try them in  Malta, they say no; we say in Egypt, they say no; in France, no;  in Holland, no. Justice in America and Britain only? This means  that all other countries have no justice, and there is justice  only in America and Britain. This is another contempt to all  peoples. This is not permissible. From the legal point of view  the two suspects cannot be tried in America and Britain. Why?  Because over there they already guilty. When they speak now  they do not say: the suspects, they say: those who have blown up  the Pan Am and UTA planes. If they already say guilty then the  case is no longer a case of accusation. They say: Libya  committed the Lockerbie operation. Therefore that is it: the  punishment of Libya, all these resolutions put an end to the  case. They put an end to the case because they constitute  punishment.    Look, as far as international law is concerned, the air  embargo, the blockade, and so on, including the losses incurred  by Libya because of the Lockerbie affair, are tantamount to  punishment. Normally when this punishment is over, the  Lockerbie affair ends automatically. Some say Libya carried out  Lockerbie and it has been punished for it. That's it then. The  matter should have stopped there. You said Libya carried out  the Lockerbie operation and you punished her for it. Fine then.  You thought Libya carried out the operation and that Libya was  guilty. If a person commits a crime and pays the price for it,  well that's it; he has paid the price. If you tell someone: You  have committed a crime and its punishment will be 10 years  imprisonment; and if you jail that person for 10 years, he must  be released at the end of that period. You cannot detain him  again by telling him: No, we cannot release you because you  committed that crime in the past. But if you committed it and  served 10 years in jail for it, why should you be detained any  longer? That should be it.    Let us suppose Libya carried out Lockerbie. Well, they have  already made her pay for it. The matter is over and there  should be no further legal prosecution. If we need to use  international law as an argument, then this is one of the  arguments we are presenting to the world. We have paid the  price and that's it; so don't talk about Lockerbie anymore and  close the file.    If there is a law, how come they forget the Montreal  agreement? How can they make light of the Montreal agreement?  The Montreal agreement allows Libya to try the suspects on  Libyan soil. The agreement is clear.    The Scottish prosecutor, the Scottish prosecutor general,  says hand them to a court in Scotland because courts in Scotland  are just and neutral. This prosecutor a month ago made a  statement swearing at Libya as if he was a diplomat or a lowly  journalist. Is it conceivable that this prosecutor general who  should be making legal statements is so filled with anti-Semitic  racist hatred? Semitism means Arabs. It should not be  interpreted the way Israelis do. We are Semites. [passage  omitted]    The Scottish prosecutor says Libya is a liar and has no  credibility or integrity. How could a suspect or the accused go  to his court when the Scottish prosecutor general makes these  statements? What would the judge be like when the prosecutor  behaves in such a way? [passage omitted]    He has said that the so-called Libyan parliament had  rejected  their trial in [word indistinct] and left it to public opinion.  This a tendentious political action against Libya. He  overstepped his position as a prosecutor general.    Who is trying to gain time? Is it the accused who has been  condemned politically and by the media before a trial and eager  to be tried to prove his innocence before the world, or is it  the person who has falsified the facts, doctored charge sheets?  Maybe the falsification was carried out with the full knowledge  of the prosecution itself.    If there was a law, this case would not have been referred  to  the Security Council, just like a civil case, an ordinary crime.  How was it referred to the Security Council? They have a  political objective. This should not at all have been referred  to the Security Council. When they spoke about referring it to  the Security Council, all law experts, and you among them, said  this was not possible. This is an ordinary crime, not a case to  be referred to the Security Council. It is not a dispute  between two states and should not have been referred to the  Security Council. [passage omitted]    Brothers, they have no scruples. This is not possible. They  are hunting a small people, the Libyan people, who have been  living under threats and infringement for so many years because  it wants to live free.    UN Security Council members think they could remain their  slaves for ever. Could they protect the Israelis in the occupied  territories? They could not. They could not because there is a  people there that is struggling. There is an ordinary  individual who is no governor or king, he has no power or  medals, he is not prominent, an individual who is barefoot and  has no identity who could carry out a suicide attack and kill  whomever he likes among the enemies. When we told them that the  Gaza-Jericho agreement was meaningless, they said: You are  against peace. I replied I was for real peace and told them  that they were the ones who were falsifying the truth and lying  to the Jews and the Palestinians, because Jews are at risk  because of this agreement.    It showed that 'Arafat is not all of the Palestinian  fighters; he is only the head of a single organization called  Fatah and not of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 'Arafat  is not a fighter. The solution is down to the fighters who have  destroyed this agreement and showed that it was... [pauses].  The Palestinian people have now started to fight. They have  said: To hell with the Gaza and Jericho agreement. A new power  has emerged over which Yasir 'Arafat has no control. From the  beginning, on the first day the Gaza-Jericho agreement was  signed, I made a statement and said I would deceive neither the  Jews nor the Palestinians and that the agreement was a big lie  because Yasir 'Arafat does not represent all the Palestinians  and because there is a power fighting in the arena now and it is  the one to hold negotiations with if there are to be any  negotiations. I said negotiations should be held with the  Palestinian people and all of the Palestinian people have to  return to their land. They said no, we want Fatah.    There you are, that is what you got from Fatah. There even  was a split within Fatah itself. Fatah hawks are now being  killed by the Israelis and they are killing the Israelis [words  indistinct]. Fatah are 'Arafat's followers, and they have  revolted against him. He has even deceived the Jews. Why do  [word indistinct] tell the Jews this is peace? This is  swindling. By the way, they all hate the Jews, they all are  Hitlers, all of them, from the United States to Russia. They  all wish the Jews to be eradicated, and they tell us that those  Jews are an evil that has to be eradicated; they hate them more  than we do. We eventually say we and the Jews are both Semite  and cousins, but they say that those ones are Semite and they  have destroyed the world. This is what the French, English, and  U.S. officials are saying; it is written in their agendas.  [passage omitted]    How do they give a machine gun to a doctor? Why did not the  Security Council convene to say that Israel is a terrorist  state? Why does the United States support terrorism? The United  States gives billions of weapons to so-called Israel, and  so-called Israel armed the doctor who perpetrated the massacre  at the al-Ibrahimi mosque. How do they give a machine gun to a  doctor? If an Arab country had armed a doctor and he was  witnessed fighting, they would have immediately put it in the  blacklist, declared it as a terrorist state, and put it under  siege, ban exports to it, humiliate and wipe it out. Why? They  would say because it had armed the doctor. [passage omitted]    How come the government gave him a machine gun? Before the  massacre, many days before, in front of the government, the  army, the Israeli officials, he used to go out and address  people and incite them. Are America, Britain, and France  civilized states? America, of course, does not pretent to be  civilized. It says we are [word indistinct], cowboys, and  criminals. They say all criminals are there and they had formed  America. America itself does not at all claim to be a civilized  state, and no one can confer on it such a certificate, but are  Britain and France civilized states? If Britain is civilized  and if France is civilized, then to hell with civilization.  This is not civilization. These are biased, very biased  nations. [passage omitted]    We defy the Americans to come and negotiate with Libya, and  we will not negotiate secretely with them. We are not a gang.  States negotiate openly. We challenge them to negotiate openly  with Libya. Even if they want to negotiate, they would say let  us negotiate secretly. We are not a gang to negotiate secretly.  If you are a gang, we are not a gang. It is the Israeli and  Palestinian gangs that go to Norway or Denmark or I do not know  where, in Oslo, to negotiate secretly. They are right, they are  gangs: the Zionist Hagana or I do not know what gangs and the  Palestinian armed gangs. All gangs, and they have the right to  negotiate secretly. They are all gangs struggling for  Palestine. But we, independent states and members of the United  Nations who do not negotiate secretly.    What right has America to supply the Israelis with weapons?  Against who? They say: it is to strike the Arab Maghreb, the  Gulf, Sudan. They said to the Israelis: We have now done away  with the ring countries, and now we give you weapons. Yesterday  we saw a report on 25 aircraft whose range attains the Arab  Maghreb, Sudan, Yemen, the Arab Peninsula. [passage omitted]    The so-called Israel has admitted to possessing nuclear  weapons, why then don't they treat it like Korea? Like the  Rabta? This is not possible. The so-called Israel is exempt of  article 7. No matter what crimes it may commit, which fall 100  percent under article 7, America cannot permit that article 7 is  applied to Israel. Therefore, the charter of the UN is  finished. [passage omitted]    Therefore, it is not a case of justice or injustice and  legality or illegality. The UN Security Council member states  have told us that the United States had threatened and told them  to vote against Libya otherwise they would suspend economic aid  to them; vote against Libya to get economic aid. It is like a  judge going to witnesses and members of a court and threatening  them, ordering them to pass unjust sentences or else. [passage  omitted]    You hear statements made by the United States, Britain, and  France; they say that Libya is against the international  community. You three are against the international community and  swimming against the current. You have been afflicted by  conceit. However, this conceit will shatter on the rock of  peoples' resistance and the Libyan people's [word indistinct].  This arrogance and superciliousness will escalate the  resistance. This arrogance and audacity will inevitably  shatter. We enter the battle with resilience, good patience,  and unique courage. Let the battle between us and them continue  until doomsday. They are the ones who are seeking quick profits  and [word indistinct] without loss. They will lose in this  battle. We are fighting on our land, while they are fighting  outside their borders; in the seas, oceans, and continents.  They are opening fronts to terrify the whole world.    As a matter of fact, this gathering of Libyan men of law,  supported and backed by honorable men outside Libya in the Arab  homeland and the world, is an extremely important message  directed to America, France, and Britain precisely, the arrogant  and leagued states that have trampled under foot international  law, the sovereignty of peoples, the UN charter and conventions,  which do not permit comparison between what is done against the  Israelis and against the Arab countries. Double standards.  This is an extremely important message if they respect world  public opinion. But it should be made clear that it is they who  are isolated. Setting aside the [word indistinct] between Libya  and America, Britain and France, all the world stands on the  side of Libya.    In reality they have served the Libyan people because the  Libyan people were going along on their way, not paying  attention. They have awakened you and told you that they wanted  to harm you a second, third, and tenth time. They told you  their ambitions have been continuous since Caesar's time, since  the first century AD until today. They have warned you. In  fact we thank them for warning the Libyan people, who were not  vigilant. We have felt that their rifles were directed at the  chest of each one of us. On a night like this, innocent young  people were killed. Who blew up the the Berlin night club? In  the end, it became clear that Libya had nothing to do with the  Berlin nighclub. What should we do then about the dozens of  young people who died that night? Does this mean that this is  going to be repeated? Every Libyan is feeling that his child  might be killed, that he might be killed, that his home might  collapse on him at any time. He knows there is no Security  Council any more, no United Nations or international law; there  is a jungle. [passage omitted] We are resisting. Thank you.  The struggle continues.     "

Australia was branded a weak link in Western security last  night in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation television  investigation following the expulsion of six Russian spies last  year. The expulsions, reportedly on CIA directions, were kept  quiet by the Australian government, which is embarrassed at its  image as a soft target used by Moscow during and since the Cold  War. The expulsions were only exposed last month by an  opposition MP.    A spy hunt is under way to identify a network of as many as  30 Russian-recruited agents. The investigation was confirmed  last night in an interview with David Sadlier, Director-General  of the Australian Secret Service.    Through its shared military and commercial operations with  Britain and the United States, Australia is still considered to  be a more relaxed target for Russia to learn about its more  powerful allies. The security breach could date back ten years,  or possibly 30 years as the case of the last Soviet spy in  Australia, Vladimir Petrov, is reopened. A Russian translator  with the Australian secret service George Sadil, has been  committed for trial in Canberra for handing over intelligence  secrets that would have been passed on to MI6 and the CIA.    Last night the programme Lateline offered the first specific  details of Soviet penetration and damage. The targeting the  late 1980s was the joint Anglo-Australian development of the  worlds most sophisticated sonar buoy for tracking Soviet  submarine movements. The Barra sonar buoy was used by Britain in  the Atlantic and Australia in the Far East.    Developed in a project between Plessey and the Australian  government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the  Australian AWA defence manufacturer the buoy has 25 underwater  hydrophones. They are dropped by RAF Nimrod surveillance  aircraft for the Royal Navy, and by Australian Air Force Orion  aircraft for the Australian Navy.    Disclosure of the operation was made by Professor Desmond  Ball, of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, at the  Australian National University in Canberra.    The focus of attention was the Garden Island Naval Dockyard  beside the Opera House. Professor Ball explained how Soviet  agents intercepted phone calls between naval officers and  defence headquarters in Canberra, allowing Soviet agents to  monitor trials of the buoy by the naval facility south of Sydney.

The report, leaked to the magazine Personnel Today, says that personnel managers in Japanese companies are highly critical of UK skill levels and the poor quality of job candidates. The report was drawn up by the National Training Task Force, the voluntary body set up in 1989 to advise on the establishment of Training and Enterprise Councils. It says 85 per cent of personnel managers in Japanese manufacturing companies in the north-east found that candidates had serious skill shortcomings. In the Midlands and south Wales the figure was about 70 per cent. In Scotland it was five out of 10 and in north Wales four out of 10. According to the report, literacy, numeracy and technical skills are in particularly short supply. Mr Clive Morton, personnel director at Komatsu, said: 'Where investors run into trouble is in starting up with the existing level of skills in Britain. We have a long way to go before we meet the standards of Germany and France.' According to the Japanese External Trade Organisation, 137 Japanese companies are considering investment plans in Germany, compared with 107 in the UK. Britain has so far attracted more than Pounds 12bn in Japanese inward investment, almost half of Japanese investment of the total for Europe. Recently, though, Mitsubishi Electric decided to build a Pounds 500m semiconductor plant in Germany rather than the UK. A separate report in Personnel Today says that Asda, the supermarket group, is reviewing its participation in the government's National Vocational Qualification scheme. Asda, which was a pioneer of the scheme, is reported as saying that the system has become too costly and bureaucratic.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

The bombing was condemned as 'revolting' by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reflecting British concern that loyalist violence could threaten the open-ended IRA ceasefire announced last month. Mr Pat Doherty, a senior official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the UVF of trying to force the Dublin government to abandon direct contacts with republicans. 'The loyalist hope is that fear of the conflict being brought 'down here' will scupper the peace process,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said he was confident the IRA would not retaliate because Sinn Fein's leadership was 'totally committed' to the peace process. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said the attack would not deflect the Dublin government from its strategy of consolidating the republican ceasefire by talking directly to Sinn Fein. British officials believe the US is likely to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, at the Irish government's request, as part of the Irish strategy of drawing Sinn Fein into mainstream politics. However, Downing Street believes President Clinton and administration officials will avoid a direct meeting with Mr Adams for fear of weakening unionist support for the peace process. The Dublin bomb exploded as an express train from Belfast was pulling into Connolly station in the city centre. Two women were slightly hurt. Irish police said the explosion was caused by a detonator which failed to ignite a 2kg explosive charge, suggesting that casualties could have been higher. The UVF, which bombed a Dublin pub three months ago, said it had planted bombs in seven other locations in the city. None was found. The bombing reflects loyalist suspicion of a deal between Britain and the IRA, and confirms that Protestant terrorists are prepared to take their campaign to the Irish Republic. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the UVF and the Ulster Freedom Fighters said last week a loyalist ceasefire would depend on assurances that no deal had been done. Loyalists are also concerned about the implications of a 'framework' document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process.

Whether all four join the EU's existing 12 members in January now depends on whether they can sell European integration to their voters in referendums, starting with Austria next month. Latest opinion polls show that only in Finland is there a clear majority in favour of EU entry. But the size of yesterday's ratification was acclaimed by Nordic diplomats as a boost to their membership chances. In what European parliament president Mr Egon Klepsch described as 'a decision of historic importance', MEPs confounded critics of their chronic absenteeism with a near-record turnout of 468 of the 518 members. Amid barracking, an attempt to get the vote postponed was defeated by 305 to 150 votes with 13 abstentions. A large bloc of Euro-MPs then switched to demonstrate support for enlargement itself and all four countries were endorsed by huge majorities. Norway received 374 for, 24 against, and 58 abstentions; Austria 374 for, 24 against and 61 abstentions; Finland 377 for, 21 against, and 61 abstentions; and Sweden 380 for, 21 against with 60 abstentions. At the core of the No vote were neo-fascists complaining that the Maastricht treaty meant death to independent nations, and Greens arguing that an unreformed EU would destroy high environmental and social standards in the applicant countries. An exception was former French foreign minister and European commissioner Mr Claude Cheysson, who in a speech histrionically titled J'accuse, attacked 'the gravediggers of Europe' responsible for March's compromise with Britain in the row over EU voting rights. But the debate had already turned towards European Commission president Mr Jacques Delors' interpretation that parliament had won a victory in ensuring Britain got only cosmetic concessions in the voting row. Strasbourg had held enlargement hostage until Britain's partners faced down the UK demand that a small minority of countries should be able to block decisions in an expanded Union. Mr Delors called for a new federalist drive in Europe, and an offensive against Euro-sceptics he characterised as bigots. 'Let us go on the attack,' he urged MEPs, ahead of next month's Euro-elections. 'Don't be defensive. Don't just answer the people who have a different Europe to propose, because those are the anti-Europeans. Those are the people who do not accept people with different political convictions, different religions, or a different colour of skin.'   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Palace insiders said Friday that one reason for the quick award of the Order of  Merit, restricted to only 24 eminent men and women, was the queen's desire to  demonstrate that there is no animosity between Britain's two most prominent  women.    In the past, Buckingham Palace sources and journalists assigned to the royal  court have said that the two did not get along.    ""This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didn't like each  other,"" said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage and an authority  on the royal family.    As a member of the Order of Merit, created in 1902, Thatcher joins such  luminaries in the world of arts, science and politics as philosopher Isiah  Berlin, historian Veronica Wedgwood, writer Graham Greene, violinist Yehudi  Menuhin and artist Sidney Noland, as well as honorary member Mother Teresa.    Deceased recipients include Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Gen. Dwight D.  Eisenhower, missionary Albert Schweitzer and actor Lawrence Olivier.    Contrary to some reports, the OM, as it is popularly called, does not precede  all other British royal honors but ranks behind the Order of the Garter, which  dates from 1348.    Thatcher said she was ""deeply honored and moved"" by the award.

A little science, a smidgen of history and a dip into French, German or another European language'. And he claims, presumably correctly, that this is what the national curriculum will achieve. Is this a curriculum suitable for preparing British children for the 21st century, from an economic, political or cultural perspective? For Britain to reverse its economic decline, our education must include basic science and technology as central subjects, more important than the Bible or Shakespeare. A little science is not enough. If Britain is to participate fully in European governance and our children are to participate fully in its economic opportunities, every child should leave school fluent in another European language. A 'dip' into a foreign language - which is what most English children enjoy now - will leave us and them at an increasing disadvantage in all European matters. Ideally every child should have some of their schooling in another European country. In our multi-ethnic society, the exclusive focus on the Bible and Shakespeare is offensive to the non-Christian majority and makes no attempt to educate our children to be tolerant and inclusive in their religious and cultural attitudes. Joe Rogaly (and apparently the government's) curriculum is an attempt to turn the clock back to the 19th century in cultural terms - and then our under-emphasis on technology and its low prestige was the forerunner of our present economic decay. His curriculum is ideally suited for a life spent on the desert island of Desert Island Discs, when the only occupation available is to read the Bible and Shakespeare: is this the environment we expect in the 21st century?

The Russian foreign minister said that British Prime  Minister  John Major's meeting with Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin was still quite a recent event, while a new and  important event for mutual relations was now on the agenda: the  first state visit to Russia by Queen Elizabeth II.    Kozyrev mentioned the broad list of issues discussed at the  current talks, in particular, preparations for the political  meeting of leaders of the G-7 and Russia in Naples, the working  out of an agreement on partnership between Russia and the  European Union, the prospects of cooperation between Russia and  NATO, the Bosnian crisis, and Moscow's relations with the Baltic  countries. Significant attention, in his words, was paid to  finding ways to step up the activities of the CSCE during  preparations for the summit meeting of the member countries of  this international forum. There was also a productive exchange  of views on ways of developing regional cooperation, including  cooperation with Murmansk. The minister said that ""Britain was a  partner with whom Russia was holding a stable, open and friendly  dialogue.""    The head of the British Foreign Office noted that his  country  was playing pioneering role in ties with Murmansk. In Hurd's  words, this role was clearly manifested in the past wars, and it  continues now, as demonstrated by the present visit, the first  by a British foreign secretary to the polar regions of Russia.  ""Agreement has been reached on all the issues we discussed,"" the  head of the Foreign Office said. ""There are three major  organizations in Europe - NATO, the EC, and the CSCE. In the  early stages of their existence they were dealing with the  problem of overcoming confrontation, but now a new stage has  begun, and work is under way with the aim of reaching accord.  Russia is playing a key role in this process. I hope a  cooperation agreement between Russia and the European Union will  be signed as early as June. We in Britain at any rate will be  striving towards this. We also expect Russia to reach accord  with NATO on the basis of the Partnership for Peace program, and  we expect the CSCE to become a more effective tool in overcoming  international crises.""

0,FT942-11529 ,"FT942-11529 _AN-EEED1ADXFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / Major acts to protect balance of European manifesto      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr John Major has rejected calls from the right of the Tory party to recast in distinctly Euro-sceptic terms the government's manifesto for the June 9 European elections. Instead, the latest Downing Street version retains the careful compromises set out in the original draft written by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. It marks a significant setback for the party's anti-Europeans. Last night Mr Hurd reinforced the message in a letter to party activists pledging to mount a 'positive' campaign emphasising the need for European economic growth and employment. The latest manifesto draft, which will be subject to only minor changes before its publication on May 18, has been shortened to give it a sharper edge. But the careful balance of the original - seen by Mr Hurd as essential to preserve the peace between the pro- and anti-European factions in the Tory party during the run-up to the elections - has not been upset. It sticks firmly to a neutral line on participation in a single European currency - the subject of the latest Tory infighting over Europe. Earlier this week, Mr Major rebuked Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, for voicing opposition to economic and monetary union. The manifesto underlines the prime minister's insistence that parliament will take the decision only if and when Britain's partners move to a single currency. It stresses that Britain will not return to the European exchange rate mechanism in the foreseeable future but leaves open the possibility of participation at some stage in a reformed ERM. The central themes of the manifesto - the case for a decentralised, deregulated, open and competitive European Union - are designed to draw maximum support from the Tory backbenches. It underlines also the commitment to maintain Britain's veto in EU decision-making, to maintain Nato as a central pillar of European defence, and to preserve the present intergovernmental basis for foreign policy co-ordination. Mr Major hopes the contrast between those pledges and the alleged commitment to a European 'superstate' of Labour and the Liberal Democrats will suppress the Tory party's internal divisions during the campaign. But the manifesto flatly rejects the demand of hard-line sceptics that Britain consider disengaging from the EU if its partners press for greater integration at the intergovernmental conference due in 1996.

""Hong Kong's economy will not be affected by politics.""    These are the assurances given by Chinese officials to Hong  Kong people on different occasions. When China and Britain  suspended talks on Hong Kong's constitutional reform, however,  Hong Kong's stock and real estate market remained brisk,  presenting bright prospects.    However, the author heard something quite different in  Beijing: ""The central authorities have made a rightist mistake  on the policy toward Hong Kong.""    ""We cannot barter away our principles.""    ""We should resolutely take over Hong Kong.""    In the face of overbearing criticism from the top CPC  levels,  Jiang Zemin had to make some ""clarifications.""    While meeting with and feting veteran Army officials and  cadres in Beijing in early February, Jiang Zemin explained the  policies of the CPC Central Committee and answered their  questions. For a long time, these veteran army officials and  cadres had had misgivings about certain matters. Taking the  rare opportunity of their meeting with the party general  secretary, they sharply raised a wide range of questions,  including Army building, hegemonism, current social reality,  understanding of Marxism, and Hong Kong's transition. Of these,  the Hong Kong question was full of gunpowder. One person asked  Jiang Zemin: ""Did the CPC Central Committee commit a mistake of  rightism in dealing with Britain over the question of Hong Kong?  Did economic interests override state sovereignty and dignity?""    ""Never Before Has the Policy Toward the British Hong Kong  Government Been So Identical as Today""]    In the face of the question that regarded ""left"" as ""right,""  Jiang Zemin replied: ""This criticism is not correct. We are  fully prepared, as we had estimated the political and economic  challenges deliberately made by Britain during Hong Kong's  transition period. I hope the comrades present will rest  assured. The CPC Central Committee will never make any  compromise on questions of principle!""    Another person asked: ""Is it true that the central  departments do not have a unified policy in dealing with the  Hong Kong question?""    Jiang Zemin raised his tone in the reply: ""We can guarantee  you that the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the  State Council, and the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress [NPC] share identical views on the Hong Kong  question."" He especially quoted Deng Xiaoping's latest  instruction: ""Since the founding of the PRC, the policies of  the CPC Central Committee regarding the British Hong Kong  Government and the U.S. hegemonists' interference in China's  internal affairs have never been so identical as today.""    The Problem Can Be Resolved Easily When the British Side Has  Further ""Gone Off the Rails""    Regarding the question of Hong Kong's early recovery, Jiang  Zemin also conducted ""ideological work."" Of course, he stood by  some comrades who criticized Britain, saying: ""As Britain has  violated and undermined the Sino-British Joint Declaration;  openly negated the agreements reached between the two  governments; incited hostile forces in Hong Kong to launch  anti-Chinese Government activities; and brazenly interfered in  the Basic Law, which is purely an internal Chinese affair;  comrades within the party, the Army, people's organizations, and  basic levels have urged the central government to adopt resolute  measures to recover Hong Kong at an early date. We have legal  grounds for such a move, as well as the political environment,  economic strength, and the backing of the 1.2 billion Chinese  people."" Jiang then gave an account of the central committee's  policy: ""However, a decision can be made only after judging the  development and changes of events. We are fully prepared  against the turbulence during the transition period and at the  initial period of the establishment of the Special  Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It is definite that the  British colonialists will create trouble politically,  economically, and socially. We should let the British  colonialists fully perform at the stage. Only when they have  fully exposed themselves and have gone off the rails will it be  easier to resolve the problem.""    Jiang Zemin reiterated his position to the veteran Army  officials and cadres: The Chinese Government and the Chinese  people will never forget the base action of British perfidy; we  will never forget British plunder, slaughter, and aggression  against China during the Opium War; we will never forget the  British support and participation in China's civil war; and we  will never forget the British participation in the economic  sanctions imposed against New China for over 30 years. I can  assure you that after 1 July 1997, we will never allow the  remnants of the British colonialists to remain, we will not  allow the British colonialists to enjoy privileges, and we will  never allow foreign forces to meddle in Hong Kong's affairs.  The British authorities were informed long ago of our position  and principled stand.    Li Peng Backs With Clear-Cut Stand the Leftist Line Pursued  by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch    Moreover, Premier Li Peng took the opportunity of his  participation in the inaguration of the Daya Bay nuclear power  station to brief relevant departments. In Shenzhen on the  afternoon of 5 February, Li Peng listened to an account of Hong  Kong given by Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch.  Present on the occasion were Zou Jiahua, Ding Guangeng, Xie  Fei, Lu Ping, and Lie Minqiu.    News of the meeting was blacked out. While meeting with  reporters, Zhou Nan refused to disclose that he had discussed  the question of Hong Kong with Li Peng. He simply told the  reporters to ask Li Peng.    It has been reported that Li Peng gave a five-point  instruction at the meeting:    First, the central authorities have highly appraised the  work  of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and  the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, which have implemented the central  policies in a comprehensive manner;    Second, the rule of the British colonialists will end on 30  June 1997; if any drastic changes take place during this period,  the central government will take over Hong Kong earlier in light  of the established principle and policies. This is China's  national policy;    Third, the central government is capable of maintaining Hong  Kong's economic prosperity following the establishment of the  SAR Government on 1 July 1997 so that Hong Kong can continue to  serve as an international financial, industrial and commercial,  and transportation center;    Fourth, regarding the political, economic, and social  troubles created by the British colonialists during the  transition period in an attempt to sow the seeds of turmoil and  confusion for the future, it is necessary to continue to  heighten vigilance, expose the plot, and adopt countermeasures  to protect the interests of the vast number of Hong Kong  compatriots; and    Fifth, under the principles and policies of the central  government, it is necessary to continue to unite all Hong Kong  figures who love the country and Hong Kong, and who are willing  to take part in Hong Kong's construction, including foreign  figures in Hong Kong who support the Basic Law and who are  willing to contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity.    In his speech, Li Peng straightforwardly expressed his  support for the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, which was aimed at the  criticism made by certain figures with foresight that the XINHUA  Hong Kong Branch was taking an increasingly ""leftist"" line.  This gives people much food for thought: Is it tantamount to  bureaucrats' shielding one another or has the XINHUA Hong Kong  Branch simply followed the line of Li Peng?    Assuming the Posture of ""Political Examination"" of Hong Kong  Civil Servants    Zou Jiahua also delivered a speech. He made the following  two main points: First, how should we deal with the British  unilateral constitutional reform? Second, can the  department-level civil servants take the through train? Zhou  continued: ""Without the blessing of the Chinese side, we will  not recognize or undertake any responsibility for the political  system, economic matters, and things introduced unilaterally by  the British side which transcend 1 July 1997. All Hong Kong  civil servants now in office may continue their service after  1997 and the conditions may be more preferential. However,  there definitely will be changes in the department-level chiefs.  The Chinese Government and the Chinese people will never  recognize or accept the continued occupation of senior posts by  British agents after 30 June 1997. The three-tier council  elections introduced by Britain can last only until 30 June  1997.... How can the Chinese Government accept and inherit the  elections introduced by the British colonialists after the  change of sovereignty and administration?""    Following the breakdown of Sino-British talks, there are  indications that Beijing is taking the highly efficient  contingent of civil servants of the Hong Kong Government as the  target of attack. Now they have openly assumed the posture of  ""political examination,"" and even have intimidated some  senior-level civil servants, which is bound to exert an adverse  influence. No wonder a conscientious senior-level cadre in  Beijing said indignantly: ""In this way, they are undermining  the basic framework of the Hong Kong Government. How can the  concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong be realized in a  state of anxiety?""     "
0,FT944-3861 ,"FT944-3861 _AN-ELLBEAFLFT 941210   FT  10 DEC 94 / A nation warmed to take the cockle to its heart      By MICHAEL WIGAN   Enjoy a bouillabaisse? You barbarian] What about the rights of the innocent cockles and mussels plucked from sand and rock, thrown mercilessly into boiling water, solely for the gastronomic satisfaction of humans? This is the charge levelled against shellfish eaters by Animal Concern, a vegetarian organisation that recently petitioned William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, to outlaw all types of shell fishing. Britain is showing every sign of becoming the most animal-loony nation in the world. The Jains of India sweep the path before them, and wear cloths over their mouths, lest they inadvertently harm insects. But they are an extreme religious sect; and live for the glory of God. Care for animals in Britain is taken to extremes by a vociferous fringe who discredit those whose concern for animals is reasonable and genuine. Hunt saboteurs in their doomsday garb fail to convey the impression of having a deep regard for animals, or the countryside. Peculiar public reactions followed the latest death of a keeper, mauled in John Aspinall's zoo. Animal 'experts' were summoned to examine the offending Siberian tiger, and pronounced it 'not wicked'. But how could the world's most powerful terrestrial carnivore be wicked if, frustrated by incarceration, it occasionally wanted a dietary change? The public reproaches heaped on this animal would not have been applauded by the deceased keeper; he had made a pact that the animal should not be punished if he were mauled. We have a contradictory attitude to wildness in animals. We crave to see it, touch it, but we simultaneously veer in the direction of sanitising it. So people increasingly keep dangerous animals such as cross-bred wolf-husky dogs as pets and then are surprised when, as happened recently, one attacks its owner's child. What we want on the fireside rug is a reminder of the animals we are banishing at an alarming rate from the great outside. Britain is one of the world's most urban societies, and its inhabitants are also great lovers of animals. This is no accident. People feel the need to reconnect with the unpredictable, mysterious, non-neurotic world of nature and wildlife. This repressed nostalgia for wild environments has surfaced conspicuously in the cries for a restored Great Caledonian Forest in the Cairngorms. Enthusiasts talk wildly about bears, wolves, even genetically-recreated aurochs, or aboriginal cattle, which will roam together. The forest will be shady, capercallies gliding between the great pines; humans will play a part as mushroom-gatherers harvesting the fruits of the forest floor. The appeal of this lost world moves modern man who has to make do with the cat on the mat. But alienation from real processes in the animal world is almost complete. Gross overstocking of Canada geese in the London parks produced a communal wringing of hands, but confusion about a sensible culling policy. Shooting the surplus birds, which were making mud-pie of the lakesides, was held to be cruel, even though dispatch by a rifle shot is far kinder than the fate which awaits most animals in the wild. Similarly, public anxiety about the rate at which native British red squirrels were being displaced by 'foreign' grey squirrels led to an effective system of trapping the greys. But now people are worrying about what happens to the unfortunate grey squirrels that fall into the traps. They are killed of course. What else? Culling deer in public parks was highly unpopular until supernumerary browsers started grazing on people's garden shrubs. Our society tries to eliminate cruelty but, through lack of understanding, creates more. Cruelty to animals is the prolongation of pain, not the swift taking of life. A hue and cry arose recently about the transport of farm animals to overseas slaughterhouses. Yet the closure of hundreds of abattoirs in Britain because of trivial hygiene failures and over-zealous EC sanitation rules has increased the transport of farm animals. At the same time on-farm slaughter, unless performed by an expensive vet, has been outlawed. Traditionally, farmers killed their own livestock for eating. The sheep was led into the barn, and its nose got deep into the corn before the farmer, who may have assisted in its birth as a lamb, approached with the stun-gun and killed it instantly. Now, by EC law, a sheep must be herded into a truck, driven perhaps 100 miles to a slaughterhouse, pushed down the ramp into the odour of blood and death, and fixed on to some ghastly assembly-line for the final meeting with powerful electric nodes. In the name of welfare, we have legislated for something far worse, which costs more. The call of the wild is in us all. The hunter-gatherer instinct is also a strong one. On Brittany's summer shore at low tide hundreds of people pick, rake, and probe for things to put in the bouillabaisse. The whole family goes. It is neither unecological nor unsustainable. The scene was the same hundreds of years ago. The idea that to pull a whelk from its rock is cruel would be regarded in France with incredulity. Such a perversion of values could happen only in Britain. The nation of great animal lovers no longer dares to reason against its sentimentality.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mitterrand insisted that the treaty would neither be renegotiated nor amended to secure Denmark's acceptance in a second referendum next year. He also claimed to have the support of a majority of other member states for this view. 'Rejection by the countries in question (Britain and Denmark) will not stop the construction of Europe . . . The old Europe of the Six plus Portugal and Spain find themselves completely on the same wavelength,' he said. Ireland and Greece have also ratified the treaty. 'We can't make an agreement minus a single currency, minus the central bank, minus a common foreign policy.' Mr Mitterrand said it would be legally possible to adapt the treaty - 'not in substance but in form' - to exclude Denmark in the event of another rejection by Danish voters. As for Britain, he added: 'I do not despair at all of seeing Great Britain adhere to the treaty that the head of its government signed.' While he refrained from comment on Britain's latest proposals for dealing with Danish objections to Maastricht, the French president's remarks signal a hardening of tone on this central question ahead of Friday's Edinburgh summit. They seem intended in part to increase the pressure on Mr John Major, the prime minister and current EC president, to speed up ratification of the treaty in parliament, rather than waiting for the outcome of another Danish vote in May or later. Such pressure, however, may complicate Mr Major's efforts to muster consensus at Edinburgh while struggling with his own backbench rebels, whom he has assured that he will delay completing ratification until after a second Danish vote. Mr Mitterrand, who is due to meet Mr Major tomorrow night before the summit begins, said it would not be 'catastrophic' if British ratification took another four months, but that Britain should not make its decision hinge on that of another country. Also in the interview, Mr Mitterrand: Expressed determination to resist pressure from his European partners over the recent EC-US deal on farm trade. He said he did not expect the issue to come up at Edinburgh, as negotiations on an overall settlement in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were still continuing. He said France wanted a reopening of negotiations on agriculture with Washington. If there were no concessions on farm trade, however, he said France would have to act with 'great firmness' - while refusing to be drawn on whether it would use its veto. Reaffirmed his determination not to devalue the French franc, which has been under sporadic but heavy pressure in recent weeks. 'Devaluation has never been considered a good policy,' he said. 'France's economic indicators are the best at the moment within the EC.' Said he did not see the need to move the franc to a narrower band within the European monetary system, but that the idea was 'for discussion'. Renewed his backing for a 'European growth initiative' involving the acceleration of large EC infrastructure projects, and called again for a cut in German interest rates.

The report, issued in mid-April, urges the British  government  to strengthen ties with Taipei, Beijing's rival, in a move  described by some observers as playing the Taiwan card.    In a meeting with a visiting delegation of Hong Kong media  executives, Mr Hsu said Taipei's reaction to the British  parliament report was positive. But, according to him, the  Executive Yuan, Taiwan's cabinet, has yet to study the thick  document.    ""The report indicated something new in British foreign  policy  towards the Republic of China,"" Mr Hsu said.    China reacted furiously to the House of Commons 110-page  report on China including Hong Kong and Taiwan, criticising it  as an ""infringement"" of its internal affairs.    The vice-premier dismissed suggestions that Britain was  playing the Taiwan card to improve its position in dealing with  China over thorny Hong Kong issues.    Mr Hsu said Taiwan was eager to strengthen ties with all the  western nations including Britain but relations between the  island republic and the United Kingdom have not been smooth in  years.    He said one of the major targets of Taiwan's diplomatic  strategy was to fight for larger international space and  increased communications and exchanges with the world community.  However, the vice premier said Taiwan's relations with the  British could be influenced by two crucial factors -- the  relationship between the two rivals across the Taiwan straits  and that between Beijing and London.    He said Taiwan's foreign policy was not hostile towards the  mainland communist regime. Rather, it was aimed at ensuring the  survival and development of the island.    ""We have no desire to produce a foreign policy that is  hostile towards the mainland and what we are exploring in the  process of policy-making is to seek survival and development for  the island,"" he said. The senior ruling Kuomintang party  official said he was optimistic about the prospect of  reunification with mainland China and he himself was ready to  return to and live on the mainland once the dream of  reunification was realised.    ""I am very optimistic about the prospect because changes  have  been going on rapidly,"" he said.    Mr Hsu said he would like to be a mainlander rather than a  Taiwanese.    Among the preconditions for reunification are the narrowing  of living standards, lifestyles, ideology and social systems.     "

Britain and Germany are objecting strongly to a section of the draft document which says that families of immigrants have the right to be re-united in one country. They are concerned that this suggests that relatives of immigrant workers or of naturalised citizens have rights to immigration. London and Bonn may be prepared to back the principle that families should be united, but are pressing for a new phrasing which could not be used in court, delegates from European Union countries said. The present text, which has not been agreed, urges governments to 'recognise the right of family reunification'. However, the deadlock over text on abortion policy remained the chief obstacle to consensus, with delegates braced to scrap a scheduled weekend break and negotiate up to the last hour of the conference on Tuesday night. 'I don't think there is any one group trying to wreck the conference, although there may be groups trying to hold it to ransom,' said a British delegate. The Vatican and a 'hard core' of about 10 Roman Catholic countries remain bitterly opposed to the proposed wording on abortion, although Moslem states have now given their backing. Dr Nafis Sadik, executive director of the UN population fund, who is chairing the conference, said: 'I do not think the Vatican will agree (to the policy document) even if all the phrases (on abortion) are left out, because basically they are against contraceptive technology.' Holy See officials insisted they were seeking a final text to which they could agree. However, delegates yesterday reached agreement on the controversial financing target of Dollars 17bn by the year 2000, more than treble present levels. Two thirds of the money is expected to come from developing countries. Mr Abdul Suleiman, from the Nigerian delegation, warned the figure 'is very much a global average - in some countries, the ratio will have to be more like 50:50.' Yesterday Baroness Chalker, the UK minister for overseas development and head of the British delegation, repeated her pledge that Britain would spend Pounds 100m over the next two years on overseas family planning programmes - an increase of 60 per cent.

0,FT931-12740 ,"FT931-12740 _AN-DA0B8AFWFT 930127   FT  27 JAN 93 / UK base rates cut to 15-year low: One-point reduction lifts shares but leaves sterling sharply lower      By PETER MARSH, PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER   UK INTEREST rates were cut by a full percentage point to their lowest level for more than 15 years yesterday in an unexpected move to help economic recovery. The cut to 6 per cent, which took senior ministers and the markets by surprise, was swiftly followed by announcements from banks and building societies that they would cut mortgage rates by just over  1/2 a percentage point. Share prices moved sharply higher, but the pound weakened significantly after the announcement. The move was generally welcomed by industry, which expressed the hope that it would bring down borrowing costs for thousands of struggling businesses. But the base rate cut drew a less than euphoric response from Conservative MPs at Westminster. Hopes that it would give a boost to the outlook for recovery were tempered by fears that it reflected an element of panic in Downing Street or the prospect of more bad news on the economy. Cabinet ministers had expected Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to wait until nearer to the Budget on March 16 before lowering borrowing costs. They speculated that Mr John Major had been the active force in bringing the cut forward. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, found himself in the embarrassing position of being unware of the announcement when asked about it some hours afterwards in a television interview. Mr Lamont said Britain now had the lowest interest rates in Europe and that prospects were becoming 'better and better'. Speaking in New Delhi, the prime minister said the cut in interest rates was necessary to boost economic confidence and return Britain to 'a secure pattern of growth'. The London stock market saw the biggest daily rise since September 18, two days after the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism, as investors reasoned that lower borrowing costs would at last bring recovery from the longest recession since the 1940s. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose 63.8, to close at 2,835.7, within a whisker of the all-time high recorded on January 4 this year. Investor satisfaction at the move spilled over to the gilts market where prices gained up to 1 point. However, the foreign exchange markets took a dim view of the fourth one-point cut in interest rates since Britain left the ERM. After heavy selling of sterling for other currencies, the pound closed in London at DM2.424, down 2 3/4 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar it closed just over 2 cents lower at Dollars 1.538. In New York it closed at DM2.4264 and at Dollars 1.5445. The cut in commercial banks' base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent came shortly after the Bank of England reduced the rate at which it lends to the banking system by the unusual device of announcing a minimum lending rate just before 10am. The Bank's move, which came ahead of today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of medium-dated gilt-edged stock, infuriated many gilt marketmakers. Because of the subsequent rise in gilt prices, they face losses estimated at Pounds 25m in their auction operations. The decision to take short-term UK interest rates more than 3 points below Germany's internationally important Lombard rate came after a string of bleak economic indicators, including a sharp rise in unemployment, a fall in manufacturing output and sluggish broad money growth. In a Treasury statement, Mr Lamont said the cut in rates was 'appropriate' given Britain's economic background. The government believed the move was 'consistent with the necessary restraining influence on inflation'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the cut but said it did not add up to an economic strategy to deal with rising unemployment and falling investment. 'The government will have to do far more in employment and industry measures to ensure sustainable recovery and the reversal of national economic decline,' he said. The Liberal Democrats welcomed the cut but said it was 'foolish' to imagine it would end the recession. Tory backbench MPs meanwhile again warned Mr Lamont against tax increases in the Budget. They said that lower interest rates should not be the precursor to higher taxes.

0,FT931-557 ,"FT931-557 _AN-DC3CGAALFT 930330   FT  30 MAR 93 / Britain and France seek end to fishing rights row      By JIMMY BURNS and ALICE RAWSTHORN      LONDON, PARIS   BRITAIN and France yesterday moved to prevent a diplomatic row from developing over weekend incidents involving French fishermen and Royal Navy patrol vessels. The moves came as further confrontation between fishermen appeared to have been defused when 40 French boats left the Guernsey capital, St Peter Port. After discussions with the Guernsey Sea Fisheries Committee and Guernsey fishermen, French skippers agreed to a four-week cooling off period in which to try to resolve problems over disputed fishing grounds off the Channel island. Earlier, officials in both countries had called for calm. Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister, played down earlier statements suggesting Britain might use force. The government would be 'hysterically over-reacting' if it changed its fisheries protection policy which precludes the use of firepower against unarmed fishermen, he said. 'I believe the French fishermen have been trying to take advantage of the transition between governments. They are trying it on. It is important not to confuse this with a more generalised EC dispute over fisheries,' Mr Curry said, following talks with Mr Archie Hamilton, UK defence minister. Mr Bernard Dorin, French ambassador in London, said a meeting with foreign office minister, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, was 'very cordial and friendly'. In a prepared statement, which had the apparent blessing of British officials, Mr Dorin said: 'The French government has condemned the fishermen's unacceptable behaviour in this matter . . . the French authorities will do everything necessary to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.' Meanwhile, Mr John Gummer, minister for agriculture and fisheries, repeated a warning that the UK would consider arming its naval boarding parties if French actions escalated. However, British officials stressed last night that they were dissuaded from altering the rules by the risk that this might exacerbate the relatively minor incidents when animosity between fishermen on both sides was high. On Sunday, three Royal Navy fisheries protection officers were abducted after boarding a French trawler off the Channel Islands. The events have come at a sensitive time for France, which is changing government following the electoral success of the conservative coalition. The outgoing Socialist government was supportive of French fishermen, who have been protesting against cheap fish imports, while at the same time condemning attacks by French fishing vessels. The RPR Gaullists, the largest conservative party, have been more chauvinistic than the outgoing Socialists at defending French interests, although UK officials are confident that they are unlikely to risk Anglo-French relations.

But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland convention was a crucial stumbling block. In London officials said they were confident that the proposed declaration - likely to be finalised at a third meeting between the two leaders next week  -would include firm guarantees for the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. Those guarantees would centre on explicit recognition by Dublin that any change in the province's status could be achieved only by consent and a commitment by the Republic to drop its constitutional claim to the north. It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to violence. Mr Major may also reaffirm that his government has no strategic interest in maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal its willingness to accept separate referenda in the north and south on any political settlement. But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to the unionist parties the establishment of an all-Ireland convention and is resisting Dublin's demands to acknowledge publicly the right of self-determination across Ireland. The uncertain reaction of the IRA to any declaration was underlined by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. At a party meeting in Belfast yesterday he defined the key issues for a total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for the people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting in a process of national reconciliation'. He said Sinn Fein's involvement in political talks 'is not the main issue at this time'. He said the republican movement was not about to surrender, but added: 'We have taken risks and are prepared to take further risks to achieve a lasting peace . . . The opportunity for peace presented by the Irish peace initiative remains intact if it is seized and built upon and if Dublin puts the onus on Britain to deliver'.

The President did so despite his Administration's failure to  elicit from Mr Adams the unequivocal renunciation of violence  and declaration of support for the Anglo-lrish peace effort that  it had agreed with Britain should be the minimum conditions for  letting him in.    The decision comes on the eve of the visit to Washington by  Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, and seems certain to raise new  questions about the so-called ""special relationship"" since Mr  Clinton took power. It is almost inconceivable that the Bush or  Reagan Administrations would have delivered such a public slap  in the face to America's closest ally.    Though the move caught Downing Street officials by surprise,  they said the decision to provide a visa was ""a matter for the  U.S."" British officials in Washington were making  representations to the White House at the weekend. Putting a  brave face on events, Downing Street said it hoped the New York  conference would impress on Mr Adams the need to end violence  permanently. There was no indication that John Major considered  Mr Adams's words as amounting to an acceptance of U.S.  conditions.    Mr Adams said last night that he had received no official  notification of the American decision but had had ""a very  interesting exchange of views"" with American consular officials.  He said he had not been asked to renounce violence.    John D. Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said the  decision was despicable and that the Clinton Administration had  ""given in"" to pressure from the Irish lobby in Washington.    Mr Clinton has been under pressure to let in Mr Adams from  Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose  support he needs for his health care reforms, and from 38  congressmen who argue that the U.S. should foster ""constructive  dialogue"" instead of violence.    The State and Justice Departments and the FBI had agreed  with  Britain that Mr Adams's application should be rejected because  of his terrorist links, as eight before it had been. Their views  were apparently overruled by the National Security Council and  by Nancy Soderberg, NSC third-in-command and a former aide to  Senator Kennedy. The White House said Mr Clinton supported the  decision which he believed would ""help advance the cause of  peace in Northern Ireland.""     "

This question came to my mind  repeatedly last week. There are a lot of activities taking place  because India's Prime Minister Narasimha Rao is visiting  Washington on 18 May. The federation of Pakistani and Islamic  organizations, known as the Pakistan-American Congress, held a  large meeting in Washington on 12 May. There was a dinner to  introduce Professor William Baker's book, KASHMIR VALLEY, VALLEY  OF DEATH. The professor had risked his life to collect material  for this book by visiting Srinagar. The Pakistan-American  Congress spent lot of resources and time in printing and  publication of this book. We cannot praise the organizations  president, Dr. Sakhawat Hussain, and the organizer of the  Washington ceremony, Dr. Murtaza Arain, for their efforts  enough. Several members of this group addressed the dinner  meeting. Sardar Abdul Qayum, president of Azad Jammu and  Kashmir, also made a speech.    Dr. Maliha Lodhi, the Pakistani ambassador, addressed the  meeting during the day. I was busy with some other important  activity of the Congress at that time, however, I did manage to  get a copy of the text of the speech. The ambassador presented a  balanced view of Pakistan-United States relations. Her speech  did not include mere promises of green pastures or scenarios  that scare people. Dr. Maliha Lodhi also presented the unfair  U.S. position on F-16s and our nuclear program without mincing  any words. She also made it clear that although Pakistan wanted  to cooperate with the United States, this cooperation will  depend on Pakistan's own national interests. She also said that  if the United Nations or the United States want peace in the  sub-continent, the Kashmir issue must be resolved. Dr. Lodhi has  been in Washington only for four months. During this brief  period she had to visit Pakistan twice for official business,  take care of Sardar Qayum's visit, Narasimha Rao's visit, and  President Farooq Leghari's visit. Still, she did not have a  heart attack and this shows her strong personality.    I did not know her personally despite her journalist  background, and met her after her only arrival here. She has a  strong grasp on Pakistan-United States relations and  international affairs. This is not because she was a journalist  (we have many ""pedestrians"" in our ranks), but because of her  personal analyses. I will discuss in a separate column how the  enemies of Pakistan are disturbed even after her brief stay  here. This issue will require a lot of details. Her address to  the Pakistan-United States Congress was a first solid speech  made to any Pakistani community. It gave glimpses of cautious  optimism, but also warned that Pakistan was not in any position  to continue taking steps unilaterally. There was another meeting  of the organization after this speech and I participated briefly  in that. What I heard during that meeting brings us to the  subject of discussion today. The participants were clear that  the United States, despite its statements, was practicing double  standards in regard to India and Pakistan. The question was how  to change the U.S. attitude. Since I was only an observer in  this forum, I thought that it would be appropriate to express my  opinion in my own way--this column. I will focus on the Kashmir  issue at this point. The United States and other Western powers  will never help Pakistan over Kashmir or the Kashmiris that want  their state to join Pakistan. The UN Security Council  resolutions that provided Kashmiris the right to  self-determination were passed in 1948-49. The forces behind  these resolutions were Great Britain and the United States.  Everyone knows that Kashmir should go to Pakistan. Great  Britain, its Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, and the leader of the  border commission, Lord Radcliffe, committed deceit and gave  Gurdaspur to India and opened a land route for the Indian army  to reach Kashmir. History shows that the Indian military did not  have fighter planes to send troops to Kashmir. Thus, India used  planes owned by American companies. It is obvious that these  American companies must have discussed this with the U.S.  embassy before cooperating in a war effort. Meanwhile when  Quaid-i Azam tried to use Pakistani military and air force, the  British general refused to obey Quaid-i Azam. It should be  remembered that the same British general was commanding both  armed forces. Thus, India not only got the privilege of using  the Indian military and air force openly, but also used American  civilian aircraft. Lord Mountbatten was India's governor general  at that time. The strategy that was used in the United States to  stop the war must have been discussed between the governor  general and Prime Minister Nehru before agreeing on all these  tricks. World War II, in which the United States and Great  Britain were allies, had just ended. The United States had  become the new superpower in the world. The security policy in  the Middle East and South Asia, known as East of Suez at that  time, was managed by Great Britain at that time. It is,  therefore, assumed that the U.S. policy on the sub-continent for  any UN resolution was formed after discussions with Great  Britain. This policy was not based on principles of fairness,  but to protect the Western interests. This made the country  established in the name of Islam economically paralyzed and  Kashmir was given to the Hindus. It should also be remembered  that the Ottoman Empire had fallen 25 years earlier, and the  West was able to establish its control in the Middle East after  the fall of this Muslim empire.    Is it possible for us to accept that the Great Britain that  had dishonestly given Kashmir to India in 1948 would sincerely  support such resolutions in 1948 that would result in annexation  of Kashmir to Pakistan? The UN resolutions were only a timely  strategy. Anyhow, the Pakistani leadership of that time had  limited military options and accepted this resolution. However,  as expected, neither did India follow up on it nor did the  United States and Great Britain press India about it.    In 1962, when India's whole military force was occupied  against China and it could not defend Kashmir, President Kennedy  wrote to President Ayub Khan not to take any military action  there. In exchange, the United States was to help Pakistan  negotiate with India. Agreeing for negotiations at a time when  we could have taken over Kashmir was a major blunder which only  the Pakistani leadership could make. The talks were held as  promised and India continuously repeated that Kashmir is its  integral part. The United States betrayed Pakistan a second  time. However, the situations in 1962 and 1965 were very  different. There was no local movement in Kashmir that could  endanger the Indian government. There were some wolves in ""lion""  clothes in Kashmir that wanted to strengthen their position by  selling out the Kashmiri people.    The situation, however, changed between 1987 and 1989. A  pure  local movement in Kashmir was born and men, women, and children  of Kashmir were ready to sacrifice their lives, souls, and  property. They have made unprecedented sacrifices. However, when  this movement reached its apex in 1989-90, a group surfaced that  began to demand that the United States should play a role in  resolving the Kashmir issue. Seeing how the United States has  played no role in the whole history of the Kashmir dispute, this  demand is ridiculous. A lobby was formed here and the Kashmiri  American Council hired a lobbying firm for $500,000 per year.  Its purpose was to persuade the government and the U.S. Congress  to put pressure on India over Kashmir and take notice of human  rights violations in Kashmir. This whole lobby effort should  have been focused on one thing: the United States should be  non-aligned in this dispute and not put any kind of pressure on  Pakistan to stop helping Kashmiri freedom fighters. However,  after this lobbying firm was hired, the Kashmiri freedom  fighters were called terrorists and Pakistan was accused of  encouraging terrorism. The Pakistani strategy should have been  simple. It should have provided full support to the Kashmiri  freedom fighters and prepared itself to withstand the U.S.  pressure for a short period. Had it warded off this pressure  until 1993, the Kashmiri movement would have made remarkable  progress.    Those who are sincerely demanding U.S. involvement in  Kashmir  are naive. Why should the United States and other Western powers  help ""resolve"" an issue that could end the differences between  India and Pakistan? Their goal is to keep us divided and not  unite us. have these powers even given a fair treatment to any  international issue until now?    The lobby firms working for Pakistan and Kashmir should have  the strategy aimed at keeping the United States out of Kashmir  and let the freedom struggle achieve its goal. No slave nation  in the world has managed to get the gift of freedom from  negotiation tables. If this movement is suspended now, there  will no such movement again for a hundred years. Kashmir will  become an international brothel if it comes under the  trusteeship of the United Nations and Western powers. Now only  will chastity be violated, it will then be sold. The people who  are trying to ""solve"" the Kashmir issue with the U.S. help will  be responsible for that!     "

If Mr Heseltine wants to encourage the cultural revolution he feels is so necessary to lift Britain's business prospects, he should go to the heart of the problem and make an appointment with the education minister. At this meeting, he might ask Mr John Patten why, while subjects such as political, military, social and economic history are an integral part of the general educative process, business history as a curricular subject is not part of any form of universal education at UK schools? He might point out that its neglect is evident at higher levels too, even at business schools. Just 6 per cent of business students are exposed to the subject in any way, equal to fewer than  1/2 per cent of the country's university population, a statistic which is put into further perspective by the number of professors of business history in the UK - just three against Japan's 300. Our research into business history's application in the workplace shows that  -unlike many of their overseas competitors - British managers and workers at all levels acquire little historical awareness of business in general and companies in particular from the wider educational system. This is compounded by the minimal efforts by companies to pass on their own history to employees. While low historical awareness helps to explain the absence of a wider business culture, it also means that industry is unable to take advantage of its own practised example. It can also be argued that the concentration on wider-based economic history at the expense of more specific business history makes aspiring British entrepreneurs less practical businessmen. The industrial revolution is more than 220 years old. By being its first participant, Britain should have an inbuilt advantage of experience, knowledge and tradition - if it were passed on. If the education system and industry did not ignore business history, Mr Heseltine wouldn't have to depend so much on initiatives such as advice shops to help individuals do what should - by now - come naturally.

One reason why the outlook is so pessimistic for the unemployed is, he says, that 'technological change and competition from low-cost producers in developing countries has reduced the demand for unskilled labour other than in low-wage, often part-time employment. These jobs have . . . been mainly taken by female entrants into the labour markets'. Evidence on part-time working is usually cited in support of this view. Since June 1978, well over 2.5m full-time jobs have been lost. Over the same time there has been an increase of more than 1.25m of part-time jobs. Indeed, a third of those in employment now work part-time. This trend is way out of line with other European countries, with Britain currently employing 40 per cent of Europe's part-time workforce. But is this due to the market forces which Edward Balls describes? Or are there particular circumstances in Britain which make such an outcome inevitably unfavourable to those wishing to seek full-time employment? I would suggest that such an outcome is inevitable, given the way the contributions for national insurance are structured. Employees and employers pay no contribution on the first Pounds 54 of earnings. When creating new posts, many employers bear this in mind and often offer part-time rather than full-time posts. Some employers, Burton is a recent example, are now cutting full-time jobs and offering only part-time work. I believe it is time that these national insurance rules were looked at critically. I would hope that the government would consider in next month's budget levying national insurance contributions for employers from the very first pound of earnings. As the move would not be aimed at raising additional revenue (which would be an additional tax on jobs) the overall level of employer contributions would therefore be adjusted to make the move revenue-neutral. Such a simple change would remove the present bias which is working in favour of creating only part-time employment. It would not, of course, prevent employers and employees negotiating packages of less than full-time employment. But it would mean the removal of the current penalty which operates against the creation of full-time posts. Frank Field MP, House of Commons, London SW1 0AA   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Errera, chairman of the conference, said Pyongyang's refusal  cannot be ""treated as only a regional issue.""    He said the world's major nuclear powers -- the United  States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- could not ""accept  to impose nuclear constraints on themselves if other countries  continue to secretly develop nuclear weapons programs.""    North Korea suspended inspections of its nuclear sites by  the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in January 1993 and  three months later threatened to pull-out of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, sparking fears that it was developing  or had already developed a nuclear bomb.    Errera added that Iraq had also raised fears within the  international community that it was developing its nuclear  capability and that the breakup of the Soviet Union was  threatening the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty.    There are fears that stocks of fissionable material have  been  sold or otherwise channelled from former Soviet bloc countries  to countries secretly engaged in nuclear research.    The UN conference here, aimed at securing pledges from the  nuclear powers for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), is to  set up an ad-hoc committee to negotiate the treaty.    The United States has already expressed reservations about  Iraq being a member.    UN representative Vladimir Petrovskiy said Tuesday that he  would be in favor of enlarging the committee to include  additional members.    Errera, in his opening statement, also said that ""today's  reality does not reflect the past where two superpowers could  negotiate between themselves a disarmament treaty and then  present it for ratification by the international community.""    The five nuclear powers nevertheless have their own  reservations about a CTBT.    The United States, Russia, France and Britain have for  example suspended their tests, whereas China carried out an  explosion as recently as last October and appears in no hurry to  conclude testing.    In any event, signing a test ban treaty would in no way  imply  that the nuclear five were ready to give up their nuclear  stockpiles or abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence.    Errera said he could not predict how long the conference  would last. ""The main thing is that the talks should be taken  seriously so that we can work towards a treaty acceptable to  everybody.""    It appeared unlikely that they would conclude before the  1995  expiry date of the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT) which the Western powers wish to extend for a period of  several years.

As supporters of full integration of the province into the UK stepped up their campaign urging ministers to embrace their viewpoint, the octogenarian Mr Powell used a rare appearance on the conference fringe to condemn the government's Northern Ireland policy. The government had simply come up with a new version of the game-plan that had been in place for decades: 'Give Northern Ireland a new identity and we will soon get it out of the United Kingdom,' he said. The object of the conference, involving Ulster's main constitutional parties, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, hoped to convene was 'to recommend a measure of self government for Northern Ireland which will . . . enable it to be associated with the Irish Republic even more directly than it was by the Anglo-Irish agreement'. His assertion came as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told the party that the government's position was founded on 'an impregnable rock of principle' - that Northern Ireland's future depended on the wishes of its people. Britain and Britain alone was responsible for the government of 'this part of our country', Mr Hurd stressed. Aides said Mr Hurd's comments were directed at Washington rather than Dublin. Addressing a sympathetic audience of rightwingers, Mr Powell - the Ulster Unionist MP for South Down for 13 years until 1987 - attacked Washington's role in current efforts to forge a durable political settlement in the province. 'The US has ordained that the UK government is to use its best efforts to satisfy the IRA and the territorial ambitions of the Irish Republic,' he said. He predicted that the IRA would resume violence if it decided it would not achieve its objectives peacefully. Questioned by Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland minister, on whether he would urge people to vote against proposals incorporating 'some element of devolution' if they were backed by three of the four main political parties in Ulster, Mr Powell replied simply: 'Yes.' The role of the US was also attacked by Lord Tebbit, another former cabinet minister, who said President Bill Clinton thought he could 'push us around even in Northern Ireland as though this was a Caribbean banana republic'.

Today Britain takes over as president of the Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page pull-out FT writers assess the prospects WHEN Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the UK Board of Trade, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, met last weekend to discuss Community industry policy they may have found they were closer philosophically than they expected to be. 'There aren't significant disagreements between us and the UK,' said a Brussels industry official. 'But when it comes to political discussion and rhetoric we tend to be far apart and that makes things much more difficult.' The official Brussels line is that the Commission should promote a generally applicable 'horizontal' policy - such as funding for research and training - rather than sectoral measures aimed at, say, the motor or electronics industry. Britain would clearly like the Commission to hold that line. But over the next six months the fight between free-market and interventionist governments is likely to intensify. The main battlefields will be the Commission's budget plans for 1993-97 and Brussels' centralised competition powers. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, would like his budget package to be approved as written - complete with plans to enhance industrial competitiveness through improved research and training programmes. Community liberals worry that such plans could be hijacked by ailing industrial sectors. But faced with opposition to the whole budget, Mr Delors has hinted that research and training funds may have to be scaled back to ensure more aid for the EC's poorer regions. Meanwhile, the Commission is under pressure from some countries, notably France, to hand some of its competition powers back to national authorities. The UK will be counting on Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible, to fight his corner.  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "
0,FT942-4642 ,"FT942-4642 _AN-EFIC8AAIFT 940609   FT  09 JUN 94 / Britain ruled in breach of EU employment law: Companies must consult workforces about changes      By ROBERT RICE and DAVID GOODHART   British employers will, for the first time, face a statutory obligation to consult employees when planning to make more than 10 redundancies or when transferring workers from one business to another, after two rulings by the European Court of Justice. The rulings, which said Britain was in breach of EU laws protecting workers' rights during the contracting out of public services, also pave the way for compensation claims by employees over dismissal and loss of benefits. The decision by the Luxembourg court means that companies - even non-unionised ones - will have to ensure there is adequate machinery for consulting their workforces. This could range from setting up committees elected by employees to simply notifying workers in advance of changes. Mr Fraser Younson, vice-president of the Employment Lawyers Association, said: 'This is the most important development in UK industrial relations in the past 20 years,' The Luxembourg court said the UK had failed to implement key aspects of the European acquired rights (1977) and collective redundancies (1975) directives. In translating the European rules into English law through the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment ) Regulations, known as Tupe, the UK limited the requirement to inform and consult workers to those employers who recognised trade unions. The judgment, which was not unexpected, was played down by the government as a 'technicality'. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the vast majority of employers already had mechanisms for consulting with employees. But the ruling was welcomed by trade unionists and Labour politicians. Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said: 'The right of workers to be consulted over redundancies and transfers is a key element of social policy which had been deliberately denied to British workers.' The government is expected to introduce the required changes to legislation in the next few months. The European court also confirmed that the UK was guilty of excluding the public sector from the job security and wage protection provided to workers by Tupe. Last summer, the government fell into line with the rest of Europe by extending Tupe to cover the public sector. However, yesterday's ruling confirms the right of public sector employees who had not been covered by the legislation to sue the government for compensation.

But only four of them (Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and  Sweden) were represented by both their ministers of environment  and agriculture. Pleading the GATT negotiations, Germany and  France sent higher civil servants, just like Finland and  Switzerland. According to Greenpeace and the World Fund for  Nature, this shows that ""there is no real European political  will to protect the North Sea.""    However, the report drawn up by a working group is crushing:  1.7 million tons of nitrogenous substances (ammonia, nitrates)  are dumped into the sea every year, 900,000 tons of which come  from agricultural activities. This leads to a rarefaction of  oxygen in the marine environment. The efforts made since the  conference held in The Hague in 1990 have not improved the  situation and the states that border the sea almost unanimously  admit that it will not be possible to reduce by half the dumping  of nitrogen and phosphates by 1995, as expected.    All the more, as Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken  pointed out, since ""industrialized countries like France, Great  Britain, and Norway continue to dump nontreated sewage water  from the cities into the sea."" ""Those countries,"" he added,  ""lack the courage to impose sacrifices on their citizens in  order to pay the costs of filtering stations."" Mr. Auken  emphasized that ""Denmark has spent ECU1 billion in taxpayer  money to clean waters carrying sewage.""    Taking place before the major 1995 conference that also is  to  be held in Copenhagen, this intervening meeting discussed  various types of pollution, whose scope was not known, including  the smoke from ship stacks or the dumping of oil during illegal  degasification of ships, not to mention the leaks and other  incidents in the 4,000 [oil] wells and the 140 offshore oil and  gas rigs in the North Sea.    ""Even more outrageous and more dangerous is the release of  radioactive waste from the Sellafield nuclear recycling plant""  (northwest England), reported Greenpeace during the meeting.  The British delegation, which included the agriculture  minister, has not reacted to the protest, which was supported by  Denmark, which has requested that an end be put to the release  of such waste. Great Britain is the only country that has not  published data on the reduction of pollutants in the North Sea.     "

As campaigning for the June 9 European parliament elections resumed, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, appealed to the Tory party's Euro-sceptic wing to unite behind the election manifesto to be issued today. The manifesto, A Strong Britain in A Strong Europe, will focus on Euro-sceptic concerns such as the preservation of the UK veto on European initiatives on taxation, defence and immigration. Mr Hurd, trying to allay rightwing fears, described himself as a 'Euro-realist', and accused the European Commission of going 'too far into the nooks and crannies of all our lives'. His remarks, in a BBC interview, echoed his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference two weeks ago when he committed the government to seeking a flexible Europe of nation states. The comments were reinforced in a letter sent to thousands of voters in marginal seats by Mr John Major, pledging the Tories to block any moves towards federalism. But the government's claims that Britain is winning the argument for a less centralised Union were rejected by Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 1992 group of rightwing MPs. Writing in the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group's summer magazine, Sir George said the party's natural supporters were 'totally opposed to being sucked by degrees into a federal Europe'. The Liberal Democrat manifesto, also published today, promises to seek 'popular assent' for 'fundamental changes' agreed at the European Union's next intergovernmental conference in 1996. The stance contrasts with Mr Major's refusal to consider a referendum. The manifesto also proposes cuts in the size of the Commission and the Council of Ministers, and a stronger European parliament elected proportionately to size of population. It also calls for a federal Europe, an independent central bank, and progress towards a common foreign and defence policy and a European army. 'We don't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for Britain's sake,' said Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader. Labour's manifesto, also published today, will commit the party to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and an eventual single European currency.

That is perhaps why its 159 pages make no explicit mention of the Bosnian crisis, which Paris obviously hopes will be over long before then. French ambitions to play a leading, even the leading, part in future European security arrangements shine through right from the start. In the foreword, Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, says 'France must set an example, not in a 19th century-style concert of powers, but in 'Europe'', while Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, asks his countrymen to make 'the necessary efforts by which France will play a major role in building a common European defence'. After working wordily through all the uncertainties and risks in post-cold war Europe, the paper concludes that 'France will maintain its effort' well into the next century. That is a radical conclusion, at a time when virtually all its allies are sharply paring their military spending. Yet France has gone 22 years without a defence white paper. So why one now? One reason has to do with domestic politics - Mr Balladur's desire to encroach on President Francois Mitterrand's constitutional prerogative on defence, and in the words of one white paper committee member 'to gather the strategic community around the prime minister' in preparation for Mr Balladur, or another Gaullist like Mr Jacques Chirac, winning next year's presidential election. Mr Mitterrand's role in the paper's preparation has been largely passive. It had to have his approval, but he confined himself mainly to resisting conservative attempts to undermine his moratorium on French nuclear weapon tests, and to make France's nuclear deterrent more 'useable' by calling for design of smaller, cleaner weapons. The other motive is to preserve the famous French consensus on defence in the post-cold war world. The 1972 white paper defined French security in a geographically narrow and nationalist way, to be defended by French forces operating semi-detached from Nato or any other allies. As such, it won remarkable public support. The dangers are now different and more diffuse, but, the paper argues, no less real to France in that they affect the whole European Union into which France is increasingly embedded. It marks Germany and Britain out as key partners. France wants to see Germany throw off its constitutional and political inhibitions to playing a wider military role in Europe, while with Britain 'the level of our co-operation must be significantly raised' because the two countries 'possess relatively important capacity for external action' and 'the will to use it'. But the paper also points to the military and defence potential of Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Far from expressing any animus against Washington or Nato, the paper acknowledges the US as today's 'only military giant' and the alliance as 'the principal organisation of defence'. France will not go back on its 1966 withdrawal from Nato's integrated command, but the paper puts on the record that French defence ministers and chiefs of staff will attend Nato meetings on a case-by-case basis, particularly when peacekeeping operations are involved. The goals which the white paper sets for the Balladur government's forthcoming framework law for military spending over the 1995-2000 period are: Maintaining the nuclear deterrent and filling gaps in conventional forces such as intelligence-gathering, logistics and air transport. The ability to transport some 120,000-130,000 troops and equipment overseas, let its 113-ship navy fall to no fewer than 100, and keep 20 squadrons in its air force. Continue to build its own nuclear weapons and maintain an autonomous capability in such technologies as electronic warfare, stealth weaponry and intelligence. But apart from this, 'there is no area in which France cannot share with other European countries'. This clearly means more arms co-operation with EU partners. The paper foreshadows a joint arms agency with Germany which Paris wants to set up at this summer's Franco-German summit, and again it contains a note of the frustrated suitor with Britain 'whose research and industrial potential is most comparable to ours'.

It is a pleasure to say that I find virtually nothing to quarrel with in 'A new policy framework' (October 21) - except that it is a few years late. In addition to a 'thorough investigation into the decisions associated with the UK's membership of the ERM', I believe it is important to examine the decisions from 1985 and particularly from 1987 when Nigel (now Lord) Lawson pitched Britain into the ERM in all but name. Many, myself included, have suggested that the Bank of England be given more or less complete independence in conducting monetary policy rather than serve merely as adviser to the Treasury. But if we are still en route to Maastricht, as the prime minister says, and we do not invoke the opt-out provision, then the Bank will be merely an operating arm of the European Central Bank with no independence at all. If, on the other hand, we rejoin the ERM, whether we opt out or not, then again it is difficult to see what independence the Bank can have under such a closely pegged, even fixed, exchange rate regime. Only if we continue to float can a Bank of England have real responsibility for monetary policy. The notable examples of independent central banks which you mention, the US and Germany, have floating exchange rates. So the Fed and Bundesbank can pursue monetary policies suitable for their own domestic conditions. Because of the possibility of breakdown on both Maastricht and the ERM as we know it, and because it is possible that Britain will have a floating rate regime, I think it is wise to consider the implications in terms of an independent Bank.

0,FT924-15540 ,"FT924-15540 _AN-CJDAFACVFT 921003   FT  03 OCT 92 / Ugly noises mar quiet alliance: The reasons behind the recent bout of Anglo-German acrimony      By DAVID MARSH   A junior British minister, speaking in spring last year at the annual Anglo-German Konigswinter conference, delivered an eloquent illustration of the unevenness of ties between Britain and Germany. Emphasising how reunited Germany should play a more active role in world affairs, he declared: 'We would like the Germans to be more assertive - as long as they agree with us.' His remark provides an insight into the past few weeks' hubub between the two countries over the decline of sterling and the future of European integration. During the post-war period, Britain has always wanted a strong relationship with Germany. But, as one of the two European countries (along with France) with any pretensions to being a world power, Britain wanted to define these links, as far as possible, on its own terms. Now, as a result of Germany's development into Europe's pivotal economic and political power, the favourable terms of the 1950s and 1960s - or even of the 1970s and 1980s - are no longer on offer. Against a background of evident British economic weakness, the relationship needs to be reshaped - amid an atmosphere of bickering and mistrust which is hardly conducive to mutual co-operation. The criticisms by the British government, backed by the media, of alleged German complicity in the pound's collapse have been only the latest example of irritation. German ministers and officials - including some in the Bundesbank - were severely irked by the lack of support for reunification shown in 1989 and 1990 by the government of Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher. Both sides have done their best to forget the episode, along with the less serious affair in 1990 over anti-German remarks by Mr Nicolas Ridley, then industry secretary, who was forced to resign. But bruised feelings are still there - manifest in barbed comments by Bonn officials as well as, occasionally, by the German chancellor himself. Not least because of the residue of ill-feeling, Mr John Major has made repairing ties with Bonn one of his priorities since he took over the premiership nearly two years ago. He has succeeded in building a good working relationship with Mr Kohl - one which enabled him to achieve Britain's 'opt-out' accords on economic and monetary union (Emu) and on the social chapter at last December's Maastricht summit. None the less, the skirmishing has flared up again during the past year. Discontent has been sown by differences on matters ranging from policies towards the former Yugoslavia to the European Fighter Aircraft. Germany's quest for a permanent seat on the UN security council has also set some alarm bells ringing in Britain. Last week, the Bonn government's (promptly abandoned) plans to support officially a ceremony to commemorate the first flight of Hitler's V2 rocket spurred strong rebukes from British newspapers and politicians. If the Anglo-German partnership - dubbed only a few years ago the 'quiet alliance' - has grown cacaphonous, this is partly a reflection of the growing problems both countries face at home. Germany is united. Yet, preoccupied by the exacting (and seriously underestimated) economic and social challenge it faces, it has yet to demonstrate that unification will prove a success. Britain is not only debilitated by recession. It is also caught between opposing fears of being ensnared in a German-dominated federal Europe, and of being excluded from a 'core' of richer countries, led by France and Germany, which could forge ahead with integration in a 'two-speed' Europe. On both sides, there is edginess and oversensitivity, combined with insufficient understanding for the other country's predicament. Just as Britain sometimes fails to comprehend the strains on Germany caused by an unprecedented influx of 400,000 asylum-seekers this year, the Bonn government admits it was late in spotting the full political importance of the pressures forcing sterling's exit from the ERM last month. One German diplomat, upset at the readiness with which Nazi caricatures surface in the British media, compares the climate - perhaps somewhat drastically - to the sabre-rattling between the two countries before the First World War. Certainly, the ramifications of comments on the recent exchange market upheavals by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, bear a resemblance to the celebrated Daily Telegraph affair in 1908. Then, indiscreet interview remarks by Emperor Wilhelm sparked off a crisis with Britain. Mr Josef Joffe, foreign policy commentator of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Munich-based newspaper, says he has been surprised by the anger towards Germany in Whitehall in recent weeks. 'I never thought you could build good cars, but I always thought you had a talent for keeping cool,' he says. Lord Roll, a veteran diplomat and now president of S G Warburg, points to the ease with which anti-German resentment can 'bubble up' in Britain. 'Ignorance and disdain, mixed up with envy and jealousy, tend to rise up and poison the atmosphere.' He adds: 'This is dangerous, and it should be stopped.' Mr Major now says the same, with his appeal on Thursday for an end to the 'war of words' between the two countries - announced at the same time as his decision to resubmit the Maastricht treaty to parliament. Mr Major's strategy of attaining D-Mark-like currency stability has disastrously misfired. But he appears to have been firmly told by Mr Kohl, during their one-hour telephone conversation on Wednesday, that Britain's credibility will take a further dive unless it goes ahead with ratifying the treaty. In the light of the sterling debacle, the British government has been jealous of France's success in the last fortnight in maintaining the franc's parity against the D-Mark. Mr Major has, however, probably realised that too evident a show of Euro-scepticism in Britain would end up strengthening the Franco-German alliance - the opposite of what he intends. In its European policies, Britain has one trump card to play with Germany. Mr Kohl has his own domestic reasons - above all, growing opposition to the abandonment of the D-Mark - for not proceeding too quickly to Emu. In view of Britain's own scepticism about monetary union, Mr Major is thus a useful ally to have on board. In the end, though, the future of European integration depends not on Britain, but on whether Germany overcomes its own economic difficulties in the next few years. If it fails, Mr Kohl and Mr Major may face the prospect not of a Europe of two speeds - but of a Europe proceeding at no speed at all.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT931-5223 ,"FT931-5223 _AN-DCGAJAERFT 930306   FT  06 MAR 93 / Private View: An ally's estimate of Britain's worth - Raymond Seitz, US ambassador to Britain, explains his view of the 'special relationship'      By CHRISTIAN TYLER   WHEN HE was posted back to Britain as US ambassador in 1991, the first professional diplomat ever appointed to the job, Raymond Seitz made two resolutions. 'The first was that I would never use the phrase 'special relationship' and the second was that I would never quote Winston Churchill,' he said. Have you stuck to them? I asked. 'And I have stuck to both of them. I have no objection to 'the special relationship'. I just think it's a little shopworn. It's become a code in some respects to make people teary (tearful). But we're moving into a new phase in a very new world and it kind of obscures what I think are harder realities. It is the hard realities of life and of international affairs that make this relationship unusual, effective, productive, coincident . . . ' Does the expression signify less these days to ordinary citizens? 'Well, I don't know exactly what it refers to. Does it mean that every time we say 'frog' you jump or every time you say 'frog' we jump? Do people go to Andrew Lloyd-Webber plays in America? Yes. Do we go to see Howard's End, do we give Anthony Hopkins an Oscar? Yes, we do. Do we listen to the same rock and roll? Yeah. Is that the special relationship? Sure, you have Americans - and they don't have to be of British stock - who love to see the Changing of the Guard and who read Christopher Robin to their children.' He gestured towards the window of his big office in Grosvenor Square. Raymond Seitz was back in London after helping smooth the way for John Major's unexpectedly cheerful first encounter with the new US president. But the question at the back of my mind was whether Bill Clinton was merely being polite when he reassured an apprehensive British prime minister that the relationship was 'special to me personally and special to the United States and I think will be as long as I am sitting here.' Seitz agreed that the phrase is more a British than an American pre-occupation. He also observed the familiar, self-denigratory flavour of much British press comment in advance of the summit - 'as if almost hoping that somehow it wouldn't work.' This week, John Major rounded on what he called the gloomsters. If the special relationship exists, what can a demoralised Britain bring to it? I asked the ambassador what he thought of the present mood of doubt and drift. 'There is a black dog that wanders around Britain worrying about its future,' he said, 'about its sense of decline, of what it relates to. Is it to an empire, to the Continent, or across the Atlantic?' The present crisis of morale, he went on, could be explained by the insecurity of living in a post-Cold War world and by the persistence of the UK recession, 'a feeling that the dawn never quite comes, that the green shoots don't quite press high enough. I think you can even add what's happened to the Royal Family or the Church of England. And I think what happened in Liverpool (he was referring to the murder of two-year-old James Bulger) acted as a kind of flashpoint, somewhat in the way the coalpit closures did.' There had been much the same gloom in the air in 1979, when Seitz completed the first of three tours of duty in the London embassy. He came back in 1984, as second in command to Charles Price II, bringing two family dogs: Topsy, a Brooklyn pooch which he later described as 'smart as hell' and Scarlett, an English labrador, 'as thick as two planks.' He found that Margaret Thatcher had instilled new confidence and assertiveness in the country. 'One felt that Britain had a firmer grip on its destiny. It's that which seems to have loosened a little.' I suggested that John Major has made little or no impression on Americans. Seitz smoothly sidestepped the invitation to a faux pas and talked instead of Thatcher's impact. It was not the Falklands war which had impressed Americans, he said. 'What really crystallised it was not the grand sweep, the Cold War struggle. It was the clarity with which Mrs Thatcher said Yes to the raid on Libya. Her willingness to take tremendous domestic political flak really lifted the American image of Britain.' The ambassador manages to combine cool analysis with a winning lack of pomposity. He is the typical Yale preppy, you would say, a man of Republican tendencies and of no visible eccentricities - unless you count as eccentric the fact that he is twice married, smokes, and keeps a collection of old locks on his office window-sill. 'I've been told it's Freudian', he said, smiling. Seitz is so much admired ('the most capable American in Europe,' according to one diplomat) that a campaign developed on both sides of the Atlantic to keep him in London in spite of the change from a Republican to a Democrat Administration. When I asked Seitz this week whether he would be recalled he said he had not been told he was staying, but nor - and here he looked insouciant - that he would be going. Raymond GH Seitz was born in Hawaii at the end of 1940 where his father, later a major-general who took part in the Omaha Beach landing in Normandy, was then stationed. At Yale, he was president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, apparently known as 'the animal house'. His State Department career included Canada, Kenya and Zaire before London, with spells in Washington under Kissinger, Vance, Haigh and Baker. George Bush put him in charge of European and Canadian affairs: he was the leading US official for German unification talks and helped persuade Moscow to accept a united Germany in NATO. Today, he is occupied with Anglo-American policy towards Bosnia. I asked him whether Britain had anything any more to teach the US - a question to make a diplomat squirm. He hedged a bit, and replied: 'Well, I find this a very civil society. One of the things I find most appealing here is the little transactions of everyday life, whether it is buying the newspaper at the newsagents or taking a taxi-cab or bumping into somebody.' What could Britain contribute to the relationship? Seitz launched fluently into his exposition. The three broad bases, he said, were geography, language and common attitudes and values. 'From these deeper things comes a greater likelihood that the US and the UK are going to identify their interests internationally in a roughly similar way. 'If that's the case, what do you bring to the game? The independent nuclear deterrent is the most obvious example.' Formerly there existed what might be called a 'comfortable balance of terror'. Today the danger was nuclear proliferation. This, and the unpredictability of events in the former Soviet Union, could make Britain's bomb strategically as important as before. 'So I'm not prepared to draw the conclusion that Britain's nuclear role is anachronistic.' Another asset was the historic exchange of military intelligence and other information, now extending into law enforcement, drugs and terrorism. Third, there was Britain's seat on the Security Council of the UN (a status today being challenged). The UN's new-found authority as world peacekeeper could make Britain's role here more important. 'One final point - and I think this could be a critical one in the world ahead: there will always be a few issues or challenges where the US is prepared to act alone to protect what we regard as our vital national interest. However, I think there will also be a much bigger category of issues where the willingness of the international community or the US to act will depend very much on the degree to which other nations are prepared to act and take risks. 'And when you look around the world, you can count on the fingers of one hand - and that may be an overestimate - those nations which are prepared to act and which have a capability to act, and to act even beyond their own region of interest.' I turned to the question of Britain in Europe and Seitz confirmed that the US attaches the highest importance to Britain's active membership of the EC. But, I asked, do you get the sense that Britain is drifting somewhere in mid-Atlantic and doesn't know where to put the anchor down? 'My impression is Britain does not put as much ideological and emotional weight into the concept of a European union. That kind of rhetoric, those kinds of ideals and goals are very important on the Continent.' What about this British ambivalence? 'I watch the debate every day. If Britain is determined to isolate itself from Europe then the nature of our relationship is of course going to be different.' Are they compatible alliances? 'Oh, I don't think they're mutually exclusive at all. I know there's a zero-sum proposition: the analogue is America's preoccupation with the Pacific. While that zero-sum calculation is analytically attractive, I don't think that's how in fact it works.' He would not agree that the Conservative Euro-rebels were necessarily defending the old alliance: they might simply be Gaullist nationalists. What difference does it make to have Bill Clinton in the White House? 'On the basis of five weeks, it's a little early to make that judgment. But I have not seen anything that would make me revise what I have just said.' You mean the pragmatic underpinnings are strong enough to make the ideological or moral differences relatively unimportant? 'I don't think there is a great ideological gulf,' Seitz replied. But in political terms a big change has occurred. 'Yes, it's a big change but its happened before. I mean, you had Margaret Thatcher and Jimmy Carter. In the end it is the degree to which there is this coincidence of strategic interests, whether it's trade issues or Bosnia or Iraq or dealing with the former Soviet Union. My argument is that, uniquely, our interests are going to be far more likely to coincide than not.' Would Labour be less sentimental about the special relationship? 'It's not so partisan. I'm glad to see that the Labour party, perhaps because of the Clinton victory, in many respects is anxious to resume a dialogue with the US.' The relationship would fare much better without excuses or hype, the ambassador said. 'If one scrapes away some of the rhetoric we'll be able to deal with this relationship in a much healthier way. 'It's unusual to have to appear to defend the value of all of this. It's wrapped up a bit with your earlier question. There's almost a psychic wish here to say, 'Well, there's another thing that's gone] Well, we blew that one too] Well, we're no longer important or relevant.' It's this return of the hangdog.' Would he prefer to call it something boring like the 'reliable relationship'. 'No, I prefer to call it a strategic relationship.' But is there any other country with which the US has it? 'Not that I can think of. It's not all harmony, and it shouldn't be because interests will clash from time to time . . . But no, not that I can think of.' The Special Relationship, in other words, is not special, merely unique.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  PEOP  Personnel News.

Details of the plan, under which Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel will be threatened with destruction, are expected to be announced in the next 48 hours. Most of Iraq's neighbours, in spite of their hostility to the regime of President Saddam Hussein, have warned that the exclusion zone will increase tension in the region and threatens to dismember a sovereign state. Iran, Yemen, Syria, Jordan and Algeria have issued statements in support of Iraq's territorial integrity and opposing the allied plan. Egypt is also known to be concerned at the US action, and even Gulf countries such as Bahrain, where Britain based its Tornado aircraft during the Gulf war, have sought to head off further US involvement in Iraq. Only Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are believed to be fully behind renewed military action. Mr Kamel Abu Jaber, Jordan's foreign minister, appeared to sum up Arab fears when he said: 'Any measure that aims at curtailing the unity of the Iraqi people and its territorial safety will lead to destabilising the region's security and subjects its states and people to dangerous options.' Iraqi opposition groups and reports from Iran said yesterday that Shias in the south had come under fresh attack from President Saddam's troops who were using heavy artillery and tanks. The aim of the allied air exclusion zone is to protect the Shias from persecution by Baghdad in defiance of the regime's obligations imposed by UN resolutions after the Gulf war ceasefire. There is also a US threat to bomb other targets in Iraq if the regime refuses to permit UN inspectors to enter government buildings to search for evidence of weapons of mass destruction. An inspection team is expected to return to Baghdad next week. The US said last week that Mr Saddam was planning 'genocide' against the Shia population.

The review of the influence of Japanese companies on UK labour practices finds 'little evidence that Japanese-style international competitiveness can be achieved in Britain by copying some, or even most, Japanese working methods'. It also raises questions about the effect of having to 'work as hard as humanly possible' on the quality of employees' lives. The study, conducted for the Department of Employment by Industrial Relations Services, an independent pay and conditions research group, says British manufacturers are using the threat of Japanese competition to push through reforms in working practices. The report's author, Ms Sue Milsome, says this tack has proved more persuasive than the more accurate 'but less compelling' argument that 'competitive pressures demand changes in working and management practices'. Labour law reforms and the recession have probably had more influence on working methods in Britain than the example of companies like Nissan, she says. The report warns that the introduction of some working methods favoured by Japanese companies could increase British industry's vulnerability. For example, 'just-in-time' production means companies do not keep buffer stocks. A sudden stoppage by workers could mean immediate lay-offs in other plants, as happened during the 1988 Ford strike, the report also says. It warns: 'At some point . . . the British economy will recover. If there is a great deal of pent-up resentment against Japanese-style working practices, and the fragility of production systems has been increased . . . worker dissatisfaction leading to industrial action could have a devastating effect.' The study also points to the current debate in Japan over karoshi - death through overwork. Karoshi, it says, is mainly as a result of the large amounts of unpaid overtime performed by Japanese workers. It concludes that the Japanese economic miracle, which has so impressed western observers, is probably coming to an end. 'It may be that Japan's employment practices, in particular, will be jettisoned as Japan becomes a mature economy, so British employers should be wary of imitating practices that are only appropriate in a climate of ever-increasing growth.'

0,FT943-5238 ,"FT943-5238 _AN-EIECYAEJFT 940905   FT  05 SEP 94 / The Markets: Overdoing the caution - Global Investor      By JOHN PLENDER   As analysts speculate feverishly over the outcome of Wednesday's chat between the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England it is worth casting an eye over the recent behaviour of sterling futures. In effect the market has been anticipating an increase in short-term rates of more than a full percentage point by December - in other words, at least two separate half point increases. Notwithstanding the strong probability of some pre-emptive tightening before Christmas, the implicitly draconian forecast looks manic in the light of recent economic data. It certainly appears a backhanded compliment to the credibility of UK monetary policy, as, incidentally, does the behaviour of long-term rates (see chart), where the yield differential in the UK has moved very unfavourably this year against German bunds. The question is whether the markets are overdoing the caution, leaving a big arbitrage opportunity for cooler heads. Some, such as CS First Boston in its September fixed income research bulletin, have unhesitatingly recommended buying the December short sterling futures contract outright. My inclination is on their side of the argument. But it is still worth playing devil's advocate to see what could justify the market's pessimism. The prize candidate for this role is a sterling crisis. The obvious scenario would probably involve market worries about high rates of growth leading to a rapid disappearance of the gap between actual and potential output, quickly followed by inflationary bottlenecks. Against a background of no early increase in base rates and a November budget which is perceived to be excessively political and over-generous, this could easily do the trick. The snag with the argument is that we have already seen some pre-emptive tightening by the bond markets, which have imposed constraints on consumption via the rise in the cost of fixed-rate mortgages. This has coincided with the chancellor's tougher fiscal policy starting to make its mark. The worry about capacity utilisation thus looks premature in relation to a December futures contract. As for the concern about Kenneth Clarke's fiscal and monetary intentions, it presupposes that the man is wholly devoid of judgment. A more interesting case for pessimism is that advanced by Mr Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research. This hinges on Britain's role as a global financial intermediary in a world where the pattern of capital flows looks increasingly perverse. If life were rational, countries with ageing populations in the developed world might be expected to run current account surpluses on their balance of payments and to export capital to developing countries where the risk-adjusted returns are much higher. Yet within the Group of Seven industrialised countries, only Japan comes close to matching that description. Even then, the Japanese last year recycled only half their current account surplus in the form of long-term direct and portfolio outflows. But the most remarkable statistic in the accompanying table is the one that shows Britain, despite being in substantial current account deficit, becoming the biggest net exporter of long-term portfolio capital in the G7 in 1993. The US, too, has recently turned generous with its outflows, especially if direct outward investment of a further net Dollars 37bn is included. Meanwhile, Germany and Italy both received huge portfolio inflows. Part of the reason why the English-speaking economies have been exporting capital despite running current account deficits is that their financial systems are so highly developed. Traditionally, ageing Britons are big savers. But much of their saving has been recycled to younger Britons who borrow more than their counterparts elsewhere. When the inter-generational transfer is netted out, the savings rate proves unduly low and contributes to a large current account deficit. Yet the deployment of the gross savings of the ageing populations of the US and Britain is conducted mainly by fund managers without regard to macro-economic considerations such as the overall level of national savings. This leads to a big financing requirement. Both countries have, in effect, ended up borrowing short and lending long on a huge scale. This leads to an unstable situation, which is more worrying for Britain than the US where external factors are less important for the conduct of monetary policy. Given that the UK economic recovery is more advanced than continental Europe's, Britain will need to cut interest rates again before Germany. That could cut off the short-term inflows, causing sterling to crash. Mr Reading concludes from this that the way to deal with the new external constraint on monetary policy is to allow currencies to take the strain, while the consequences of easier money are offset by tighter fiscal policy. An equally striking feature of the table is the reversal of the biggest net flows, those of Britain and Japan, in the first quarter of this year. Yet in practise they do not represent conventional repatriation since they were largely offset by a return to repayments of borrowing. Because of the historic losses sustained through the appreciation of the yen, Japanese institutions finance much of their international capital excursions in the euromarkets. London, meanwhile, plays host to many leveraged investors in its capacity as an international financial centre. The big swings in the table help explain the extent of the bond market fall-out earlier this year. And, indeed, why burnt investors are leaving such large arbitrage opportunities in the futures markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Total return in local currency to 1/9/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   % change over period                       US    Japan  Germany   France    Italy       UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                0.09     0.04     0.09     0.10     0.16     0.09 Month               0.38     0.18     0.42     0.45     0.69     0.45 Year                2.66     2.66     5.94     6.06     8.38     5.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week                0.50    -0.36     0.00     0.11     0.72     0.57 Month               0.22    -1.13    -0.94    -1.66    -1.70     0.29 Year               -0.89     1.65     3.17     0.81     1.77     1.26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week                0.82    -0.09    -0.21    -0.03     0.46     0.72 Month               0.10    -0.96    -2.44    -3.73    -3.39    -0.02 Year               -4.07     0.32    -1.03    -4.22    -4.63    -2.39  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week                 1.1      0.4      2.1      0.7      0.1     -0.4 Month                2.8      0.8      2.1     -1.1     -1.3      4.2 Year                 4.9     -1.6     13.6     -0.9     10.0      8.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash  Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

Errera, chairman of the conference, said Pyongyang's refusal  cannot be ""treated as only a regional issue.""    He said the world's major nuclear powers -- the United  States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- could not ""accept  to impose nuclear constraints on themselves if other countries  continue to secretly develop nuclear weapons programs.""    North Korea suspended inspections of its nuclear sites by  the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in January 1993 and  three months later threatened to pull-out of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, sparking fears that it was developing  or had already developed a nuclear bomb.    Errera added that Iraq had also raised fears within the  international community that it was developing its nuclear  capability and that the breakup of the Soviet Union was  threatening the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty.    There are fears that stocks of fissionable material have  been  sold or otherwise channelled from former Soviet bloc countries  to countries secretly engaged in nuclear research.    The UN conference here, aimed at securing pledges from the  nuclear powers for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), is to  set up an ad-hoc committee to negotiate the treaty.    The United States has already expressed reservations about  Iraq being a member.    UN representative Vladimir Petrovskiy said Tuesday that he  would be in favor of enlarging the committee to include  additional members.    Errera, in his opening statement, also said that ""today's  reality does not reflect the past where two superpowers could  negotiate between themselves a disarmament treaty and then  present it for ratification by the international community.""    The five nuclear powers nevertheless have their own  reservations about a CTBT.    The United States, Russia, France and Britain have for  example suspended their tests, whereas China carried out an  explosion as recently as last October and appears in no hurry to  conclude testing.    In any event, signing a test ban treaty would in no way  imply  that the nuclear five were ready to give up their nuclear  stockpiles or abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence.    Errera said he could not predict how long the conference  would last. ""The main thing is that the talks should be taken  seriously so that we can work towards a treaty acceptable to  everybody.""    It appeared unlikely that they would conclude before the  1995  expiry date of the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT) which the western powers wish to extend for a period of  several years.

0,FT921-11793 ,"FT921-11793 _AN-CA3BUABMFT 920130   FT  30 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Deterrence in Europe   ON THE face of it, the disarmament measures announced by President George Bush on Tuesday night, and by President Boris Yeltsin yesterday do not directly affect western Europe. Both British and French officials were quick to point out that, even after these measures are implemented, Russia and the US will still have nuclear arsenals far larger than either Britain or France. But officials in both London and Paris are well aware that the reverse arms race, if it continues at its present rate, will before long reach a point where the size of the British and French arsenals becomes a consideration affecting US and Russian decisions. And without waiting for that point to be reached, it is already abundantly clear that the old rationale for the deployment of nuclear weapons in western Europe no longer applies. Mr Tom King, Britain's defence secretary, effectively admitted as much yesterday when he invited journalists to draw their own conclusions about the targeting of Britain's submarine-based missiles from Nato's declaration that it no longer viewed the former Soviet Union as an adversary. It no longer makes sense for British or French strategic weapons to be targeted on Russian cities. The threat to western Europe from Soviet conventional power has now been removed. There is therefore no longer a justification for any Nato country to retain an option of being the first to use nuclear weapons. The remaining function of nuclear weapons is, so to speak, to deter each other. Given that there are a great many of them around, particularly at present in the former Soviet Union but potentially also in the Middle East and the Third World, no country wants to be exposed to the threat of their being used against it. Three choices Three ways to avoid that risk suggest themselves. One is to be armed with nuclear weapons of your own as a deterrent. But that solution, if generalised, leads to a world with dozens of nuclear powers. Few theorists, and no political leaders, are prepared to say that such a world would be a safe one. Consequently there is more or less of a consensus on the preferability of a second and contrary option, which is to limit the spread of nuclear weapons as strictly as possible. That is the object of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), of which Britain was a co-sponsor with the US and the Soviet Union, and to which France too is now a party. The awkward long-term question for Britain and France is whether, by insisting on the necessity of maintaining their own independent national deterrents, they do not risk undermining the NPT and making it more difficult to persuade states such as Kazakhstan and Ukraine to adhere to it. The awkward short-term question, for Britain in particular, is whether a decision to commission a fourth Trident submarine, which is due to be taken within the next weeks or months, might not in present circumstances be seen as a step in the wrong direction, sending a wrong signal to states now considering their nuclear options. Uniform security It was perhaps with such thoughts in mind that President Francois Mitterrand recently suggested the necessity of working out a 'European nuclear doctrine'. Certainly Britain and France would be well advised, if they wish to retain their nuclear forces, to relate them as clearly as possible to the security of Europe as a whole. If they decide that a tactical air-to-surface missile is necessary as a deterrent against new nuclear powers, they would surely be well advised to pool their resources in developing it. The third solution, compatible with both of the others, is the one suggested by Mr Yeltsin yesterday: a co-operative effort to build anti-missile defences. Implausible when President Ronald Reagan suggested it as a way of making nuclear weapons 'impotent and obsolete', it becomes less so as an insurance against a single strike from a novice nuclear power. It is certainly worth examining, and if it goes ahead Europe should make sure of being included in it.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

The court's advocate general yesterday endorsed two of the charges brought against Britain by the European Commission. The development will be an embarrassment to the government, which is trying to emphasise the success of its environmental policy. It came as Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, was in Brussels talking to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, about the British presidency of the EC later this year. The court's judgment, likely to be made around Easter, will do little to improve relations between the UK and Brussels environment authorities. These were soured in October when Mr Ripa di Meana asked the UK to halt seven construction projects until it was established that it had complied with a directive requiring environmental impact studies. The advocate general's opinion was yesterday was that the UK had not adequately transposed the 1980 directive on drinking water into national law and that nitrates in East Anglian water exceeded the limit of 50 milligrammes per litre laid down in the directive. But he said a complaint about lead pollution in Scottish water should be dismissed for insufficient evidence. Court judgments usually follow the advocate general's opinion. Mr Heseltine declined to comment on the dispute after meeting Mr Ripa di Meana but said Britain had one of the best records in complying with Community regulations. In London, Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's minister for environmental protection, said: 'The EC ruling shows the government is granting licences to pollute and the water companies are putting profits before pollution controls.' Friends of the Earth, the environmental organisation which initiated the complaint, said that during 1990 5.3m people in East Anglia and the Midlands received water with nitrate in excess of drinking water directive standards. The Water Services Association, representing the 10 big water and sewage companies, said that, even where nitrates were above set levels, they were well within World Health Organisation limits. The UK water industry has a Pounds 1.8bn programme to reduce nitrates and comply with the directive by 1995. Clean-up scheme, Page 26  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

The Hong Kong government has proposed that China lobby more  than 70 countries for the permanent abolition of visa  requirements for holders of the Hong Kong British National  (Overseas) (BNO) passport and the future Special Administrative  Region (SAR) travel document.    But a senior government official has revealed that Beijing  has shown reluctance to hold talks with other governments on the  issue. Beijing has yet to discuss SAR passports, despite  numerous requests for talks on the matter by Britain over the  past 12 months. And approaches by the British government have  been met with silence. But the Hong Kong government fears that  China's indifference to the latest request for co-operation  could result in future difficulties for Hong Kong people.    At present, 71 countries waive visa requirements for BNO  passport holders. However, there is no guarantee that the  arrangement will continue beyond 1997 as Hong Kong people will  be regarded as Chinese nationals and may hold both passports.    ""The British side's proposal is based on goodwill, aiming to  secure freedom of travel for the people of Hong Kong, which is  enshrined in the Joint Declaration and essential for Hong Kong's  continuous prosperity in future,"" said a government official.  However, a Chinese official said Beijing was unlikely to  cooperate with the request because China viewed visa abolition  agreements with foreign governments for SAR passport holders as  an issue to be dealt with exclusively by Hong Kong's future  sovereign power.    China has not yet made any unilateral efforts to hold talks  with foreign governments on recognition of SAR passports or visa  arrangements. But it is understood that Western governments  could categorise the SAR passports in the same manner as normal  passports issued by Beijing.    Among the countries that currently waive entry visas for  short stays for BNO passport holders, only Thailand, South  Africa and Poland have formal written agreements with the Hong  Kong government. Another 10 countries that have visa abolition  agreements do so as an extension of similar agreements with  Britain. It is still not clear whether such agreements will  remain in place after 1997.    The ten countries are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,  Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland, San Marino, Argentina, and  Liechtenstein. The issue will be discussed again at a meeting  of team experts of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the  end of the month, but arrangements will not be made without  Beijing's co-operation.

Leading Labour politicians gave an enthusiastic, if qualified, reception to a report from the party's Social Justice Commission urging a 'Citizens' Service' programme to tackle youth unemployment. Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the race for the Labour leadership, said the proposal to take unemployed people aged between 16 and 24 off the dole through paid but voluntary service schemes marked an 'excellent' contribution to his party's policymaking. His enthusiasm was echoed by several members of Labour's shadow cabinet, with Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, suggesting that up to 750,000 young people could benefit. The Liberal Democrats welcomed the proposal as 'a shift to our ground'. But Mr Malcolm Bruce, their trade and industry spokesman, warned that without a strong commitment to education or training, the scheme would merely 'plaster over the cracks'. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, rejected the idea and accused Labour of promot-ing a dependency culture. Mr Hunt, stressing the government's commitment to high-quality education and training, said: 'I don't want 16 and 17-year-olds going straight from school on to social security or weeding grass verges.' Mr Hunt was forced to acknowledge that nearly 80,000 school-leavers aged between 16 and 17 fall through the government's training and social security safety nets. This group - at the centre of the recent political row about begging on the streets - are denied benefit because they do not take up training places. His comments came as Mr John Major launched a Conservative defence of the government's decision to opt out of the European Union's social chapter. He said that Britain's lower social costs were a vital ingredient in its strong record of job creation over the past year and cited widespread support from business for the opt-out. Mrs Beckett used a keynote speech to attack the government's approach. She said the Tory future for Britain was a 'low-wage, low-skill economy where pay and living standards are driven down'. She said the first act of a Labour government would be to sign the social chapter in a commitment to high wages, high skills and job creation.

Ratification requires approval by at least 260 of the 518 MEPs, and party managers were yesterday making frenetic efforts to ensure enough Yes votes. According to an official, special travel arrangements were being made to ensure that several MEPs arrived in time. In letters to leaders of the main political groups in the Strasbourg assembly, Mr Kohl promised to ensure the parliament would get the top-table seat it wants in the run-up to the 1996 constitutional review of power-sharing in the EU and the Maastricht treaty. Apart from Mr Kohl's assurance, Mr Ruud Lubbers and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Dutch and Belgian premiers (and both candidates to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president) have also made similar pledges. Germany takes over the EU presidency at the end of next month when a high-level committee should be set up to prepare the 1996 inter-governmental conference. Mr Kohl reminded MEP leaders that he had long argued for strengthening the parliament as the basis for a more democratic and federal Union. The parliament has been making its mandatory ratification of the EU's biggest expansion conditional on a further enhancement of its own role. In March, it made clear it would not ratify if Britain had its way in the voting rights row, making it easier for a minority of member states in the larger Union to block decisions. Germany took the lead in ensuring Britain received only cosmetic concessions, but even these have provoked many MEPs into fighting for postponement of enlargement until the institutional and power balance in the EU is sorted out. At least 100 MEPs are today expected to press for a postponement. This motion will almost certainly be defeated. But the question is whether enough of the dissidents will then vote Yes on entry for the four newcomers. Mr Kohl's intervention will bolster arguments that the failure of the enlargement vote would create an institutional crisis that would hinder reform. But the British Conservative government faces further discomfort with its Euro-phobe faction if it backs the Chancellor's pledge to support a body which is markedly Socialist and federalist. Polls suggest that after next month's Euro-elections, the parliament will be even more dominated by Socialists than it is now. Officials in Strasbourg point out, moreover, that additional seats for Germany to reflect unification means that federalist Germans will occupy many of the key positions in the new assembly.

0,FT924-11216 ,"FT924-11216 _AN-CJ0BMADNFT 921027   FT  27 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Britain and Maastricht   IN THE increasingly tense run-up to next week's debate in the House of Commons, the future of the Maastricht treaty is starting to become confused with the survival of Mr John Major, or even with the future of his government. This is to miss the main point: the Maastricht treaty must be ratified by Parliament because it is in the interests of Britain that it should be ratified. It is obvious that this treaty is not perfect; and it is easy to cavil at particular ingredients. But the whole menu is a broadly based programme of further integration in a wide range of policy fields, which represents the best political compromise the 12 governments were able to reach at their Maastricht summit 10 months ago. Some parts of the treaty now look rather over-ambitious; others may seem over-cautious or plain inadequate. Last month's currency crisis in the exchange rate mechanism has cast a cloud over the feasibility of the programme for Economic and Monetary Union; it now seems uncertain when or if weaker member states will be in a position to join in moves towards monetary union, and unlikely that even the strong currencies can reach monetary union before the end of the decade. Conversely, it is clear that the treaty provisions for developing a common foreign and security policy rest much more on rhetoric than substance; this political lacuna has been underlined in practice by the meagreness of the European response to the Yugoslav crisis. Coherent action But the Community needs to develop. The logic of the single market dictates closer economic integration; the geopolitics of Europe requires effective, coherent action from the western part of the continent. Agreeing effective mechanisms in response to these needs is a complex matter involving much compromise. Maastricht was just such a compromise: not a series of final solutions, but an inescapable agenda. No one can pretend that the treaty as a document is simple, lucid or elegant; some people pretend that it is unintelligible. But its general objectives are clear, large and unmistakable: to carry the process of European integration a large stride forward, without unnecessary centralisation of powers, and to extend it on a broad front into new fields such as foreign policy, perhaps defence one day, justice, immigration and social welfare. On immigration, for example, member states naturally wish to preserve a high degree of autonomy, but only the foolish pretend that national responses alone can deal with the scale of potential migratory pressures bearing down on the Community from all sides. Maastricht or no Maastricht, common action is needed. Common interests This extension of the process of European integration does not derive from some dogmatic and abstract federalist ambition. It is in Britain's interests to take part in the process of European integration, because Britain and its European partners have increasingly broad interests in common, and share more and more problems which they can better tackle together. The British government has resisted any binding commitment to take part in a single currency, and the British political establishment may not think in Community terms as instinctively as some of its continental counterparts; but the central reality is that Britain is a European country with European interests and European problems, and it needs European policies which can be developed with its European partners. That is the function of the European Community: to enable the member governments jointly to develop common policies. The most misconceived and misleading ingredient in the Maastricht treaty, was the attempt to pretend that Emu would be an automatic mechanism leading unstoppably to a single currency. Nothing in the Community has ever been or can ever be that automatic; this is a Community of sovereign governments which are permanently engaged in negotiation and decision-making. And in such a Community, Britain has everything to gain; the only thing it need fear is that it may mistakenly exclude itself, by retreating to some anachronistic isolation. This was the platform on which all three political parties fought the general election in April. Now they must deliver.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

Partly as a result of the UK Conservative party's resistance to sanctions during the apartheid era, British relations with the new government are weaker than with the old. At the same time the UK finds itself fourth in South Africa's trading league behind the US, Germany and Japan. Mr Heseltine's visit follows ones by US commerce secretary Ron Brown and French president Francois Mitterrand which have been seen as part of a drive to reap possible commercial rewards for those countries' support for sanctions during the anti-apartheid struggle. 'South Africa is now perceived as a country with which to do business,' says Mr John Doble, British consul-general in Johannesburg, who says British companies have made more than 60 investments since 1990. On the investment side, the UK has for more than a century remained unchallenged as South Africa's single biggest foreign investor with about R50bn (Pounds 8.8bn) in stock and assets. South Africans hold about R35bn in Britain. Two-way trade between the UK and South Africa amounted to R10.25bn in 1993 slightly in the UK's favour. Britain's imports are primarily of raw materials and food and vegetable products. It exports mostly pharmaceuticals, machinery and, more recently, telecommunications equipment. The UK Export Credits Guarantee Department already has Pounds 1.3bn in export credits outstanding in South Africa, the agency's fourth-biggest commitment. In the first four months of this year British exports to South Africa grew by 20.2 per cent. Imports from South Africa increased only 2.3 per cent, although some sectors, such as fruit and wine, are expected to grow by about 30 per cent for the year. In the defence sector, South Africa is known to be in the market for up to six navy corvettes worth about Pounds 1bn, and if Britain could secure the contract it might help save the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. At the same time Britain is considering buying South African Rooivalk attack helicopters as part of a total order for 90 helicopters costing about Pounds 2bn and there is speculation that a reciprocal arrangement could be worked out. Mr Heseltine discussed the issue yesterday with Mr Joe Modise, South African defence minister, and an announcement may be made before the end of the week.

'It seems to me likely that it will fall to be resolved by the European Court of Justice at the end of the day,' he said. He said the European Commission was proposing to extend the use of such assessments to cover proposals and policies put forward by EC governments. An announcement on the new proposals extending the principle to governments will be made in two weeks time, he said. At present the directive on impact assessments applies only to large individual projects. 'It is now clear that this is not enough,' he said. 'It is essential that policies, plans and programmes are also subjected to environmental impact assessment.' He envisaged that this would also apply to EC policy at a later date. He renewed his strong criticism of the British government for pressing ahead with large schemes which he had asked to be suspended because environmental assessments had not been properly made. The reaction of the British government and some parts of the British media 'have left a bitter taste in my mouth', he said. 'There has been absolutely no victimisation of the United Kingdom, no singling out to the exclusion of other member states.' UK schemes include the Channel tunnel rail link, East London river crossing and M3 extension near Winchester. Britain and other EC states have argued that projects in the pipeline when the directive came into force in July 1988 should be exempted. But the commission rejected this. He said the commission had opened proceedings for breach of the directive against 10 governments, including Britain, and proceedings would soon start against an 11th.

As an adult resident of this country for the last 40 years I, too, am shocked at its continuing slide into acceptance of media manipulation of its mind, and I applaud Mr Major, Mr Smith and Mr Ashdown for ignoring the amazing accusations made against their everyday ability by those who purport to speak freely for the electorate. It was refreshing recently to read in your paper that Mr Lamont does not feel he has to read it regularly. We are witnessing, in this country particularly, an alarming (for some) and increasing arrogance among the media, which has an avarice for a new sensation a day to keep it going. Unfortunately, a large part of the community continue to feed the media by avidly reading, listening and watching; and applauding, it would seem, that very sentiment. We are witnessing and are powerless; unless your good journal and one or two other media quality disseminators awake to publish comment on this rumbling coup d'etat to our leadership and our very constitution by those who speak and wave their hands but are unable to govern themselves (or themselves). They are a terrible band of brothers who maintain that 'freedom of speech' means anybody can say almost anything under its banner, but whose main aim is to increase their audience and own sense of well-being. In Britain the time for anger certainly appears to have arrived and we might start by not condoning such media activity, by not purchasing it and by speaking out against it when it appears before us.

0,FT942-12703 ,"FT942-12703 _AN-ED1EOADZFT 940428   FT  28 APR 94 / A problem aired . . .: Bruce Clark previews a portrait of the UK Foreign Office      By BRUCE CLARK   As western politicians work themselves into a moral frenzy over Bosnia, there is something refreshing about a senior western diplomat who is dubious about the role of ethics in foreign policy. The diplomat is Mr David Gore-Booth, British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and former head of the Middle East department at the Foreign Office. His world-weary musings on the rights and wrongs of arms sales provide one of many startling vignettes in a documentary series on the British diplomatic service entitled True Brits, to be screened on BBC2 over the next six weeks, starting tonight. 'You have to factor in the morality because that is what British public opinion and the British value system demands,' believes the ambassador. 'But it cannot be the overriding factor because Britain has to survive by exporting.' Mr Gore-Booth is talking about the Scott inquiry, which is considering allegations that Britain avoidably abetted Saddam Hussein by selling him weapons and components. He sees no case to answer. 'I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of British policy at that time; it was in fact as close to being honourable as international circumstances permitted.' The series is billed by its producer Stephen Lambert as the closest British television has come to the heart of government. It provides hilarious insights into the horse-trading before a European summit; follows a consul into a Thai prison; depicts the opening of lonely outposts in ex-Soviet cities; and follows the dreaded cost-cutting inspectors to Washington. It is the existence of the latter which explains the sudden onset of glasnost at the Foreign Office. Like everybody else, the diplomats want to show that they provide value for taxpayers' money. But in throwing open their doors, the diplomats have been remarkably bold. In one episode, we see the pragmatic Mr Gore-Booth, who speaks for British policy at its most hard-boiled and mercantilist. In another, we meet two women diplomats who are blazing idealists. There is the formidable, elegant Ms Gwynne Evans, head of the UN department, who is unmarried, a self-confessed workaholic, who has devoted her working life to what she calls 'public service'. We see her visiting Sarajevo, where she sits stoically through an artillery battle, makes some proposals about how to defend aid convoys and attends Mass in a local church. She is too clever to think there are easy answers in Bosnia, and that makes her all the more likeable. That said, most viewers will relate more easily to the engaging, vulnerable personality of Ms Frances Guy, a young Scotswoman who deals with Iraq. One moment she is saying goodbye to her husband and baby daughter in a modest London home; the next she is helping the Kurds of northern Iraq rebuild their villages under cover of the 'no-fly' zone. The two women seem at times to live on a different planet from Mr Gore-Booth. On reflection, however, the worlds of all three are closely intertwined. Ms Guy may represent a gentler school of diplomacy than Mr Gore-Booth, but she too has realpolitik to consider. With disarming frankness, she explains the reason why she cannot be too zealous in promoting self-government among the Kurds or in any other part of Iraq: neighbouring countries would see it as a bad precedent. 'You have the Iranians who are scared of democracy, you have the Saudis who are scared of democracy . . . and they control a lot of the British economy.' Which brings us back to Mr Gore-Booth. The Saudis may not like western political systems, but they do care about their co-religionists in Bosnia and they expect Britain to care about them too. We see Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, telling his man in Riyadh: 'We have to show also that we're not just sitting back being careless of Moslem lives.' On the subject of Moslem lives: one of the 'international circumstances' to which Mr Gore-Booth refers is the fact that five years ago, most of Iraq's partners did not see the use of poison gas against the Kurds as grounds for cutting off arms sales. So a unilateral UK boycott would arguably have hurt Britain more than Iraq. This 'circumstance' was certainly regrettable, for it was soon apparent that Saddam was capable of much 'worse' acts than poisoning his citizens - such as invading Kuwait. If the west had 'factored in the morality' a little earlier, perhaps the Gulf war, and the human tragedy of the Iraqi Kurds which Ms Guy is trying to alleviate, could have been avoided. Nor is Mr Gore-Booth a mercantilist all the time. Confronting a delegation of British businessmen who want better relations with Iran, he tells them bluntly: 'We believe the Iranians are trying to acquire a nuclear bomb.' So there are, it seems, some circumstances when countries need to be kept at arm's length, even when business opportunities beckon. Defining those circumstances has never been easy for professional diplomats, and it is not easy for the ordinary tax-paying citizen either. Even allowing for the interest of the Foreign Office in self-promotion, it is still extraordinary that it has allowed the viewer quite such a candid glimpse of its own dilemmas and the differing ways in which its staff respond. The Foreign Office apparently wants its dilemmas to become the public's dilemmas too; and that is a worthy aspiration. It also makes for gripping television.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

A health policy document to be launched by Mr John Smith, the party leader, will show that Labour does not intend to return to the system of centralised decision-making that characterised the NHS before the government's 1991 reforms. Labour will consult widely on its document over the coming year before completing its health policy for the next election. The party is taking a firm stand on some issues from the outset - notably a determination to abolish GP fundholding, under which some family doctors purchase hospital care for individual patients. The document will emphasise that Labour is satisfied that fundholding has contributed to the development of a two-tier health service and should be abolished. It will propose that all GPs should instead be involved in joint commissioning arrangements with health authorities. Labour's document accepts the principle of the purchaser-provider split on which the government's reforms are founded. A Labour government would seek to operate it in a planned and co-ordinated way, rather than with what the party sees as the commercialised and competitive flavour of the government's internal market. One of the most topical issues in the document concerns public accountability in the running of hospitals and health authorities. There is growing debate in the NHS over whether the current system of appointing members to health authorities gives their decisions sufficient legitimacy. Labour intends to test public opinion on three options - retaining nomination, direct election or integration of health purchasing with local government. The document will stress that Labour's current view is that nomination should be abandoned in favour of a more democratic structure. Some of the most controversial aspects of the document are likely to concern a future Labour government's relationships with private healthcare. It proposes the eventual phasing out of private treatment in NHS hospital pay beds, and restrictions on the amount of private work that NHS doctors could carry out. The document will not commit a future Labour government to any particular levels of spending on the NHS. But statements that Britain spends less on health than many other European countries - for every Pounds 3 spent in Britain on health care, it says, France, Germany and the Netherlands spend Pounds 5 - are likely to raise public expectations.

At first sight they look impressive to the 'stakeholders' at whom they are aimed - employees, suppliers, customers and the wider community. But how many are really worth the paper they are written on? Much depends on how they are drawn up, according to Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford. In many companies they are formulated by a small group at the top. But the Bishop disparaged such codes last night in a London Business School lecture on 'the morality of good business'. Instead, he advocated a lengthy process of consultation in which everyone affected could participate. His own diocese had involved all of its parochial church councils in drawing up a Vision, Priorities and Targets paper, he said. The process took two years. Itemising other requirements needed to make codes of conduct effective, the Bishop said they should be expressions of, not substitutes for, a deeply-imbued sense of corporate values. Rather than just being applied in a 'minimalist, legalistic way', they were effective only when they were seen to be part of a corporate culture with a strong sense of moral purpose about what the company did and how it did it. Codes should be communicated widely and kept constantly effective, said the Bishop. The next stage for companies must be to review and monitor them. Adequate mechanisms must be set up to test 'the effectiveness, the reality, of what exists on paper'. Comparing the existence of codes of conduct in Britain with other industrialised countries, the Bishop cited statistics which suggest that about 75 per cent of US companies now have them, against 40 per cent of companies in Germany and France in 1988, but only 28 per cent of Britain in 1991. However, this was well up on the 18 per cent in 1987. The Bishop expressed confidence that the increase would continue.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

In the first place everyone seems incapable of  distinguishing  between a loan and a grant. Persistently, the loan for the  Pergau Dam is referred to as a grant. Had it been a grant, the  amount which covered more than half the cost of the project  would certainly have made it a wonderful buy for the Malaysians,  contrary to what the press and some British officials insist it  was.    A loan has to be repaid with interest, however small. The  benefit for Malaysia would only be marginal. On the other hand,  if it was not offered, the project could have gone to  non-British companies. Japan offers soft loans on a yearly  basis. Other countries also offer grants or loans when bidding  for projects.    The Pergau loan serves to help pay a British company which  presumably would make a profit. So the aid benefits a British  company. Malaysia gets nothing other than a marginally lower  price. How driving a hard bargain in order to save the Malaysian  government's money is considered corruption is beyond us.    Malaysians are not concerned about British scruples over  selling arms. Arms are arms and, whether they are gifts or  subsidised or aided or sold at a massive profit, the purpose is  the same. If you have scruples don't sell arms at all. In no  other business is there so much hypocrisy in the West. When  arms are sold, long-term payments or offset programmes or  special terms are invariably offered by every one.    In any case it is clear that the loan is for the Pergau Dam.  It has never been proven conclusively that it was for the arms  purchase. The attempt to link it with the arms sale is  political and intended to embarrass the British government.  Malaysia is not concerned and did not react or comment.    Unhappy with the lack of results over the expose, the  British  press then shifted its focus to Malaysia. Of course the natives  are corrupt. They must be, because they are not British and not  white. To allege that the Malaysian prime minister accepted  bribes is second nature. He should accept this allegation  because, as a British newspaper later commented, all politicians  in Asia are corrupt. The question is: why do the British insist  on corrupting ""corrupt"" people. Don't they have any scruples or  do they consider giving bribes is not corruption?    The allegations against the Malaysian prime minister have  turned out to be baseless. Wimpey denied (them). Even the  editor of THE SUNDAY TIMES said he was misunderstood.    There was no tender for an aluminium smelter. There was no  smelter project. Only a feasibility study aided by the British  government, which hoped to get the project for a British  company, Wimpey. It was not feasible.    Alleging, wrongly, that the Malaysian prime minister is  corrupt may be part of British press freedom. But the Malaysian  prime minister need not subscribe to that, even as Andrew Neil  [SUNDAY TIMES editor] himself did not accept reports on his  affair with Pamella Bordes.    Press freedom is about telling the truth, not fabricating  lies for whatever purpose. The contempt for the hurt inflicted  on others seems to be condoned by the British government and  people. No scruples about lying, seemingly plenty about selling  arms? The standard answer to the Malaysians is that the British  press is free. ""Lies, damned lies"" are free. Redress isn't.  This is what Western democracy and human rights is all about.  If this is not moral decadence, then what is?    Giving contracts to the British seems to expose Malaysia to  vilification and libellous attacks. Why let British companies  make money out of Malaysia if this is to be the consequence? If  we are going to be vilified, at least we should not pay for it.  Thus the decision to stop giving contracts to British firms.    And Britain should be happy. No contracts means no soft  loans, no grants and no corruption of the natives. Since  Britain was, according to British papers, responsible for  Malaysia becoming one of the ""economic tigers"" of South East  Asia, Malaysia would soon realise the folly of its ways. Then  the free press can gloat when Idi Amin/Hitler/Mahathir comes  crawling back with offers of contracts.    But instead we hear more threats and lies. Seems that paper  gunboats still abound. What can Malaysia do? The free press is  free for the British. It is not free for Malaysians. While  British newspapers are freely available in Malaysia, Malaysian  papers are not available to the British. And the British papers  never publish Malaysian views. This is the practical result of  Western-style press freedom.    For Malaysia, the die is cast. No contracts in exchange for  British press freedom to tell lies.     "

Mr Smith used his speech to a Labour conference on Europe in Brighton to insist that Britain had to be in the lead in Europe, saying: 'Let us play our part in shaping the Europe of the next century.' He justified Labour's decision to vote against the government by saying he was not prepared to support a motion, 'which would have endorsed the Conservative opt-out from a social chapter which the rest of the (European) Community properly regards as vital'. He said Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, was either 'not telling the truth' or was 'an unashamed hypocrite' in suggesting that he knew three weeks ago that the government would delay completing ratification of the Maastricht Bill until after the second Danish referendum. Mr Smith said Mr Ashdown had told the Commons he did not believe that Britain should, 'shelter behind the skirts of the Danish people'. The Liberal Democrats had backed, 'a discredited and bankrupt government that is undermining our society, destroying our economy and wrecking our future in Europe'. His comments came at the end of a week in which relations between Labour and the Liberal Democrats have worsened dramatically. Aides to Mr Ashdown denied there had been any contact between the Liberal Democrats and the government, but confirmed that the party had long believed the bill's committee stage could last until April or May. Conservatives have attacked Labour. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in a speech in Derbyshire last night, said that 'domestic partisan interests - and an appalling lack of principle - have, once again, been allowed to overshadow Britain's future in Europe'.

Speaking in London, Mr Rexrodt stressed that individual  European economies had to show ""more convergence"" before EMU  [economic and monetary union] would be feasible.    ""From the German side we are keeping the goal of a common  currency. But we will not get excited if it takes five, six or  seven years,"" he said. The Maastricht Treaty lays down 1997 and  1999 as the earliest and latest possible dates for introduction  of EMU. Mr Rexrodt made clear his overall commitment to  monetary union. ""We have to go that way there is no  alternative.""    Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank  president, have both emphasised recently that maintaining  currency stability is more important than sticking rigidly to  the Maastricht timetable. However, Mr Rexrodt is the first  senior member of the German economic policy establishment to say  publicly that EMU could be delayed until the next century. He  made the comments at a conference on investment in Germany  organised by the German-British Chamber of Commerce.    Both Mr Rexrodt and Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and  industry secretary, who also spoke at the conference, underlined  the importance of further measures to free European businesses  from unnecessary regulation. However, the two ministers admitted  that Britain and Germany had made little progress on setting up  an Anglo-German panel of business experts to review EU  legislation. The initiative was announced when the two  ministers met in London on April 27, but Mr Rexrodt said the two  sides were still exploring the ""structure"" of such a body.    Mr Heseltine said the delay was partly due to the  intervening  six weeks of campaigning for the European elections.    Mr Rexrodt painted a relatively optimistic picture of German  economic recovery. The 1994 German growth rate could top the  official target of 1.5 per cent, and expansion next year could  be around 2 per cent, he said.    The two ministers showed divergence on the importance of the  European social chapter, from which the UK won an opt-out in the  Maastricht treaty.    Mr Heseltine claimed that Britain was attracting investment  from Germany partly because German companies were trying to free  themselves from onerous EU social legislation.

A  European summit was looming and they were, naturally, bitching  about Margaret Thatcher.    Kohl: I don't know where we're going. Its very difficult to  talk to her.    Mitterrand: I'm not pessimistic. Britain always says ""No"" at  the start, but if France and Germany do something together, it  wants to be involved.    According to M Attali, the French and German leaders then  moved on to a little horse-trading. Germany would pass up its  chance to name the President of the European Commission, in  favour of a Frenchman, if the French would promise to back a  German the next time round. Herr Kohl would accept a French  candidate ""on condition that he doesn't work against the  political initiatives which you and I will take."" The Frenchman  chosen was Jacques Delors.    This episode puts John Major's Corfu veto in perspective.  Kohl and Mitterrand thought that they could bring off the same  sort of trick a decade later by cutting an early deal for  Jean-Luc Dehaene. They lazily assumed that the Dutch and British  would grumble but roll over in the end. They were wrong.    But Mr Major has not broken any mould. M Attali's portrait  of power-broking between Paris and Bonn captures the authentic  flavour of high European politics then and now. High-flying  officials, private-sector go-betweens, ambassadors and Eurocrats  hop from capital to capital trading milk quotas, votes, slots in  a variety of international hierarchies and, from time to time,  ideas. What happened at Corfu was a rare failure of  stage-management, due partly to the infirmity of the 75-year-old  Greek Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, and mostly to an  uncharacteristic blunder by Herr Kohl.    ""The talk of dictatorship should come as no surprise to Kohl  and Mitterrand,"" one German correspondent wrote, yesterday,  echoing another who pointed out that several governments felt  that German foreign policy was becoming increasingly ruthless.  Mr Major exploited the grumbling resentment among the  governments which France and Germany had taken for granted.  Even if Herr Kohl now manages to glue the broken china back  together, me bad-tempered dinner at Corfu exposed a gulf which  is slowly opening between two ideas of how the EU [European  Union] should evolve. The gap is not the much rehearsed  difference over more federalism or less (which is moving into  the background as other more urgent questions shoulder it aside)  but the fight between little Europe and big Europe.    The defective deal to install Mr Dehaene in succession to M  Delors was made among four of the six states which originally  formed the EEC -- a fact which French spokesmen quickly  underlined at Corfu. The veto wielded by John Major is written  into the rules of the wider, formal EU of 12 states, soon to  expand to 15 or 16. Disliking vetos used by states outside the  founders' club and fearing the dilution of their power in a  growing EU, France and the Benelux countries are itching to go  back to the intimacy of the past. Could there be a new treaty  between the six founding states?    Supplanting the existing, resilient EU would be impossible  and the EU treaties are against this sort of exclusive,  political club. Multiple speeds are inscribed in the Maastricht  treaty on monetary union and social affairs, and opt-outs are  either voluntary or determined by agreed rules. ""Large Europe,""  perhaps 20 states in the early years of the next century, can  only rest on a treaty shaped around individual states and their  powers of veto. The Swedish Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, was  asked what he thought of the stormy dinner that he and his  fellow applicants had attended on Corfu. Rough bargaining, he  said, but it was god to see that the veto is real.    The ""Little Europe"" states of France, Germany and Benelux  say  that they want to do away with the veto unleashed with such  disruptive force by countries like Britain and Denmark. If a  minority of five or six governments want deeper integration  under Franco-German direction, other states cannot and should  not want to stop them. But the larger Europe, working slowly to  extend the benefits of stability and economic growth to East  Europe, will still be operating. The wider continent will not  take orders from the western end. Some decisions will still be  made at the speed of the slowest, and the veto will continue to  count.    The clash at Corfu was a small victory for the larger  Europe,  ponderously procedural, slow and sometimes infuriating though it  is. But Mr Major's action should have reminded his partners that  communities run by backroom deals tend to fall under the sway of  their most powerful members. If Europe comes to a parting of  the ways, Britain should avoid the small secretive clubs.     "

The 15-member UN Security Council rejected a Moroccan request in private consultations in New York to delay sanctions to consider the Libyan offer. The UN resolve set the stage for punitive measures, including an arms and air embargo, against the North African state. Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador to the UN, said sanctions would go ahead unless Libya made a last-minute decision to comply fully with UN demands  - which he considered 'extraordinarily unlikely'. The UN wants the two men  - accused of blowing up the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives  - surrendered for trial in Britain or the US. Malta said yesterday it would agree to Libya's request to put the men on trial, provided all parties agreed to this. But Sir David Hannay said Libya's proposal 'posed a condition which is unacceptable to our governments, which is that the trial can only, exclusively, take place in Malta'. Earlier yesterday the International Court in The Hague rejected Libya's plea to bar the US and Britain from taking punitive measures. The court said Security Council Resolution 748 imposing sanctions should override all other international agreements. President George Bush said this was 'a very good decision'. Libya defiantly isolated itself from the world yesterday by declaring a 'day of mourning' and cutting external air and telecommunications links. The national news agency Jana said this had nothing to do with sanctions but was a mark of respect for 37 Libyans who died in US bombing raids in April 1986. Most Arab states have indicated that they would reluctantly agree to fall into line with the UN air embargo, although both Egypt and Tunisia are planning to facilitate travel across their frontiers with Libya. EgyptAir and Libyan Arab Airlines have agreed to begin shuttle services to airstrips on each side of the Egypt-Libya border. Tunisia is making similar arrangements. Some 30 offices of Libyan Arab Airlines are expected to be closed worldwide and Libyan diplomatic representation will be thinned out under the terms of the UN resolution. The sanctions will not affect Libyan oil exports or shipping services.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "
0,FT941-1648 ,"FT941-1648 _AN-ECXDCAEJFT 940324   FT  24 MAR 94 / On the brink of a breakdown: The impasse on voting rights that threatens to provoke a crisis over EU enlargement      By LIONEL BARBER   The European Union loves to live dangerously. Brinkmanship runs in the blood, but there comes a point when members of the club must decide whether to pull back or precipitate a crisis. This point is approaching rapidly in the dispute over power-sharing in an expanded Union. Without an agreement in the next week or so, there is a serious risk that Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway will be unable to meet the agreed date of January 1 1995 for EU entry. A delay threatens to erode fragile public support for EU membership among the four Nordic and Alpine applicants, where only the Finns show a consistent majority in favour of entry. Postponement of enlargement would reinforce the sense of disarray in the Union, rekindling doubts about more ambitious projects such as a common foreign and security policy and a single European currency. There may be other unpredictable consequences. Britain and Spain's insistence on maintaining their ability to block decisions in an enlarged Union has attracted nationalist cheers at home. But it threatens to break the informal truce among heads of government over the constitutional future of the Union, a truce which barely held during the painful ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Until the latest imbroglio over voting rights, the consensus among the Twelve was to hold fire on constitutional issues until 1996, the date set for a review of Maastricht. But the power-sharing dispute has forced member states to confront matters which many hoped to postpone: the relationship between voting power and population in an expanded Union, and the organisation of a Union of 20 or more member states, including the central and east Europeans. With Hungary's application to join the EU due next month, pressures for faster integration of the east are growing. Germany, which takes over the rotating EU presidency from Greece on July 1, is planning several initiatives, including invitations to the former communist countries to send permanent non-voting delegations to the European Parliament, and invitations to heads of governments to attend European summits. 'We have to rethink our whole policy toward eastern Europe,' said one senior Commission official. It seems unlikely that the British and Spanish governments intended to open up the debate about the future shape of the EU. Together they make an odd couple: the pioneer of enlargement (Britain) hitched up with an EU partner which has more reservations than most about its impact (Spain). The next few days, starting with an EU foreign ministers meeting in Greece at the weekend, will determine whether the London-Madrid alliance is a marriage of convenience or principle. Both Spain and Britain want to preserve voting rules in an expanded Union which prevent two large countries and one small member state being outvoted  -23 votes are at present needed to muster this blocking minority. Britain is pressing for a legally binding protocol which would safeguard this present position. Spain may settle for something less, but it remained firm at Tuesday's meeting of EU foreign ministers. Voting procedures do not affect matters of sovereignty such as foreign policy or European monetary union, where a national veto by one member state can be exercised; but they do cover decisions on 'second tier' issues such as the environment, health and safety regulations, tobacco advertising, and trade action. For instance, the UK collected enough votes to block the first Commission proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the early 1990s; and last year won support from Germany and the Netherlands to block trade reprisals against cheap aluminium imports from Russia. For the Madrid government, the planned switch to a 27-vote threshold is especially worrisome because it challenges the power of the 'olive oil minority'. This grouping allows Spain to combine with Italy and Greece to muster 23 votes to block decisions judged to infringe its vital interests, mainly in the area of Mediterranean agriculture. For the UK, the tale is more tangled. Along with Germany, Britain had ranked as the Nordic applicants' best friend. Yet British support for 'widening' Europe has always been based on the assumption that it would not come at the price of further 'deepening' of Euro-institutions. The British calculation is that enlargement can proceed without further erosion of national sovereignty, and its conviction has strengthened in the past two years as ministers have watched public ambivalence about Maastricht grow on the continent, particularly in France and Germany. The belief that the tide in Europe is running Britain's way is widely held in Westminster, even though it has proved misplaced in the past and is not held in the Foreign Office. Brussels officials express astonishment that the UK has invested so much capital on an issue which they describe as peripheral compared with the greater political prize: enlargement of the Union to include wealthy, free-trading Scandinavians who will very soon be net contributors to the EU budget. The suspicion is that Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is wrapping himself in the Union Jack to prevent a civil war in his own party over Europe in the run-up to the European Parliament elections in June, where polls suggest the Tories will suffer heavy losses. The prime minister also looks boxed in by his own Cabinet, where a mixture of Euro-sceptics and pretenders to the premiership have turned an arcane voting system into a cause celebre. When EU foreign ministers met on Tuesday, Britain and Spain were clearly isolated. Ten countries declared there was no question of offering legally-binding protection for the 23-vote blocking minority, a position echoed by the European Parliament, which must give its assent to the enlargement treaty by early May or postpone consideration until after the June polls. Here is the big risk. Without an early favourable vote in the Parliament, there seems little hope of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway holding referendums on the accession treaties in time for the target date for entry into the Union. 'The whole momentum of enlargement would be lost,' said one Scandinavian ambassador. British officials say their best hope lies in persuading Germany to come up with a compromise. The Bonn government has little appetite for making population reflect voting power more accurately because it would mean a more populous Germany acquiring more votes than France, thus jeopardising the relationship with its closest ally. It insists that the threshold is raised from 23 to 27 votes. British officials are hoping, however, that Germany may agree to a deal whereby certain areas - notably social policy - would be subject to the 23-vote blocking minority in return for UK acceptance of 27 votes on most other areas. But such a solution still runs the risk of being turned down by the Parliament. What irks Britain and Spain's partners is that London and Madrid implicitly accepted the principle of a 'mechanical' adjustment in voting weights at the Lisbon summit in June 1992. The European Commission, as well as federalist-minded countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, argued in favour of more far-reaching reforms to streamline decision-making in an expanded European Union; but they were overruled by the UK and Germany which insisted that enlargement should come first. A Dutch diplomat, echoing widespread sentiment in Brussels, argues that the UK's strategy is to 'roll back' Maastricht and push the European Union further towards loose inter-governmental co-operation. 'The British are taking a very consistent line,' agrees a German official. The question is whether the rest of the Union has the stomach to provoke a confrontation now, or cobble together a compromise in the hope that the deep divisions over the future shape and pace of integration can be resolved in 1996. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has no doubt about the best outcome. 'It is better to have a crisis than to have a bad compromise which later turns out to make things five or six times worse.'   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT942-4409 ,"FT942-4409 _AN-EFJCMAABFT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Bonn casts doubt on monetary union timetable      By DAVID MARSH, European Editor      LONDON   Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday appeared to cast doubt on the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union by saying that a single European currency might take until 2001 to realise. Speaking in London, Mr Rexrodt stressed that individual European economies had to show 'more convergence' before Emu would be feasible. 'From the German side, we are keeping the goal of a common currency. But we will not get excited if it takes five, six or seven years,' he said. The Maastricht treaty lays down 1997 and 1999 as the earliest and latest possible dates for introduction of Emu. Mr Rexrodt made clear his overall commitment to monetary union. 'We have to go that way - there is no alternative.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, have both emphasised recently that maintaining currency stability is more important than sticking rigidly to the Maastricht timetable. However, Mr Rexrodt is the first senior member of the German economic policy establishment to say publicly that Emu could be delayed until the next century. He made the comments at a conference on investment in Germany organised by the German-British Chamber of Commerce. Both Mr Rexrodt and Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary, who also spoke at the conference, underlined the importance of further measures to free European businesses from unnecessary regulation. However, the two ministers admitted that Britain and Germany had made little progress on setting up an Anglo-German panel of business experts to review EU legislation. The initiative was announced when the two ministers met in London on April 27, but Mr Rexrodt said the two sides were still exploring the 'structure' of such a body. Mr Heseltine said the delay was partly due to the intervening six weeks of campaigning for the European elections. Mr Rexrodt painted a relatively optimistic picture of German economic recovery. The 1994 growth rate could top the official target of 1.5 per cent and expansion next year could be around 2 per cent. The two ministers showed divergence on the importance of the European social chapter, from which the UK won an opt-out in the Maastricht treaty. Mr Heseltine claimed that Britain was attracting investment from Germany partly because German companies were trying to free themselves from onerous EU social legislation. Mr Rexrodt said the problem of German labour costs and social policy rigidities was not linked to the social chapter. 'Our problems concern a social system that has become too complicated and extensive and is also misused,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

The venture should enable Mr Heseltine to monitor economic activity independently of the Treasury, which has run into criticism over its failure to forecast the length or seriousness of the recession. The group of about 20 companies, including J. Sainsbury, Imperial Chemical Industries and Marks and Spencer, would give Mr Heseltine confidential information about their sales trends in the crucial period as Britain attempts to move into an upturn. The group - which will also include Northern Foods, TI Group and Unigate - would also advise Mr Heseltine on long-term industrial goals. The project marks another stage in the government's efforts to set up a new dialogue with industry after the Thatcher era gave it a lower priority. The Treasury's role as the dominant force in economic policy making has been made less secure both by recession and last autumn's currency crisis which swept Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism. While ICI and Marks and Spencer said they were still considering Mr Heseltine's invitation, Mr Tony Sumner, a director of TI, said his company would take part. 'The more government and industry can get together the better,' he said. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, said his company 'will be happy to play a role', while Sainsbury and Northern Foods have also indicated willingness to participate. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Nor-thern Foods, said: 'By gathering the anecdotal experiences of people in industry, Mr Heseltine may be able to improve on the Treasury's more academic approach to monitoring the economy.' The Treasury, which has stepped up its contacts with industry, welcomed Mr Heseltine's plan and hoped to share the information gained. A formal announcement is expected within the next few weeks. Companies in the scheme are to send DTI officials commercially sensitive sales information about important parts of their business that provide clues to economic activity, both in the UK and overseas. The data would supplement economic statistics gathered from government or industry surveys, which during the recession have often given a misleading or confused picture of economic activity. Top executives would meet Mr Heseltine perhaps twice a year to thrash out ideas about long-term industrial goals.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He said: ""Britain would be  the first loser if the sanctions against Libya were escalated to  include Libya's oil exports. [no closing quotemarks as  published] He pointed out that 7,000 Britons worked in the  Libyan oil sector and that the trade balance between the two  countries was $1.5 billion in Britain's favor. In a statement  to AL-HAYAH yesterday, the source criticized what he described  as ""the West's intransigence against the Arab League's proposal  calling for the implementation of international legitimacy by  having the two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie case stand trial  before a Scottish court at the headquarters of the International  Court of Justice."" He added: ""That rejection is not only a  stand against Libya but also a slap to all the Arab states."" He  said that if the Arab League proposal was rejected and the  Western states concerned with the crisis insisted on escalating  it, then the Arab states should not comply with the economic  sanctions imposed on his country since April 1992 under Security  Council Resolution 748, and should resume flights between the  Arab states and Libya. He said that ""if the Arab states did  that, they would command world respect. Not all the Security  Council resolutions are always in their favor. In fact, the  majority of these resolutions are applied by some states and  ignored by others.""    Meanwhile, Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the Arab League's  assistant secretary general for political affairs, has stated  that the Arab League's proposal for the settlement of the  Lockerbie crisis placed the ball in the West's court. He said  that the proposal took into consideration international  legitimacy and Libya's sovereignty at the same time, and that  the Western states should respond to the Arab proposal which is  also supported by the Organization of African Unity and the  Nonaligned Movement.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, 'Imran said that Libya is  serious  in its efforts to close the Lockerbie file, adding that Western  rejection raised some questions about this issue. He said: ""If  the Western states have sufficient evidence to support the  charges then why do they not agree to the trial of the suspects  at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice?""

At a hearing of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, in addition  to continuing his attack on the Chinese side, he also distorted  facts, used lame arguments, and wantonly attacked some British  personalities who are relatively more rational in the  Sino-British disputes over constitutional issues.    This move by Chris Patten naturally called forth responses  from people with breadth of vision, including the abovementioned  personalities. Akers-Jones refuted Chris Patten's distortion  and slander against him as a ""cheap jibe."" Percy Craddock even  published an article entitled ""Patten `Has Got It Wrong' Again""  in Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST. In a cool and  rational style, Craddock used facts to clarify Chris Patten's  distortion and attacks. The rational response from Percy  Craddock is in striking contrast to Chris Patten's character and  morals as one who is rude and unreasonable and who fabricates  lies. It has provided reference material, which is hard to come  by, to help people understand the right and wrong of the  Sino-British controversies over constitutional issues.    No Consultations With the Chinese Side Before Publishing  Chris Patten's Proposals    The Joint Declaration states: In order to ensure a smooth  transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997, China and Britain  are to ""continue their discussions in a friendly spirit and  develop the cooperative relationship that already exists between  the two Governments over Hong Kong with a view to the effective  implementation of the Joint Declaration."" In the second half of  the transitional period, ""there will be need for closer  cooperation,"" and ""joint consideration of measures to be adopted  for a smooth transition in 1997."" However, Chris Patten has  gone in the opposite direction. A year and a half have passed  since he took up the post as governor of Hong Kong. He has done  nothing good to safeguard and maintain Hong Kong's economic  prosperity and social stability, but instances of his  conspicuous behavior in opposing Sino-British cooperation are  numerous. Percy Craddock disclosed that Chris Patten's refusal  to consult with the Chinese side on the constitutional reform  proposals before making his policy address was his first major  move of confrontation with Sino-British cooperation.    Facts have shown clearly that there was no consultation with  the Chinese side prior to the formulation of the constitutional  reform plan,and the plan was published unilaterally despite the  admonition and warning of the Chinese side. Percy Craddock has  always had reservations toward Chris Patten's refusal to consult  with the Chinese in advance and his unilaterally dishing out and  implementing a ""three violations"" constitutional reform package,  ignoring the provisions of the Joint Declaration. Proceeding  from the interests of Britain, he did not hesitate to criticise  this openly. However, instead of making a self-examination,  Chris Patten pretended to speak sternly at the Parliament, out  of a sense of justice, blaming Percy Craddock, saying that this  ""is completely untrue, and that whether its was the result of  misunderstanding or of other motivations is for Sir Percy to  explain in due course."" Since he distorted facts and made  unfounded counter-charges, Percy Craddock had no alternative but  to respond.    Quoting a passage from a book he had written, which would be  published soon, Percy Craddock pointed out that the Chinese  reaction to the ""three violations"" constitutional reform package  dished out by Chris Patten was so violent ""because of both the  manner and the substance of the proposals. Although they were  informed of the substance of the Governor's speech two weeks in  advance, their request that they be consulted (which in their  eyes probably meant negotiation) before the speech was delivered  was rejected."" What is especially interesting is that this  passage had been ""carefully checked"" with the Foreign Office as  part of the official clearance and had been ""accepted."" The  statements in this passage, which has gone through official  British clearance and is officially accepted, are exactly the  same as what the Chinese side has said. Chris Patten, being an  ""intimate friend of the prime minister"" and the person who  concocted and dished out the ""three violations"" constitutional  reform package, should know better than anyone else. However, he  went so far as to deny them and falsely accused the person who  spoke the truth as having other ""motivations."" This can show  only that Chris Patten intentionally tried to withhold the truth  and to continue deceiving Parliament and the British public in a  bid to gain support for his erroneous stand. Recently,  Sino-U.S. relations have been improving, China's domestic  situation has become more and more favorable, and more and more  Hong Kong people have come to understand China's policy toward  Hong Kong and have identified themselves with it. On the other  hand, Chris Patten's constitutional reform plan has been opposed  by more and more Hong Kong people, and has been criticized by  industrial and commercial circles and by people with breadth of  vision of other circles in Britain. Under such circumstances,  Chris Patten, after returning to Britain, indeed had no way to  court support in Britain other than to disguise himself, resort  to sophistry, and withhold the truth.       Chris Patten Deliberately Practices ""Three Violations""    At the hearing, Chris Patten also said that Percy Craddock  had not told him in advance of ""the existing political and  constitutional settlement,"" implying that although Percy  Craddock knew very well that his constitutional reform plan was  one of ""three violations,"" he had no objection. The fact is  that everyone knows very well that Percy Craddock does not agree  with Chris Patten's abandoning the relevant Sino-British  diplomatic agreements and understanding, takes an attitude of  reservation toward his constitutional reform plan, opposes open  confrontation with Sino-British cooperation, and takes the stand  of regarding such confrontation as ""the tragedy of Hong Kong.""  Chris Patten has completely confounded black and white in his  attempt to put Percy Craddock in the ranks of those who show  support the ""three violations"" constitutional reform plan.    In his article, Percy Craddock said that at that time, he  ""had no inkling of plans to circumvent existing arrangements and  substantially widen the electorate by bringing in a new kind of  functional constituency."" On the contrary, he explicitly  advised Chris Patten: ""Given the existing agreements,"" the  British side ""has very limited room for maneuver""; ""it is  dangerous to disregard Chinese objections to any increase in the  number of directly elected seats in 1995; and therefore, it is  necessary to work within the agreed framework."" This is  tantamount to clearly and correctly reminding Chris Patten that  by no means should he go beyond the agreements and understanding  reached with China to make the so-called constitutional reform  plan.    The Joint Declaration officially came into effect as early  as  1985 and the Basic Law also was published long ago. Chris  Patten also bragged that he ""read the Basic Law more frequently  than the Bible."" Regarding the agreements and understanding  concerned, which were reached by the foreign ministers of the  two countries, even if Chris Patten did not know about them in  advance, did he ever show any indication or take any action to  return to the ""three conformities"" when the Chinese side  explained to him, item by item, and explicitly pointed out his  mistakes of ""three violations?"" Moreover, Chris Patten also has  repeatedly undermined Sino-British talks on arrangements for the  1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. Consequently, no positive  results were attained and the talks finally broke down.  Evidently, it is not that Percy Craddock did not tell Chris  Patten the gains and losses in advance, but that Chris Patten  turned a deaf ear to the advice, and deliberately and stubbornly  took the road of confrontation with the Chinese side. He cannot  shirk his responsibility for the deterioration in Sino-British  relations.    Who Is Responsible for the British Interests?    In view of Chris Patten's attack to the effect that Percy  Craddock ""advocates an indulgent policy"" toward the Chinese  side, Percy Craddock pointed out that if the British side  insists on not cooperating with the Chinese side on the Hong  Kong issue, ""the Chinese do not have to negotiate at all; they  could dictate, or simply wait until 1997, when, by the mere  passage of time, Hong Kong will fall into their hands with no  restraints on their freedom of action."" In a certain sense,  this has reflected the truth. It also shows that Percy Craddock  has a far better understanding of China than does Chris Patten.  The British side once insisted on continuing the governing of  Hong Kong after 1997, and it was willing to hold talks on the  issue of returning Hong Kong only after Deng Xiaoping sternly  warned the British side that if it did not change its attitude,  the Chinese side would be compelled to announce unilaterally the  principles and policies for resolving the Hong Kong issue. The  reason is quite simple: Since time immemorial, Hong Kong has  been a part of China's territory, and the Chinese Government has  an absolute right to recover Hong Kong at any time. The three  unequal treaties which Britain imposed on the Chinese people  through such illegal means as armed invasion cannot have the  authority of international law. Still less will Britain be able  to continue forcibly occupying Hong Kong in the 1980's [year as  published]. Therefore, Britain's returning Hong Kong to China  is a question of respecting facts and legal principles, and is  not a so- called question of ""indulgence"" or ""kow towing.""  Chris Patten's wishful thinking of implementing the ""three  violations"" constitutional reform plan and of attempting  effectively to extend the privileges and interests of the  British colonial rule after 1997 is precisely a repetition of  Britain's past mistake of demanding to continue its colonial  rule in Hong Kong and underestimating the firm confidence and  strength of the Chinese side in safeguarding the principle of  sovereignty. His experience and knowledge is a far cry from  that of the more practical Percy Craddock!    In his article, Percy Craddock also held that ""the more we  can work out by agreement, the greater the protection. That is  what made the achievement of the Joint Declaration so  important."" Facts have precisely proved this. The signing of  the Joint Declaration has given a definite date for Britain to  hand over Hong Kong to China, has established the principles and  mechanism for close Sino-British cooperation for a smooth  transfer in 1997, and has provided sufficient protection for the  rational interests of the British side in Hong Kong during the  transitional period and after 1997. The principle of  convergence with the Basic Law, the agreements and understanding  between the two sides concerning arrangements for the elections  in 1994-95, and the memorandum of understanding on the new  airport are all beneficial to both sides. As long as the  British side abides by all agreements on Hong Kong between the  two sides, Hong Kong will benefit, and the existing and future  interests of the British side also will be well protected.    The interests of the British side can exist only within  Sino-  British agreements, and not outside them. Percy Craddock has  warned repeatedly that on the issue of Hong Kong, the  Sino-British agreements and understanding cannot be ignored, and  that the road of confrontation with the Chinese side should  never be taken. This should be said to be a rational direction  for protecting the interests of Britain. The purpose of Chris  Patten's persistence in ""three violations"" confrontation is to  turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political  entity, and to preserve the absolute influence of the British  side so as to grab illegal privileges and the interests of  colonial rule outside the Sino-British agreements. In addition,  Chris Patten's gambling with politics in Hong Kong also has a  personal political objective, but it is evident that all this  will fall through. In addition, the interests of Hong Kong, and  even those of Britain, will be damaged by Chris Patten's  confrontation activities. Is it not very clear, who -- Percy  Craddock or Chris Patten -- as personalities of British  political circles, really is responsible for the interests of  his own country?     "

0,FT941-9450 ,"FT941-9450 _AN-EBODHACPFT 940215   FT  15 FEB 94 / Workers 'losing access to decisions'      By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent   The increasingly unregulated labour market is returning to the way it was in the 19th century before trade unionism, according to a government-commissioned survey of workplace industrial relations published today. Its author - Dr Neil Millward of the Policy Studies Institute - argues the country is approaching the position where most workers lack any any means of influence in the way their workplace is run beyond their own job. The report was commissioned by the Employment Department as part of a long running inquiry into Britain's changing industrial relations. The third report in the series says: 'The recent growth in inequality in wages and earnings which has been widely observed to be greater in Britain than in almost all other developed economies is being matched by a widening in the inequalities of influence and access to key decisions about work and employment.' The study suggests the sharp decline in workplace trade unionism since 1980 (with a fall from 58 per cent to 40 per cent in membership) has not led to any spontaneous move by employers to introduce alternative forms of worker representation or joint consultation. Instead, the author argues British industry and commerce 'appear to be moving towards the situation in which non-managerial employees are treated as a 'factor of production' '. Management is growing increasingly autocratic in its wielding of unilateral power. At the same time, Dr Millward points out that no laws have been passed in Britain - unlike in 'almost all other developed economies' - to 'provide a basic floor of employment rights and minimum labour standards' for workers. The comprehensive survey covers 1,500 establishments with more than 25 employees in industry and commerce in 1990. Dr Millward found few companies were following human resource methods of management. Only 10 establishments had 'new style agreements' that included 'management control over work organisation' combined with a functioning consultative system; single status in benefits for blue and white collar workers; and 'final offer' arbitration. The survey found few companies had introduced profit sharing or share ownership schemes to strengthen the commitment of their employees. It also found human resource management techniques were more common in unionised than non-unionised enterprises. 'We could find little evidence the very substantial growth in non-unionism was accompanied by a growth in human resource management or more 'progressive' management practices,' says Millward.

The Arab  countries should reconsider their stance on Iraq based on  accurate, logical, rational, and long-term calculations to serve  the Arab nation's interests, and even the interests of the  neighboring countries that have been subjected to aggression  from the current Iraqi regime.    After more than three years since the Gulf War, which led to  the collapse of the old Arab system without bringing down the  Iraqi regime, and in view of the failure of all efforts to  establish a new system capable of assimilating Arab and  international changes, it is necessary for the Arab world to  look for other ways to bring the Iraqi regime back into the  fold. The Arab world should not leave Iraq in its isolation at  the mercy of the international forces, primarily the United  States and Britain, which seek to use the current situation for  their own interests.    What happened at the UN Security Council recently indicates  that the international alliance, which was opposed to Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait and also encouraged Saddam Husayn and  provided him with weapons and nuclear capability that made him  the bully of the Gulf, has been beset by clear rifts. These  rifts appeared in the differences among the Security Council  members over the statement that it releases periodically on the  extent of Iraq's compliance with Resolution 715 on subjecting  its military resources to international supervision, which is a  condition for lifting international sanctions.    France, Russia, and the PRC believe that there is a need to  note in the statement the ""progress"" Iraq made in destroying  banned arms instead of issuing the usual arbitrary statement on  which the United States and Britain insist, a statement that  maintains that Iraq has not complied with all the necessary  conditions to lift the sanctions. By insisting on this usual  statement the United States and Britain seek to achieve goals to  entrench the current division of the Arab world, a division that  will only increase Iranian influence and deepen suspicions and  fragmentation within the Gulf Cooperation Council itself.    The United States usually uses the stick and carrot in its  dealings, even with North Korea, but it only uses the stick with  Iraq. France and Russia believe that ""encouraging"" Iraq by  giving it time to watch its behavior and note its progress will  motivate it to cooperate in all areas, notably recognition of  the state of Kuwait.    It is strange indeed that when foreign countries are seeking  to ""normalize"" ties with Iraq, the Arab countries, which are  racing to normalize ties with Israel, find no justification to  even consider reaching a minimum level of normalization with  Iraq.

By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TOKYO      Faced with intensifying friction over trade and investment in the United  States, Japan is casting a hungry eye on Europe.    In 1992, the 12 nations of the European Community unite as a single marketplace  of 320 million consumers -- and Japanese manufacturers are determined to be in  place to share the expanding economic pie.    Yet fear of possible trade protectionism in a ""fortress Europe"" has motivated  corporate strategists here to modify their traditional drive toward exports and  acquisitions.    The approach to Europe is gentler. Rather than boldly pursuing corporate  takeovers, Japanese companies are quietly obtaining minority shareholdings in  European firms. Instead of buying the Eiffel Tower, they are securing  beachheads in friendly territory -- and moving their production base inside the  ramparts.    The new tactic was demonstrated earlier this week when one of the world's  mightiest industrial and financial conglomerates, the Mitsubishi family of  companies, announced that it is negotiating a ""cooperative relationship"" with  West Germany's giant Daimler-Benz group.    Mitsubishi officials would not comment on specific business plans. They did say  the two groups would go beyond existing ties in the auto industry to cooperate  in ""high-growth industries such as aerospace, electronics and the service  sector.""    Significantly, Mitsubishi disclaimed any intention of swapping technology in  weapons research, though both groups include the largest defense contractors in  their respective countries. That did not stop the Japanese news media from  quivering with apprehension that Americans might fear a rebirth of the World  War II Axis that aligned imperial Japan and Nazi Germany against the United  States and its allies.    But a sober examination of what is potentially at stake in the Mitsubishi-Benz  alliance clearly points toward 1992, the year the barriers will drop in the  Common Market -- and not back toward 1941, the year Japan attacked Pearl  Harbor.    Mitsubishi Motors, the third-largest Japanese car manufacturer, accounted for  207,000 of the 1.7 million cars that Japan shipped to Europe last year. The  company, which sells Mercedes Benzes through its distribution channels in  Japan, is the only major Japanese auto maker without production facilities in  the European Community.    Rivals Nissan, Honda, Isuzu and Suzuki are already producing motor vehicles in  Europe, echoing the trend toward production in the United States. Nissan built  76,976 cars in Britain last year and 86,181 in Spain. Toyota is building a  plant in Britain that will have the capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year.    Mitsubishi officials say they are studying the possibility of investing in an  auto plant in East Germany.    Mitsubishi Electric, another core company in the group, whose top executives  were involved in negotiations with Daimler-Benz officials in Singapore last  weekend, is building a semiconductor plant in Alsdorf, West Germany, that will  make 4-megabit DRAM memory chips.    It follows Fujitsu and NEC, chip makers with plants in Britain. Hitachi is  looking at Munich.    Over the past several years there has been a phenomenal surge of Japanese  investment in Europe -- more than 300 Japanese companies have set up plants.  Cumulative Japanese direct investment in the EC as of last March 31 was more  than $35 billion, nearly a third of it in Britain.    The pace of the capital infusion has quickened dramatically: In the six-month  period that ended last Sept. 30, Japan invested $7.3 billion in the EC, nearly  double the amount in the same period in 1988. One dollar of every $4 Japan  invests overseas now goes to Europe, while America's share is declining.    The boom in European investment is no accident. A company that manufactures  goods in one of the EC nations will apparently enjoy the free-trade atmosphere  of post-1992 Europe, no matter what kind of protectionist barriers might be  thrown up against Japanese imports.    ""Japanese are very concerned about the possibility of a fortress Europe  developing,"" said Peter Morgan, senior economist for the Barclays de Zoete Wedd  investment bank in Tokyo. ""They're looking for a way to be inside.""    Particularly, auto makers are attempting to make peace with their European  competitors in order to assuage fears that Japan might try to dominate the  industry once import quotas are relaxed.    ""They're trying to develop cooperative ties -- as opposed to adversarial  relationships -- with European car manufacturers,"" Morgan said.    Ultimately, however, the bottom line for the Japanese firms may continue to  reflect a fixation on market share, whether the goods are made locally in  Europe or imported from Japan.    ""The Japanese are approaching Europe with market share in mind,"" Morgan said.  ""They don't know exactly who they're going to displace, but they're going to  displace somebody.""    A fierce debate is now raging in the EC over how to define a Japanese car and  how to deal with imports when the time comes. Five of the EC's 12 countries now  impose some sort of quota or market restriction on auto imports from Japan, but  this practice will become illegal after national markets are merged. The EC  Commission has proposed phasing out the quotas over a period of several years.    France and Italy are leading the fight to keep the quotas in place as long as  possible and to include locally produced Japanese cars in the total.

By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TOKYO      Faced with intensifying friction over trade and investment in the United  States, Japan is casting a hungry eye on Europe.    In 1992, the 12 nations of the European Community unite as a single marketplace  of 320 million consumers -- and Japanese manufacturers are determined to be in  place to share the expanding economic pie.    Yet fear of possible trade protectionism in a ""fortress Europe"" has motivated  corporate strategists here to modify their traditional drive toward exports and  acquisitions.    The approach to Europe is gentler. Rather than boldly pursuing corporate  takeovers, Japanese companies are quietly obtaining minority shareholdings in  European firms. Instead of buying the Eiffel Tower, they are securing  beachheads in friendly territory -- and moving their production base inside the  ramparts.    The new tactic was demonstrated earlier this week when one of the world's  mightiest industrial and financial conglomerates, the Mitsubishi family of  companies, announced that it is negotiating a ""cooperative relationship"" with  West Germany's giant Daimler-Benz group.    Mitsubishi officials would not comment on specific business plans. They did say  the two groups would go beyond existing ties in the auto industry to cooperate  in ""high-growth industries such as aerospace, electronics and the service  sector.""    Significantly, Mitsubishi disclaimed any intention of swapping technology in  weapons research, though both groups include the largest defense contractors in  their respective countries. That did not stop the Japanese news media from  quivering with apprehension that Americans might fear a rebirth of the World  War II Axis that aligned imperial Japan and Nazi Germany against the United  States and its allies.    But a sober examination of what is potentially at stake in the Mitsubishi-Benz  alliance clearly points toward 1992, the year the barriers will drop in the  Common Market -- and not back toward 1941, the year Japan attacked Pearl  Harbor.    Mitsubishi Motors, the third-largest Japanese car manufacturer, accounted for  207,000 of the 1.7 million cars that Japan shipped to Europe last year. The  company, which sells Mercedes Benzes through its distribution channels in  Japan, is the only major Japanese auto maker without production facilities in  the European Community.    Rivals Nissan, Honda, Isuzu and Suzuki are already producing motor vehicles in  Europe, echoing the trend toward production in the United States. Nissan built  76,976 cars in Britain last year and 86,181 in Spain. Toyota is building a  plant in Britain that will have the capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year.    Mitsubishi officials say they are studying the possibility of investing in an  auto plant in East Germany.    Mitsubishi Electric, another core company in the group, whose top executives  were involved in negotiations with Daimler-Benz officials in Singapore last  weekend, is building a semiconductor plant in Alsdorf, West Germany, that will  make 4-megabit DRAM memory chips.    It follows Fujitsu and NEC, chip makers with plants in Britain. Hitachi is  looking at Munich.    Over the past several years there has been a phenomenal surge of Japanese  investment in Europe -- more than 300 Japanese companies have set up plants.  Cumulative Japanese direct investment in the EC as of last March 31 was more  than $35 billion, nearly a third of it in Britain.    The pace of the capital infusion has quickened dramatically: In the six-month  period that ended last Sept. 30, Japan invested $7.3 billion in the EC, nearly  double the amount in the same period in 1988. One dollar of every $4 Japan  invests overseas now goes to Europe, while America's share is declining.    The boom in European investment is no accident. A company that manufactures  goods in one of the EC nations will apparently enjoy the free-trade atmosphere  of post-1992 Europe, no matter what kind of protectionist barriers might be  thrown up against Japanese imports.    ""Japanese are very concerned about the possibility of a fortress Europe  developing,"" said Peter Morgan, senior economist for the Barclays de Zoete Wedd  investment bank in Tokyo. ""They're looking for a way to be inside.""    Particularly, auto makers are attempting to make peace with their European  competitors in order to assuage fears that Japan might try to dominate the  industry once import quotas are relaxed.    ""They're trying to develop cooperative ties -- as opposed to adversarial  relationships -- with European car manufacturers,"" Morgan said.    Ultimately, however, the bottom line for the Japanese firms may continue to  reflect a fixation on market share, whether the goods are made locally in  Europe or imported from Japan.    ""The Japanese are approaching Europe with market share in mind,"" Morgan said.  ""They don't know exactly who they're going to displace, but they're going to  displace somebody.""    A fierce debate is now raging in the EC over how to define a Japanese car and  how to deal with imports when the time comes. Five of the EC's 12 countries now  impose some sort of quota or market restriction on auto imports from Japan, but  this practice will become illegal after national markets are merged. The EC  Commission has proposed phasing out the quotas over a period of several years.    France and Italy are leading the fight to keep the quotas in place as long as  possible and to include locally produced Japanese cars in the total. Britain  and West Germany advocate a completely liberalized auto market.    ""Our group welcomes Japanese manufacturers entering Europe,"" Edzard Reuter, the  Daimler-Benz AG chairman, told the newspaper Nihon Keizai late last year.

0,FT911-4571 ,"FT911-4571 _AN-BDRBUAGGFT 910418   FT  18 APR 91 / Leading Article: A risk worth taking   THE decision by the US, Britain and France to send troops to northern Iraq to ensure the safety of hundreds of thousands of Kurds has been taken to prevent a human disaster of horrifying proportions. These people, who have been stranded on the Iraqi border in appalling conditions, have preferred to risk starvation and death in the icy mountains rather than face the wrath of President Saddam Hussein's forces by returning home. The only way to save them is to persuade them to come down from the mountains and that they will only do if their security is guaranteed. Mr John Major, the prime minister, must be given the credit for mobilising not only his European partners, but ultimately a clearly reluctant US president, in support of at least the main elements of his safe havens plan. However, Mr George Bush's initial reservations about the original British proposals were entirely understandable. The suggestion that the fleeing Kurds should return to their home towns and villages under the military protection of allied forces or the UN over a very substantial area of Iraq, could be seen as the first step towards the creation of an autonomous Kurdish region. Worst of all, it risked directly involving the US and Britain in Iraq's internal affairs for years to come and thus provoking the hostility of most of the Arab world, including the coalition partners in the Gulf conflict. Military involvement Though the plan that was finally adopted is still full of hazards, the risk of permanent military and political involvement by the US, Britain and France in the domestic affairs of Iraq has been reduced. The forces which will be sent to safeguard some five to six refugee camps in northern Iraq will be relatively limited. The US is sending 5,000 to 10,000 troops and Britain some 2,000. Both Mr Bush and Mr Major have stressed the intended temporary nature of the operation - perhaps two to three months - and their desire to hand over responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Kurds to the UN as soon as possible. They have once again emphasised that it was not US or British policy to break up Iraq into separate states or to get involved in internal political quarrels, but only to deal with an urgent humanitarian need. It is right that these good intentions should be underlined publicly. But it is equally necessary squarely to face the dangers inherent in the joint military action. Though Washington and London sound confident that the Iraqis, while denouncing the allies for intervening in their internal affairs, will in practice do nothing to hamper it, that cannot be taken as a foregone conclusion. Even an isolated shooting incident, either between Iraqi and allied troops, or between Iraqi and Kurdish rebel forces, runs the risk of reigniting a conflict which most people thought had come to an end with Baghdad's acceptance of the coalition's tough ceasefire terms. Legal authority Neither is it possible to ignore the fact that the decision to send troops to northern Iraq has been taken by the three governments in question without the specific sanction of the UN, which provided the anti-Iraq coalition with its much-vaunted stamp of legitimacy throughout the Gulf conflict. The claim by the US and Britain that Resolution 688 gives them the necessary legal authority for their move is controversial, to say the least, and is unlikely to convince either China or the Soviet Union, both permanent members of the Security Council. The UN itself, which reported yesterday that it had reached agreement with Baghdad to set up 'humanitarian centres' in northern Iraq, said its initiative could be undermined by the trilateral action. No one should thus be under any illusion about the political risks of a humane move which cannot in any case provide more than a very short-term answer to the Kurds' plight. The problem of their long-term security and identity will remain as acute as always after they have been fed and cared for and the allied troops have returned home. Over this matter, the coalition partners can exercise only the most modest influence.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "
0,FT923-1417 ,"FT923-1417 _AN-CIWCOABZFT 920923   FT  23 SEP 92 / Moratorium agreed on nuclear dumping      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   NEGOTIATIONS on a new international treaty to curb sea pollution finally ended yesterday in Paris with an agreement for a 15-year moratorium on dumping radioactive waste. The Convention on Marine Pollution will be signed later this week by the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic, which had been sharply divided until late on Monday night over the radioactivity issue. Britain and France, which need to decommission old nuclear submarines and power stations in the next two decades, retain the right to dump low and intermediate radioactive waste in the sea after 2007. But they must continue to study land-based alternatives and report the results every two years from 1997 to the other signatories - Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. After 15 years, Britain and France would still not be able dump radioactive waste without discussing it with other signatories and producing studies assessing the potential harm to people and marine life. The Department of the Environment said yesterday: 'There is not yet any proven land-based alternative and it may be that disposal at sea will represent the best environmental practice.' The alternatives of demolition and storage might also present health risks, it had commented earlier. A solution to the impasse on Monday, when Finland, Iceland and Spain were set on a permanent ban, came when the UK agreed to extend its original offer of a 10-year ban to 15 years. Mr Bob Edwards of Greenpeace France, the environment pressure group, said: 'In the end the UK and France made the right decision, although we still think they should have accepted a permanent ban.' The rest of the treaty, which has been overshadowed by the nuclear issue, includes commitments to reduce discharges of other toxic substances and heavy metals, with the aim of eventually eliminating some of them. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'The convention has shown some limited progress, but I am alarmed that there are no timescales agreed for the reduction of polluting materials.'

0,FT941-15141 ,"FT941-15141 _AN-EAQCKACSFT 940117   FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Games duopoly   Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers have captured the hearts and minds of children throughout the world. But, at a cost of anything up to Pounds 60 a time in the UK, video games are anything but cheap. Hence, last week's decision by Britain's Office of Fair Trading to refer the industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. There is a strong prima facie case that prices are artificially high because of insufficient competition. Sega and Nintendo, the two Japanese companies which dominate the Pounds 9bn-a-year global market, have a combined market share of over 90 per cent. They have used this duopoly power to earn fat profit margins. The duopoly's dominance is not confined to hardware. It embraces software too, as anybody wishing to produce games to use in Sega's and Nintendo's machines must first reach a licensing arrangement with the companies. A further concern in the UK has been that video games are roughly 30 per cent more expensive than in the US. This is partly because retailers' margins and indirect taxes are higher in Britain. But it is also possible that Sega and Nintendo are charging higher wholesale prices than in the US. Their use of different technical standards on either side of the Atlantic suggests that they may be segmenting the market in order to discriminate on prices. But even if the Monopolies Commission finds that the duopoly operates against the public interest, it will face a tricky task deciding what to do. One option would be to impose price controls. But such heavy-handed action would prevent competition developing. Another option would be to attack the licensing arrangements which enable Sega and Nintendo to extend their dominance in hardware to software. Such an approach would complement legal moves in the US and Britain by rival software producers which wish to sell their games direct to customers without paying royalties to the duopoly. The snag here is that licensing arrangements are often global in scope, so action by the UK alone could have only limited impact. Many software suppliers might not wish to compete aggressively with Sega and Nintendo in Britain if they were still tied to them in other markets. The final option is to do nothing and allow market forces and technological advances to undermine Sega's and Nintendo's dominance. That may seem a cop-out. But given that Sony and Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics giants, have been tempted into the market by its high margins, inaction may not be such a bad idea.

0,FT943-3659 ,"FT943-3659 _AN-EIMDOADXFT 940913   FT  13 SEP 94 / Personal View: How to flatten the cycle's ups and downs      By TONY BLAIR   We are barely out of the last recession and already the economic brakes are being applied. Businesses and households across Britain have good reason to feel worried. But these concerns will go beyond the extra burden yesterday's rate rise will place on family and investment budgets on top of this year's tax increases. More fundamental still is what the increase reveals about the long-term weaknesses of the British economy. It is here that the real political debate will be joined, not over whether each rise is in itself justified. The fact is that the government has failed to create the conditions necessary for sustained growth without accelerating inflation. These conditions are a strong and dynamic economic base, with the industrial capacity and skilled workforce necessary to cope with rising demand. Without them, slow growth, rising insecurity at work, high unemployment and increased social decay will persist. Of course, it is a matter of acute economic judgment whether yesterday's increase was necessary now in order to choke off inflationary pressures or could have been postponed until later. Recent economic statistics tell conflicting stories - weaknesses in the housing market but rising retail sales; stable retail price inflation but accelerating producer prices. What is clear, however, is that the Treasury and Bank of England, on the basis of published statistics and privileged information available to them, believe that rising inflationary pressures justify action now to slow the recovery. But why is inflation threatening to derail economic growth at such an early stage of the recovery? When Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, raised US interest rates at the beginning of this year, the US economy had been growing for three years and output had risen by 10 per cent. UK rates, already higher than in the US, Japan and Germany, have been forced up only two years from the bottom of the recession with output up just 5 per cent. Part of the problem is credibility. It must be worrying for the government that it has made so little progress over the past two years in persuading the public and the financial markets that it can keep inflation under control. The implied City forecast in the index-linked bond market is an inflation rate of more than 5 per cent by the end of the decade, a long way from the government's pledge of 2.5 per cent by the end of the current parliament. But the reason for this lack of credibility goes to the heart of Labour's critique of the Conservatives' economic mismanagement over the past 15 years. For the reason why neither the financial markets nor the Bank of England believe that the government will meet its inflation objectives is not simply that it has failed before, but that it continues to treat inflation as the disease, not the symptom, of a deeper economic malaise in the British economy. In short, the government's lack of credibility is not simply a question of competence but of analysis and understanding. For the root cause of Britain's economic failures is that our economic base is too small and backward to deliver the employment opportunities and sustained, non-inflationary growth we need - too few successful firms, not enough skilled workers, too little research into the development and use of new technologies. Tackling inflation is not simply about prudent monetary policy, important though that is. Instead, economic policymakers in Britain need to tackle what CBI director-general Howard Davies recently identified as 'crucial structural weakness' in the British economy - the deficiencies which mean we have high unemployment alongside rising skill shortages, and a recovery starved of new investment. What Britain needs is a modern industrial policy to build up our economic base - to encourage more long-term investment in industry, support small businesses and encourage the use of private finance in public infrastructure projects. It needs a tax system which encourages investment rather than tax evasion and promotes employment rather than unfairness. And it needs to boost the education and skills of British workers. Only then will the UK economy be able to deliver rising living standards and employment growth without running into an inflationary mire. No government can avoid completely the ups and downs of the business cycle. Our aim must be to minimise them and provide the conditions for stability and growth which will make stop-go economics a thing of the past and remove the spectre which now haunts this recovery.

0,FT924-14035 ,"FT924-14035 _AN-CJMCIAARFT 921013   FT  13 OCT 92 / Bundestag plans tighter control of EC issues      By QUENTIN PEEL      BONN   GERMANY'S main political parties are expected to reach agreement this week on an important constitutional amendment, giving the German parliament far more power to influence legislation in the European Community. The plan, drafted by constitutional experts from the Christian Democrats and Free Democrats, from the government side, and from the opposition Social Democrats, would set up a form of EC oversight committee, along the lines already operated in Britain and Denmark. The new deal is likely to make Germany a less flexible negotiating partner, just as Denmark and Britain already are, because of their parliamentary control systems. The German plan would require the government to submit all proposed EC legislation to the committee, before it comes up for negotiation in the Council of Ministers, and then to take account of the parliamentary opinion in its subsequent negotiations. It amounts to the first time that the German Bundestag - the directly elected lower house of parliament - has insisted on real powers to oversee and influence law-making in Brussels. Until now, the EC committee of the Bundestag has been little more than a rubber stamp for the negotiations of the German government. Bonn has virtually agreed to similar powers for the 16 federal states in the Bundesrat, the upper house. German parliamentarians defend the proposed enhancement of their powers as an essential element of greater democratic control over Brussels - a demand sparked off by the current debate over the Maastricht treaty on European union. The Bundestag is likely to make the constitutional amendment a precondition for ratification of the treaty. They also say that its aim is to make the EC more democratic, and more integrated, rather than to resist the integration process. However, they admit that it will depend very much on how such a powerful committee operates. The plan won the backing yesterday of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union Bundestag leadership, and is expected to be approved by the full constitutional committee on Thursday. A simple constitutional amendment will be complemented by an accompanying law spelling out the details, requiring the German government to provide comprehensive information to the planned committee on every item of legislation, including an explanation of its purpose, of the government negotiating plans, and of the positions of other member states.

Today Britain takes over as president of the Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page pull-out FT writers assess the prospects THE REAL trouble for the British government may start the day after its EC presidency ends. On January 1, 1993, it is a fair bet that some publicity-seeking federalists  -possibly led by a posse of continental European MEPs - will try to enter the country without passports. If they are stopped at immigration, that could mark the beginning of a long and potentially embarrassing legal challenge to Britain's refusal to lift border-checks on people - just two weeks after an Edinburgh summit at which Mr John Major is certain to proclaim the European market open for business. Britain's position is simple. It says the 1986 Single European Act does not oblige the UK to lift its border controls on non-EC citizens. Consequently, it must maintain at least enough checks to ensure that unwanted non-Community travellers do not slip through the EC passport lane at sea and airports. The European Commission maintains that the Act requires an end to all controls from next January 1, and believes the European Court would uphold that opinion. To the great irritation of the Commission, that difference of opinion has been easily finessed by politicians and journalists into a simmering row between Brussels and Britain, spiced with the emotive issues of compulsory identity cards (essential if controls are dropped, the sceptics claim) and illegal immigration. In fact, the position is more subtle. Broadly speaking, all continental members except Denmark - the members and associate members of the 1990 Schengen free travel zone - back the Commission's legal interpretation. But most are worried it will be impractical and imprudent to lift border controls at the beginning of the year unless certain 'compensating measures' are introduced. They would include a database linking customs, tax and immigration authorities, a convention on asylum (signed but not yet ratified by all member states), and a convention aimed at strengthening external frontiers. This last measure would be the easiest way of encouraging national immigration authorities to trust one another, but signing has been held up for more than a year by the Anglo-Spanish dispute over Gibraltar. Denmark and Ireland are in a slightly different situation. Denmark disputes the Commission's interpretation and intends to maintain controls, but it might eventually be persuaded to drop them if sufficient safeguards were brought in. Ireland is worried that if it joins the Schengen bloc, Britain will reinstate passport checks for Irish travellers, 70 per cent of whom pass through the UK. In May, when the Commission published its hardline interpretation of the Single European Act, it looked as though the dispute was bound to end in tears. But since then, the Danes have voted down Maastricht - partly, it is said, because of worries about open borders - and the atmosphere has changed. Three weeks ago in Lisbon, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, told fellow interior ministers they should not underestimate the all-party opposition to lifting border controls in the UK. With ratification of Maastricht uppermost in governments' minds, that warning seems to have had an impact, and a full-scale confrontation now seems unlikely. More likely is a postponement of the January 1 deadline - the Commission prefers to say that 'the clock will be stopped' - while concerted efforts are made to bring in the compensating measures. It is at that point that the boatload of passport-less federalists comes in. But short of instructing immigration officers to wave through any litigious MEPs on New Year's Day, British officials admit there is not much they can do about that.

The market may have seen the biggest one-day fall since the June 1989 Tiananmen killings, but the talk of the town was of politics, perfidious Albion and the strange ways of China. Hong Kong may be a British colony but it is emphatically a Chinese city. The result of Governor Chris Patten's proposals has been to divide Hong Kong society. That division has produced strong reactions among a people adverse to venting their anger, especially in public. At what would normally have been a sedate business lunch yesterday, one senior Chinese executive of a large Hong Kong property company lost control, to general astonishment. He said the people of Hong Kong had taken so much flak from Britain and China over the past 14 years. 'What does he think he is doing now with so little time to go? China is changing; it has embraced the market economy; it wants its people to get rich; Hong Kong can play a key role in that. All we want is a quiet life.' On the streets of Central, the main business, retail and tourist district on Hong Kong island, Hong Kong Chinese vented their dismay and anger, but not all oppose the governor's stand. An assistant hotel manager declared himself for Mr Patten. 'I support Patten's proposals because I think Hong Kong people should have the freedom to decide what they want. That there are more protests now shows people are beginning to know better what sort of society Hong Kong is and recognise what their needs are. 'I think business people might not want changes because they do not want what they are enjoying to be taken away. They are considering their own interests.' Ms Ella Kwok, a nurse, is also a strong supporter of the governor. An investor in the stock market, who has seen more than a fifth of the value of her shares wiped out in three weeks, she believes China is to blame. 'They should not say things like the statements made concerning the container terminal and the airport contract. I think the governor is doing everything for Hong Kong people's long-term interests. 'If one side has to back down, I hope it is not the governor. 'He has more guts than the other governors before him. I hope he can stand firm.' The worsening relations between Britain and China has stirred anti-British sentiment within Hong Kong - something never far from the surface. Among some people, China's staunch opposition to the governor is seen as repaying the indignity of colonialism. 'I think China is right,' said one secretary. 'The British have lived well in Hong Kong for a long time and they need to be put in their place.' One hears echoes of these sentiments on the streets. Ms Chow, an office administrator, is in no doubt about Mr Patten. 'I do not like Patten or what he is doing. I think he is making Hong Kong a mess,' she said. 'He is doing everything for himself. It is naive to believe that Britain has Hong Kong people's interest at heart; they enjoy the notion of doling out democracy. If we have to suffer, it is preferable to being ruled by the hypocritical British.' A civil servant who gave his name as Mr Ho said the governor had gone too far and should back down. 'When he deals with China, he should go one step at a time,' he said. 'Hong Kong is still not used to his way of doing things. I do not think China wants to do this but is forced to.' Throughout the day, however, the overwhelming call was for Britain and China to sit down and talk. This view was given expression by a housewife who said: 'The two sides should sit down calmly and talk about what is good for Hong Kong, what is good for its economy. They should look at the agreements again or find a middle way to solve the problem.' She also made the saddest observation on the fall-out from the controversy. 'I have lost confidence that Hong Kong will change for the better.' Additional reporting by Karen Tang.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

But I was also heartened to learn that 39 per cent of British respondents thought the present very close political links between EU member states should 'remain unchanged'; of those 40 per cent, a majority thought they should be even closer. German opinion is very similar. The respondents' demand for a referendum on a single currency stands at 64 per cent in Britain, and 1 percentage point higher in Germany, which did not surprise me. On the great majority of important subjects, proposing a referendum is invariably popular. The hard fact remains that some issues lend themselves better than others to the kind of 'yes' or 'no' decision-making, which is all that a referendum can offer. There is clearly no way of forcing the electorates to concentrate on the issue at hand. The September 1992 Maastricht referendum result in France was, for instance, above all a reflection of the low standing of the government of the day. In Ireland the treaty was widely thought to mean abortion on demand would be introduced as of right. I hesitate to be pedantic, but note that the exact form of the question in your survey relates to a referendum on whether the EU should introduce a single currency. The question for us is rather: should Britain remain outside a single currency were the EU to go ahead with the commitment (contained in the Maastricht treaty) to introduce the single currency by 1999 at the latest? This is a clear pointer to the prodigious difficulty of formulating questions not only in referendums but in opinion polls. There was one thing in your report that took me aback. I had always assumed the German public to be well-informed. You have put me right. The 57 per cent in Brandenburg who know the Commission is based in Brussels get a pat on the head for their 'above-average' performance. I will draw a veil over the 38 per cent in the East Midlands who got it right. It depressed me but I was not very surprised. As Goethe put it, against stupidity the gods themselves strive in vain.

0,FT944-1761 ,"FT944-1761 _AN-ELSDLABCFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / Figures on minimum wages and jobs released      By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor   Most leading market economies with national minimum wage laws achieved higher employment growth rates than Britain in the past 14 years, the Department of Employment has admitted. The official government figures show that between 1980 and 1990 employment grew 25.4 per cent in Australia, 18.4 per cent in the US, 12.9 per cent in Japan and 7.3 per cent in Spain. This compares with 1.5 per cent in the UK. The figures were provided in a parliamentary answer by the department to Mr Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham. Between 1990 and 1993, while there was a small net increase of 1.2 per cent in the US employment growth rate and falls of 2.6 per cent in Australia and 5.9 per cent in Spain, there was a net decline of 4.6 per cent in Britain. The employment department statistics appear to conflict with the government's fundamental belief that the existence of national minimum wage laws lead to job losses. Mr MacShane said yesterday: 'No minister in the future should have the cheek to stand up and tell the lie to the House of Commons that a legal minimum wage is a job killer.' He added, however, that while a legal minimum wage did not cost jobs, it would do so if it was set at 'an absurdly high level close to national average earnings'. The Labour party is discussing what figure should be set for a national minimum wage. Many union leaders believe it should be about Pounds 4 an hour while a number of senior Labour MPs say that it should be closer to Pounds 3 an hour. Mr MacShane said: 'The Tories think that their claim that a national minimum wage in Britain would cost jobs is, in the words of their deputy chairman Mr John Maples, a killer fact to be used against the Labour party. Now the government's own figures show ministers have been lying.' The employment department figures come as an embarrassment to Mr John Major and his senior cabinet colleagues, who have continued to say in recent weeks that the Labour party's general commitment to the introduction of a national minimum wage would destroy employment in Britain. Mr MacShane said last night: 'If other countries which have more dynamic economies and better job creation records than the UK can have a national minimum wage, it is high time that British workers enjoy one too.'

Gemini aims to be the first of a new generation of large, eight-metre diameter mirror telescopes needed to take infra-red astronomy into the next millennium. Two telescopes are required to scan the entire sky and the proposed sites are at Mauna Kea on Hawaii and Cerro Tololo in Chile. Both telescopes should be operational by 2000. Half of the Dollars 176m (Pounds 89m) in funding for Gemini has been contributed by the US, 25 per cent by Britain and 15 per cent by Canada, leaving 10 per cent to be found. Chile has sent a letter of intent offering another 5 per cent, but the remainder still needs to be raised. While several countries have expressed interest none has so far committed. In view of previous successful joint ventures, a formal invitation has been issued to Australia which is still deliberating over whether to accept. Even if no new parties come forward, the project could be rescued by the weak dollar - a suggestion proposed by Lawrence Randall, Gemini's project manager. As the project is budgeted in US dollars, Canada and Britain between them would have sufficient funds to buy the remaining share simply by taking advantage of the relative strength of their currencies. However, Geoffrey Moore, head of public relations at Britain's Science and Engineering Research Council, said: 'We are confident that another country will take up the shortfall. If we did take advantage of the exchange rates we would have to bear the cost if future rates became unfavourable and we cannot take that risk.' The new telescopes will have four times more light-collecting capacity than their predecessors so that known objects can be surveyed in a quarter of the time and new, fainter objects become visible. The viewing range has been considerably increased, extending from ultraviolet through visible to infra-red light at wavelengths well beyond those used previously. Also, the mirror arrangement within the Gemini telescopes allows larger measuring instruments to be installed.  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "

0,FT942-2385 ,"FT942-2385 _AN-EFTD4AB7FT 940620   FT  20 JUN 94 / Tories back away from EU funds row      By DAVID OWEN   Conservative Euro-sceptics are preparing to back away from confrontation over a bill increasing Britain's contribution to the European Union's budget for fear that renewed wrangling could smooth Labour's path to government. But ministers may be unable to exploit the situation to secure Commons approval for the measure before MPs begin the summer recess next month, as they had originally intended. This is because the bill remains blocked in the EU Council of Ministers. Meanwhile, in an indication that the government still faces a struggle to get its way on some European issues, Tory rightwingers yesterday intensified their calls for Britain to veto the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, as president of the European Commission. The calls were led by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who said Britain should reject the nomination of Mr Dehaene and threaten to veto it. Earlier this month, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, hinted that the government was not prepared to veto Mr Dehaene's appointment if its preferred candidate - Sir Leon Brittan - did not gain enough support among other EU states. Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday played down the prospects of a Maastricht-style rebellion over the bill giving force to changes in the European Union's funding system. They warned of a 'sea-change' in attitudes brought about by growing concern in Conservative ranks that Labour was making itself 'electable'. But Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Euro-sceptic, made it clear that he would oppose the bill, which will lift Britain's contribution to the EU budget in line with the agreement reached at Edinburgh in December 1992. Sir Teddy, the MP for Southend East, said he found the idea of passing a bill to give the EU more money 'literally unbelievable'. According to the Treasury, Britain's net payments to the EU are set to more than double to Pounds 2.8bn in the year beginning April 1995 from Pounds 1.3bn in 1994-95. The government said last month that the bill was being blocked by Italy in the Council of Ministers, making it increasingly unlikely that it can be presented to MPs before the Commons summer recess starts next month. If ministers are unable to introduce the measure until the autumn, it will raise the prospect that next year's legislative timetable will have a pronounced European flavour, which would be unwelcome to the government. A bill to permit the enlargement of the EU is also expected to be included in the timetable.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT924-10200 ,"FT924-10200 _AN-CKBCIAABFT 921102   FT  02 NOV 92 / Tory Euro-rebels snub ministers' appeals      By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent   MR JOHN MAJOR was braced for two days of frantic campaigning yesterday after forecasts from Tory Euro-sceptics and independent bodies found some 35 rebels still pledged to oppose him or abstain in Wednesday's Maastricht debate. The findings underlined the uncertainty of the outcome in what is increasingly being seen as a crucial test of the prime minister's credibility and his ability to command party respect. Several loyalist Tory MPs have publicly expressed broad agreement with Labour that Mr Major's authority would be critically damaged if he loses the debate - even if the government goes on to win a confidence vote. If all 35 potential rebels vote against the motion, Mr Major would face the real possibility of defeat. However, it would only need a few rebels to abstain for the government to win by a narrow margin. After a weekend of frenetic behind-the-scenes activity by government whips, the crisis atmosphere was fuelled yesterday by dire warnings from cabinet ministers and a ferocious row over tactics between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Early yesterday, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, used an interview with TV-am to insist that Conservative MPs would be 'playing with fire' if they put the government at risk. His message was repeated by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary. In a clear warning to the rebels, he said: 'If they think the government can just be defeated on Wednesday and everything will just settle down the following day  -it won't' Meanwhile, Labour was raising the pressure on the Liberal Democrats by warning that their support for the government would rebound when public expenditure cuts are announced next week. In a statement, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, warned that voters would not forgive the Liberal Democrats if they 'propped up' the prime minister. 'If he wins next week's vote, John Major will have a mandate to go ahead with the public spending cuts which he denied would be made,' she said. The charge drew a furious retort from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who described Labour's decision to oppose the Maastricht motion as 'a tawdry deceit'. Claiming the Liberal Democrats were putting the interests of the nation first, he argued that if the government was defeated it would immediately win in a confidence motion. 'So we would be left with the worst of all possible worlds - no general election and no future for Britain in Europe either,' he said. The idea of Britain working in collaboration with Europe was the main message of Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as both attempted yesterday to stress the importance of ratification for the economy. In an article in the News of the World, the prime minister claimed that Community membership had brought 'a tidal wave of job-creating foreign investment', adding that it would be a disastrous mistake for Britain to walk away from it. Leading Tory Euro-sceptics, however, were confident there was no erosion of their support. Mr James Cran, an unofficial 'whip' for the rebels, said that 37 MPs remained ready to oppose the government's motion. 'They have been subject to a lot of pressure in their constituencies and elsewhere, but they are not prepared to move,' he said. A BBC poll of 70 possible rebels found that 36 MPs are ready to oppose or abstain.

0,FT923-739 ,"FT923-739 _AN-CI0ADAC2FT 920926   FT  26 SEP 92 / Life outside the premier league: Britain's prospects in a two-speed Europe      By DAVID MARSH   We must build a United States of Europe. Only in this way will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living.' That was the vision of Winston Churchill, expounded in September 1946 in a celebrated speech in Zurich. He made clear at the end of the address that, whatever this European union might be, Britain itself would not take part. It would remain grandly on the flank, along with the US and the Soviet Union, among the 'friends and sponsors of the new Europe'. This week, the UK is once again facing up to the prospect that European integration could forge ahead without British participation. This time, however, if Germany and France went forward with political and monetary union among a small 'hard core', Britain's outside position would be a great deal more uncomfortable than that envisaged by Churchill. Instead of sharing the 'joys and hopes' of the champions, Britain could well be toiling in the second division - a somewhat shabby, soft-currency cousin ploughing a low productivity furrow ever further away from the EC centre. Britain's economic output per head has already fallen by about 20 per cent compared with the 12-nation EC average during the last 30 years. Now the long, slow decline looks likely to continue. Is this view a caricature? Not according to Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, one of the few UK companies in this sector successfully to have steamed through the shocks of the recession. 'We'd better get started pretty damn quick. Otherwise we'll be a third-world nation next to a first-rate European economy.' Mr Garrick calls on the government to use the current phase of policy reappraisal to give more support to manufacturing industry - not through 'interference' but through practical measures such as help in export credits or research and development. 'If we keep on like this we will not be in the slow lane of Europe. We'll be stationary - on the east European fringes.' Mr Garrick says his company managed to 'compete with the Germans' with sterling pegged at the former central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95. Although Weir has been given a competitive boost by sterling's devaluation, Mr Garrick believes UK inflation could, before long, be 'out of step' with inflation rates in the rest of Europe. Almost inevitably, British people will become poorer compared with the French and the Germans, Mr Garrick says. 'Successful economies see their currencies becoming worth more, not less. And they sit at the top of the pile in terms of spending power.' A slightly less gloomy view comes from Mr Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University, who has given consistently accurate forecasts of the depth of the recession. Although Mr Godley says he remains very pessimistic about the outlook for real recovery, he believes sterling's devaluation will put Britain in the fast lane of European growth in the next few years. This is because 'the whole of Europe is locked into depression' as a result of the strictures of the exchange rate mechanism. 'We are clearly better off than we were a fortnight ago. One of the lunacies of the last year or two was when people said that a devaluation would lead to higher interest rates. That was absolutely wrong.' Consumers, house-owners and anyone involved in small business will benefit, Mr Godley predicts. Lower interest rates 'will stop a lot of suicides. A large number of people were in real trouble. And it will lower unemployment. This will tend to make Britain a happier place.' Longer term, there are clearly worries about whether British consumers and industrialists will profit if the UK remains outside the mainstream of Europe. Mr Graham Mather, head of the European Policy Forum, a pro-European think-tank, sees some appeal in Britain's position as a cheap and relatively unregulated manufacturing base serving the European core. 'Making Britain the Hong Kong of Europe could be a viable strategy. I can imagine Lord Young (the former industry secretary) selling it, seizing on the idea of 'free port Britain'. But somehow I don't sense the mood that our business leaders want to do this.' However powerful a formal European currency bloc might eventually become, employees in British banks and financial services could benefit if Britain remains outside. After sterling's ignominious withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism, the City's idea that London could play host to the European central bank is no more than a pipe dream. But, says Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Finance in London, 'there would be a competitive advantage in trading the money and instruments of the core group without being subject to the same restrictions'. Two parts of the economy which stand to prosper if sterling remains on the 'soft' monetary periphery are tourism and retailing. Mr Michael Herbert, chief executive of the Tussauds group - part of the Pearson concern which publishes the FT - expects increased numbers of foreign visitors to the group's tourist attractions. He reacts strongly to the notion that Britain is set to become a sort of a weak-currency tourist supermarket. 'Tourism tends to be regarded as a poor sort of industry, when in fact it's one of Britain's most thriving sectors.' British Aerospace used to be the biggest employer in the area around Kingston-upon-Thames, he says, whereas now it is the group's Chessington World of Adventures theme park. 'I don't see swapping heavy industry for service industry is a bad thing.' The Harrods department store also sees a silver lining in the monetary fall-out. 'Harrods has always been integrated with Europe,' says Mr Michael Cole, Harrods' main press spokesman. The store's 700 tills at present accept only sterling and dollars. 'But if the customers want us to take D-Marks, we will take them.' With 15 per cent of Harrods' merchandise bought from France, and 11 per cent from Italy, Chianti is likely to fall in price relative to Bordeaux, he says  -and there are even prospects for cheaper pasta in the food hall. Harrods' sales on Thursday were up 15 per cent compared with the same day last year. About 60 per cent of Harrods' clientele come from the 'tiara triangle' within three miles of the store. But 10 per cent are from overseas visitors. 'The public was stunned by what happened last week. But then it collected itself and decided that it (the fall of sterling) was not such a bad thing.' From what used to be the country's industrial heartland in north-west England, the Bishop of Manchester, as might be expected, has his eyes on loftier matters than the price of pasta. He said yesterday he welcomed anything - including a devaluation - which would improve the lot of 'devastated' local manufacturers. But he added: 'It seems incredible that European leaders can't get closer together.' British 'pride' was to blame for the government's failure to accept an earlier devaluation of sterling: 'It was clear that we were overvalued.' As for Britain's prospective European relegation, the bishop said: 'It is not inevitable. It needs imaginative leadership to keep Europe united, to keep the European movement going forward, and to maintain Britain at the heart of it, like John Major says.' After the events of the last 10 days, if Mr Major is to stop Britain's slow decent towards second class Euro-citizenship, he will need intervention considerably exceeding that furnished by the Bundesbank. A divine spark may be the prime minister's best hope.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

In his first speech to the Congress at Brighton, Mr Monks said 'overmighty unions' were a thing of the past. 'Dictatorship of the bad employer' was today's reality for far too many people, he said. His address, which was politely rather than enthusiastically received, was partly overshadowed by the continuing argument over the readmission of the electricians' union to the TUC. After the speech, Mr Monks attended an emergency meeting of union leaders which agreed that complainant unions could put their case to the general council today. His speech reflected his efforts to reach beyond the union movement's blue-collar, northern stereotype with a theme of the decline of the 'steady job'. 'What's on offer today is fixed-term contracts, contract working, part-time working, all too often forced down people's throats,' Mr Monks said. 'It's as true now for the white-collar professional as it is for the manual worker. It's as true in the south as it is in the north.' He linked rising crime and drug addiction to the effects that 'unemployment, casualisation and no prospects are having'. Britain, he added, was no longer the workshop of the world but had become 'a warehouse bulging with imports'. Mr Monks, who has developed a friendly relationship with Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the TUC wanted 'to contribute to public policy on training, health and safety, employment law and making Britain work better'. He said he would be testing Mr Hunt's offer of an 'open door' to the TUC. Officials said later a meeting with Mr Hunt had been planned and training would be at the top of the agenda. On a more optimistic note, Mr Monks told Congress: 'The tide of opinion is turning and in it lies the force which can be harnessed to regenerate British trade unionism.' He said raising the morale of active trade unionists would be crucial to the campaigns ahead, particularly efforts to persuade members to vote for the automatic 'check-off' of union dues by employers. Mr Monks, who takes over as general secretary on Friday, is more comfortable in the TV studio than the conference hall but most delegates said his address reflected the key themes facing the unions.

The stance will be taken by some European politicians as a  sign that the former Conservative cabinet minister wants to  underline his independence from Britain as part of his campaign  to succeed Jacques Delors as European Commission president.    A strategy paper drawn up by Sir Leon says the EU should  ""make clear its willingness to include the trade-related aspects  of human and social rights"" in the World Trade Organisation  being set up under the GATT Uruguay Round. The paper, which is  to be put to the full European Commission for adoption in coming  weeks, specifically lists trade union rights, forced labour and  prison Iabour as subjects to be pursued by the EU. ""The  institutions of the EU must enunciate more clearly the social  commitment entrenched in the Maastricht Treaty, and must explain  more clearly to the citizens of Europe how in the past these  principles have already been carried into practice as well as  what more can be done,"" Sir Leon's paper says.    Incorporating labour issues into the world organisation  could  open the way for the withdrawal of trade advantages to  developing countries that fail to respect internationally agreed  rights. The commissioner's position runs counter to the British  Government's contention that there is no place for social issues  in world trade negotiations. British officials believe there  could be a dangerous impact on trade if the organisation is  given the mandate to deal with social issues.    The Government could be embarrassed by Sir Leon's call for a  strengthening of the International Labour Organisation [ILO]  including the possible imposition of sanctions against countries  that fail to live up to ILO conventions. Britain has faced  repeated criticism from the ILO, in particular for its trade  union ban at GCHQ [Government Communications Headquarters].    Sir Leon's stance also marks a shift from his initial  hostility to recent suggestions from the Clinton Administration  that labour issues be brought into the world trade arena after  next month's signing of the GATT deal in Marrakesh.    Washington argues that developing countries should not be  able to gain competitive advantage on world markets because of  poor working conditions.    The paper puts Sir Leon closer to the views of Europe's  Christian Democratic parties, which strongly support efforts to  improve working conditions in Europe and elsewhere in the world.  Unlike the Tories, the Christian Democrats are closely linked  to trade union movements.    Sir Leon's initiative is likely to be broadly welcomed by  the  European and international trade union movements, which have  been pressing for some time for a social clause in GATT.     "
0,FT921-5630 ,"FT921-5630 _AN-CCCA8ADSFT 920303   FT  03 MAR 92 / Russia seeks bigger role in IMF      By LEYLA BOULTON and PETER NORMAN      MOSCOW   RUSSIA, promising further radical economic reforms, served notice yesterday that it would fight for a much bigger role in the International Monetary Fund than the West is prepared to give it. Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, responsible for negotiations with international organisations, said Russia was seeking a quota of 4 to 4.2 per cent of the IMF's capital. The size of the quota determines the amount of Fund resources available to individual members. The Group of Seven leading industrial nations, whose influence is key in IMF decision-making, are proposing a 4.5 per cent quota for all former Soviet republics, including 2 to 2.5 per cent for Russia. Before a proposed IMF capital increase, this would rank Russia in 11th place, sandwiched between the Netherlands and China. The IMF expects its experts to agree with the G7 figures for Russia. But Mr Kagalovsky, whose country is also seeking a seat on the IMF board, said that such calculations were 'erroneous' because they were based on working out a quota for the former Soviet Union and then dividing it among the 15 republics. One compromise solution would be for the Fund to promise Russia a greater share of IMF funds in return for a lower ranking. The issue is delicate because national pride means that Russia, as heir to the former Soviet superpower, sees itself as closer to the US and Germany than to the Netherlands. The quota will be one of the main issues in membershp negotiations between now and April 27, when Russia and the other republics are expected to receive the green light for joining the Fund. Russia will be using as a bargaining chip its bold programme of economic reforms for 1992, which follows IMF recommendations to the letter. The main points of the programme are as follows: The removal of price controls on most goods and services by end of March except for rents, transport and services, domestic use of gas and electricity The freeing by April 20 of the domestic price of oil to reach an estimated Rbs2,000-2,500 (Dollars 19.6-Dollars 24.5) a tonne (compared with Rbs350); this will be accompanied by a 50 per cent tax on domestic sales, presumably to be paid by the seller. Mr Kagalovsky said he expected domestic energy consumption to fall by 10-15 per cent after the price liberalisation. The government aims to slow inflation to 1-3 per cent by the end of the year after an expected jump in prices overall of 50-75 per cent in April Reduction of the budget deficit to one per cent of GNP by the end of this year (according to Mr Kagalovsky) to be achieved mainly through a cut in subsidies to enterprises and military spending Restoration of value added tax of 28 per cent on all types of goods (following its removal from certain food sales) and its introduction for imports from July 1 1992 A unified regime of export taxes for energy and raw materials Introduction in mid-summer of system of one fixed exchange rate for the rouble for all current transactions, plus one rate for capital movements. One western embassy recently calculated that there were at least 10 exchange rates in force in Russia at the moment Further tightening of the central bank's monetary-credit policy including an increase in reserve requirements for commercial banks to 20 per cent in April Progressive tax on pay rises by state enterprises which exceed set norms more focused social subsidies for the worst off and the unemployed Mr Kagalovsky warned that the scope of the programme would have to be cut back if Moscow failed to receive sustantial foreign financial assistance. He said this should include a stabilisation fund of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn (Pounds 2.86bn-Pounds 3.34bn) which is being put together by individual western states, not by the IMF, for the rouble, and further debt relief to free resources for social welfare, stabilisation funds, and increased imports. Britain has agreed to help Russia become a member of the International Monetary Fund, marking a further step forward in economic cooperation between the two countries, writes Peter Norman. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, announced yesterday that Britain would represent Russia's interests during the IMF's consideration of its membership application. The move follows a request for British help from Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian finance minister. Russia's application will be discussed soon by a committee of the IMF board of directors, which will also consider details such as the size of Russia's membership quota in the fund. Russia will make an initial presentation of its case to the committee and then leave Britain to argue the Russian case in detail. It is normal procedure for an applicant to appoint an existing IMF member to act on its behalf in this way. Britain's goal is to secure Russia's membership of the IMF at the next meeting of the fund's policy-making interim committee at the end of April. Mr Lamont, the UK chancellor, said he was 'delighted' that Mr Gaidar asked Britain to represent Russia.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
