HE WARNS AGAINST 'FRATRICIDAL INDIFFERENCE.'      By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso      In the keynote address of his African tour, Pope John Paul II appealed to the  rich nations of the world Monday to provide more generous aid to the afflicted,  have-not region of sub-Sahara Africa.    On the fifth day of an eight-day trip through some of the poorest countries on  Earth, the Pope's rhetoric was as powerful as his conviction that the wealthy  nations of the Northern Hemisphere are not doing enough to counter Africa's  misery.    He was addressing aid workers and members of a foundation established in his  name in 1984, principally through contributions by West German Catholics. It  was the 10th anniversary of his first appeal here for aid to the Sahel, a  region scourged by backwardness, drought and hunger in the relentless advance  of the Sahara desert.    ""In the name of justice,"" he said, ""the Bishop of Rome, the successor of Peter,  begs his brothers and sisters around the world not to scorn the hungry of this  continent, not to deny them the universal right of human dignity and a secure  life.    ""How would history judge a generation that, having all the means to feed the  Earth's population, refuses to do so with fratricidal indifference? What peace  could be hoped for by people who do not carry out the duty of solidarity? What  a desert the world would be where misery is not met with life-giving love.""    The principal purpose of his visit to the Sahel, the Pope told reporters last  week, was to remind the industrial world that the needs of Africa must be  respected in the rush to aid the newly democratizing countries of East Europe.    And he said Monday: ""Again, I must launch a solemn appeal to humanity in the  name of humanity itself. The world must know that Africa suffers deep poverty.  Available resources are declining, the Earth is becoming sparer across an  immense area, malnutrition is chronic for tens of millions of people; too many  children die. Is it possible that such a need is not felt by all humanity?""    His new appeal, John Paul said, ""is directed to the peoples of the world,  especially to those of the North who have most of the human and economic  resources.""    Like the other countries John Paul is visiting in the pilgrimage, Burkina Faso  -- a landlocked, Colorado-size military dictatorship of 9 million people once  known as Upper Volta -- is mired in the backwardness of subsistence agriculture  that is hostage to nature's caprice.    Despite public and private foreign assistance, Burkina Faso's standard of  living has hardly improved since the Pope's visit in 1980. The country has  enjoyed two successive years of good rainfall in regions where drought is more  common, but per-capita income is still only about $200 a year. Last year,  abundant rain brought voracious swarms of grasshoppers and locusts to devour  the crops.    Crowds of singing, dancing people lined the dusty roads of this capital to  greet the Pope on a day when the air was so heavy with Sahara sand that the  airport runway lights were switched on at noon to guide the papal aircraft.    The Pope also met President Blaise Compaore, an army captain who took power in  a 1987 coup in which his predecessor, Thomas Sankara, was killed.    West European countries provide the lion's share of economic assistance for  Burkina Faso. The United States, eighth on the donor list, gave about $10  million last year, supporting development projects and the government's family  planning program. The Catholic Church opposes all such projects that promote  artificial birth control.    The John Paul II Foundation for the Sahel, headquartered here, serves eight  countries and has distributed about $3 million in aid, but Western diplomats  here say its work is little known outside church circles.    Today John Paul flies to a provincial capital to conduct a Mass before  continuing to Chad, the fifth and last stop of a pilgrimage that began in Cape  Verde and continued through Guinea Bissau and Mali over the weekend.

According to the  GCA's African Population Advisory Committee (APAC) report  presented in Harare, nine million adults in Africa were infected  with the HIV virus.    The report was presented by prof H Okoth-Ogendo on behalf of  Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, the current APAC chairman,  the ZIANA news agency reported.    The session was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert  Mugabe, Botswana's President Kethumile Masire and other  dignitaries.    The report said many African countries, including Zimbabwe,  had the highest HIV prevalance among adults worldwide.    AIDS was also increasing health care costs while orphaning  large numbers of children and leaving many elderly people  without protection.    The report said advances made in health and welfare were  being eroded by AIDS and it quoted United Nations Children's  Emergency Fund estimates as showing that under-five mortality  rates were likely to be pushed back to the 1960s level.    ""In summary, the epidemic will likely increase the number of  people in poverty and thwart efforts to develop sectors that  rely on skilled or scarce manpower.""    The report noted African efforts to contain the virus had  had  mixed results. Zimbabwe, along with six other African countries,  had been successful in changing behaviour through use of condoms.    APAC recommended focusing prevention programmes on the  youth,  making condoms easily available and improving management  programmes to control the AIDS epidemic.     "

Sonangol has already drawn about 10 per cent of the one-year facility, which will finance the installation of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel so that two previously-drilled oil wells can be brought on stream. Bankers Trust has provided a hedge for about 2m barrels of crude oil. Mr Ted Giletti, managing director of Energy Merchant Bank, part of Bankers Trust, said the hedging mechanism was necessary because of the size of the facility relative to the projected oil flow rate. The two wells are situated in Block 4/26, an offshore oilfield off the coast of Angola. Block 4/26 is expected to produce between 7,000 b/d and 9,000 b/d and recoverable reserves are estimated at between 9m and 14m barrels. Since the mid-1980s, Angola has become the second-largest oil producer in sub-Sahara Africa, after Nigeria. Bankers Trust said that further development programmes are expected to boost Angola's crude oil production from current levels of 500,000 b/d to about 700,000 b/d by 1997.

0,FT941-4190 ,"FT941-4190 _AN-ECMANAA4FT 940312   FT  12 MAR 94 / In 40 years' time, black Africa might reach the level of wealth it had 20 years ago: IMF reforms are paying off, but the continent is way behind the rest of the world, says the World Bank      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor   Unless sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, warns a World Bank report on the region published tomorrow. Even Ghana, rated the best of Africa's reforming countries which has achieved real growth of about 5 per cent a year, is still among the world's poorest countries: 'At this growth rate, the average Ghanaian will not cross the poverty line for another 50 years,' says the report. The report is the most sombre in a series that go back to the early stages of Africa's economic crisis. Past studies have combined tough appraisals with upbeat expectations of reform. The latest study warns that success will not come easy, but cautions against 'undue pessimism', pointing to the fact that Asian countries which had almost no growth between 1930 and 1960 now enjoy 'stunning' growth. Structural adjustment is essential but not sufficient if sub-Saharan Africa is to achieve sustained growth, says the World Bank in a 280-page appraisal of economic reform. But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in Africa, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or assess its impact on economic performance in the years under review. Of the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement in macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest resurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per cent in GDP. By contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies saw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the number of poor. Although the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they might be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades. 'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical trend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto a higher growth path. 'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export and GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other developing nations.' The report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in sub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two periods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries were implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African governments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment programmes. The six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation, introduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural incentives. Countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops, says the Bank. The study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were complementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.' Export volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if the exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies were implemented, says the report. Comparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is worrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to matching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget balances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and currencies are fully convertible, at least for current account transactions.' African governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The value of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank, 'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even after adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.' Africa's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector demands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding public enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit. 'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in Washington to launch the study. 'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no country has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low inflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he said. Africa performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing countries. In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of population growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited resources available. Adjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and efficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development efforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate resources into education and strengthening weak management capacity. 'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid growth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank. Other central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate divestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's external debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank 'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes are in place.

0,FT911-5176 ,"FT911-5176 _AN-BDPBVABIFT 910416   FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: Don't encourage Third World defaults      From LORD BAUER   Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. He cites Africa to support his contention. The statistics I used refer to Latin America, the principal thrust of the argument of the Bishop of Oxford, which focused largely on Brazil. The bulk of African debt is owed to official lenders under various aid agreements. The debts represent loans with a substantial grant element. The limiting case is the international development association loans, 50-year loans, unindexed for inflation, at zero interest. The debts of African countries have often been cancelled or rescheduled, frequently several times for the same country. To treat debt as necessarily burdensome also ignores the initial transfer of resources. This is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest. If the funds are used productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense that the debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed. I do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind in referring to institutions serving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict suffering on the poor. What I do know is that throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America the level of material achievement declines as we move away from the effect of western commerce. To harp on alleged external causes of Third World poverty diverts attention from the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and thereby from the possibilities of addressing these. These factors include, among others, government policies and extensive, often enforced, dependence on precarious subsistence production. It is pertinent also that the poorest are low among the priorities of the local rulers. State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor, conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may not accord with local mores. Such considerations are reinforced by ubiquitous civil conflict. An Arab-dominated Sudanese government will not help the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed conflict; the Sinhalese government will not help the Tamil poor, nor will the government of Ethiopia the poor of Tigre. As I said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of Third World poverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred sentiment. Encouraging Third World countries to default inhibits the inflow of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries, notably in south-east Asia, west Africa and Latin America.

By CARLOS BREZINA, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      WASHINGTON      Most of the world is winning the war against poverty, ignorance and illness,  and the number of people can be further reduced by the end of the century with  adequate economic policies, the World Bank says.    It said only one major region -- Sub-Saharan Africa -- risks a degradation of  its economic and social conditions in the 1990s.    Despite ""tremendous"" progress the past three decades, 1.1 billion people in  developing countries -- one out of four -- still live on less than $370 a year,  World Bank President Barber B. Conable said.    The bank's annual report, ""World Development 1990 -- Poverty,"" said per-capita  consumption in developing countries rose by 67% between 1965 and 1985, life  expectancy lengthened to 62 years from 51 and primary school enrollment rose to  84% from 73.    Progress was uneven, with the greatest gains in East Asia. Yet even in  Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where consumption per capita stagnated  during the period, life expectancy and primary enrollment rates improved.    Moreover, the 1980s -- often called a ""lost decade for the poor"" -- did not  reverse the overall trend of progress.    ""The incomes of most of the world's poor went on rising, and under-5 (years of  age) mortality, primary school enrollment ratios and other social indicators  also continued to improve,"" the study said.    The setbacks of the 1980s occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America,  where poverty increased. In Latin America, however, overall social conditions  did not deteriorate as much as the fall in income would have suggested, the  bank noted.    Conable contended that, with adequate economic policies, the number of poor  could be slashed by 300 million by the end of the century.    ""This is no pipe dream,"" he said, adding that over the past few decades there  were spectacular victories in the war against poverty in countries as diverse  as Colombia, Indonesia, Chile and Botswana.    In Indonesia, the proportion of poor was reduced to 20% from 60% in the past 25  years.    Conable warned, nevertheless, that although the number of poor could be reduced  by 400 million in Asia, their numbers could swell by 100 million in Sub-Saharan  Africa because of slow growth in income and high population growth.    He said countries that reduced poverty did so with a two-part strategy. The  first promoted using the poor's most abundant asset, labor, through policies  that harness market incentives, social and political institutions,  infrastructure and technology. The second aimed at providing basic social  services to the poor -- health care, family planning, nutrition and education.    The World Bank voiced optimism on prospects for the global economy for the  1990s, except for Sub-Saharan Africa.    It projected that industrial economies will achieve a 3% annual growth,  commodity prices will dip in the short term but gain an average 0.2% per year,  and real interest rates will fall to between 3% and 4% from almost 5.5% in the  1980s.    The number of poor in Latin America is expected to remain the same as the  region's economy advances by 4.2% per year through the end of the century, with  a 2.3% per-capita output gain. If the region achieved better income  distribution, the number of poor could fall by 20%.    For Sub-Saharan countries, the projected annual economic growth rate is 3.7%,  but high population growth may reduce the per-capita gain to 0.5%.    In contrast, South Asian nations will increase output at a 5.1% annual rate, a  per-capita hike of 3.2%. India's economy will expand at a 5.2% annual clip, a  3.4% per-capita advance.    East Asian countries will all but wipe out poverty, with an economic growth  rate of 6.6% per year and a per-capita advance of 5.1%. China's economy will  expand by 6.8% a year in the 1990s, down from 10.1% in the 1980s, with a  per-capita gain of 5.4%.    For Eastern Europe, the bank cautioned, the outlook is cloudy. Economic reforms  and anti-inflationary measures will depress growth for a while, even with  generous external assistance. Annual output expansion in the 1990s could  average 1.9%, for a 1.5% per-capita gain.    In the Middle East, North Africa and developing countries of Europe, economic  expansion is projected at a 4.3% annual clip, for a 2.1% per-capita gain.    The World Bank and its affiliates, the principal source of financing for  developing nations, lend over $20 billion a year for economic structural  reforms and development projects.

Conable warned, nevertheless, that although the number of poor could be reduced  by 400 million in Asia, their numbers could swell by 100 million in Sub-Saharan  Africa because of slow growth in income and high population growth.    He said countries that reduced poverty did so with a two-part strategy. The  first promoted using the poor's most abundant asset, labor, through policies  that harness market incentives, social and political institutions,  infrastructure and technology. The second aimed at providing basic social  services to the poor -- health care, family planning, nutrition and education.    The World Bank voiced optimism on prospects for the global economy for the  1990s, except for Sub-Saharan Africa.    It projected that industrial economies will achieve a 3% annual growth,  commodity prices will dip in the short term but gain an average 0.2% per year,  and real interest rates will fall to between 3% and 4% from almost 5.5% in the  1980s.    The number of poor in Latin America is expected to remain the same as the  region's economy advances by 4.2% per year through the end of the century, with  a 2.3% per-capita output gain. If the region achieved better income  distribution, the number of poor could fall by 20%.    For Sub-Saharan countries, the projected annual economic growth rate is 3.7%,  but high population growth may reduce the per-capita gain to 0.5%.    In contrast, South Asian nations will increase output at a 5.1% annual rate, a  per-capita hike of 3.2%. India's economy will expand at a 5.2% annual clip, a  3.4% per-capita advance.    East Asian countries will all but wipe out poverty, with an economic growth  rate of 6.6% per year and a per-capita advance of 5.1%. China's economy will  expand by 6.8% a year in the 1990s, down from 10.1% in the 1980s, with a  per-capita gain of 5.4%.    For Eastern Europe, the bank cautioned, the outlook is cloudy. Economic reforms  and anti-inflationary measures will depress growth for a while, even with  generous external assistance. Annual output expansion in the 1990s could  average 1.9%, for a 1.5% per-capita gain.    In the Middle East, North Africa and developing countries of Europe, economic  expansion is projected at a 4.3% annual clip, for a 2.1% per-capita gain.    The World Bank and its affiliates, the principal source of financing for  developing nations, lend over $20 billion a year for economic structural  reforms and development projects.

Declaring that 'we are well prepared to invest in peace,' Mr Preston said the bank had been working 'over the last several years' with all parties in South Africa to help draw up an economic support programme. The bank had been working on policies for the occupied territories over the past year. Speaking at the opening of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, he said that the world was changing faster than at any time since the second world war and the bank was having to change too. Developing countries had become a powerful force in the world economy. In the past five years, they accounted for more than a quarter of the rise in global imports. They were expected to contribute about a third of the growth of world output over the next five years. East Asia was 'positioned to become the world's fourth major growth pole by the end of this decade'. But their economies and problems were differentiated. Fast growth in east Asia contrasted with persistently high levels of poverty in Africa. To improve its effectiveness, the bank had: Changed its organisational structure to focus on poverty reduction as its main objective and rapidly increased its activities on the environment so that environmental projects have become the fastest growing section of its portfolio. Boosted lending to the private sector and tripled over three years its support for 'human resource development,' such as education. Taken steps to improve the quality of its loan portfolio.

Already there are over 5m unemployed, nearly two in five workers, the ILO estimates. While blacks bear the overwhelming burden of joblessness, the ILO says unemployment and poverty have surfaced among whites for the first time since the 1930s. South Africa's labour force is expected to rise from 13.4m in 1990 to 20.2m in 2025, with up to 500,000 workers entering the labour market each year. Only 31,000 new jobs a year were created in the 1980s and fewer since then, mostly in the public sector, the ILO notes.

'After a decade of structural adjustment programmes implemented under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, Africa remains trapped in a downward spiral of economic and social decline and poverty is increasing,' the agency said in London. 'There is now overwhelming evidence that existing adjustment policies have failed in two ways,' it said. 'They have not created a platform for sustainable recovery and have not addressed the central challenge, correctly identified by the World Bank, of alleviating poverty.' However, the Bank's policies 'suffer from inappropriate design, inadequate funding and poor implementation', the statement continues. Some of the sharpest criticism is reserved for the IMF, whose role in Africa should be reviewed by an international committee reporting to the United Nations, Oxfam said. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, strongly defended its role in Africa against Oxfam's charges, while admitting that the situation in Africa was 'a matter of immense concern'. But he said there were countries in Africa that were growing - ones that had followed IMF economic reform programmes that had allowed increased output and exports. Countries such as Mozambique, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia were all benefiting from IMF-inspired policies. More could be done, he added. There was scope for greater regional integration in Africa. Those countries which had not embarked on structural adjustment programmes must put their macro-economic policies in order. Mr Camdessus said there was much that industrialised countries could do to improve the situation. Africa would benefit most from early conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Oxfam says the speed at which IMF programmes require governments to reduce budget deficits is 'totally unrealistic and destructive'. The statement calls for longer time frames and 'more selective introduction of trade liberalisation measures.' Debt servicing takes up a quarter of the region's exports, although only half of scheduled payments are being met. Arrears currently exceed Dollars 11bn and are building up at an alarming rate. Oxfam called on the IMF to create a special fund to write off part of Africa's debt through the sale of gold stocks.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT941-3811 ,"FT941-3811 _AN-ECODSABAFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / Long snakes and short ladders in Africa: A formula for development failure      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Unseen hands play Snakes and Ladders across sub-Saharan Africa. Democracy fitfully emerges in South Africa, is denied in Nigeria. Civil war revives in Angola, Zaire slides towards anarchy, a fragile peace pact holds in Mozambique. News is as unpredictable as the throw of the dice. Snakes marked Drought, Corruption or Civil War writhe across the board; ladders appear as Debt Rescheduled or World Bank Loan. Short ladders, long snakes. . . and loaded dice. As the latest World Bank Sub-Saharan Africa report published at the weekend makes clear, the destination labelled Recovery remains out of reach. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn (Pounds 113bn), has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warns the Bank. Whoever is to blame, the policy at the heart of relations between Africa and the west is failing. 'Good governance', the concept which links aid to Africa with economic reform, human rights and democracy has not got to the heart of the continent's predicament. Admirable in principle, complex in practice, today the policy appears confused. Increasingly the west is placing responsibility for Africa on the World Bank, but providing neither adequate mandate nor clear guidance. Once enslaved, later colonised, and marginalised in the 1980s, the continent faces a continuing crisis in the 1990s - but with a new dimension. Africa is not only in danger of losing the battle; the world is losing interest. The countries that led the scramble for Africa's resources some 100 years ago are now disengaging. 'If only the west cared enough to want to recolonise us,' an African diplomat ruefully observes. 'But we're hardly an attractive proposition.' At one level, the west continues to respond positively. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. But the critical link between economic and political reform is being neglected, and aid is ineffective. Under the auspices of the World Bank's economic recovery programme, Africa's governments were expected to cut budget deficits, curb inflation and monetary growth, introduce competitive exchange rates, reform tariffs and revive agriculture. The good news, says Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank's vice-president for Africa, is that the formula works: 'The six countries that improved their policies the most (over the period 1987-91) saw their GDP growth per capita jump about 2 percentage points per annum between 1981-86 and 1987-91.' The bad news is that this is not nearly enough. The Bank's claim in a 1989 report that African economies could grow at a rate of 4-5 per cent has proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Part of the reason for Africa's failure is made clear in the report. Implementation of the World Bank structural adjustment reforms has been poor, political will lacking, and management resources scarce. But essential to the success of economic reforms, donors have argued, is a matching programme of political reform. Transparency, accountability and democracy are vital to sustain development, they maintain. The World Bank report agrees, but it does not address how it can be achieved in practice, or assess the part political problems have played in Africa's failure to reach economic targets. The only reference is to 'a strong social consensus on the need to improve governance'. Corruption is not mentioned, nor military spending, nor is there any discussion of a central issue: how to reward reformers, punish laggards. Yet the experience of Bank representatives across Africa is that this is precisely the area which needs attention. 'Structural adjustment means reducing state patronage,' explains a Bank official in west Africa. 'Reducing patronage undermines the ruling party. Unless the president is prepared to risk political suicide, there is not enough I can do to force him down a path of reform, whether it's the big stick or the big carrot.' The reason for the report's reticence on 'good governance' issues is not hard to find. The Bank, officials privately point out, is constrained by a mandate which precludes it from a political role; and its mandate is determined by the directors - 'none of whom wants to rock the boat'. The board's third world appointees tend to reflect the views of their leaders, who would be the last to support tougher measures, say their domestic critics. Developed country directors, may be reluctant to jeopardise commercial or security interests. But the misgivings of directors representing the biggest donors about applying tougher pressure on reluctant African reformers stem from a further, more understandable concern: the generally poor performance of Africa's opposition parties. After the high hopes of the 'new wind of change', the wave of democratisation that swept through Africa in the late 1980s, opposition parties have turned out to have most of the weaknesses of the regimes they oppose: ethnically based, few carefully worked out policy alternatives and likely to be as corrupt if ever they won office. 'Who can blame us for our reluctance to follow through a policy that could destabilise Nigeria, with its 80m people and huge problems, and where the opposition seems as incompetent as the army?' asks an irritated European diplomat. The report leaves further questions unanswered. If democracy is essential to sustained growth - the assumption that underpins the concept of good governance - how can the position of Ghana, under military government until 1992 but the leading reformer, be explained? As long ago as 1981 the Bank called for 'a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'. World Bank officials and aid workers argue that Africa's need for such a compact is overwhelming. But until the west renews its interest in Africa, resolves the anomalies in its policies, and gives the Bank and other donors a clearer mandate, the compact will remain a pipe dream.

0,FT922-4425 ,"FT922-4425 _AN-CFEA9AD3FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (17): Daunting burden of development  -Tough social problems loom      By PATTI WALDMEIR   'WE ALL, whites and blacks, think we're entitled to Swedish social security, but with Polish GDP. It won't work like that,' says Mr John Kane-Berman, director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, highlighting the most daunting problem of the post-apartheid era: how to meet the enormous economic expectations raised by the prospect of black rule. For any new government will immediately face one grim truth: that South Africa simply does not have the resources to raise black living standards overnight to white levels, and there is no explosion of economic growth on the horizon to meet the country's huge development needs. South Africa's under-educated population lacks the skills needed for economic revolution along Far Eastern lines. And over the next generation, the sheer weight of numbers will depress efforts at economic upliftment: by 2010, South Africa's 1980 population of 29.1m will have nearly doubled to 59.7m, according to the Urban Foundation, a business-funded policy institute. It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be up to the task of housing, educating and employing nearly 60m people. Black South Africans may well find that life remains a struggle. The first post-apartheid government will inherit a country where, in the words of the authoritative Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa, published in 1989, 'poverty is deep and widespread and . . . the degree of inequality is as great as in any other country in the world.' For a nation so advanced - the World Bank classifies it as an upper middle-income developing country - the extent of poverty is striking. The charity Operation Hunger feeds 1.8m people daily, victims of the three-year recession and this year's catastrophic drought. In 1989, 40 per cent of the population (excluding the nominally independent homelands where poverty is rife) is estimated to have lived below the so-called 'minimum living level' or poverty line. A recent IMF report* notes that in terms of social indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality 'black South Africa has done at best only moderately better than its neighbours despite its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy'. The gap between white and black incomes further emphasises black deprivation: according to the Development Bank of Southern Africa, though black incomes have risen more than white incomes in recent years, the white share of total personal income was 54 per cent in 1988 (whites are 13 per cent of the population) while blacks representing nearly 80 per cent of the population had a 36 per cent share. Apartheid has ensured that state spending on social services is similarly skewed. According to the IMF, government spent R4,087 per capita educating whites in 1990, and only R907 on blacks, R2,406 for coloureds and R3,055 for Asians. Pensions, which are a principal source of income for the poorest South Africans, are also unequal: whites get a R345 monthly payment, blacks R293. Health spending is also distorted. And while whites are all at least decently housed - South African cities boast some of the world's most luxurious suburbs on earth - over more than 7m non-whites live in informal urban dwellings such as shacks. Racial disparities in social spending have narrowed substantially in recent years, and the government has devoted an extra R3bn of extra-budgetary funds for special education and housing projects. But the cost of introducing per capita parity between races would be extremely high. The IMF report states: 'Equalising spending levels at the present white level would result in an overall level of social spending dramatically beyond the capacity of the budget.' It notes that overall spending on education and health (though not on pensions) is already high in relation to GDP: indeed, education spending, as a share of the budget and of GDP, substantially exceeded not only that of middle-income countries, but also industrial nations. Abolishing the senseless duplications of apartheid would generate some savings: the new South Africa will not need 15 racially-based departments of finance, 15 education departments and 14 health ministries, complete with Mercedes-driving ministers in each one. But the cost of reincorporation is likely to exceed any savings: to raise per capita socio-economic spending on homeland blacks to the level which prevails in the Republic would mean a 38 per cent overall increase. And given that independence governments elsewhere in Africa have tended to increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it, there seems little chance that bloated homeland civil services or central government will be streamlined. The IMF report concludes: 'The scope for further compressing non-social spending (eg defence) . . . is limited and therefore implies that social expenditures will need to be re-ordered if the budget is to attend to the needs of the least privileged groups of society without significant resort to deficit financing or to higher taxes.' What this means in practice, according to minister of (black) education and training, Sam de Beer, is that if South Africa continues to spend 6 per cent of GDP on education (assuming 3 per cent overall economic growth and a 1:32 pupil/teacher ratio), government will be able to finance only seven years of compulsory education by 2000. The inevitable conclusion is the one drawn by the late Mr Simon Brand, formerly Development Bank chairman: 'We don't have the resources for the kind of welfare state we have been running for whites.' Substantially increasing taxes to fund greater social spending on blacks would be counter-productive, the IMF argues: 'The tax burden on the white community appears to be relatively high even by industrial country standards. This would argue against raising tax rates in South Africa and running the risk of heightening disincentive effects.' The IMF concludes: 'Redistribution policies will need to be firmly supported by growth-orientated policies if the social spending gap is to be effectively bridged.' For without economic growth, very little progress can be made toward a more economically just society. Yet sustaining growth at the 3.5 per cent required for what the IMF calls a 'meaningful increase in living standards' - during a period of great political and social turmoil - could well prove a tall order.* Economic Policies for a New South Africa, IMF, January 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EDUCATION INDICATORS IN 1990*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           White   Black   Coloured   Asian  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pupils (m)                 1.0     7.7       0.9      0.3 Pupil/teacher             18.6    40.8      23.3     21.7 Expenditure/pupil (R)    4,087     907     2,406    3,055  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Including public ordinary schools, secondary schools and technical training colleges  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: South Africa department of National Education: IMF staff estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SELECTED SOCIAL INDICATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                            White   Coloured   Asian   Black  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Life expectancy at birth                                          (in years) 1970                            68.5      58.0      62.5 1979                            69.9      61.5      64.8 1980*                           69.5      58.6      65.5    58.5                                            Literacy                                   (rates of adult literacy) 1970                            98.0      69.0      74.0 1979                            99.3      84.5      92.4 1980                            99.3      84.5      92.4    67.0                                        Infant mortality                                (deaths per 1,000 live births) 1950                            35.7     134.3      68.5   165.0 1960                            29.6     128.6      59.6    95.0 1970                            21.6     133.5      36.4    85.0 1980                            13.1      60.7      24.4    70.0 1988                            13.2      57.5      17.4    57.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *1980 figures are computed at age 12 months  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Eckert (1986); South African Department of Information, Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa; Department of National health and Population, 1990 Health Trends in South Africa  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page VIII  "

The Netherlands minister for development cooperation, Mr Jan Pronx, told the annual meeting of the African Development Bank it was difficult to see where resources required to assist growth and attack poverty would come from, without more effective rescheduling of debt. 'In the view of the Netherlands, we still have to strive for a write-off debt of all least-developed countries,' he said. Representatives of other industrialised states stopped short of endorsing a need for new debt relief schemes, but chorused their intention to stand by Africa. 'My country is committed to remaining engaged in this continent,' declared Mr Olin Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury. Mr Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, Nigeria's finance minister, said debt relief now provided 'a glimmer of hope', but Africa's economic plight was alarming. He proposed that concessions which multilateral aid agencies allowed to the poorest countries should be extended to the less well-off, middle-income states. But Mr Wethington told a news conference that Washington was reluctant at this stage to agree to such a proposal. He outlined at the meeting a two-pronged approach by his country in its economic relations with Africa in the post-Cold War world. While helping to meet social and economic needs, it would stress the value of democracy and market-based economies, and favour changes to promote the private sector. 'The long-term future lies with encouraging private enterprise,' he told reporters. 'The private capital markets will be able, in the long term, to provide resources that will exceed those available through official channels.' Mr Alhaji urged industrial countries to open their markets. 'At present, excessive subsidies to agricultural products of the developed economies create the double-edged sword which keeps our farm products out of their markets and, at the same time, depresses markets for our products,' the minister said.

Geingob, received  congratulations from Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and other  officials of the world organization, which for four decades has been the chief  advocate of Namibian independence.    At a news conference later, Geingob cited his country's place in the ranks of  the Third World. He said that, while it is better off than many of its African  neighbors, it will begin its independence with an inherited deficit of $192  million.

While the African continent traversed some of the most  difficult times in the last year, it also witnessed moments of  triumph and hope.    The Cairo Declaration adopted by the OAU in June last year  on  the establishment of the mechanism to resolve African disputes  peacefully represented a landmark achievement of the  organization in the political sphere.    The treaty establishing the African Economic Community, that  came into effect last month, was the first step Africa has taken  toward economic integration and it is expected to have a  significant impact on the revitalization of the African economy.    The summit also acquires its special significance as it  comes  in the wake of the first all-race elections in South Africa, and  the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as its president.    Reforms to end apartheid in Pretoria have brought about  world  acceptance and South Africa was formally welcomed as the newest  member of the OAU on May 25.    But there are new challenges that the African continent is  still facing.    Despite the political and economic progress in the past  year,  some African countries are still suffering from war and domestic  disputes.    The conflict in Rwanda has shocked the world by its scale,  brutality and savagery, which is expected to call urgent  attention of the African leaders.    Besides, the accumulated crucial economic and social  problems  are hindering development of the African countries.    Over the recent years, African countries suffered greatly  from the low prices of primary commodities in the international  markets. The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing  foreign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S.  dollars, or three times the figure in 1980.    The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6  billion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47  least developed countries in the world.    Perhaps more devastating are Africa's exploding population,  which now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU  estimates, at the region's current average annual growth rate of  3.1 percent, Africa's population will reach approximately 1  billion by the year 2005.    In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual  average growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been  a mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African  population growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita  income and a further slide into poverty in Africa.    It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution  of ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent.  And the second most important problem is finding ways and means  of combating the rising tide of economic problems.    African conflicts and economic development will top the list  of concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15.    Given the changing international situation, it has become  increasingly important for African countries to maintain  political stability for the benefit of economic development.    In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic  development will appear to be the main theme of the African  summit.     "
0,FT932-12865 ,"FT932-12865 _AN-DD1BPAA0FT 930427   FT  27 APR 93 / Oxfam wants urgent Marshall Plan for Africa: West attacked for lacking political will while IMF/World Bank policies 'hurt but do not work'      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   OXFAM yesterday called on the west to back a Marshall Plan for sub-Saharan Africa, warning that without greater assistance the region's economic crisis is set to deepen. 'Africa is on a knife edge,' Mr David Bryer, director of the Oxford-based charity, told the London launch of its Africa recovery programme. The end of the Cold War, 'fragile' peace in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Mozambique, and the emergence of more representative governments in Africa provided the opening for a western initiative, said Mr Bryer, adding: 'Northern nations have the power to tip the balance: to support the current opportunities for recovery or to sentence the region to a spiralling and agonising decline.' But unless the opportunity were seized, prospects were bleak, Mr Bryer warned. In the words of the charity's 40-page analysis* of the crisis: 'Economic stagnation, social breakdown, decaying infrastructures, crippling debt burdens, ruinous prices for commodity exports, and environmental degradation threaten to retard Africa's development prospects into the next century, with frightening consequences for human welfare.' 'Without recovery, more than 300m people - half the region's population - will be living in poverty by the end of the decade.' The report accuses the west of lacking the political will, contrasting the response to problems of eastern Europe and Russia with 'their neglect for over a decade of Africa's far deeper problems'. Some of Oxfam's sharpest criticism is directed at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, arguing that their policies are 'hurting but not working'. The Fund's 'increasingly damaging role' stems from policy mistakes in the early 1980s, says the report: 'The Fund treated what was a problem of insolvency as one of short-term liquidity, extending short-term loans at high interest rates to cover structural and trade deficits.' The Fund embarked on financing 'what was bound to be a slow process of adjustment and recovery with the wrong resources and the wrong approach . . .'. 'Africa has been paying the price ever since.' It is time for northern governments 'to face up to the fact that the IMF has failed Africa . . .'. 'The time has come either fundamentally to reform the IMF or extricate it from Africa.' The report calls for a write-off or concessional rescheduling of much of the region's external debt. The debt crisis is deepening, says Oxfam. Total external debt in 1992 was Dollars 183bn (Pounds 116bn), including IMF and World Bank debt - Dollars 30bn higher than in 1989 when large scale cancellations began. Multilateral agencies, mainly the World Bank and IMF, accounted for 36 per cent of debt servicing payments in 1991. Neither agency, under existing rules, is permitted to reschedule or write off debt. Tackling the debt burden would be central to Oxfam's five-point recovery programme, which urges western governments to treat Africa with the same sense of urgency and concern that prompted the Marshall Plan. Under the plan, launched at the end of the second world war, the US transferred some 2 per cent of its gross national product to support the rebuilding of post-war Europe. Oxfam will put its debt proposals to the G7 summit in Tokyo in July. Oxfam's recovery programme also calls for: Increased aid flows, moving towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GDP for aid budgets. Oxfam urges Britain to take a lead by agreeing an extra Pounds 100m in support of Africa's recovery. A fund to help Africa process its commodity exports; the ending of subsidised disposal of agricultural surpluses; reduction of protectionist barriers against Africa's exports. Reform of structural adjustment programmes, including protection for African industries and greater investment in health and education. Strengthening the UN role in aid and peacekeeping; the appointment of one special representative responsible for co-ordinating UN operations. The report says that while the 1980s were grim, 'things are getting steadily worse'. Gains in health and education are being eroded, and as a result 'Africa is being disempowered as the educational gap between itself and other parts of the world widens'. Oxfam's analysis is at odds with the World Bank's appraisal, published last February.* * 'Sub-Saharan countries have achieved significant progress in the last few years. Growth has resumed,' said the Bank. Though it acknowledges the 1990s will be a critical decade, the Bank maintains that there has been general agreement on the merits of its reforms, arguing that 'adjustment has improved the lives of the vast majority of Africa's poor'. * Africa, make or break: Action for recovery, Oxfam, 274 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DZ; tel (0865) 312498/311311 fax 312580 Africa. * * From stagnation to recovery, World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433; tel (202) 4771234 fax 4776391 ***** Our current trends, Africans living in poverty will increase from 218m to 300m - half the poulation - by 2000 The region has 32 of the world's poorest 47 nations It has 10 per cent of the developing world's population but receives over 30 per cent of official aid It relies on aid for 80 per cent of its financial resource flows - 11 per cent of GDP (Asia 1 per cent) Its share of world trade has fallen from 3 per cent in 1970 to just over 1 per cent It receives less than 1 per cent of worldwide foreign investment The slide of commodity prices between 1986 and 1990 cost Africa Dollars 50bn in lost earnings - more than twice the amount received in aid IMF Economic Outlook, Page 6   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT933-2177 ,"FT933-2177 _AN-DITBZAA2FT 930920   FT  20 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) World Bank to raise lending commitments      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   Correction (published 21st September 1993) appended to this article. THE World Bank plans to increase lending commitments by up to Dollars 3.2bn in its current fiscal year from Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30, reflecting the cost of its battle against poverty and the growing financing needs of former communist states. The bank's annual report, published yesterday, disclosed that both arms of the bank - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and its soft loan affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA)  -have been authorised to increase lending this year. The IBRD, which made commitments of Dollars 16.95bn in the past financial year, has been empowered to boost its lending commitments to between Dollars 17bn and Dollars 19.5bn in fiscal 1994. The IDA, which lends funds to the poorest developing nations at very low, subsidised interest rates, is expected to commit about Dollars 7.4bn in 1993-94 against Dollars 6.75bn in 1992-93. Countries qualifying for IDA credits have incomes per head of Dollars 765 or less. The report contained figures showing how World Bank lending provides business for companies in the industrialised world. The UK, which has provided Dollars 6.08bn for the IBRD and IDA since their inception, has won contracts worth Dollars 11.2bn in support of World Bank projects, representing a return of Dollars 1.85 in orders for every Dollars 1 invested in the bank. In the case of the US, the return has been Dollars 1.09 for each Dollars 1 ploughed into the World Bank. This compares with Dollars 1.01 in the case of Japan; Dollars 1.51 for Germany and Dollars 1.82 for France. Total World Bank lending to Europe and central Asia increased to Dollars 3.84bn in 1992-93 from Dollars 2.14bn the previous year, as 11 former Soviet republics and two of the Baltic republics joined the bank. Russia became the third largest user of IBRD funds, with four borrowings totalling Dollars 1.37bn. The two heaviest borrowers from the IBRD in 1992-93 were China (Dollars 2.16bn) and Argentina (Dollars 1.96bn); Mexico and India took fourth and fifth places. India was the biggest drawer on IDA, borrowing Dollars 1.53bn, followed by China (Dollars 1.02bn), Pakistan (Dollars 429m), Ethiopia (Dollars 371m) and Ghana (Dollars 354m). In regional terms, Africa was the biggest user of IDA finance, taking Dollars 2.77bn in 1992-93. But overall World Bank lending to Africa fell sharply to Dollars 2.8bn from Dollars 3.9bn reflecting the absence of any IBRD lending to Nigeria or the Ivory Coast. Actual IBRD and IDA lending to the poorest countries (with annual per capita incomes of less than Dollars 635) fell last year to Dollars 9.96bn from Dollars 10.86bn. However, the bank is placing greater emphasis on poverty reduction in its programmes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD BANK OPERATIONS (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                           1989     1990     1991    1992     1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------- IBRD Commitments*       16,433   15,180   16,392  15,156   16,945 Gross disbursements*    11,310   13,859   11,431  11,666   12,942 IDA Commitments          4,934    5,522    6,293   6,550    6,751 Gross disbursements**    3,597    3,845    4,549   4,765    4,946  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *Excludes loans to the IFC **Includes disbursements from the Special Fund  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank  ----------------------------------------------------------------- CORRECTION In the article 'World Bank to raise lending commitments', in the Financial Times of September 20, a reference was made in the first paragraph to the bank's lending commitments of 'Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30'.

0,FT921-6495 ,"FT921-6495 _AN-CB0CIAEEFT 920227   FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad catches the free-market bug - UN body seeks to assist rich and poor in an open trade system      By SARITA KENDALL   AGAINST all the odds, the UN Conference on Trade and Development appears to have accomplished what it set out to do at its eighth conference in Cartagena, Colombia: restructure itself so it can play a bigger part in influencing world trade and development. The future of this UN organisation, which has functioned since its founding in 1964 primarily as a trade and development watchdog on behalf of the developing world, depends on finding new ways to benefit countries - from the very poor to the very rich - that endorse free-market policies. With so many developing countries already carrying out market-oriented reforms and accepting the liberalisation of trade as part of a growth strategy, dialogue has become easier. Few significant conflicts surfaced at Unctad VIII, and, to most delegates' relief, ideology barely intruded. The desperation to keep up 'the spirit of consensus' was such that the final political declaration dissolved into a few platitudes - but the document on revamping Unctad is solid. The organisation's existing committees have been scrapped, and four new ones named. Although the subjects covered - commodities, poverty alleviation, service sectors and economic co-operation among developing countries - are not new, their terms of reference will be redrawn to fit changing circumstances. 'This will have to be done rapidly because the countries clearly intend it should be,' said Mr Carlos Fortin, deputy to the secretary-general, Mr Kenneth Dadzie. Mr Fortin sees Unctad's main function as providing an overall vision of trade and development related issues, and extending this to analysing problems that need international action. For example, all nations wanted to increase trade, so competition was a special concern. 'What kind of competition do we really want? What economic and other obstacles are there for competition? Unctad can do global studies of this nature and be a pioneer in getting agreements going,' said Mr Fortin. Competition surfaced in several guises and is one of the reasons developing countries have come to endorse the negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Until recently Gatt was seen as a rich man's club (with Unctad known as the poor man's Gatt), but now that poorer countries are more interested in trade they want the protection afforded by clear multilateral rules. As a result, there were repeated calls for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay round. Both poverty and the environment were taken up by the conference: 'sustainable' development was the byword, with the proposal that Unctad could be one of the organisations to follow up the Rio Earth Summit in June and help create a new environmental order. Trade-related environmental questions, especially where commodities are involved, are already being tackled by Unctad. The conference gave a high priority to alleviating poverty with support for programmes designed to deal with the problem of the 47 least developed countries, particularly in the context of depressed commodity prices. But Unctad has invested enormous efforts in commodity questions 'to remarkably little effect', as one African delegate said. And Colombia's proposal for a world commodity conference received only tepid backing because few members believed it could succeed where, for instance, coffee pact negotiations have so far failed. The volume of world exports grew by an average of 6.5 per cent a year from 1985 to 1990, with the market-oriented industrialised countries accounting for about 70 per cent of the total. Although developing countries increased their exports by 9 per cent a year in the same period, this figure was largely due to the performance of south-east Asian countries. By contrast, African and Latin American countries depending mainly on commodities had lower export growth by volume, and lost purchasing power. Developing countries are particularly enthusiastic about Unctad's concept of 'trade efficiency' which proved its practical worth in a newly installed 'Trade Point', a trade information technology centre, in Cartagena. 'We've shown here that we can cut the cost of transactions by 40 per cent, even in a small city. It's not highly sophisticated technology, it only costs Dollars 20,000 to install,' said Mr Jean Gurunlian, chief of Unctad's trade facilitation. 'The main aim is to eliminate obstacles and corruption, and move goods faster. What it does require is a change of attitude.' Delegates were so impressed by the possibilities of savings in time and costs that they agreed on a Trade Efficiency Symposium in 1994. Unctad's role as the main UN development forum is still a diffused one, with the important decisions being made by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Gatt. At a time when Unctad, is under pressure to be more useful and look for ways of alleviating poverty, the efficiency concept is thus especially relevant. At the end of the conference, Mr Dadzie, whose term was extended for another year, said the meeting marked a turning point and reflected 'a remarkable unity of purpose' which would 'command the adherence of everyone'. There are a lot of inconsistencies to be ironed out back at Unctad headquarters in Geneva, and the organisation's role as a catalyst will only be assured when the new committees and working groups have proved their effectiveness. But, as the Brazilian delegates commented: 'This is the first time Unctad has even come up with a proper set of priorities. And with the reforms in place we can tackle the substance.'  -------------------------------------------------------------          DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: PERCENTAGE GROWTH               IN VOLUME OF EXPORTS 1980-1989*  -------------------------------------------------------------                                  1980-1985     1985-1989  ------------------------------------------------------------- All developing countries              -1.2           9.5 Africa                                -4.1           2.5   North Africa                        -4.9           5.0   Sub-Saharan Africa                  -3.7           0.8 Asia                                   5.5           8.9   West Asia                          -12.3          11.4   South and South-East Asia            7.4          15.0 Latin America                          3.7           2.8  ------------------------------------------------------------- *Annual average.  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Unctad secretariat  -------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

In a exclusive interview with XINHUA and China Radio  International before his third state visit to China scheduled  for next Tuesday [3 May], President arap Moi said Kenya and  China are cooperating very well with each other in domains such  as politics, education, culture, economy and trade.    He highly commended the Chinese personnel in various  projects  in Kenya for their hard but enthusiastic work.    President arap Moi said that Kenya in Africa is far from  China in Asia, but they are both developing countries, and are  facing the common tasks that all developing countries are facing.    He rapped the press in Western developed countries over  ignoring to report various development in Third World countries.  Instead, he said, they attack them on the so-called  human-rights issue which was a gross distortion of facts.    He warned the Western media not to create unrest in  developing countries by using the stick of human-rights.    Referring to the problems the developing countries are  facing, President arap Moi said that the main issues in the  present world are peace and development, adding that where there  is no peace, there is no development. He said that the big  threat to peace in Third World countries is poverty which is the  main root to cause turmoil in those countries.    He appeal to the developing countries, particularly African  countries to intensify the South-South cooperation and exploit  their own resources for development.    Recalling the previous visits in 1980 and 1988, he said he  was very much impressed by the Chinese economic development. He  hoped that the coming visit would further promote friendly  cooperation between Kenya and China in various domains.     "

While the west worries about the endangered black rhino and loss of bio-diversity, most Africans are too exhausted from the daily struggle to find fuel and water to care about the destruction of their environment. The priorities of each seem irreconcilable, and yet, they need not be. What is needed is a greater awareness in the industrialised world of how its policies exacerbate Africa's environmental crisis. And African governments need to place greater emphasis on combatting the extreme poverty which is a cause, as well as a result, of environmental degradation. There is little time to reverse the damage. At current growth rates, Sub-Saharan Africa's population of 600m will double in 22 years. The World Bank estimates the growth rate will decline from the present 3.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent at the end of the decade, as Aids takes its toll and family planning becomes more widespread. However, even this decline will not be enough to prevent the population doubling early in the next century. Already, women in the Sahel and many parts of east Africa walk 15km each day to gather a bundle of firewood. In a few years, there will be more mouths to feed and less wood to burn. Over-cultivation and over-grazing are transforming much of the continent into a vast wasteland: an area twice the size of India, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), is under direct threat of desertification. In addition, Africa is losing 2.7m hectares of woodlands every year. In most countries, forests are disappearing because people need land for farming, not wood to burn. When famine sweeps across Africa, the west calls it a natural disaster and spends billions of dollars in emergency food relief. But Africa's hunger is not simply a question of crop failure. In 1985, five out of six nations on a United Nations list of famine-afflicted countries were also racked by civil war. In Ethiopia, Chad, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, it was difficult to distinguish between drought-related famine and war-induced starvation. 'For the past 20 years, civil strife has indirectly wreaked as much devastation on the environment as any other cause in Africa,' argues Dr Roger Batty, an Oxford historian and consultant at UNEP. He believes western powers have been culpable of fuelling conflict by arming their client states on the continent. With the end of the cold war, however, superpower interest in conducting wars-by-proxy on the continent has evaporated, and it is hoped that the level of military aid to African governments will also fall. Environmental degradation can also add to the pressures from which conflict emerges. 'The next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile, not politics,' Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, now the UN secretary-general, warned in 1985. The Nile basin touches on nine other countries, reaching as far south as Tanzania and Zaire. All upstream nations are keen to extend land under irrigation by tapping Egypt's only source of water. 'Without political imagination,' Mr Boutros Ghali continued, 'Egypt will become a new Bangladesh fraught with drought and famine - but with one difference. This Bangladesh will be on the shores of the Mediterranean, half-an-hour by jet from the rich people in the north.' Already, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees, there are 5m displaced people on the continent. To call them refugees would be a misnomer, for most will never be able to return to their homes. Many are fleeing land too degraded to support them. Others seek refuge from civil war, government repression, ethnic conflict, or simply the desperate poverty of rural areas. But up to now, the west has preferred to focus on endangered animals, rather than endangered humans. The expulsion of Maasai pastoralists from 4,800 square miles of traditional grazing land which became the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania was one of the first important battles fought by western conservationists in Africa. All over the continent, 'experts' imposed the theory that wildlife and people should be separated. This principle is now being challenged. 'It is hard to imagine that 150,000 tourists are not causing greater environmental damage and disturbing wildlife far more than 2,000 Maasai ever did,' says Mr Raymond Bonner, a US journalist and author of At the Hand of Man: Peril and Hope for Africa's Wildlife. New solutions are required which marry the needs of local people to those of the environment. In Luwangwa, Zambia, hunting rights are auctioned among safari companies and the revenues are channelled to the local tribes. As a result, villagers have started supporting the national parks service and set up security committees to prevent poachers entering into their areas. The number of poached carcasses of elephants and black rhinos in Luwangwa fell by 90 per cent between 1985 and 1987. The lesson to be learned is that Africa needs an economic incentive to protect its wildlife. But western institutions - be they tourist or pharmaceutical companies - are often reluctant to pay the price. Far more worrying than the endangered black rhino are Africa's disappearing insects and plants - species that could hold the cure for Aids. Already, Africa has destroyed 65 per cent of its original wildlife habitats. Concerns about the staggering loss of bio-diversity are not exaggerated. A substance discovered in the rosy periwinkle, a species unique to Madagascar, has quadrupled the survival rate for children suffering from leukemia. Worldwide sales of the rosy periwinkle drug now earn more than Dollars 100m a year, but not a cent has accrued to Madagascar in compensation for preserving the plant's habitat. A growing number of ecologists now argue that the best way of persuading African nations to protect their bio-diversity is by paying them to leave their natural resources intact. What is found in Africa may be needed in Europe and the rest of the developed world. Paper mills in the US and Japan, for example, are experimenting with an African plant, Kenaf, a relative of jute, which produces five times more pulp than the average tree. After 30 years of investigations, the US Department of Agriculture has singled out Kenaf as the most promising substitute to produce tree-free paper. It is an annual crop, whereas man-made forests require up to 60 years in the northern hemisphere to reach maturity. US newspapers which have tested Kenaf newsprint report that it is brighter, reproduces better pictures, and uses less ink, which does not stain hands. Africa's environmental problems are often portrayed in doomsday tones. In reality, they are neither insoluble nor insurmountable. What is needed is a radical reassessment of the value the industrialised world places on Africa's environmental health. It is an issue the west ignores at its peril.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

The burdens of natural and man-made disasters, crippling debt and enervating disease have become intolerable. Yet, as Africa's plight has become more acute over the years, the international response has tended to be belated and poorly co-ordinated. Spasms of compassion have taken the place of pre-emptive action. Hastily planned operations in Somalia and Rwanda have not been sustained. Other states in need of help, such as Sierra Leone, have been abandoned. Western policy has been damaged by allowing the principle that aid should be linked to good governance and human rights to be influenced by short-term expediency. In Kenya, the country's first multi-party elections for over 20 years were flawed, but nevertheless won international endorsement. Elsewhere, the principle seems negotiable: a multi-party poll was a precondition for resumption of normal aid to Kenya, but not for Uganda. Nigeria is the latest test of the international community's willingness to assist an African country in distress, before pictures of disaster appear in western living rooms. Although the US was sufficiently concerned to have sent an emissary to Lagos, Jesse Jackson was thought too close to former military leader General Ibrahim Babangida, and to Chief Moshood Abiola, the jailed opposition leader, to play honest broker. As for the UK, it emerges with no credit, for it has not seen fit to send a foreign office minister to assess a crisis which could destabilise the region. Western powers may have assumed prominent roles in Somalia and Rwanda, but they have failed to meet responsibilities elsewhere: in Zaire, for example. The west must even bear some responsibility for the resumption of the Angolan civil war after the 1992 election. Namibia's transition to independence under UN monitors required some 6,000 personnel, while Angola had to make do with barely 600. Africa's problems are complex and daunting. But the west can act sooner, do more and perform better. The continent's plight requires a more effectively co-ordinated and longer-term effort. The disarray in the ranks of donors and aid agencies must also end. The way influential charities - such as Oxfam and Christian Aid - the Economic Commission for Africa and other UN agencies are at odds with the World Bank over reform policies is profoundly damaging. Yet there is more common ground than seems to be the case. The need for radical debt relief, greater attention to the impact of reform on the poor and strengthened management capacity, are concerns common to all. More than 10 years ago, the World Bank called for 'a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern'. Such a compact is now urgent. Without it, Africa's crisis could become a catastrophe.   Countries:-  NGZ  Nigeria, Africa.     MXZ  Mexico.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT934-16727 ,"FT934-16727 _AN-DJEC1ADJFT 931005   FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lethal cocktail exacerbating economic problems in Africa      From Mr DAVID BRYER   Sir, World Bank President Lewis Preston (Personal View, September 27) is right; the magnitude of sub-Sahara's deepening crisis presents the international community with a formidable development challenge. The question is, are the policies of northern governments, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund capable of meeting it? Not if proceedings at the World Bank-IMF annual meeting are anything to go by. Yet again, northern governments missed an opportunity to address sub-Saharan Africa's debt crisis, with British efforts to secure agreement on a plan to write off two-thirds of the region's debt foundering on Japanese resistance. The upshot is that debt servicing will continue to drain the region of Dollars l0bn annually, or a quarter of export earnings. These resources are desperately needed for investment in health, education and the physical infrastructure vital to economic recovery. With an average debt-to-export ratio of 400 per cent, higher than for Latin America during the worst days of its debt crisis, the chances of sub-Saharan Africa attracting the private capital which Mr Preston regards as vital to recovery are negligible. That is why Oxfam is calling on the World Bank and northern governments to increase diplomatic pressure on Japan to comply with the Trinidad terms. As your leader of September 28 ('Debt relief cannot wait') rightly observes, debt write-offs alone will not resolve Africa's crisis. Equally urgent is a review of structural adjustment programmes, designed and implemented under World Bank and IMF tutelage. Nobody with a concern for Africa can deny the case for adjustment, or the damage inflicted by policies such as over-valued exchange rates, blanket protectionism of inefficient industries, or the heavy taxation of peasant producers by state marketing monopolies. However, adjustment policies are manifestly not establishing a platform either for sustained economic recovery or for successful poverty alleviation. This is reflected in the fact that investment levels in countries undergoing adjustment are lower than in 1980, and in the persistence of high inflation and unsustainable budget deficits. The IMF's dogmatic attachment to reducing inflation through punitive interest rates, and to rapid import liberalisation, provides part of the explanation for this failure. Across the region, a lethal cocktail of rising costs and cut-throat competition from abroad has caused mass unemployment, and the collapse of labour intensive industries across the region. In many countries, it is the resulting shortages of goods, rather than lax monetary policy, which is fuelling inflation. Oxfam believes that African governments, northern governments, non-government organisations and the World Bank should unite around a new agenda for recovery and social justice. That agenda must enshrine a commitment to debt relief, and to redistributive policies which enable poor people to benefit from market reforms. Without that commitment, Africa's accelerating descent into social and economic catastrophe will continue uninterrupted into the next century.

0,FT941-2906 ,"FT941-2906 _AN-ECRDQADZFT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Africa's gloom   Sub-Saharan Africa's economic decline may have been arrested, and in some countries modestly reversed. But the long-awaited World Bank report on structural adjustment in the region is deeply worrying, nevertheless. Current growth rates among the best performers are 'still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades'. With today's poor policies, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its income per head of the mid-1970s, says the report. The sheer misery of countries not covered in the report can only be guessed at: Sudan, Africa's largest state, Zaire, potentially one of its wealthiest, Angola, Somalia and Liberia. Meanwhile, Burundi, which was doing rather well, has had a coup and Nigeria has slid backwards, after having been a leading performer between 1987 and 1991. Last weekend it was given a justified ticking off by Mr Kim Jaycox, the bank's vice-president for Africa. The fundamental questions are why Africa has been left trailing by the rest of the developing world and what can be done to remedy the calamity. Some of the answers may emerge in Tokyo this week, where the Japanese finance ministry has brought together World Bank and IMF officials, other donors and African governments, to discuss lessons from east Asia's success. Mr Lee Kuan Yew of economically successful Singapore made a start last November, when he offered Africa his own sensible checklist: clean government; an effective and adequately paid civil service; family planning; 'pragmatism, not dogma, in economics'; letting foreigners and local entrepreneurs 'get on with their business'; universal education; and going 'for results not political correctness'. Mr Lee had another piece of advice, one that goes to the heart of Africa's development disaster: maintain national solidarity and social cohesion. Africa faces many formidable obstacles in its efforts to recover. The infrastructure is desperately poor, privatisation painfully slow, the external debt burden heavy, management weak and education inadequate. In all of these areas outsiders can offer some assistance. But the continent's most formidable hurdles, those of social fragmentation and brutal political exploitation, are not susceptible to outside intervention. Too often governments fail to act on behalf of their countries. Obligations extend, instead, in concentric circles, beginning with family, village and clan, and embracing tribe, but not country. It is not Africa's fault that boundaries are arbitrary, that former nation states were divided, or several nations encompassed within newly created territories. The Organisation of African Unity's decision to retain those colonial boundaries was right. But after independence, African leaders failed to build either the machinery or, more important, the attitudes required by functioning modern states. Building such a social compact may require a new generation of leaders. Make no mistake, structural adjustment is necessary, even though it is bound to work slowly. But it may not work at all if those with power do not feel obliged to serve the interests of the people.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

At the meeting, Qian Qichen pointed out: Since the  establishment of Sino-Mauritian diplomatic relations, exchange  and cooperation between the two countries in the political,  economic, and cultural areas have expanded continually. The  Chinese Government has always cherished friendship with  Mauritius and is ready to work together with the Mauritian  Government in exploring new ways for mutually beneficial  cooperation.    Kasenally believed that Qian Qichen's visit would certainly  result in the deepening of mutual understanding and expansion of  cooperation, especially in the economic and trade fields,  between the two countries.    The two foreign ministers briefed each other on their  respective country's stance on the conflict in Somalia, problems  in South Africa, reform of the Security Council, and the  establishment of a new international political and economic  order.    Qian Qichen said: Under the new international situation,  many African countries are facing aggravating difficulties and  widening their gap with the developed countries. To reform the  irrational economic order and help African countries shake off  poverty is a pressing task facing the international community.  Only when the economy of the African countries shows  improvement can the global economy grow healthily. Africa's  development needs the support of the world, and Africa's  participation is also essential for the development of the world.    Kasenally pointed out: The solution to problems in Somalia  and other African nations will depend primarily on their  peoples. He said: It is necessary to bring into play the OAU's  role instead of relying on solutions imposed externally. The  establishment of an international order must be participated by  all small and big nations on an equal footing and must not be  manipulated by one or two blocs again.    Prior to the meeting, the two foreign ministers attended a  ceremony to sign an agreement on the Chinese Government's  donation of general goods to Mauritius, and signed the agreement  for their respective governments.    Qian Qichen and his party arrived in Mauritius on the  evening  of 19 January for a two-day goodwill visit to the island country  in the Indian Ocean.     "

What is needed is a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'  - World Bank, 1981 The warnings have gone unheeded. Now come signs of a continent under intolerable strain, poised between crisis and catastrophe, lacking both the capacity and the will to implement economic and political reforms. Rwanda is the latest in Africa's roll call of disasters over the past 20 years, during which at least 10m people have died and as many have become refugees. For some governments, the strain has proved too much. Zaire, almost straddling the waist of Africa, is less a state than a collection of fiefdoms. Sudan, Africa's largest country, has been destroyed by civil war, and Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Angola are joining them. Worse may be to come, for two of Africa's most important countries are now at risk: Nigeria in the west and Kenya in the east are both showing signs of stress. Nigeria's leaders squandered Dollars 100bn of oil earnings over the decade of the oil boom from the 1970s to the early 1990s. External debt, currently Dollars 34bn, rises by Dollars 6bn a year, the civil service is undermined by political interference and corruption, per capita gross domestic product has halved since 1980, the fault line is deepening between Moslem north and Christian south. Meanwhile Kenya is battling against impossible odds. Its population has tripled over the past 20 years to 25m, land hunger grows, unemployment rises, and 400,000 school-leavers compete annually for 20,000 jobs in formal employment. Corruption and vested interests stand in the way of effective reform. Meanwhile Africa's rare 'success stories' such as Ghana and Uganda, are not inspiring. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warned a recent World Bank review. The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Unless Sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, says the Bank. Dissenting voices suggest ways out of the predicament. 'More aid]' cries one. But aid has increased and the crisis deepens. Net aid transfers to Africa increased from 5.6 per cent of regional GDP in the early 1970s to 8.3 per cent in the late 70s, reaching 11.7 per cent of GDP by 1990. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn, has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Reform the international trading system,' cry others, pointing to Africa's deteriorating terms of trade. Perhaps, comes the response, but why has Africa lost its market share of cocoa, tea, coffee to other third world countries who live under the same system? 'Foreign investment is the key,' say others. But who will invest in a continent where the infrastructure has deteriorated, skills are in short supply, and instability endemic? 'Impose democracy by making aid conditional on good governance,' say western governments. But democracy isn't working; and +++++++ End of Leg 3 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ the World Bank's report on the 'east Asian miracle' suggests there is not necessarily a link, says another. What can be done? First, the World Bank, the continent's leading donor, and the aid agencies must find common cause. Africa needs their vigorous lobbying of the west's decision makers. John Clark, who used to work with Oxfam, put it well in his book, Democratising Development: The Role of Voluntary Organisations. Non-governmental organisations, he says, 'will make little headway unless their ideas are grounded in economic reality and unless they search for positive as well as negative lessons within the programmes of the World Bank and other practitioners of development orthodoxy.' Once there is agreement on the economic and political agenda, non-governmental organisations should play a greater role. In certain countries, where the mangement capacity of government is weak, NGOs should run primary health care, or primary education, or drought relief. The private sector should make investment decisions, rather than aid workers without the necessary skills. Increase transparency. Too often donors are willing to conceal what they know of corruption in African governments. They fail to insist on minimum levels of accountability and access to information. By withholding or denying African electorates information about structural adjustment programmes, they stifle debate about economic policy. Constitution making. Hopes for the revival of democracy will be dashed unless Africa draws up constitutions which take account of ethnic, religious and regional differences. Rebuild the parties and institutions of democratic government. Set levels of military spending at a percentage of GDP below spending on housing, education and health. Radical measures to ease Africa's debt burden should be accompanied by tougher monitoring of reform policies, including donor officials in institutions such as central banks and finance ministries. If governments are not willing to embrace structural adjustment and good governance requirements, then donors should only finance humanitarian projects. Above all, the west must be motivated by self-interest as much as compassion in its response to the African crisis. Possible solutions will only be implemented when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat and as a loss. As Africa's economy declines, so immigration to southern Europe will rise; Moslem extremism will intensify; drug-trafficking will increase; disease, whether Aids or the discovery of bubonic plague in Zaire, will pose a serious health problem; environmental erosion or neglect will lead to the destruction of valuable flora and fauna. Africa cannot be ring-fenced: and the longer a co-ordinated response to its crisis is postponed, the more daunting become the problems and more serious the consequences of failure.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  AFRICA: FROM CRISIS TO CATASTROPHE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country            Group      Major armed      Refugees from                  rebellion*    conflict**       the country                                                   ('000)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1980-89       1989-92          1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mozambique           no            yes           1,730 Somalia             yes            yes             870 Ethiopia            yes            yes             840 Liberia              no            yes             670 Angola              yes            yes             400 Sudan               yes            yes             270  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-state armed groups of over 1,000 fighters, in conflict with other such groups **Involving more than 1,000 battle-related deaths with government forces  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           WORLD LENDING RELATIVE TO MILITARY SPENDING  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country         Military        Average annual       Loans as                 expenditures    World Bank loans     % of total                as % of GDP      per capita          World Bank Loans                                  (dollars)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Major rise in military spending  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1960    1990     1960s  1989-91     1960s   1989-91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ethiopia        1.6     13.5      10.2     77.4        1.0     0.4 Tanzania        0.1      6.9       5.3    283.0        0.5     1.3 Zambia          1.1      3.2       5.7     92.7        0.5     0.4 Burkino Faso    0.6      2.8       0.1     68.2        0.0     0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

In economic terms, this  represents an estimated $1.7 billion loss in 1995 for sub-Sahara  African countries.

Princess Anne of Great Britain, who is in the area as  part of a Save the Children tour, stumbled upon a large camp  occupied by people suffering from cholera, something, it seems,  the Ethiopian authorities are keen to cover up. Correspondent  Lucy Hanan says that when the princess arrived there, the place  was actually sealed off by guards and the local press was not  allowed in. She says she saw four tents full of people who were  affected by what she was told later was cholera. The affected  people were in bad condition and the place did not look at all  good. She says that according to reliable sources, there are  now up to 130 cases a day, and about 3,000 people have already  been affected by cholera. She says that the reason that  governments are reluctant to acknowledge cholera is that the  disease is associated with poverty and poor sanitation.  Sometimes it affects exports, mainly coffee, which people fear  may be contaminated.

Dr. Kwaku Kakari,  district medical officer in charge of the Wassa Akropong health  center, told newsmen at Wassa Akropong that the disease appeared  to be prevalent around Samreboi. He said last year alone, 696  cases were reported at the Eti and Pii hospitals at Samreboi and  41 cases at the Catholic hospital at Asankrangwa. Dr. Kakari  said efforts have been made by the epidemiology division of the  Ministry of Health to educate the public about the disease and  drugs have been supplied for free distribution at the epidemic  zones.

Reporter Femi Bobade says the state administrator, Navy Captain  Adetoye Sode, visited the area yesterday to assess the  situation. He said that mostly affected are the people of Iruwa  and Lanlate, the two major towns in the local government.  Already, a large number of the people are receiving treatment  at various health centers in the local government area. On  arrival at Iruwa, headquarters of the local government area,  Administrator Sode expressed concern over the lack of potable  water in the area despite the fact that there were two  reservoirs in the area. He directed the director, personnel  management, of the local government to liaise with the water  corporation in investigating the matter and finding a lasting  solution to it. At Lanlate, the administrator was shown about  50 of the victims with the disease in various parts of their  bodies. Addressing the people, the Oyo State commissioner for  health, Mrs. Oluyoyede Fatunde, appealed to them to always boil  or filter their water before drinking.

The interventional project, which will cover  18 parishes in Masaka District, was launched yesterday by the  acting representative of the WHO in Uganda, Professor (Abiye Obo  Koribo). He said the project epitomizes the aims of the WHO that  the people of the world should receive adequate health care by  the year 2000. Prof. (Obo Koribo) said this calls for the  involvement of community participation and empowerment of the  people with affordable and appropriate technology for their own  health. He said research should not be sterile, but applied in  the field.    The head of the program, Dr. (Dan Malda), said the project  is  expected to take five years and the actual intervention work  would start in June or July this year.

0," LA070389-0070   77822    July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 10; Column 1; Foreign Desk      933 words      UNREST IN BLACK HOMELAND IN S. AFRICA LEAVES 11 DEAD      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      A bitter dispute over South Africa's homelands policy erupted in weekend  rioting, leaving nine black police officers and two civilians dead in  Leeuwfontein, a village recently forced by Pretoria to become part of the  nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana.    Bophuthatswana police went door to door Sunday, arresting at least several  hundred residents of the town, including two key tribal leaders. And police  helicopters scoured the countryside for others who had fled onto white-owned  farms in South Africa seeking refuge. By nightfall, only a few women and  children remained in the shacks of the rural community of 18,000.    The melee came six months after South Africa's white minority-led government  decreed that Leeuwfontein and next-door Braklaagte were to become part of  Bophuthatswana, a homeland comprising seven separate tracts of land inside  South Africa. So far, court challenges to the South African proclamation have  been unsuccessful, and the angry residents are seeking permission to appeal.      'A Desperate Point'    ""It had reached a very desperate point where people had lost faith in anything  ever returning to normal,"" Aninka Claassens, a spokesman for the Transvaal  Rural Action Committee, said in an interview Sunday night. ""They had tried  everything.""    The Action Committee provides legal support for Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte and  has worked extensively in the towns, about 180 miles northwest of Johannesburg.    The violence was the latest in a series of incidents that have hampered  Pretoria's 13-year-old attempt to force blacks into ethnic homelands, thereby  depriving them of their South African citizenship. More than 11 million of  South Africa's 26 million blacks live in 10 homelands, four of which, like  Bophuthatswana, have been declared independent states but remain almost totally  dependent on South Africa.      Little Recognition    Most of the world refuses to recognize the Pretoria-created homelands as  sovereign states. In fact, international anti-apartheid groups have  consistently called on entertainers to boycott the Sun City casino resort,  which is located in Bophuthatswana and pays taxes to its 12-year-old black  government.    The latest trouble broke out Saturday afternoon during a meeting of several  thousand Leeuwfontein residents that was called to discuss the efforts to  extricate themselves from Bophuthatswana's control. The town's population had  swelled because it was the end of the month and many migrant workers had  returned home with their paychecks.    Some residents said fighting erupted after police arrived to break up the  meeting. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and  witnesses said they heard automatic weapons fire.      Four Officers Killed    The Bophuthatswana authorities said four police officers were killed when their  armored personnel carrier was destroyed by a gasoline bomb. South African  authorities, who last year stepped in to put down an attempted military coup  d'etat in Bophuthatswana's capital, Mmabatho, said they were not involved in  the weekend incidents.    But Paul van der Merwe, a farmer who lives near Leeuwfontein, said he saw South  African security forces on Sunday conferring with Bophuthatswana police  officials on a remote section of his farm, in South Africa just outside the  Bophuthatswana border.    Van der Merwe said dozens of residents of Leeuwfontein have used his farm to  escape harassment by the Bophuthatswana police in recent months. And the farmer  has refused requests by South African and Bophuthatswana authorities to press  charges against the villagers for trespassing, saying he relies on them to help  him plant and harvest his 4,000-acre farm and ranch.    ""I'm not going to do that. We are neighbors,"" he said.    Before Jan. 1, the land that includes Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte had been part  of South Africa, in between two distinct sections of Bophuthatswana. The  government proclamation incorporating the two villages into the homeland  surprised most residents, who said they had not been consulted, as required by  South African law.    The two communities didn't want to lose their South African citizenship, but  they also feared retribution from Bophuthatswana authorities. The region's  Tswana tribal chiefs have been violently opposed to Bophuthatswana's South  Africa-supported president, Lucas Manyane Mangope, also a Tswana chief, since  the 1950s.      Patrolled by Police    Since they became part of Bophuthatswana, Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte have been  heavily patrolled by the homeland police, and sporadic violence has been  reported. Eighty people were injured during a police raid in Leeuwfontein in  March, and residents said that the authorities beat or arrested anyone who  refused to say they loved Bophuthatswana.    About one-third of South Africa's residents -- or about half of the nation's  blacks -- live in the homelands, which cover only 13% of the country's land  area. Pretoria's original intent was to counter the increasing demands for  black voting rights in South Africa by creating independent states outside  white-designated South Africa where the country's voteless black majority could  exercise their political rights.    But the policy has been a drain on Pretoria's coffers, and it has come under  heavy criticism from outside and inside the government in recent years. South  Africa spends more than $1 billion annually supporting the homeland  governments, but, because the land is generally rugged and the homeland leaders  often corrupt, poverty remains endemic.

AFRICA LEAVES 11 DEAD      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      A bitter dispute over South Africa's homelands policy erupted in weekend  rioting, leaving nine black police officers and two civilians dead in  Leeuwfontein, a village recently forced by Pretoria to become part of the  nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana.    Bophuthatswana police went door to door Sunday, arresting at least several  hundred residents of the town, including two key tribal leaders. And police  helicopters scoured the countryside for others who had fled onto white-owned  farms in South Africa seeking refuge. By nightfall, only a few women and  children remained in the shacks of the rural community of 18,000.    The melee came six months after South Africa's white minority-led government  decreed that Leeuwfontein and next-door Braklaagte were to become part of  Bophuthatswana, a homeland comprising seven separate tracts of land inside  South Africa. So far, court challenges to the South African proclamation have  been unsuccessful, and the angry residents are seeking permission to appeal.      'A Desperate Point'    ""It had reached a very desperate point where people had lost faith in anything  ever returning to normal,"" Aninka Claassens, a spokesman for the Transvaal  Rural Action Committee, said in an interview Sunday night. ""They had tried  everything.""    The Action Committee provides legal support for Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte and  has worked extensively in the towns, about 180 miles northwest of Johannesburg.    The violence was the latest in a series of incidents that have hampered  Pretoria's 13-year-old attempt to force blacks into ethnic homelands, thereby  depriving them of their South African citizenship. More than 11 million of  South Africa's 26 million blacks live in 10 homelands, four of which, like  Bophuthatswana, have been declared independent states but remain almost totally  dependent on South Africa.      Little Recognition    Most of the world refuses to recognize the Pretoria-created homelands as  sovereign states. In fact, international anti-apartheid groups have  consistently called on entertainers to boycott the Sun City casino resort,  which is located in Bophuthatswana and pays taxes to its 12-year-old black  government.    The latest trouble broke out Saturday afternoon during a meeting of several  thousand Leeuwfontein residents that was called to discuss the efforts to  extricate themselves from Bophuthatswana's control. The town's population had  swelled because it was the end of the month and many migrant workers had  returned home with their paychecks.    Some residents said fighting erupted after police arrived to break up the  meeting. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and  witnesses said they heard automatic weapons fire.      Four Officers Killed    The Bophuthatswana authorities said four police officers were killed when their  armored personnel carrier was destroyed by a gasoline bomb. South African  authorities, who last year stepped in to put down an attempted military coup  d'etat in Bophuthatswana's capital, Mmabatho, said they were not involved in  the weekend incidents.    But Paul van der Merwe, a farmer who lives near Leeuwfontein, said he saw South  African security forces on Sunday conferring with Bophuthatswana police  officials on a remote section of his farm, in South Africa just outside the  Bophuthatswana border.    Van der Merwe said dozens of residents of Leeuwfontein have used his farm to  escape harassment by the Bophuthatswana police in recent months. And the farmer  has refused requests by South African and Bophuthatswana authorities to press  charges against the villagers for trespassing, saying he relies on them to help  him plant and harvest his 4,000-acre farm and ranch.    ""I'm not going to do that. We are neighbors,"" he said.    Before Jan. 1, the land that includes Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte had been part  of South Africa, in between two distinct sections of Bophuthatswana. The  government proclamation incorporating the two villages into the homeland  surprised most residents, who said they had not been consulted, as required by  South African law.    The two communities didn't want to lose their South African citizenship, but  they also feared retribution from Bophuthatswana authorities. The region's  Tswana tribal chiefs have been violently opposed to Bophuthatswana's South  Africa-supported president, Lucas Manyane Mangope, also a Tswana chief, since  the 1950s.      Patrolled by Police    Since they became part of Bophuthatswana, Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte have been  heavily patrolled by the homeland police, and sporadic violence has been  reported. Eighty people were injured during a police raid in Leeuwfontein in  March, and residents said that the authorities beat or arrested anyone who  refused to say they loved Bophuthatswana.    About one-third of South Africa's residents -- or about half of the nation's  blacks -- live in the homelands, which cover only 13% of the country's land  area. Pretoria's original intent was to counter the increasing demands for  black voting rights in South Africa by creating independent states outside  white-designated South Africa where the country's voteless black majority could  exercise their political rights.    But the policy has been a drain on Pretoria's coffers, and it has come under  heavy criticism from outside and inside the government in recent years. South  Africa spends more than $1 billion annually supporting the homeland  governments, but, because the land is generally rugged and the homeland leaders  often corrupt, poverty remains endemic.

PRESS, Christian Science Monitor      WASHINGTON      Much of Africa will have above average or even record harvests this year, as it  did last year. But many Africans are still going hungry.    The surge in food production, due chiefly to improved weather conditions,  highlights what one World Bank official describes as the paradox of ""full  silos, empty stomachs.""    Big harvests are not helping poorly paid or jobless city residents who cannot  afford to buy enough food, even if prices fall slightly. And in rural areas,  many small farmers who cannot grow enough for their families lack the money to  buy extra food.    Thus, even as many experts seek ways to further boost Africa's food production,  a smaller number are looking for ways to boost incomes to help the hungry poor  afford decent diets.      Consumption Declining    According to the World Bank, nearly one-fourth of Africa's population -- more  than 100 million people -- do not get enough to eat. Food consumption per  person has been declining for most Africans since 1980, the bank says.    Large-scale famine continues in southern Sudan, due to a five-year civil war.  War also hampers farm production in at least three other countries -- Angola,  Mozambique, and Ethiopia.    But elsewhere, ""The basic part of hunger (in Africa) is an income problem,""  says G. Edward Schuh, a former economic aide to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and  Jimmy Carter, and ex-World Bank director of agriculture and rural development.  ""It's basically a poverty problem.""    There is a growing recognition among experts of a poverty-hunger link. In a  recent issue of the publication Africa Report, World Bank vice-president for  Africa, Edward Jaycox, said: ""Hunger is not mainly caused by transitory  droughts or crop failures or interruptions in the market. . . . Rather, chronic  food insecurity is caused by poverty. . . . ""      Income Declining    Per capita income has been declining in Africa for several decades, falling by  25% since 1980, Jaycox says.    ""We cannot treat the hunger problem as (only) a food supply problem,"" says  Sholom Reutlinger, a World Bank official.    World Bank President Barber Conable has called for more efforts to help the  poor afford more food. But for now, most World Bank and other aid efforts  remain directed at boosting food production rather than income.    Diverting more international and African attention to incomes will not be easy,  Reutlinger says. Larger farmers and equipment manufacturers push to keep the  focus on increasing crop production. And donors and African bureaucracies are  long accustomed to such a focus, he says.    Reutlinger and other specialists interviewed support efforts to boost food  production. But, they say, with the improved harvests, now is a good time to  try harder to find ways to help more people afford the food already available  in their countries.      New Programs Urged    They call for such programs as:    * Hiring small farmers in the off-season to build rural roads and bridges and  paying them with vouchers that can be exchanged for food.    Malawi has begun such a program, and the World Bank is considering helping fund  it. If such programs are not run during the slack farming season, however, they  may pull farmers away from regular farm work, one expert says.    *Paying rural children with food for each week of school they attend.    This would help many families by reducing their expenses on food, and would  encourage school attendance, says Schuh, now dean of the Humphrey Institute of  Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. A few programs like this have  been launched in schools in India, but he is not aware of any in Africa, Schuh  says.    Schuh says the more common types of aid to farmers also help feed the poor. For  example, assisting export-crop farmers through government programs such as  credit and improved roads often leads to their hiring more labor, giving the  laborers more income.    And government aid to farmers growing staple food crops also helps the poor by  reducing food prices, he adds.      Inadequate Storage    The challenge in Africa this year is what to do with the bumper crops already  in or expected. Storage facilities in most countries are inadequate.    Where storage is available, Reutlinger suggests that the local governments buy  the surplus and use it to pay for work projects carried out by the poor.    Dean Schuh says countries should export what they cannot use or sell, and save  the foreign exchange that is earned to import food during lean years.  Cumbersome as that may sound, it would avoid losses of food in storage to  rodents and insects, he says.      Potential for Growth    Africa has the potential to produce enough food for its people, says Curtis  Farrar, a World Bank expert on agriculture.    And although he acknowledges that a continuing high population growth rate --  Africa's is the highest in the world -- could offset production increases,  Farrar says the growth rate is almost certain to slow. It will slow as incomes  and education rise along with urbanization and couples have fewer children.    Some experts are not so optimistic. Family planning programs in Africa have  made some progress but no major gains so far.    Farrar is executive secretary of the World Bank's Consultative Group on  International Agricultural Research, which has several research centers in  Africa.      No Dominant Crop    No ""green revolution"" is likely to happen in Africa the way it did in Asia in  the 1960s, Farrar says. Africa lacks the kind of single dominant crop that Asia  (rice) had, he explains.    But some crops are showing major potential. Sorghum production has doubled in  some parts in recent years, and has more potential. Local crops such as cow  peas are also showing significant promise, he says.    Improved corn seed has tripled yields in Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, says  Michael Cowlinson, a social scientist at CGIAR headquarters in Washington. Such  increases have been accompanied by more effective use of fertilizers, better  planting methods, and local research, he says.    But Farrar and Cowlinson point to a weak link in efforts to boost food  production: In most of Africa, long-range research is inadequate. They also  cite lack of focus and coordination among donor nations aiding agricultural  production efforts.

By IAN MacKENZIE, REUTERS      MAPUTO, Mozambique      Peace is proving an elusive commodity in Mozambique, where a population of 15  million is teetering on the edge of famine.    ""Every issue you discuss always comes back to the same point -- the need for  peace,"" said a senior European diplomat.    Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk's efforts to end his country's racial separation  policy of apartheid are also backing the Renamo guerrillas fighting the  Mozambique government.    ""The people trying to stop the internal revolution in South Africa are the same  people destabilizing Mozambique,"" the European diplomat said. ""If you believe  the revolution in South Africa is irreversible, you must believe peace will  come back to Mozambique. War doesn't make sense anymore.""    The head of the U.N. development program in Mozambique, Peter Simkin, warned  that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the  population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic.    More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the United  Nations estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years  beginning with 1980.    ""Mozambique is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area  of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or  early next year and we have no resources to fall back on,"" Simkin said in an  interview. ""We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive  relief campaign.""    Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the  Persian Gulf crisis, reconstruction demands for Eastern Europe and ""donor  weariness.""    Government and church leaders in Mozambique were optimistic in early September  that a peace agreement with Renamo was possible after two rounds of talks in  Rome. President Joaquim Chissano, who has promised the country's first-ever  multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked  about peace by Christmas.    But Renamo's refusal to attend a third round of talks in September has deadened  optimism, with Chissano throwing the blame squarely on the rebels.    Diplomats note the ruling Frelimo Party in Maputo has basically preempted all  Renamo demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market  economy, political pluralism and a free press.    ""You know if you have an open multi-party system, Renamo has no hope of gaining  power,"" one diplomat said.    The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of Zimbabwe troops from  Mozambique and an end to attacks on Renamo base areas as a prerequisite for  further talks.    Diplomats estimate Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops in Mozambique, primarily to  protect the so-called Beira corridor rail link from Zimbabwe to the Indian  Ocean port of Beira.    "" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all Zimbabwe  troops,"" President Chissano told journalists at the United Nations in New York  recently. ""All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops  should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow  if possible.""    Renamo, the Mozambique Resistance Movement, originally was set up by the white  minority government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia as a destabilizing  force after Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in June, 1975.    Diplomats in southern Africa said the Rhodesians recruited Renamo guerrillas  from among black members of Portugal's former colonial forces. They were used  primarily against black nationalists operating out of Mozambique against  Rhodesia.    When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe with independence in 1980, the former white  security forces handed Renamo over to South Africa, which continued to use it  against Maputo.    Pretoria and Maputo signed the Nkomati Accord of nonaggression and  good-neighborliness in 1984 and the South African government subsequently cut  all official links with Renamo.    Chissano himself has said he trusted Pretoria's good faith.    Diplomats also believe South Africa severed ties with Renamo, cutting it off  from weapons and communications supplies.    But they said it appears right-wing groups in South Africa, including  Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in Mozambique,  continued to support the rebels.    They believe other support came from groups within Portugal -- Renamo's  official headquarters are in Lisbon -- and also Britain, West Germany and the  United States.

0,FT911-2650 ,"FT911-2650 _AN-BD2BCABOFT 910429   FT  29 APR 91 / Challenge to foster human capital: As bankers and finance ministers gather in Washington, the World Bank looks for fresh vigour under a new chief      By MICHAEL PROWSE   How can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote development in the Third World? That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes over as president of the World Bank this September. As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no shortage of advice. The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector. The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans. Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation. Mr Preston may relax on one count. Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day. More than 110m Third World children lack access even to primary education. Horrific inequality abounds. In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10 per cent is 20 years less than for the richest 10 per cent. What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber Conable? Most reports are mixed. 'It is not an impressive bureaucracy,' says Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. 'The morale of staff is lousy,' says Mr Charles Flickner, a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank. Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in 1986 knowing little about either banking or development. Although now well-liked (partly for championing causes such as women's rights in the Third World), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank. Mr Percy Mistry, a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, and former senior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from 'presidential failure' during the 1980s. Mr Robert McNamara, a forceful chief executive in the 1970s, built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership from the top. But neither Mr Conable nor his predecessor, Mr A W 'Tom' Clausen, a commercial banker, could fill his shoes. For a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents: Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the EBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi. Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience. His third, one might add, will be quickly to establish his independence from the US Treasury which always browbeats a newcomer. What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit? In spite of recent progress in a few countries, such as Mexico, the past decade has been one of relative failure. Many Third World countries have gone backwards. Real per capita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, and mildly in Latin America. The biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and early 1980s. Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, in 1989, as a 'final solution' to the debt crisis. Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden of developing countries' private debts on condition that they implement market-oriented economic reforms. 'The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt. Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of Poland's official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors. Mr Williamson laughs. 'In the long run it will be impossible to isolate Poland,' he says. 'It is not so much more deserving than other countries.' But why was a Brady-type solution not launched much earlier? For most of the 1980s, the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness. The result of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some Dollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980. 'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington. (The IMF was equally short-sighted.) As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development. The main innovation of the 1980s was a switch from project lending to 'structural adjustment' lending. Making finance conditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic performance of developing countries. But studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive. This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank's policies were sometimes misguided. Professor John Toye, director of the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, recently completed an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes. He concludes (as do internal bank analyses) that policy-based lending has 'achieved something, particularly in relation to the external account, but not nearly as much as the bank and donor community hoped'. On average programmes have reduced balance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Product and led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP. Mr Feinberg calls the decline in investment the 'great shortcoming of structural adjustment lending in the 1980s'. (Investment to GNP ratios have fallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.) He says the bank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of adjustment by increasing investment. How can the bank do better in the 1990s? One problem is that it has lost leverage over many Third World governments. The maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries. According to Mr Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next five years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s. For the large number of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans, the net flow will be negative. Some analysts, including US Treasury officials, believe lacklustre performance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency (and sometimes corruption) of governments. The EBRD's constitution requires borrowers to be 'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics'. It also says 60 per cent of EBRD resources must be devoted to the commercial sector - private businesses and state concerns in the process of privatisation. The World Bank operates under very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political and only its small affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), can make direct loans to private businesses. Should the bank's charter be amended? Direct parallels between the bank and the EBRD are dubious. The EBRD is ministering to a region that has historical ties with western Europe and that has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets. Such values are alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development. If strict political conditionality had been imposed in the past, the bank could not have lent to a development star such as South Korea. Most analysts, however, say the bank should tighten up a little. Mr Flickner of the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist on Westminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that 'loans will benefit the majority of the people'. Bank officials say greater attention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of decision-taking. Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the private sector? Mr Conable, to his credit, is resisting the US Treasury's pressure. He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing countries. In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is in spheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governments play a dominant role even in industrialised countries. Indeed, one conclusion of Prof Toye's analysis is that policy-based loans would have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand the role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote economic liberalisation. Sir William Ryrie, the head of the IFC, says the objective of a large volume of public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed. 'What we are trying to do is facilitate the flow of private-sector funds into sound investments.' Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs; but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west? There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development. During the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums. It wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently fashionable in the industrialised world. But the notion that economic liberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned. The bank's own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly and to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care. 'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for International Economics, 'but education is more important.' He argues that the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to put resources into education and primary health care. Mr Feinberg at the Overseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way of 'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development'. The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital. Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas. Ideas are certainly important, but they do not build hospitals or schools. More money could be made available: a mere 10 per cent cut in western defence spending, for example, would pay for a doubling of official aid. Rather than tamely accepting the status quo, Mr Preston could use his platform to promote a more constructive attitude in rich countries.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 FALLS IN INVESTMENT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Domestic investment as % of GNP                                   1975-82         1983-90 All developing countries            26.7            23.6 Africa                              26.4            19.4 Middle East                         26.3            23.4 Latin America  Caribbean           23.3            18.3 Asia                                27.9            28.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMF  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             WORLD BANK DISBURSEMENTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             By region (Fiscal 1990) Billion dollars          Gross           Net Sub-Sahara Africa         2.70           1.98 Asia                      6.27           3.72 Europe, Middle East and N Africa                  2.57           0.39 Latin America  Caribbean 6.16           3.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 16 Chart (Omitted).

0,FT933-5758 ,"FT933-5758 _AN-DIAB3AGMFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (15): Islands of hope in a sea of despair - Non-government organisations / NGOs are now involved in virtually every aspect of African life      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   NON-GOVERNMENT agencies provide isolated islands of hope in a sea of social and economic despair, the British charity Oxfam wrote earlier this year in its assessment of the African crisis. This is no exaggeration. By stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of government services, NGOs have become as indispensable to Africa's development efforts as official aid flows. NGOs invested Dollars 6.4bn in Africa in 1989 - more than the World Bank's net transfers to the region, and more than six times the figure for direct foreign investment. And as disenchantment grows with African bureaucracies, donor governments are increasingly channelling official assistance through NGOs. 'They help the poor directly, without costly bureaucratic mediation of donors and recipient governments, and without danger of assistance ending up in pockets of the rich, the military or the corrupt,' says the World Bank. NGOs now get about one-third of their funds from official sources. Although emergency relief work dominates the headlines, NGOs are now involved in virtually every aspect of African life, providing health services, drilling bore holes, serving as a 'bank' willing to finance small traders and cottage industries. Farmers are more likely to get seeds for planting, rural credit and extension services from an NGO than from government. And they are more concerned about the welfare of African women than most African men. NGOs are often the only safety net between tough structural adjustment programmes and abject poverty. At Kikuyu Hospital, one of the oldest mission hospitals in Kenya, Ms Margaret Waweru, the administrator, says: 'We are seeing a growing number of patients who feel government hospitals no longer provide adequate services.' This is particularly true since Kenya's state hospitals started charging for services. Because Kikuyu manufactures its own drugs, it can sell them to patients at a fraction of the market cost. The mission hospital has also become the main referral centre for eye surgery in the country, because the infrastructure once available in state hospitals - drugs, surgical instruments, equipment - has collapsed. Many of the doctors working at Kikuyu left the state health service in frustration. 'It was very demoralising not to have the basic means to do your job,' says one of the eye surgeons. 'It's not a question of pay. Medics prefer working for NGOs because they know they will have the resources to work well."" In the 1980s, it was common for NGOs to try to duplicate government services, Now the emphasis has shifted to working alongside government to strengthen their services. Kikuyu hospital runs training programmes for ophthalmologists in the state health service. In Zambia, Oxfam and Unicef have played a pivotal role in the rehabilitation of primary health clinics. And in Uganda, charities such as Save the Children Fund are supplying medical kits, essential drugs and salary top-ups for government health workers. But NGOs are not a panacea for Africa's ills: 'At best, we can only provide patchwork solutions,' says Friar Arnold Grol, the founder of an NGO called Undugu Society. The charitable nature of NGOs has also shielded them from public scrutiny. There are very few studies on the effectiveness of NGOs in alleviating poverty. Do they provide cost-effective services? Are NGO projects sustainable in the long run? And what happens to these projects when expatriate staff leave? One limited study, conducted by Britain's Overseas Development Institute, found a mixed bag of results. This is hardly surprising, given the thousands of NGOs, both foreign and indigenous, now operating in Africa. However, the study drew some interesting conclusions. Where poverty alleviation did occur, improvement was modest. There was little evidence to suggest that beneficiaries had managed to escape from poverty on a permanent basis, while few projects demonstrated potential to sustain themselves once an NGO ceased operating in the area. Credit-focused initiatives were found to be costly to administer due to the expense of monitoring large numbers of small loans. Few of the schemes became self-sustaining or self-administered. Drought or disaster quickly increased default on loans and eroded the capital base of these small lending ventures. But perhaps the greatest weakness of NGOs lies in their narrow focus. Often, projects fail because the wider economic or social context is not taken into account. In Ghana, a US-funded project to raise maize productivity was so successful that it collapsed when local markets were flooded with maize and prices plummetted. An engineering workshop making ox-ploughs in Acholi, western Uganda, went out of business when bandits started stealing cattle in the region. Another common temptation is for NGOs to create an artificial or temporary demand for produce or skills they are trying to develop. The activity collapses when NGOs stop purchasing the goods. These weaknesses notwithstanding, the NGO's seem set to play an increasingly important role in efforts to resolve Africa's development crisis.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

During the talks, Afewerki said Qian's visit is an  indication  of the importance China attaches to Eritrea and to the friendly  relations between the two countries.    The Eritrean Government pursues the policy of enhancing  cooperation with China in various fields, the president  stressed, saying the cooperation is in the interest of the  Eritrean people and helps promote peace and development of  Africa.    Eritrea is now facing the task of full-scale reconstruction  after 30 years of war and it expects assistance from China, the  president added.

He told Afewerki that Jiang  expects him to visit China at an early date so that the  bilateral relations be pushed to a higher level.    The Chinese vice-premier said the trade and economic  cooperation between the two countries has had a good start  following the establishment of diplomatic ties months ago.    It is in the interest of the two peoples that the Chinese  Government and Eritrean Government work together to enhance  mutual exchanges and bilateral cooperation, Qian stressed.

In two keynote speeches Mr de Klerk vigorously proclaimed the emergence of a 'new South Africa', called for an end to economic sanctions, painted a vision of a prosperous post-apartheid southern Africa, and defended his efforts to end political violence in the country. Mr de Klerk made clear in a speech at the Royal Institute for International Affairs that the ruling National Party envisaged an important post-apartheid role for itself. 'My government is committed to the sharing of power,' he said, but added: 'and wholly opposed to surrendering it unconditionally.' Earlier in the day he also firmly rejected the African National Congress's call for an interim government. He went part of the way towards meeting their demand, however, when he said: 'We are prepared to consider certain transitional arrangements at both the legislative and the executive levels in order to give the leaders of the various negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions.' At a press conference at the start of the day, Mr de Klerk argued that political reform had to be be underpinned by a vibrant economy that would in part depend on the lifting of sanctions and new investment capital from abroad. 'We are now positioned for . . . an economic take-off provided that the necessary investment is made and the necessary industrialisation takes place,' he said. 'We don't ask for handouts, we don't ask for donations,' he continued: 'We ask that all impediments be removed and then we have no doubt that we will get the flow of private sector investment because of the opportunities that our economy . . . offers to them.' Mr de Klerk's economic message was taken up again later in the day during an address to the Institute of Directors. After calling for a restoration of sporting links with Britain, he spoke of the potential of southern Africa. He warned that 'economic growth and constitutional reform must be mutually reinforcing' saying that 'unless the pressing problems of poverty and the unemployed are addressed, elegant constitutional models will be of little avail.' Mr de Klerk met for the first time Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party leader, who afterwards said it was still too soon to lift sanctions.

0,FT933-1184 ,"FT933-1184 _AN-DIXCIAHZFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (38): Enfeebled giant burdened by debt - Africa / Only the return of foreign investment, in partnership with a thriving private sector, will give the economy the boost it needs      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   AFRICA AND its allies are in danger of losing the battle for the recovery of a continent, now so weakened by years of adversity and mismanagement that it cannot take full advantage of a stronger world economy. More than a decade after the World Bank first sounded the alarm about Sub-Saharan Africa's crisis, and despite some Dollars 170bn in net development assistance that has followed, the region's problems remain acute. Economic reforms that got under way in the 1980s are not measuring up to expectations, whether due to weak implementation by African governments, inadequate incentives from western governments and agencies, or flaws in the structural adjustment policy itself. And on the political front, the democratisation process that raised hopes in the 1990s is proving divisive rather than constructive, as ethnicity, rather than policies, determine voters' allegiances. Today, Africa is an enfeebled giant, poorer in per capita terms than it was in 1960, and burdened by an external debt that has soared from Dollars 3bn to more than Dollars 145bn, and which costs a quarter of export earnings to service. Wars in Angola, Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere continue to scar the continent, foreign investment (outside the oil sector) is negligible, management is weak, corruption widespread, and Aids is on the increase. 'It is the only region in the world likely to experience an increase in absolute poverty over the next decade,' Kim Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, told his executive board last February. Admittedly, Africa will do better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, if the forecasters are correct. In its World Economic Outlook, published last May, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted real GDP growth at 3.3 per cent in 1993-94, rising to 4.4 per cent a year between 1995 and 1998. But the Fund was quick to hedge its bets: 'These projections are subject to a wider margin of uncertainty than for other regions,' it warned, noting that 'despite considerable progress in some countries, many obstacles to stronger growth remain to be tackled, including inadequate infrastructure, weak administrative capacity . . . and social and political instability.' Given that Sub-Saharan Africa's four leading economies are all in difficulties, the caveat is understandable. Nigeria is in the grips of a political crisis, and its economic reform programme has effectively lapsed; Kenya is faltering in its promise to root out corruption; the Ivory Coast cannot implement an effective reform programme as long as the CFA franc remains overvalued by as much as 30 per cent; and South Africa remains plagued by political violence, likely to get worse not better as party rivalries intensify in the run up to next April's general election. Nevertheless, the IMF forecast may seem encouraging, compared with the 1980s, when growth over the decade averaged less than 2 per cent and per capita income fell by more than 1 per cent. The reality, however, is that this rate of growth will only stem, possibly halt, the rate of Africa's overall decline, for it must be set against a current population increase of 3.1 per cent annually - which, if sustained, will double the region's population every 22 years. Even the most successful example of reform provides a salutary warning of the long battle ahead if Africa is to make up ground lost during the disastrous post-independence era. Structural adjustment in Ghana has worked  -but only up to a modest point. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. But at current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population), it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. One important lesson from Ghana is that aid is not enough. Only the return - on a substantial scale - of foreign investment, in partnership with a thriving private sector, will give Africa's economy the boost it needs. As Kim Jaycox points out: 'Even if aid succeeded in generating annual growth rates of 6 per cent on average, most African countries would still require 25 years to reach acceptable unemployment levels and Dollars 1,000 GDP per capita. Only the private sector has any chance of achieving higher rates of growth with greater speed.' There is little evidence that foreign investors, who saw their rate of return drop from some 30 per cent in the 1960s to just 2.5 per cent in the 1980s, are about to come back. Net foreign direct investment in Africa has averaged around Dollars 500m a year over the past few years (mostly into the oil and mining sectors), less than 1 per cent of the global total according to the UN's World Investment Report. Obstacles range from the poor state of the infrastructure in most countries to the tough competition from other countries in the developing world, such as Thailand, Indonesia or Vietnam. Above all, Africa has yet to convince the outside world that it means business. 'Too many African countries have embraced economic reform too hesitantly,' Sir William Ryrie, outgoing head of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, told a conference in Nairobi in March this year. Whether Africa and its allies are prepared to admit that defeat looms in the battle for recovery remains to be seen. Since the Bank first sounded the alarm, in its 1981 report, further warnings have come at regular intervals. Africa 'faces acute economic difficulties', said the Bank's next appraisal, published in 1984. Five years later the picture remained bleak. The Bank looked back on 'a decade of falling per capita income' and concluded: 'Overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago.' The Bank has been taking stock once again and, in a report due to be published shortly, is expected to conclude that economic reforms have stemmed the pace of decline. But at current rates of per capita GDP growth it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid 1970s. Given better implementation of reforms and an improved international economic environment, and a renewed effort by the international community to tackle Africa's crisis, prospects could change. But the critical question remains whether African governments have the political will to adopt painful economic reforms, or the managerial capacity with which to implement them. But Africa's allies will also have to take fresh stock of their performance. No development agency likes to admit failure, for it fears losing its raison d'etre. No non-government organisation likes to acknowledge defeat, for fear of funds drying up. No western government wants to add to its problems by acknowledging that its aid policy is ineffectual. But only a frank appraisal of the crisis can provide the basis of the fresh initiative the continent desperately needs.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: EXTERNAL DEBT (DOLLARS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total debt   63.5  75.1  89.8  95.6  99.1 112.3 120.6 124.8 132.4 140.5 By maturity Short-term    6.5   7.5  10.0  10.8  11.7  13.7  14.7  16.7  15.8  17.3 Long-term    57.0  67.6  79.7  84.8  87.4  98.6 105.8 108.0 116.6 123.3 By type of creditor Official     44.4  56.1  68.6  73.9  74.7  86.6  94.1  96.8 104.0 110.4 Commercial  banks       13.2  13.0  14.7  14.1  14.4  16.0  16.5  16.3  16.7  17.5 Other  private      5.9   6.0   6.5   7.6  10.0   9.6   9.9  11.6  11.7  12.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Debt-service payments (% of exports of goods and services)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa*      27.5  28.0  23.7  24.7  24.1  23.3  25.2  26.6  33.4  25.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP (annual percentage change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub-Saharan  Africa       3.4   2.9   2.2   3.0   2.9   1.3   1.1   0.4   4.5   4.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real per capita GDP (annual percentage change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa*       0.3  -0.9  -1.6   1.1   0.8  -1.0  -1.1  -1.7   0.0   1.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Figures are for all of Africa  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Economic Outlook (May 1993), IMF  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

RAPPORT    Pressure on Finance Minister--""When Minister Derek Keys  delivers his budget speech on Wednesday he will be closely  watched to a greater extent than he or his predecessors have  ever experienced,"" begins a page-20 editorial in Afrikaans in  the Johannesburg RAPPORT on 19 June. ""Not only is he acting as  minister of a government of national unity, of whom the main  role player, the ANC, has a controversial economic policy, but  he will have to find some balance between what is expected and  what is possible. On the one hand, he will have to try to boost  the struggling economy -- a task that has given several of his  overseas counterparts sleepless nights during a worldwide  recession. On the other hand he will have to find considerable  sums of money to finance the reconstruction program."" ""The  ambitious Reconstruction and Development Program will result in  higher state spending."" ""The promised large numbers of houses,  schools, and hospitals to be built through increased taxation  could have a far reaching negative effect on the economy, which  could in turn affect both rich and poor alike. If extreme  caution is not applied the internal demand for imported goods  will rise, followed by a drop in foreign exchange reserves, a  further weakening of the exchange rate, higher inflation, and  increased wage demands by unions."" ""Mr. Keys only has one way  of narrowing the economic gap: He will have to ensure economic  growth. South African products will have to be more competitive  in foreign markets so that it can expand its exports in order to  build up its foreign exchange reserves.""    SOWETAN    Petrol Price Increase -- ""The consumer is again left  wondering about the truth behind last week's increase in the  price of petrol. The Government, now composed of some of the  people who were very loud in their opposition to the last hike,  tells us that the increase was unavoidable,"" notes an editorial  in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 June on page 8.

""Under the present ANC-led government, the public broadcaster  has become more democratic. However, with many ANC members in  management positions, the SABC will have to guard against  slipping back into its former role as the exclusive voice of the  regime."" ""Before any decision is taken on the SABC's funding,  the broadcaster's role needs to be defined, as does management's  financial accountability."" ""What is needed is a full appraisal  of what services the SABC should most appropriately provide, who  should be accountable and how they should be transmitted. Only  then can the queation be addressed of how the public broadcaster  is to be financed.""     "

Today we  celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the  people of South Africa.    Our country has arrived at a decision. Among all the parties  that contested the elections, the overwhelming majority of South  Africans have mandated the African National Congress to lead our  country into the future. The South Africa we have struggled  for, in which all our people, be they African, coloured, Indian  or white, regard themselves as citizens of one nation is at hand.    Perhaps it was history that ordained that it be here, at the  Cape of Good Hope that we should lay the foundation stone of our  new nation. For it was here at this Cape, over three centuries  ago, that there began the fateful convergence of the peoples of  Africa, Europe and Asia on these shores. It was to this  peninsula that the patriots, among them many princes and  scholars, of Indonesia were dragged in chains. It was on the  sandy plains of this peninsula that first battles of the epic  wars of resistance were fought.    When we look out across Table Bay, the horizon is dominated  by Ro?ben Island, whose infamy as a dungeon built to stifle the  spirit of freedom is as old as colonialism in South Africa. For  three centuries that island was seen as a place to which  outcasts can be banished. The names of those who were  incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll call of resistance  fighters and democrats spanning over three centuries. If indeed  this is a Cape of Good Hope, that hope owes much to the spirit  of that legion of fighters and others of their calibre.    We have fought for a democratic constitution since the  1880s.  Ours has been a quest for a constitution freely adopted by the  people of South Africa, reflecting their wishes and their  aspirations. The struggle for democracy has never been a matter  pursued by one race, class, religious community or gender among  South Africans. In honouring those who fought to see this day  arrive, we honour the best sons and daughters of all our people.  We can count amongst them Africans, coloureds, whites, Indians,  Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Jews -- all of them united by a  common vision of a better life for the people of this country.    It was that vision that inspired us in 1923 when we adopted  the first ever bill of rights in this country. That same vision  spurred us to put forward the African claims in 1946. It is  also the founding principle of the Freedom Charter we adopted as  policy in 1955, which in its very first lines, places before  South Africa an inclusive basis for citizenship.    In the 1980s the African National Congress was still  setting the pace, being the first major political formation in  South Africa to commit itself firmly to a bill of rights, which  we published in November 1990. These milestones give concrete  expression to what South Africa can become. They speak of a  constitutional, democratic, political order in which, regardless  of colour, gender, religion, political opinion or sexual  orientation, the law will provide for the equal protection of  all citizens.    They project a democracy in which the government, whomever  that government may be, will be bound by a higher set of rules,  embodied in a constitution, and will not be able govern the  country as it pleases.    Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is  especially true in a country such as ours where the vast  majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the  same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political  and other minorities be safeguarded.    In the political order we have established there will be  regular, open and free elections, at all levels of government -  central, provincial and municipal. There shall also be a social  order which respects completely the culture, language and  religious rights of all sections of our society and the  fundamental rights of the individual.    The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated  us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority  lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work  with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the  future. The cornerstone of building a better life of  opportunity, freedom and expression is the most dynamic program  of social upliftment in the history of this country. The  Reconstruction and Development Programme -- this needs unity of  purpose. It needs unity in action. It requires us all to work  together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and  build a nation united in our diversity.    The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections.  They want change! And change is what they will get. Our plan  is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to  guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the  widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our  people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to  support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a  central role we will try to change our country from a net  exporter of raw materials to one that exports finished products  through beneficiation.    The government will devise policies that encourage and  reward  productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities -  African, coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we  can assist them to make inroads into the productive and  manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale  distribution to which they are presently confined.    To raise our country and its people from the morass of  racism  and apartheid will require determination and effort. As a  government, the ANC will create a legal framework that will  assist, rather than impede, the awesome task of reconstruction  and development of our battered society.    While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit  of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate  and bring about the change that our mandate from the people  demands.    We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South  Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the  conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the  past with the intent of constructing a new order based on  justice for all.    This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today,  and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.     "
0,FT943-13728 ,"FT943-13728 _AN-EGRD8AFBFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (17): Haunting test even for Solomon / A look at land reform      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress, is probably not overstating the problem in this line from a recent speech on land reform: 'Unless we settle the land question, we do not have a country. If we handle it badly, we tear South Africa to pieces. If we manage it well, we create the foundations of a truly united nation.' Deputy President FW de Klerk recently highlighted land reform as one of the issues which could destroy the government of national unity and anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the issue must recognise that resolving competing interests, meeting basic needs and defusing anger over land will require not only the wisdom of Solomon, but quite a lot of his wealth as well. Apartheid's worst injustices were concentrated in this area. Since 1960, an estimated 3.5m people have been forcibly removed from their homes under various programmes designed to rid white South Africa of blacks. Some 1.2m black farmers have been left with only 17m hectares of often sub-standard land - 13 per cent of the country's total - while 55,000 whites, employing a further 1.1m blacks as labourers, farm 102m hectares. Millions more are simply in need of land for settlement, whether urban or rural. In the former homelands, 83 per cent of black households are estimated to fall below the poverty line, largely the result of land shortage. It is a massive problem. 'If you don't have a land reform programme with some significant effect, it comes back repeatedly to haunt you. People's grievances don't just vanish,' says Mr Derek Hanekom, the newly-appointed minister of land affairs, from the African National Congress. He points out that land reform is central to the Reconstruction and Development Programme which calls for 30 per cent of South Africa's land to be redistributed over five years beginning next year. Mr Hanekom estimates the cost at R2bn a year - although only R92m is allocated for land reform in the present year's budget, which provides only a total of R2.5bn for all the RDP programmes. He outlines the government's goals as: Restitution: a Commission on Restitution of Land Rights and a Land Claims Court will be set up to deal with the claims of forced removals victims. Under the new constitution, people dispossessed of land after 1913 - the year when systematic racial dispossession began in earnest - can claim restitution from the state. Original land may be returned to them or, where this is not feasible, alternative state-owned land or other compensation will be provided. But under the bill of rights, the interests of existing as well as original landowners must be respected. The constitution bars expropriation except for 'public purposes', and requires that 'just and equitable' compensation be paid, taking into account factors such as market value, use of the property and value of investments in it. Mr Hanekom says that only state-owned land and land acquired through the market will be used for this purpose, or for: Redistribution: millions of black South Africans - not just those with historical grievances - lack adequate land for settlement. Their plight has been highlighted by cases of squatters invading privately-owned land near Johannesburg, an invasion which the government condemned. But, as the World Bank points out in a recent policy document on land reform: 'It is essential that an expeditious, transparent and thorough land restoration and redistribution process be implemented as a means of discouraging the landless from resorting to land invasions.' As Mr Geoff Budlender, a land lawyer, puts it: 'Land occupation is the only functioning land claims process in South Africa today.' Until land reform begins in earnest, the threat of invasion will grow. Rural restructuring: 'Restitution entails more than just the acquisition of lost land,' says Mr Hanekom. 'Good planning, the resettlement of people, the provision of infrastructure and services, economic support programmes, sustainable development and, very importantly, community institution building are essential elements of the programme.' Legal and market reforms: tenure rights will be strengthened, and state financial institutions restructured to improve poor people's access to finance. 'We want to remove the impediments, and ensure that those people who are in a position to take advantage of market opportunities are encouraged as much as possible,' Mr Hanekom told the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day recently. Mr Hanekom does not mention reform of agricultural markets - the ministry of agriculture is the responsibility of the opposition National Party - but the government's programme includes measures to stimulate competition in agricultural markets and reduce barriers to entry, as an essential adjunct to land reform. Many questions remain unanswered. How will the beneficiaries be chosen: according to need, or the ability to farm land productively? How will nepotism and corruption be avoided? Where will the money come from? Can the state move quickly enough to stave off the threat of invasion? One fact is clear, however: the present highly unequal pattern of land ownership cannot continue. Other countries with a similar pattern have seen neglect lead to civil disorder and violence. South Africa cannot afford to do the same.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P953  Housing and Urban Development.     P9441 Administration of Social and Manpower Programs.

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania      The Tanzania-Zambia Railway could well be a metaphor for Africa's path in the  1980s.    Known as Tazara, the 1,100-mile, Chinese-built line linking the copper belt of  Zambia to this Tanzanian port was turned over to the governments of the two  abutting countries just before the decade began. Included were 128 new  locomotives and hundreds of passenger and freight cars to run on the gleaming  rails. Western countries contributed millions of dollars to maintain the right  of way and to train railroad staff.    Today, little more than a decade after its opening, only 39 of the engines  remain in working order. Another 39 are awaiting repair, and 50 have been  destroyed by collisions and derailings on the deteriorating line.    Last year, a Swedish development agency donated 350 new cars to the railway --  enough, it has been estimated, to last only seven years at the current rate of  wreckage. Some of the cars derailed on their maiden journey, the Swedes  recently complained in a blistering letter to the two governments.    Like Tazara, whose fate is the result of chronic African maladies of  inattention, lack of maintenance, and penury, so went most of the continent in  the 1980s. Development experts describe sub-Saharan Africa as a train running  downhill to disaster.    After a period of genuine hope in the 1970s, these experts describe the 1980s  as the region's lost decade. By almost every measure of human welfare and  economic health, the area retrogressed during that period, in some cases so  sharply that Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, remarked recently that  most Africans today are every bit as poor as they were 30 years ago, at the  dawn of the continent's era of independence.    ""There was general deterioration in the main macroeconomic indicators,  widespread disintegration of productive facilities, a rapid worsening in the  social scene, repeated droughts and accelerating environmental degradation,""  says a U.N. report. ""The unending crisis did not affect only the current  well-being of the average African; it threatened the long-term development  prospects of the region as a whole.""    The 1980s saw many of Africa's modest gains of the previous 10 or 15 years  swept off in a windstorm of deteriorating roads, disappearing forest and  cropland, collapsing schoolhouses, and mushrooming military budgets.    One can debate which African capital has the biggest potholes on its  thoroughfares. Efforts to stem deforestation by planting fast-growing  eucalyptus trees fail because Africans who need wood for fuel cut them down  faster than they can grow. Ethiopia, which ranks close to rock-bottom in almost  every measure of welfare and development known to humankind, spends more than  50% of its budget on weapons to fight a largely stalemated 30-year civil war  with Eritrean rebels.    Many fear that the 1990s will be worse. For one thing, the rest of the world is  losing interest in a place that never seems to get better.    ""The broad international support for helping a continent in distress in the  1980s has been dissipated now by repeated calls for assistance,"" says Salim  Lone, a Kenyan who edits Africa Recovery, a U.N. journal of development news.  ""How long can people accept that Africa is a special place, when the economic  and political returns from Eastern Europe are infinitely greater?""    Africa no longer has a geopolitical card to play. Gone are the days when  Ethiopia and Somalia could play the East and West off against each other by  switching allegiance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zaire can  no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels  in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side.    ""In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning  to the East or West,"" Lone says. ""But now East-West amity has stripped the  continent of whatever strategic value it had before.""    The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are  increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their  export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their  appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign  currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for  want of spare parts.    At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29  billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and  higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan  Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%.    The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population  of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium.    There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement:  the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in  terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life  expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life  expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are  Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic  and Chad (46).    Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also  African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the  worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and  Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134).    Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10  countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan  Africa.    There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social  fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a  demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every  country.    More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in  Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's  one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who  fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis.    The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be  rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should  be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with  significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper  Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and  Malawi are landlocked.    A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or  ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where  weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent.    But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of  this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to  issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and  wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of  these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya,  perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts  to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it.    When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's  post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's  highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its  colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic  policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that  have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant.    Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil  servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a  two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford  less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs.    Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a  surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan  Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new  customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as  the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either  collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States,  proven totally ineffective.    The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax  machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These  machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one  person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's  and one-sixteenth that in Latin America.    ""These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the  1990s and beyond,"" warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission  for Africa.    Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate  among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the  extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue  that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and  administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the  amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa.    ""You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that  actually benefits Africans?"" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in  West Africa. ""Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to  support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the  money in any program is spent.""    Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of  demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the  rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices.    In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied  statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a  multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of  Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen  obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so  severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and  crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction.    African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges,  30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices  collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still  depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign  earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the  countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets.    The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to  the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small  horticulture industry. Today the country is the world's fourth-biggest exporter  of cut flowers.    African leaders talk incessantly about how the national borders drawn up by the  former colonial powers institutionalized political tensions by arbitrarily  dividing some tribes and combining others.    Thirty years of economic history suggests the problem is not necessarily the  wrong borders, but too many of them. Many sub-Saharan countries are simply too  small or too deprived to be self-sufficient. Eleven are landlocked. Thirty-four  have fewer than 10 million people. The distribution of natural resources is  uneven: Zambia, with 7.5 million people, has copper and broad swaths of arable  land -- largely unused -- while in neighboring Malawi, a similar population is  crowded on one-seventh as much territory and with no mineral deposits at all.    African leaders complain, quite fairly, that in granting independence their  European colonial masters left them with inadequate roads and railroads and a  pitifully small cadre of university-educated leaders. But it is clear now that  these leaders themselves must shoulder much of the blame for their countries'  problems.    One key is the persistence of failed policies. Many African statesmen formed  their economic ideas in the crucible of anti-colonialism: They reacted against  not only European politics, but also European free-market economics, which they  saw as exploitative. Great leaders like Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania created something called ""African socialism,"" based on what  they contended was Africans' unique sense of community and self-help.    Today Zambia and Tanzania are among Africa's most dismal failures. Nyerere's  catch-phrase, articulated in the ""Arusha Declaration"" of 1967, was ""socialism  and self-reliance."" But after decades of receiving the highest per-capita  foreign aid in all sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania is one of the world's least  self-reliant countries.    Kaunda, whose frequent emotional, even tearful, public speeches on the evils of  nuclear proliferation and other scarcely relevant issues have made him a figure  of worldwide respect, has presided over the collapse of one of Africa's most  promising lands. Zambia became independent blessed with the best industrial  base in southern Africa; it has been left a rotting skeleton through the  mismanagement of state-owned enterprises operating in an environment of  unbridled corruption.    ""Everyone knows that to run a socialist enterprise you need good management to  make up for the lack of individual incentives like the profit motive,"" one  Scandinavian development official said in discussing the disastrous record of  state-owned farms in nominally Marxist Ethiopia. ""Of course, management skills  are the one thing most lacking in Africa.""    Wherever the blame lies, the toll of Africa's marginalization is enormous. The  U.N. Development Program recently noted that ""between 1979 and 1985 the number  of African people below the poverty line increased by almost two-thirds,  compared with an average increase of one-fifth in the entire developing world.""    The urgency embodied in this figure has, oddly enough, led development  officials to contemplate how the ""quick fixes"" of the 1970s and 1980s went  awry: The manipulations of currency rates and the rapid infusions of aid money  and project ideas that frequently canceled each other out or duplicated effort  -- all without helping Africans build and sustain their own institutions.    Some development experts say what Africa needs may be something approaching  benign neglect. If the developed world does begin to withdraw attention and  resources from the embattled continent, one notes, it may finally wean itself  from the diet of aid.    ""There is a positive side,"" he says. ""It may actually encourage governments to  adopt policies that will be much more self-reliant and not as dependent on  outside resources.""    Africa and Third World: Region Falls Behind    Not only do the nearly 40 countries of black Afric live in a different economic  world than the industrialized countries; they are slipping behind the rest of  the THird World by many key measures of development.

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania      The Tanzania-Zambia Railway could well be a metaphor for Africa's path in the  1980s.    Known as Tazara, the 1,100-mile, Chinese-built line linking the copper belt of  Zambia to this Tanzanian port was turned over to the governments of the two  abutting countries just before the decade began. Included were 128 new  locomotives and hundreds of passenger and freight cars to run on the gleaming  rails. Western countries contributed millions of dollars to maintain the right  of way and to train railroad staff.    Today, little more than a decade after its opening, only 39 of the engines  remain in working order. Another 39 are awaiting repair, and 50 have been  destroyed by collisions and derailings on the deteriorating line.    Last year, a Swedish development agency donated 350 new cars to the railway --  enough, it has been estimated, to last only seven years at the current rate of  wreckage. Some of the cars derailed on their maiden journey, the Swedes  recently complained in a blistering letter to the two governments.    Like Tazara, whose fate is the result of chronic African maladies of  inattention, lack of maintenance, and penury, so went most of the continent in  the 1980s. Development experts describe sub-Saharan Africa as a train running  downhill to disaster.    After a period of genuine hope in the 1970s, these experts describe the 1980s  as the region's lost decade. By almost every measure of human welfare and  economic health, the area retrogressed during that period, in some cases so  sharply that Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, remarked recently that  most Africans today are every bit as poor as they were 30 years ago, at the  dawn of the continent's era of independence.    ""There was general deterioration in the main macroeconomic indicators,  widespread disintegration of productive facilities, a rapid worsening in the  social scene, repeated droughts and accelerating environmental degradation,""  says a U.N. report. ""The unending crisis did not affect only the current  well-being of the average African; it threatened the long-term development  prospects of the region as a whole.""    The 1980s saw many of Africa's modest gains of the previous 10 or 15 years  swept off in a windstorm of deteriorating roads, disappearing forest and  cropland, collapsing schoolhouses, and mushrooming military budgets.    One can debate which African capital has the biggest potholes on its  thoroughfares. Efforts to stem deforestation by planting fast-growing  eucalyptus trees fail because Africans who need wood for fuel cut them down  faster than they can grow. Ethiopia, which ranks close to rock-bottom in almost  every measure of welfare and development known to humankind, spends more than  50% of its budget on weapons to fight a largely stalemated 30-year civil war  with Eritrean rebels.    Many fear that the 1990s will be worse. For one thing, the rest of the world is  losing interest in a place that never seems to get better.    ""The broad international support for helping a continent in distress in the  1980s has been dissipated now by repeated calls for assistance,"" says Salim  Lone, a Kenyan who edits Africa Recovery, a U.N. journal of development news.  ""How long can people accept that Africa is a special place, when the economic  and political returns from Eastern Europe are infinitely greater?""    Africa no longer has a geopolitical card to play. Gone are the days when  Ethiopia and Somalia could play the East and West off against each other by  switching allegiance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zaire can  no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels  in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side.    ""In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning  to the East or West,"" Lone says. ""But now East-West amity has stripped the  continent of whatever strategic value it had before.""    The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are  increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their  export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their  appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign  currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for  want of spare parts.    At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29  billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and  higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan  Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%.    The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population  of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium.    There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement:  the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in  terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life  expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life  expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are  Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic  and Chad (46).    Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also  African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the  worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and  Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134).    Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10  countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan  Africa.    There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social  fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a  demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every  country.    More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in  Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's  one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who  fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis.    The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be  rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should  be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with  significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper  Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and  Malawi are landlocked.    A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or  ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where  weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent.    But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of  this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to  issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and  wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of  these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya,  perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts  to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it.    When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's  post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's  highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its  colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic  policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that  have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant.    Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil  servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a  two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford  less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs.    Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a  surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan  Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new  customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as  the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either  collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States,  proven totally ineffective.    The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax  machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These  machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one  person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's  and one-sixteenth that in Latin America.    ""These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the  1990s and beyond,"" warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission  for Africa.    Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate  among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the  extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue  that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and  administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the  amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa.    ""You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that  actually benefits Africans?"" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in  West Africa. ""Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to  support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the  money in any program is spent.""    Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of  demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the  rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices.    In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied  statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a  multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of  Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen  obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so  severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and  crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction.    African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges,  30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices  collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still  depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign  earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the  countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets.    The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to  the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small  horticulture industry.

At the same time, the Pope acknowledged that poverty, which has struck as hard  here as anywhere in Africa, threatens the strength of the church itself. And he  also put in a strong word for inculcation by the church of the ""obligations of  marriage and family life"" -- this in a land where sexually transmitted AIDS may  have infected as much as 20% of the urban population.    The Pope's arrival from the French island of Reunion on an Air France  supersonic Concorde -- the first time a pontiff's plane has broken the sound  barrier and the first time the luxurious jet has landed in this country -- may  have suggested some unintended ironies.    For the standard of living may have fallen faster here since independence in  1964 than in any sub-Saharan African country not afflicted by war.      Staple Food Shortages    Shortages of such staples as maize, wheat and sugar are nearly constant. To  keep their employees from spending most of their work days in line waiting to  buy food, many foreign businesses and embassies buy staples in bulk and resell  them to workers.    In recent months, the lines have turned ugly; on several occasions police have  fired tear gas at wait-weary shoppers who were on the point of storming empty  government shops.    The difficulties have focused more attention on the economic policies of  Kenneth D. Kaunda, who has led Zambia since independence, creating a nation of  remarkable political stability and equality but of economic decline. Kaunda has  failed to develop Zambia's potentially rich agricultural land, allowing the  nation to become dependent on copper mining for 90% of its foreign income.    For all that, to the extent they touched at all on economic matters, the Pope's  homilies on his first day in Zambia focused more on the exterior causes of  poverty in this area.    These include regional instability fomented by South Africa and perennially low  prices for African agricultural exports.    ""I am aware that events in this region in recent years, and world events beyond  your control which affect all developing countries, have brought economic and  social difficulties in their wake,"" he said upon landing at Lusaka airport to a  joyous welcome from a crowd of tens of thousands, tribal dancers, choirs and a  military honor guard.    Both the pontiff and Kaunda acknowledged Lusaka's status as headquarters of the  African National Congress with firm denunciations of South Africa's racial  politics.    ""We face the affliction of apartheid, an all-round human degradation declared  by the international community as a sin against humanity itself,"" Kaunda said  in his welcoming speech.    While on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion earlier Tuesday, the Pope beatified  a 19th-Century French missionary considered the apostle of the island's slaves,  the Associated Press reported. The beatification represented a first step  towards possible sainthood for Jean-Bernard Rousseau, known as Brother  Scubilion, who died in 1867. Rousseau spent 34 years on the island, teaching  catechism to the African slaves taken to the island by the French colonists.      Photo, Pope John Paul II is greeted by a Zambian woman in Lusaka.

That means 31.9 million Americans were living in  poverty in 1988.    In 1987, about 32.3 million people, or 13.4% of the population, were living in  poverty. The Census Bureau said the changes between 1987 and 1988 were not  statistically significant.    The Census Bureau also reported that Americans' median household income was  $27,230 in 1988, up from $27,140 a year earlier after adjusting for the rise in  consumer prices. Again, the change was not considered significant.    Per capita income, meanwhile, rose 1.7% to an all-time high of $13,120 in 1988,  a change that was considered significant.    ""It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved,"" said  William Butz, associate director for demographics at the Census Bureau.    The report said the nation's poverty rate for whites declined by 0.3% last year  to 10.1%. The poverty rate for blacks was 31.6%, down from 32.6% in 1987, and  the rate for Latinos dipped to 26.8% from 28.1%. None of those changes was  considered significant.    Regionally, the only statistically significant change in the poverty rate  occurred in the Midwest, where the rate dropped from 12.5% in 1987 to 11.5%  last year. The poverty rate in the South was 16.2% in 1988, up from 16.1%. In  the West, the rate was 12.7%, up from 12.5%, and in the Northeast, the rate was  10.2%, down from 10.9%.    Today's report on poverty in 1988 was prepared by the Census Bureau based on a  survey of about 58,000 U.S. households last March.    While debate rages over the cost and adequacy of programs to fight poverty,  battles also continue over defining and counting it.    Advocates for the poor insist the formal definition underestimates the problem  because it does not really reflect their spending habits.    But other researchers contend the measurement may overestimate poverty because  it only considers people's cash income and not government assistance.    The official definition of poverty was developed by the Social Security  Administration in 1964 based on Department of Agriculture research on what  people spend on food.    Agriculture analysts had calculated that people spent about one-third of their  income to eat, and developed a variety of plans to provide adequate nutrition  at high-, middle- and low-cost levels.    The definition of poverty was then set at three times the cost of the lowest  price food program, known as the thrifty food plan.    Adjusted annually for inflation, the poverty threshold has risen from about  $3,000 per year in the early 1960s to nearly $12,000 today for a family of  four. The poverty level varies slightly for urban and rural residents and rises  with the size of family. Many assistance programs kick in at 125% of the  poverty rate.    In recent years advocates for the poor have challenged that thinking,  contending the cost of living has changed over the years.

Of the 47 countries that attended the meeting, 36 were represented by heads of state. GLOBAL TRENDS AND PROSPECTS Heads of government welcomed continued easing of global tensions and expressed conviction that the United Nations was now better placed than ever before to fulfil its role. . . They underscored the complementary role which the Commonwealth and regional organisations could play in supporting the efforts of the UN. They reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, fundamental human rights, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and just and honest government as essential ingredients of the Commonwealth's fundamental political values. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedom were inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing. Commonwealth leaders stressed the need to strengthen international security through disarmament and non-proliferation. They noted the world economy faced grave uncertainties but believed the current climate of low inflation and declining interest rates presented opportunities for economic recovery. They welcomed the broadening political consensus on market-friendly measures, combined with human resource development and poverty reduction. They acknowledged special difficulties of sub-Saharan Africa and noted the performances of many countries were constrained by weak commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade. Big efforts were still required throughout the developing world to overcome institutional, economic and financial barriers to stronger growth; they also recognised these reforms should be supported by an appropriate blend of adjustment and external financing. They expressed disquiet at the continuing debt problems of many developing countries and called for measures to cut the debt burden to sustainable levels and for the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms. They noted with concern that official development assistance had fallen in real terms and called for action to reverse the fall in aid flows. Commonwealth leaders noted with appreciation numerous practical measures undertaken by the Secretariat to promote the Commonwealth fundamental political values, including monitoring elections in seven member states. SOUTH AFRICA Commonwealth leaders agreed that developments had marked irreversible progress to democracy. They endorsed lifting of sanctions but the arms embargo would remain until a new post-apartheid government was established with full democratic control and accountability. But the communique recognised that the process remained fragile and agreed the pre-eminent need was to help ensure a united, non-fragmented, democratic and non-racial South Africa. They agreed the Commonwealth Observer Mission to South Africa should remain in South Africa until after the election planned for April 1994 when the situation would be reviewed. MOZAMBIQUE Leaders expressed concern at recurring delays in implementing the October 1992 peace accord and called on the Renamo opposition party to comply fully with its terms, including despatch of its personnel to UN-administered assembly points. They urged all concerned to co-operate in ensuring multi-party elections are held by October 1994 and called on Renamo to co-operate with the government in the speedy completion of an election law. ANGOLA They deplored continuation of the civil war and called on Unita to end hostilities. Failure on the part of Unita to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on Angola would justify further sanctions and other measures. CYPRUS Commonwealth leaders reiterated support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. They stressed the importance of securing compliance with all the UN resolutions on Cyprus, divided when Turkey invaded the northern part in 1974. Lack of progress would prompt the Commonwealth secretary general to request the UN Security Councilto consider alternative ways to promote effective implementation of the UN resolutions. MIDDLE EAST Commonwealth leaders welcomed the agreement of September 13 1993 between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and expressed the hope that the momentum for peace would be sustained. BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA They expressed deep concern at the continuing hostilities and urged the international community to make all efforts to arrive urgently at a just, equitable and comprehensive political settlement based on strict adherence to Security Council decisions, international law and preservation and protection of the legitimate rights and dignity of all the Bosnian community. BELIZE Support was reaffirmed for the security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize. The leaders urged Guatemala and Belize to resume and successfully conclude their dialogue.

A study by the London-based World Development Movement says that there has been a significant fall in British aid going directly to the world's poor in the past five years. Over the same period, there has been an increase in aid spent on British consultants and industry. The report also criticises the level of UK aid. Between 1980 and 1992 Britain's aid to sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, fell by 2 per cent in real terms, when for all donors there was an average increase of 55 per cent. The UK aid budget has fallen to two-thirds of the 1979 level as a proportion of GNP, and by 12.5 per cent in real terms, according to the report. It notes that Britain is the sixth largest aid donor after Japan, the US, France, Germany and Italy, but in 1993 UK aid amounted to 0.31 per cent of GNP. Using this yardstick, it was 13th out of the 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development aid donors. Technical co-operation - consultants, training and research and development at UK institutions - provides the bulk of the project aid. The remainder is used to win commercial contracts, such as the Pergau dam in Malaysia under the aid and trade provision (ATP). Although spending on agriculture has risen by 40 per cent in the past five years, it still received less than 8 per cent of total project aid in 1992-3. In that year, says the report, 'three times as much was spent supporting British companies working in agriculture through the ATP, than on direct financial assistance to farmers'. Almost half of Britain's bilateral aid from 1987-8 to 1992-3 was spent on technical co-operation, says the report, including the ATP. Funding for non-governmental organisations is included in this budget and took up little over 10 per cent of the total in 1992-93.

Misguided economic policies, autocracy, endemic corruption and armed conflict have been part of the lethal cocktail which threatens to consign the region's citizens to deepening poverty. This is why northern governments should encourage the moves towards democratisation, peace and economic policy realism now taking place in many African countries with a 'Marshall plan' for recovery. Seven years after the Group of Seven industrial countries grudgingly accepted the need for debt relief, the world's poorest region is being drained of Dollars 10bn annually. There can be no moral or economic justification for this, especially in the wake of the massive debt relief measures agreed for Russia. This is why Oxfam is calling on Britain to press for a new initiative on African debt at the G7 summit in July. Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), implemented by African governments under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, have failed to create a platform for economic recovery and even more conspicuously to address the challenge of poverty alleviation. The World Bank's own most recent review confirmed that SAPs have a particularly bad record in terms of restoring investment, the yardstick against which recovery prospects must be measured. In part, this can be traced to the impact of deflationary monetary policies and sweeping trade liberalisation measures under SAPs. These have exposed fragile, but potentially competitive, manufacturing industries to increased competition in the face of spiralling interest rates and rising import costs. The predictable result has been disinvestment, de-industrialisation and mounting unemployment. Rather than apportion blame between doctor and patient, surely it is time to recognise that both are hooked on the wrong medicine. It is time for the World Bank and IMF to surrender their dogmatic attachment to an outmoded set of economic prescriptions. What is needed is a new approach to adjustment, based on redistribution policies, selective import liberalisation, more carefully phased market reforms and above all a commitment to increased investment in human capital.

In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial  Times, Mr de Klerk stressed the importance of economic growth to  meet the needs of what he called ""a lost generation"" of South  Africans.    But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to  undermine the status of the Afrikaans language, saying it would  drive many of his National Party supporters into the arms of the  far right.    A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of  strain after a gruelling election campaign made clear that he  looked forward to contesting the presidency in the next  election.    The National Party, he said, had won support from about l  million black voters in addition to over 3 million votes from  whites, coloureds and Indians. He was determined to help  make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela work, he  said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a  share of success when contesting the next election. The party  accepted the need to tackle housing backlogs and improve health  and educational facilities for black South Africa -- any  difference with the ANC was ""not about the needs of the people,  but how you fund the programme.""    This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly  through export promotion and encouraging foreign investment.    He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development  Programme  drawn up by the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a  single party, but of the government of national unity. ""But we  must be assured that we will not give way on the need for fiscal  discipline"", he said.    How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for  the coalition government and the need for a watchdog opposition  role? ""I am on a learning curve on this,"" replied Mr de Klerk.  But from discussions with leaders of coalition governments in  Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two options. ""You can  either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you can do  your homework initially... and agree in detail what joint  policy will be, and then test everything that happens against  this (agreement)"" -- and this was the approach he had adopted.    He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over  the  composition of the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr  Derek Keys as finance minister as one of the critical  portfolios, in addition to agriculture, constitutional affairs,  as well as his own role as executive vice president.    Asked whether the government of national unity could become  ""more or less permanent"", Mr de Klerk replied: ""Not necessarily  in this form.""    ""Power sharing"", he went on, ""should be a feature of the  final constitution (to be drawn up by the country's National  Assembly)"" arguing, as he has done frequently in the past, that  a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote should not get 100 per  cent of the power.    But he stressed that ""there are other ways of achieving it  than though an enforced coalition. One would be to give to the  regions more powers, though not necessarily more functions,"" he  said.    ""For certain types of important decisions the president  might  not be able to take them on his own, he must call in the  premiers of the nine provinces"". Alternatively, Mr de Klerk  suggested, ""the senate could more effectively represent minority  interests, to control the power of the party with the majority.""    But he underlined the fact that ""it is not about vetoes --  it  is about effectively preventing the misuse of power to the  detriment of language, religion, certain black minority groups"".    ""I don't think we should have enforced coalitions,"" Mr de  Klerk went on, ""but when (the current system) falls away, we  need to broaden the package of how to share power in other ways,  through local government for example.""    ""We have got to balance the situation between the fears of  minorities and the democratic need to have real power which  comes with being a majority (party).""    ""An enforced coalition"", he continued, ""will not wash, it  won't work either. But I predict we are going to have  coalitions any way.""    Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de  Klerk urged the international community ""not to remove us from  their agenda. They need us, they need to address the problems  of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play -- but only if we are  successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa) to the  full.""    ""We need sustained dynamic economic growth,"" said Mr de  Klerk. ""We will be focusing on exports and developing the new  markets that have become available to us, we have to get our  productivity up, and develop the potential of tourism, with lots  of jobs.""    Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however when he  responded to questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was  ""very dangerous"" he warned, to undermine the language, pointing  as an example to the dropping of announcements in Afrikaans on  board South African Airways.    ""It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the  force  that they are today...if you want me to lose their support, rub  them up the wrong way about the language. You will drive back  into the arms of the far right.""    Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last  minute decision of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the  Inkatha Freedom Party, to take part in the election.    ""Realism took over,"" he said. ""If Chief Buthelezi didn't  come  aboard we might have faced a very serious security situation"".  All parties, including Chief Buthelezi, realised this.    Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press  that  he had struck a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation,  giving extra land to the former Kwazulu homeland within Natal.  ""At no time was I involved in any discussion on that issue that  was election related""    Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk  said  it was ""at tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential""  but it ""can be managed in an orderly way."" The government has  ""already identified vast tracts of land"" which could be made  available to people dispossessed during the apartheid era.    But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South  Africa could play a major role in Rwanda. First the country's  security forces had successfully to conclude the integration of  regular units and members of the ANC armed wing. South Africa  also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he said,  notably the war in Angola.    Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel  Laureate lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a  large middle class placed South Africa ""qualitatively and  quantitively in quite a different league from any other African  society,"" he told the audience. ""We will be able to break the  cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that  many of our African neighbours share our success.""     "

At the same awards giving ceremony, 75 technologists were  presented with the service award of the Zhenhua poverty relief  by technology fund.    The fund has been donated by Hong Kong academic circles.    A leading official of the State Science and Technology  Commission (SSTC) said at the ceremony that the fund was of  great importance, because the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong are  jointly promoting the work of poverty elimination through  technology.    Sponsored by the society of Hong Kong Scholars (SHS), the  fund aims to encourage and support technological and  professional personnel to go to poverty-stricken areas to help  citizens there to escape poverty.    Elimination of poverty and common prosperity are considered  as the basic requirement of socialism and a reflection of the  advantages of a socialist system in China.    At the national conference on poverty elimination held last  month, China promulgated an ambitious seven-year plan to wipe  out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing  shortages for the remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens.    The official said that the key to the goal lies in the  advancement of science and technology and improvement of  knowledge and skills of farmers.    Since 1986, the state commission for science and technology  has given 8.5 million yuan of special funds for poverty  elimination, and 200 million yuan in loans.    Furthermore, it helped poverty-stricken areas to bring in  more than 400 poverty elimination projects and 2,700 suitable  techniques, which made direct profits of 800 million yuan for  the poor.    Most of the below-poverty-line citizens live in rural areas  of 699 counties in the central and western parts of China.     "

Partnerships in high poverty areas face particular challenges in implementing School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives:  1. There are few large private or public employers in high poverty areas, making it more difficult to secure employer participation, work-based learning opportunities, and career-track jobs for youth who complete a School-to-Work Opportunities program. Therefore, creative strategies must be developed to fully utilize the capacity of local institutions to include a variety of alternative work-based learning environments and to support intensive efforts to enhance diverse employer involvement.  2. Dropout rates of schools in high poverty areas in many cases are over 50 percent, and interventions to improve schools may need to begin in the elementary or middle school years. School-to-Work Opportunities programs can provide more relevant and engaging school-based and work-based activities which can encourage youth to remain in school until completion.  3. Students at schools in high poverty areas will be poorer and may be much less aware of college opportunities than students in other areas. This, coupled with financial constraints, may make them more likely to seek immediate job placement prior to or immediately upon high school graduation, regardless of whether those jobs have potential for long-term career opportunities.  4. In most high poverty area neighborhoods, peer pressure is a strong force which does not necessarily promote achievement. School-to-Work Opportunities programs that offer alternative learning environments and creative approaches to academic and technical subjects can make success in school more attractive to these youth.  5. Youth in high poverty areas are likely to experience pressure from situations outside of school which may affect their performance in school. To turn around the prevailing negative forces operating on youth, School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these neighborhoods will need to be complemented by various community-wide interventions.  6. Schools in high poverty areas are more likely to have students of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds than schools in other areas. In addition, high poverty area schools often serve a higher percentage of students with distinctive learning needs; therefore, School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in these areas should be designed to meet the needs of these youth.  7. Because of the high dropout rates in many high poverty areas, there will be proportionately many more out-of-school youth in these areas than in other communities.

Speaking at a national conference on poverty elimination,  which was attended by Premier Li Peng and other senior Chinese  leaders, Jiang said that the most important experience which  China has gained from its progress in past poverty reduction is  the shift of the poverty alleviation policy from merely material  aid to comprehensive social and economic development strategy in  poor areas.    Practice shows that a poverty reduction strategy which is  market- oriented, relies on advancement of science and  technology and exploitation of local resources, will not only  provide enough food and clothes for the poverty-stricken people,  but also a way to prosperity, said Jiang Zemin, who is also  general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of China (CPC).    He described the shift as fundamental and said it should be  continued in a long period of time to come.    Elimination of poverty and common prosperity is the basic  requirement of socialism and reflection of the advantages of a  socialist system over others, he noted.    He pointed out that capable cadres should be selected and  all  walks of life should be mobilized to help poor areas.    The party leader also stressed the need for local people's  self- reliance and arduous efforts in the nationwide poverty  reduction drive.    Premier Li Peng said that it was an unshirkable historical  responsibility of communists of his generation and people's  governments of all levels to eliminate abject poverty by the  year 2000, solving food and clothes shortages for the 80 million  poor.    The plan is a strategic measure to gradually narrow the gaps  between China's developed east and the developing west, he said.    The premier said that coastal areas and large and  medium-sized cities, which have become relatively rich, should  be encouraged to help the poor areas.    The central government should give adequate financial  support  to the poor areas, said Li.    He added that priority should be given to the poor areas  when  selecting a location for important investment projects.    The premier also spoke of the need to rationalize the  pricing  of raw materials and primary products, which will benefit the  poor areas that are rich in resources.    Earlier, State Councillor Chen Junsheng announced on Monday  at the meeting that the ambitious seven-year poverty reduction  plan includes raising the annual net income of the majority of  the 80 million people.    According to the plan, China will begin from this year to  improve infrastructure construction in poor areas, solving  drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic  animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and  connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks.    As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural,  educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas,  wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population,  offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural  population growth rate under the official limit.    ""The realization of the plan will be of great significance.  It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese  people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population,  will have been secured,"" said the state councillor, who is in  charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction  efforts.    Most of the 80 million people are in remote mountain  regions,  rocky regions, loess plateau areas and remote deserts.    During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about  45  million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year.    He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor  areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for  poverty elimination.    China's poor had decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80  million in 1992.     "

""It looks like this is as low as it's going to get for a while, and it isn't  very low,"" said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities, a private research group. ""It is disturbing that, despite a sixth  year of economic recovery, both the nation's poverty rate and the income of a  typical household showed no significant improvement.""    However, the Census Bureau found some cause for encouragement in the report,  pointing to a 1.7% increase in per-capita personal income last year.    ""It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved,"" said  William Butz, the agency's associate director for demographics.    The poverty rate fell from 13.4% in 1987 to 13.1% last year, and the number of  impoverished people dropped from 32.3 million to 31.9 million.    Whites, blacks and Latinos made no significant gains in 1988, leaving wide gaps  between the three groups' poverty rates: 10.1% for whites, 31.6% for blacks and  26.8% for Latinos.    Both the number of poor people and the poverty rate have been inching down  since 1983, but each still exceeds the recent low points, set in 1978, when the  poverty rate was 11.4% and 24.5 million people were impoverished.    The poverty line last year was $12,092 for a family of four.    Greenstein said that there has been a lack of progress against poverty recently  because the benefits of the economic expansion are flowing disproportionately  to the wealthiest Americans.    The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6% of total national family  income in 1988, the lowest percentage since 1954, but the richest fifth  received 44%, the highest ever recorded, he said.    The Census Bureau reported also a jump in real per-capita income last year, to  a new high of $13,120. Blacks made bigger gains than whites but still lagged  far behind.

""It looks like this is as low as it's going to get for a while, and it isn't  very low,"" said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities, a private research group. ""It is disturbing that, despite a sixth  year of economic recovery, both the nation's poverty rate and the income of a  typical household showed no significant improvement.""    However, the Census Bureau found some cause for encouragement in the report,  pointing to a 1.7% increase in per-capita personal income last year.    ""It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved,"" said  William Butz, the agency's associate director for demographics.    The poverty rate fell from 13.4% in 1987 to 13.1% last year, and the number of  impoverished people dropped from 32.3 million to 31.9 million.    Whites, blacks and Latinos made no significant gains in 1988, leaving wide gaps  between the three groups' poverty rates: 10.1% for whites, 31.6% for blacks and  26.8% for Latinos.    Both the number of poor people and the poverty rate have been inching down  since 1983, but each still exceeds the recent low points, set in 1978, when the  poverty rate was 11.4% and 24.5 million people were impoverished.    The poverty line last year was $12,092 for a family of four.    Greenstein said that there has been a lack of progress against poverty recently  because the benefits of the economic expansion are flowing disproportionately  to the wealthiest Americans.    The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6% of total national family  income in 1988, the lowest percentage since 1954, but the richest fifth  received 44%, the highest ever recorded, he said.    The Census Bureau reported also a jump in real per-capita income last year, to  a new high of $13,120. Blacks made bigger gains than whites but still lagged  far behind.    Income of whites rose 1.5% to $13,900; income of blacks increased 3.9% to  $8,270. Per-capita income of Latinos was virtually unchanged at $7,960.    There were notable income gains in certain parts of the country. Median  household income shot up 3.7% to $30,430 in the Northeast and rose 2.6% in the  Midwest to $27,540.

These differences are more fully discussed below.     a.     Need_Absolute number of persons in poverty.     HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the absolute number of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit of general local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately for this factor. Applicants which are county governments are rated separately from all other applicants. Applicants in each group are compared in terms of the number of persons whose incomes are below the poverty level. Individual scores are obtained by dividing each applicant's absolute number of persons in poverty by the greatest number of persons in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75.     b.     Need_Percent of persons in poverty.     HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the percent of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit of general local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately for this factor. Applicants in each group are compared in terms of the percentage of their population below the poverty level. Individual scores are obtained by dividing each applicant's percentage of persons in poverty by the highest percentage of persons in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75.     c.     Program Impact_General.     In evaluating program impact, HUD will consider:           _Extent and seriousness of the identified needs;   _Results to be achieved;   _Number of beneficiaries, given the type of program;   _Nature of the benefit;   _Additional actions that may be necessary to fully resolve the need;   _Previous coordinated actions taken by the applicant to address the need;   _Environmental considerations;   _Whether displacement will be involved and what steps will be taken to minimize displacement and to mitigate its adverse effects or related hardships; and   _Where appropriate, housing site selection standards.              Assessments are done on a comparative basis and, as a result, it is important that each applicant present information in a detailed and uniform manner.       In addressing Program Impact criteria, applicants should adhere to the following general guidelines for quantification. Where appropriate, absolute and percentage figures should be used to describe the extent of community development needs and the impact of the proposed program. This includes, but is not limited to, appropriate units of measure (e.g., number of housing units or structures, linear feet of pipe, pounds per square inch, etc.), and costs per unit of measure. These quantification guidelines apply to the description of need, the nature of proposed activities and the extent to which the proposed program will address the identified need.         "

Documenting and Explaining SIPP-CPS Differences in Aged Poverty Rates_ORS94005       The official poverty measure and its three derivative statistics (poverty counts, poverty rates and poverty gaps) are important and frequently used criteria employed in the formulation of policy and the evaluation of program outcomes for the aged and disabled populations served by SSA.   Twelve-month poverty rates based on the SIPP are somewhat lower for many population subgroups than the poverty rates estimated from the CPS. Much of the comparison of poverty rates from the two surveys has been based on the first operational SIPP panel (the 1984 panel) which pertained to the 198385 time period. In the 1984 panel context, SIPP-CPS poverty rate differences for the aged, were, if anything, less marked than for younger age groups. Based on a review of published poverty rate estimates based on SIPP panels for 19851990 and comparison to corresponding estimates based on the CPS, it appears that a significant change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates appeared with the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel. Key features of the change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates include: 1) a modest decline in the poverty rate for all ages in the SIPP relative to the CPS; 2) a much more marked SIPP-CPS difference in poverty rates for the aged than the nonaged (with SIPP rates for the aged ranging between 28 and 34 percent below those based on the CPS); 3) a marked attenuation of the tendency for poverty rates to increase strongly with age among those age 65 and older in the SIPP context as compared with the CPS. Furthermore, preliminary research conducted at SSA indicates that SIPP_CPS poverty rate differences among the aged appear to vary significantly by sex, age, marital status, race and ethnicity; differences appear to be particularly marked for persons who are married, white, or age 85 or older.

The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s. The shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third world, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty. In the directive, Mr Preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured'. He adds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that these policies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'. The bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past best practice on poverty reduction. The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing countries within two years. These would form the basis for a 'collaborative approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'. The directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality' on borrowing countries. 'Stronger government commitment to poverty reduction warrants greater support; conversely, weaker commitment to poverty reduction warrants less support,' it says. Mr Preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the 1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing countries. The new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past decade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'. The bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poor in developing countries will rise during the 1990s, rather than stabilise as had been expected.

That is, we plan to work hard  to basically solve the problem of food and clothes for the 80  million poor people in seven years. This is a significant  decision by the party Central Committee and State Council based  on our country's tremendous achievements in the poverty relief  scheme and development efforts.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Poverty is not socialism  and socialism wants to eliminate poverty. In the 40-odd years  since the founding of the PRC, led by the party and government,  people in our country of all nationalities have made arduous  efforts and scored world-renowned achievements in eliminating  poverty and winning national prosperity, wealth, and power. In  particular, following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, a range of rural reform polices, consisting  mainly of the contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output, launched the rural  economy on unprecedented development. Peasants' income rose  sharply. In some areas, peasants led the way toward a  comparatively well-off status, and most of the peasants now have  enough to eat and wear. The problem of poverty, one that has  long plagued rural areas, has been solved to a significant  extent.    The party and government have always been concerned about  production and living in poor areas and have viewed and pursued  poverty-relief work as a key task. Following reform and opening  up, they have adopted various measures to strengthen  poverty-relief work. They have increased capital inputs and  adjusted and reformed the traditional poverty-relief methods,  linking relief to developmental projects instead of keeping them  as pure welfare programs. As a result, extensive areas of  chronic poverty changed their outlook and poverty was reduced  significantly. This was an achievement of a historic nature,  one scored against the persistently high percentages of poor  populations and deteriorating poverty in the 1980's and fully  revealing the superiority of the socialist system.    However, ours is a big country where situations differ and  development varies in level. While the problem of having enough  to eat and wear is no longer a national problem, there are still  some areas where development remains slow and part of the  population still do not have enough to eat and wear. People in  a few extremely poor areas still lead a very hard life. The  implementation of the ""Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult  Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan"" carries  great realistic and profound historical significance. Solving  the problem of having enough to eat and wear for 80 million  people by the end of this century means the solution of the  subsistence problem for one quarter of the world's population.  This will be a great event forever written on Chinese history  as well as a great act in the development of mankind. Poor  people account for only a minority of the country's rural  population, however most of them live in hilly areas, rocky  mountains, deserts, high-altitude mountains, loess plateaus,  areas of high epidemics, and reservoir areas in the mid-west.  Remoteness, inaccessibility, imbalanced ecology, slow economic  development, and backward culture and education mean harsh  living conditions. Therefore, seven years will be required to  solve the problem of having enough to eat and wear for  populations in these poor areas. The task is much more difficult  than the poverty-relief work in the early phase.    We are determined, confident, and capable of winning this  poverty-fighting battle. First, the party Central Committee and  the State Council are taking this task very seriously. The 14th  Party Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee convened last year, and the central rural work  conference and related documents all stressed the significance  of poverty relief and development work and put forward  objectives and requirements. The leading comrade of the party  Central Committee and State Council made many visits to poor  areas to conduct investigations and studies and organized  leadership there. These are the important guarantees for  winning the battle of tackling key problems in poverty-relief  work. Secondly, the vast number of cadres and people in poor  areas have a strong wish to rid themselves of poverty and  backwardness. There is enormous motivation among them to shed  poverty and attain wealth. This is the inner dynamism for  fighting this decisive battle against poverty. The fact that a  large number of models who rid themselves of poverty and  attained wealth with essential state help and their own  independent effort have emerged from previous poverty relief and  development, fully proves the point. Thirdly, further deepening  reforms, especially the gradual establishment of the socialist  market economic system, has brought unprecedented opportunity  and wide prospects for economic development in poor areas. For  instance, as a result of comprehensive opening up, large numbers  of remote borders and backward, quiet, and inland poor areas are  becoming outposts for opening up and key ports for border trade.  High-speed growth in coastal economically advanced areas have  created massive labor service markets and job opportunities for  the abundant labor supply in poor areas. As reforms in the  circulation sector gradually unfold and prices are deregulated,  poor areas may look forward to a real possibility of exchanging  their rich natural resources for goods and services of coastal,  economically advanced areas on parity and increases in their  income. Fourth, the state will increase, as it has done before,  inputs in poor areas and the effort at poverty relief and  development. The State Council has decided to, from now until  2000, annually increase 1 billion yuan worth of work-relief  programs and special interest-inclusive loans. Provinces,  cities, and autonomous regions will also increase input in  poverty relief and development. These are the material  guarantees for the effort to take on the most difficult problems  in poverty relief.    Strengthening leadership at all levels in poor areas is an  important condition for the battle to fight poverty. Policies,  capital, and projects are naturally important, but they require  a strong and combative leadership in order to be useful. Such a  strong leadership must have sustained and unflinching courage,  an enterprising spirit, readiness for long-term struggle,  concern for the masses, and a good, pragmatic, and down-to-earth  work style. Such leadership will unify party members, cadres,  and the masses to change poverty.    Tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief is  not  only an affair for poor areas, but also a common responsibility  for the whole society, and requires the effort of all members in  society. All professions, trades, departments, democratic  parties, and people's associations must look at poverty relief  as part of their duties, practice traditional Chinese ethics,  and give their hearts and contribute their efforts to the  poverty-fighting battle.    The implementation of the ""Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult  Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan"" marks the  last decisive stage of poverty relief and development, which is  aimed at solving the problem of having enough to eat and wear in  rural areas. The realization of the scheme marks a new  historical stage in the economic and social development of poor  areas. Leading cadres must have a great sense of responsibility  and mission, and fight well the historically significant battle  of tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief. If  our ancient ancestors could feel ""ashamed of getting pay while  there are beggars in town,"" should we not feel the same today?  We believe that, led by the Central Committee and State  Council, the people of all nationalities throughout the country  will be united in heart and mind, join in concerted effort, win  this hard battle, and march into the 21st century triumphantly.

0,FT944-12663 ,"FT944-12663 _AN-EKAEZABCFT 941101   FT  01 NOV 94 / Wary businessmen welcome Mideast progress: Casablanca talks offer good contacts, but doubts remain      By JULIAN OZANNE and FRANCIS GHILES   International businessmen and bankers yesterday lauded recent political and macro-economic changes in the Middle East but delivered a hard-headed assessment of further reforms needed to open economies and stimulate large flows of investment into the region. While more than 1,000 businessmen have come to the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca, most are likely to go away with a pile of business cards and the seeds of future investments rather than signed contracts. 'We've made some good contacts here, though whether anything will actually transpire only time will tell,' said Mr Abraham Glezeman, president of Inter-Power, a US company seeking to develop a power plant in the Gaza Strip. 'But it exceeded my expectations.' For most businessmen at the Casablanca casbah, peace moves in the region are a necessary but not sufficient condition for greater investment and better integrated economies. They want further reforms, including speeding up stalled privatisation programmes, removing trade barriers - among them the Arab economic boycott of Israel - abolishing excessive import restrictions and laws which restrict foreign equity holdings, reinforcing intellectual property rights, guaranteeing full repatriation of profits and dividends, granting better tax holidays and ensuring international mechanisms for the resolution of disputes. Mr Tom Vaughan, a director of Unilever, said: 'Most businesses have many places where they can invest their money and they are looking for a business environment of reasonable risks and good returns. It's still too early for specific deals but its very good to see Arab and Israeli delegations together talking about business, trade and economics.' Mr Sandy Allan, president of Coca-Cola Middle East, said his company had invested Dollars 350m in the region in the past five years and was seeking further expansion: 'There are problems but the potential for profitable businesses in the Middle East and North Africa is still excellent.' Some bankers said they were enthusiastic about the strengthening of emerging markets in the Middle East especially in Morocco, Jordan and Israel. Mr Daniel Smaller of Union Bank of Switzerland's emerging equity markets division, said the conference 'supports the view that these are exciting markets going through positive changes. For the first time the additional risk of geopolitical instability has been reduced, so price/earnings rations are expanding, providing investors with opportunities to participate.' However, Sir William Ryrie, executive director of Barings, said that of a total Dollars 62bn of equity flows into emerging markets last year, only Dollars 200m went to the Middle East. 'The peace process slightly improves our type of business,' he said. 'But the Middle East is way behind the game.' It emerged yesterday the first merchant bank to be set up in North Africa has just received approval from the central bank in Tunis. International Merchant Bank will have capital of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m and brings together individual shareholders from North African countries, institutions like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation which has contributed Dollars 300,000, and two European commercial banks - Societe Marseillaise de Credit and Creditanstalt Finanziaria, the Italian subsidiary of Austria's Creditanstalt Bankverein. But potential investors in the tourism sector are most likely to leave Casablanca with real deals in their pockets. Unfolding Middle East peace has increased public perceptions of regional stability, opened borders and unlocked the development of multi-destination packages. Delegates are expected to establish a regional tourism promotion and marketing body. Mr Basil Jardaneh, chairman of Royal Jordanian, Jordan's state-owned airline, said it was adding 20 flights next month. Mr Peter Till, a vice-president of Marriott, said he was spending time at the conference consolidating a planned project in the Gaza Strip for a hotel with a private Palestinian company. He said Marriott was aggressively seeking opportunities in Israel and looking at other Middle East countries. 'We are seeing increased stability and an improved business climate and we want to do more business.' Some companies are concerned about appeals by Israeli and Palestinian leaders for the private sector to alleviate poverty in Palestinian areas. 'How do we square this with seeking good returns on investment?' asked Mr Peter Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone investment bank of the US. The extent of the difficulties ahead for the Middle East in attracting private capital was demonstrated by the absence of Japanese companies. Mr Riki Kogure, head of Middle East division of Itochu, the large trading house, said only 1.2 per cent of total Japanese investment overseas went to the Middle East, largely due to a cultural gaps between Arabs and Japanese and the absence of high-level political links. Japanese and other foreign companies will be critical to financing and executing the multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects being put forward at the summit. Mr Anthony Pellegrini, manager of the World Bank infrastructure unit, said money from domestic budgets and concessional finance was 'nowhere near sufficient to deal with the infrastructure needs of the region'. Mr Eberhard von Koerber, president of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering combine, said the region needed Dollars 80bn over 10 years to meet basic power generation needs alone and warned: 'If the regulatory environment does not allow capital to make adequate returns, then we have to be very cautious.'

According to a plan announced by the Chinese Government  earlier this week, China is determined to wipe out abject  poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing shortages  for its now-remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens.    The ambitious plan is significant in the history both of the  Chinese people and mankind, for the rights to subsistence of  1.18 billion Chinese, which make up a quarter of the world  population, will soon have this fundamental human right secured.    Most of the 80 million people, about the same number as the  whole German population, live in remote mountain regions, rocky  regions, Loess plateau areas and remote deserts. Their lives  are disastrously affected by acute shortage of water and poor  public transport services, which make agricultural production  difficult, not to mention industrial development.    The per capita share of water in the poor areas is between a  16th and a 24th of the world's average. Electricity, education  and transport services are hardly available to most of the areas.    Compared with the poverty eased among about 45 million poor  people during the 1986-1992 period, the remaining poverty facing  80 million Chinese is much more difficult to wipe out than the  steps taken by China in 1978-1985.    The population of the poor decreased from about 200 million  in 1978 to 125 million in 1985, when China abolished the commune  system and introduced the household contract responsibility  system. The reform resulted in a sharp increase in grain output  and farmers' incomes.    During the eight-year poverty-reduction drive since 1986,  China earmarked about 30 billion yuan worth of grain, clothes  and other consumer goods for poverty alleviation, and allocated  about five billion yuan in aid or discount loans to help the  poor areas.    For the next seven years, in comparison, China should do at  least twice as much. It should help 11 million escape from  poverty each year during the coming seven years, while, on  average, only 6.4 million poor people did so each year in the  past seven, by getting enough food and clothes.    Despite the difficulty, China has many positive factors in  its fight against poverty, such as the growing government  investment, the priority given by the central and local  governments to social and economic development in the poor  areas, and support given by all walks of life and the  international organizations.    A recent government decision stipulates that when preparing  national and regional budgets, a set sum of money should be used  for poverty reduction by the central and local financial  departments.    To beef up the poverty reduction drive, the central  government also made a decision to increase its investment in  the ""work for food program"" by one billion yuan each year before  the end of this century, and also extend one billion yuan  discount loans to the poor areas.    The investment in the program would total four billion yuan  in 1994 and 1995, respectively.    China's opening of its developing inland areas, particularly  the border areas, has promoted local businesses and benefited  from their trade with their neighboring countries or other areas.    The booming Chinese economy also contributed greatly to  poverty alleviation, offering many jobs to surplus laborers in  the poor area.    About 10 million surplus farmers in China's most populous  Sichuan Province were employed last year by businesses in and  outside the province, who earned a total of 10 billion yuan.    Past practice shows that if a laborer from a poor rural  family is hired by a business, the money earned by the laborer  will enable the whole of his poor family to get enough food and  clothes.    In addition, the poor areas, which are rich in resources,  will earn much more money as China is reforming its commodity  circulation and pricing systems, including a gradual lifting of  its control over prices of raw materials and primary goods.    All these factors, together with other efforts, such as  making water, power, education, public health and transport  services available to the poor, will certainly ensure the  realization of the plan to wipe out abject poverty in China.

She lives in a mud hut in the village of Dareda in the district of Babati in Tanzania. Her age, I estimate, is about 25 and she has five children under seven years of age. The aid worker who introduced this lady to me last week described her as a 'mover and shaker' and influential in persuading her neighbours to adopt new farming ideas. For women, I was told, were the real farmers in this part of Africa. The men tend to sit around most of the time discussing great issues and drinking locally distilled gin. Their wives till the soil, plant and harvest the crops and milk the goats, as well as cooking meals and rearing a large brood of children. That is why Farm Africa, a British-based charity is targeting women in this densely populated area. If they can persuade them to adopt more efficient methods of food production, the charity reasons, their activities will have the greatest overall effect on the well-being of children and the whole community. The methods used by Farm Africa are basic. Firstly it tries to establish what the women themselves need, which sounds obvious but is radically different from the approach of some other aid agencies. Many major charities have the reputation of imposing on poor communities massive 'improvement' schemes that may be alien to local culture and therefore destined for failure. Farm Africa starts at grassroots. In Dareda it has been established that the small herds of goats owned by most families are not only grossly inefficient for both milk and meat production but, as they roam the village, usually tended by children, are also denuding the area of vegetation and trees. Goats are widely recognised as destructive animals because of their indiscriminate grazing habits. Farm Africa is therefore recommending to the women that they erect small huts for their goats and keep them confined all the time. The feed is then cut and carried to them by a system called, in more advanced agricultural societies, zero grazing. The paradox is that animal welfarists in the west condemn such systems for limiting the movement of the animals. In Tanzania, however, the priorities are different and damage to the environment leading to lack of food for the future together with associated erosion of the soil are seen as the most important considerations. Alongside this changed system of goat keeping Farm Africa has introduced British-bred female goats which give five to six pints of milk a day, three to four times as much as the native nannies. This is a quantum leap in production and although the number of British Toggenbergs in Dareda is so far only about 30 females and one male the effect on those who have them has been dramatic. Children are better nourished by the larger quantities of rich milk and the superior goats give the families a feeling of greater wealth. But Farm Africa is anxious to spread these benefits as widely as possible and insist that after one lactation each Toggenberg female is passed on to another family leaving the first owner with the young goat it has just produced. In addition the billy goat is made available for a fee of about Pounds 2 to mate with the local village females. A service fee for goats was unheard of until Farm Africa arrived but such is the perceived improvement in potential production from the cross breeding that the billy is kept very busy. The initiative also advocates a programme of tree planting and has developed a simple but more efficient stove for cooking. In the past this has been done on open fires, which burn a great deal of wood. This too has led to the cutting of large areas of trees and there has previously been little attempt to replant. All over Tanzania the heavy downfalls of the rainy season has gouged great channels through the unprotected red soils and washed the aluvium down the rivers. So the combination of the fuel-efficient clay stoves, moulded and made by women like Mama Flora Yrafay and sold to others for a little over Pounds 1 each and the tree planting programme will in time help to control the erosion. Another aspect of Farm Africa's initiative is to encourage farmers, in other words the women of the community, to use oxen to relieve some of their burdens. At present most land work and water carrying is done by hand or head and on foot. Tractors are far too expensive and hi-tech, so oxen are the appropriate compromise. Groups of co-operating women are being encouraged to take out interest-free loans from Farm Africa with which to purchase two or four oxen together with basic equipment like a plough, a weeder and a cart. All these improvements are also being disseminated through the local government-employed extension service - one man who, lacking any other means of transport, has to walk from farm to farm over a vast area - and through the schools. As would be expected in a country where it is normal for families to have between five and ten children the schools are teeming with pupils. But they too have few resources and it is not unusual to find a ratio of one teacher to 90 or a 100 children. The schools do, however, usually have a few acres of land - as food production is the most crucial subject children can study. Time spent at this level, says Farm Africa, is a vital investment in the future. But the scale of the problem of rural poverty in Tanzania is immense. Of its 23m people it is estimated that 90 per cent are involved in agriculture - usually at subsistence level or worse. The population of the country is increasing at about 3 per cent each year and 50 per cent of Tanzanians are under 14 years of age. The socialist government, which has owned all the land since nationalisation in 1974 but is just beginning a modest programme of privatisation, claims there is plenty of land for the next generation. But there certainly is not enough in districts such as Babati and villages like Dareda. Each family has just 2 acres allocated by the government and to split these tiny holdings among the next generation would make subsistence for a family impossible. The answer, says the Tanzanian government, is to relocate to other areas of the country where the population is less dense. But the reasons so many are concentrated around Dareda is because it is a good farming area with relatively reliable rainfall. Conversely, the reason other areas are under-populated is because the land is poor and the rain unreliable. Clearly population control is an urgent priority. But the culture of the people is such that large families are seen as security for old age and there appears little inclination to tackle such a delicate subject. My farmers' assessment of the food supply situation in Tanzania is that it is a disaster waiting to happen. Poverty breeds population and wealth is denied to all but those who exploit the system. Corruption is admitted to be rife at all levels of government and business. Given the size of the problem Farm Africa's efforts seem puny. But at least it is starting at the right level and the tiny area in which it operates is already beginning to benefit from its efforts.   Countries:-  TZZ  Tanzania, Africa.

0,FT943-5083 ,"FT943-5083 _AN-EIFD0ACZFT 940906   FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Ill-health linked to low status      By ANDREW DERRINGTON   Low social status rather than the impact of poverty is the main reason poor people do not live as long as the rich and become ill more often, the association was told yesterday. Professor Robert Evans, a health economist from the University of British Columbia, used studies of monkeys living in captivity, free-living baboons in East Africa and Whitehall civil servants to support his argument that ill-health is caused by the stresses of social interaction between people - or baboons - of different status. Civil servants were divided into four categories of increasing social status. Those in the upper echelons had longer life expectancy and lower incidence of disease than those in the categories beneath them. The baboons of the Serengeti showed a similar difference in health status correlated with their position in the pecking order. Reasons for the difference also emerged from measurements of stress-related hormones (glucocorticoids) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in blood samples taken at different times after social contacts between males of different status, he said. Glucocorticoid levels were higher in males of low social status. Levels in both groups peaked after encounters in which dominant males yawned at low-status males - to show their teeth - while the low-status males were eating or mating. The higher glucocorticoid level in submissive baboons persisted long after the encounter. Long-term glucocorticoid elevation also caused increases in LDL, a risk factor for heart attacks. High LDL levels were found in the blood of low-status but not high-status males. To measure glucocorticoid levels it was necessary to shoot the baboons with anaesthetic darts to take blood. Although this could not be done with the civil servants - nor is it likely that their superiors yawn at them while they are mating - the measurement of their disease rates left little doubt that the results would have been similar. Prof Evans was speaking in a session on the challenges facing the National Health Service. He argued that changes to the NHS could not remove the inequality between rich and poor, because that difference does not result from differences in treatment. The results from the civil servants established that the inequality was not simply a difference between the well off and the destitute. Other speakers discussed how the internal market could improve healthcare in the UK. The correlation between health and socio-economic status was first systematically described 15 years ago in a report by Sir Douglas Black.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. World Bank officials argue that Ghana shows that adjustment, if properly pursued, need not mean greater poverty or fiscal austerity. The share of tax revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. And the sketchy evidence, according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on average, adjustment has shifted resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions. Nor can this growth record be explained by aid flows alone. Ghana remains heavily dependent on gross aid flow, totalling 8 per cent of GDP a year. But, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses, the net resource transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared with a sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent. There is another factor in Ghana's success, which World Bank officials prefer not to talk about: politics. Ghana's former military government has consistently tried to align its interests with the rural poor. The government also built an impressive record, over 10 years, before putting its popularity to the test at last autumn's elections. Ghana's record does seem to show that structural adjustment is necessary for an acceleration in economic growth. But it also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is insufficient for an accelerated growth and a rapid fall in poverty. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. The government plans to accelerate its growth rate to 8 per cent a year over the next decade, but it lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and physical infrastructure, and the civil service is weak. Meanwhile, the domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow commodity base for export earnings, manufacturing exports are tiny, foreign investment minimal. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990, compared with 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in Thailand. Success will be assured only when, and if, this investment starts to flow. Failure would be a serious blow to adjustment in Africa.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.

0,FT943-8324 ,"FT943-8324 _AN-EHRD3AAWFT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / UN warns of world's creaking cradle: Annual population report points to huge strains on resources      By BRONWEN MADDOX   The world's population is set to reach a staggering 10bn by the middle of the next century, up from 5.7bn now, the United Nations warned yesterday. The annual report from the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), released yesterday, says the projections assume that the average number of children born to each woman will continue to fall, as it has done steadily for several decades (see accompanying story). If birth rates fall by more it expects the world's population may be as low as 7.8bn people in 2050. If they stop falling, the total could reach 12.5bn. The difference between the upper and lower projections - nearly 5bn people, as much as the world's current population - has huge implications for prosperity, migration and demand for natural resources. But in advance of a UN conference in Cairo next month, controversy is mounting over how countries can try to restrain population growth, or whether they should do so at all. Global figures conceal the diverging fortunes of different regions. Africa's population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in total fertility rates - the average number of children born to each woman - they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 years to 61 years, according to the UNFPA. Industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to shrink given their slow rates of population growth: about 1 per cent a year in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025. The report flags a long list of economic, social and environmental concerns that follow from its projections. It warns that population growth will put huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and clean air. It dismisses fears of an 'overall global shortage of food' of the kind much voiced by 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago, pointing out that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'. But the report points out that the improvement in food production has been unevenly distributed; in Africa during the past decade, food production fell by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. The report concludes that while production 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable future . . . poverty translates global adequacy into national and local shortages'. Water, as much as food, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between countries and regions, the UN suggests. Rapidly industrialising countries such as China are facing intense demand for water supplies from industry as well as from rural populations which are continuing to grow. Developing countries should brace themselves for huge internal migration as surplus rural labour travels to the towns to look for work, the UN warns. The report estimates that 1.3bn will be added to the workforces of Asia, Africa and Latin America between 1995 and 2020. It adds that cities are likely to contain half the world's population by the end of the century. For their part, developed countries need to consider how to respond to rising pressure for immigration, particularly along Europe's and North America's southern borders. The UN describes present levels of international migration as 'hardly significant numerically - about a million people a year  -compared with movement within countries toward urban areas'. But it warns that such migration has 'a social and economic impact out of proportion to its numbers'.

Speaking at a national conference on poverty reduction,  State  Councillor Chen Junsheng said that the ambitious seven-year plan  includes raising the annual net income of the majority of the 80  million people to 500 yuan according to 1990 constant prices.    According to the plan, China will begin from this year to  improve infrastructural construction in poor areas, solving  drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic  animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and  connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks.    As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural,  educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas,  wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population,  offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural  population growth rate under the official limit.    ""The realization of the plan will be of great significance.  It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese  people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population,  will have been secured,"" said the state councillor, who is in  charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction  efforts.    Chen described it as a major event in the history of China  and a magnificent feat in the history of human development.    Most of the 80 million people are distributed throughout  remote mountainous regions, rocky regions, Loess Plateau areas  and remote deserts. The regions are characterized by a paucity  of natural resources and adverse natural environment, such as  severe shortages in drinking water or cultivable land, which  make it difficult for local people to produce enough food.    Chen said that in order to achieve the poverty reduction  target, China should reduce the poverty-stricken population by  an average 11 million each year in the coming seven years,  nearly twice as quickly as it has done in the past seven years.    During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about  45  million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year.    He stressed that the present poverty reduction tasks are  more  arduous than ever before, but are achievable, since the current  conditions are favorable for poverty alleviation.    The Chinese leadership has attached great importance to  poverty reduction, a guarantee of success in the poverty  elimination cause, he noted.    He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor  areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for  poverty elimination.    The Chinese Government has decided to increase its  investment  in the ""work for food program"" by five billion yuan and in  discount loans by one billion yuan each year during 1994-2000.    In addition, the current reforms in China, including the  effort to establish a socialist market economy, have provided  the poor regions with unprecedented chances for economic  development, the official said.    Because of the open policy, many remote, backward inland or  border regions, which used to be sealed off from the outside  world, have taken forward positions in China's opening drive and  opened important trading ports with neighboring countries.    The opening drive has promoted economic and trade  development  in the poor areas and uplifted the living standards of the  people.    The booming national economy has also created enormous jobs  for the poor regions, which are rich in labor resources.    Last year, the expanding labor market in and outside of  China  absorbed about 10 million laborers from sichuan, China's most  populous province, which earned about 10 billion yuan, Chen told  the meeting.    Thanks to the reform of commodity circulation systems and  gradual lifting of controls over prices, the poor areas will  earn much more through exploiting their rich natural resources  than before.    According to statistics from the State Planning Commission,  China has used about 30 billion yuan worth of industrial goods  and food to finance development programs in poor regions since  it launched ""the work for food program"" a decade ago.    During each year of the past decade, the Chinese Government  itself allocated five billion yuan to poor regions in aid or  soft loans.    China's poor have decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80  million in 1992.     "

Unless the world senses that  Egypt is prepared to assume a key role in the region no one will  assist us. The result would be negative both in terms of the  Egyptian domestic scene and the life of ordinary Egyptians.  Many nations have fallen behind, retreating into backwardness  and poverty that Egypt is not eager to join, he stated.    Speaking to chief editors of Egyptian newspapers during the  plane trip from Harare to Cairo, Mubarak said that the daunting  efforts in which he is engaged, his exchanges with various world  leaders, and his bid to achieve stability in the region have  demonstrated to the entire world, particularly the big powers,  the vitality of Egypt's role in this part of the world. Egypt's  policy during the Gulf war proved to the whole world that Egypt  is a reliable force, he said.    President Mubarak said that the consultations he held with  leaders of major countries and his friendship with them led  these countries to adopt policies that helped Egypt in its talks  with the IMF.    The world does not appreciate reclusive nations and that  major powers only support those countries that have stature and  influence and get involved in world events, Mubarak pointed out.    President Mubarak said that he is in constant touch with  U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat,  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, and Jordan's King Husayn in an  effort to stimulate the peace process and resume the  Arab-Israeli talks in Washington. He pointed out that even  during his stay in Harare he talked on the telephone with King  Husayn.    President Mubarak added that the contacts he had with  President Clinton and all the other parties produced results,  particularly following the UN Security Council resolution  concerning the massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. An Israeli  delegation will meet in Tunisia with Palestinian officials to  review current proposals and prepare for high-level  Palestinian-Israeli talks, he remarked.    'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are likely  to meet in Cairo to sign an agreement detailing the practical  measures for the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles, Mubarak said. The agreement will set  a timetable for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return  of 'Arafat to Palestinian land. The president pointed out that  an Israeli- Palestinian agreement was already reached before the  Hebron massacre occurred.    Jerusalem's status will be determined through negotiations,  Mubarak said. A statement in which U.S. President Clinton  declared otherwise [a'lana ghayr dhalik] has been cited by a  U.S. television network, but this statement was denied by an  adviser at the U.S. Department of State who was speaking to  journalists in Cairo last Thursday, Mubarak remarked. President  Mubarak reemphasized the position of the U.S. Administration  vis-a-vis Jerusalem, whose status will be determined through  negotiations [al-quds allati sayatahaddadu mawqifaha min khilal  al-mufawadat].    Concerning the possibility that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher might visit the region in the near future,  President Mubarak said: Such a visit is likely.    To a question about the attitude of some Arab rulers toward  Egypt, President Mubarak said: I don't care about persons, but  I do care about the Arab nations. My principal concern is the  interest of these nations. We are against the partitioning of  Iraq and Sudan.    To another question about the recent visit to Cairo by  Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, and the possibilities of arranging a meeting between  them in Cairo soon to achieve national reconciliation, President  Mubarak said that Egypt is making the necessary contacts in this  regard to achieve progress. However, the arrangements for such  a meeting in Cairo must be preceded by an agreement between the  two sides, President Mubarak added.    Alluding to the issue of national dialogue in Egypt,  President Mubarak said that he will call for the start of this  dialogue next April and that he will deliver a speech when the  dialogue starts. He pointed out that working groups and a  committee representing all concerned groups will be formed. He  affirmed that the government is currently carrying out tangible  and concrete efforts, adding that Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi's tours of various governorates have helped to solve many  problems. President Mubarak said that some 200 projects were  recently set up in Suhaj Governorate, noting that this will help  solve the problem of unemployment.    Continuing, President Mubarak said that the government will  make strenuous efforts in the various fields by the end of this  year and the beginning of next year.    Commenting on current intensive activity by the political  parties to prepare for next year's People's Assembly and  Consultative Council elections, President Mubarak said that  everybody is encouraged to join such activity and he is sure  that the makeup of future parliaments will reflect this popular  participation.    He asserted that the government is doing its best to solve  all problems, particularly important ones like unemployment. He  urged further efforts to solve this problem gradually.    President Mubarak said that in the past Egypt had no  currency  reserves in the banks and that current reserves must not be  squandered but kept for appropriate uses, noting that the money  belongs both to the public and the banks.    Discussing the reduced revenue from tourism and the demands  made by some people working in the tourist business, he said  that the government has exempted owners of tourist businesses in  Aswan from taxes for 10 years. He noted, however, that some  unreasonable requests are being made. He said many citizens  have suffered as a result of lower tourism profits.    Mubarak said although some people are disturbed by the  evident wealth of some Egyptians, one must remember that wealthy  people who invest their money in projects or spend it at hotels  and other places are actually helping to create jobs for others.  He explained that this issue must be viewed from a practical  angle, taking into account the benefit to society and Egyptian  families.    On the South African Committee meeting that President  Mubarak chaired in Harare yesterday, the president said that the  committee had met to discuss measures by which the OAU could  contribute to backing the democratic process in South Africa.  President Mubarak noted that the KwaZulu announced their  independence yesterday and that they want to set up a state  independent of South Africa, but the South African Committee in  its meeting yesterday rejected the question of KwaZulu's  independence. He noted that the final statement issued by the  committee had reaffirmed the territorial integrity of South  Africa. President Mubarak added: We will hold urgent and  extensive talks with all parties, the major states, and the  United States to assist the democratic process in South Africa  and facilitate the elections that will be held on 27 April.    President Mubarak noted that the white right-wing party  [al-hizb al-abyad al-yamini] in South Africa is pressing the  KwaZulu to create these problems, adding that urgent messages  will be sent in the next two days to resolve these problems.  President Mubarak described the results of the South African  Committee meetings as good. He noted that there was a proposal  to hold an international conference on the elections in South  Africa, but the proposal was not accepted. Besides, he added,  the people of South Africa must approve of such a conference  first. He pointed out that the elections will be held on 27  April and the South Africans do not want to postpone them,  because such a postponement would be a disaster for them and  would lead to serious consequences.    Asked if he would go to South Africa on 10 May following the  elections in his capacity as OAU chairman, the president said  that nothing has been decided yet, adding that this could be  determined after the elections. The president expressed concern  over the current events in South Africa, where some people are  sneaking their money out of the country. He noted that this  will have a very negative effect on development in South Africa  after the elections. He hoped that there would be stability in  South Africa in the coming stage and that the national forces  would avoid potential conflicts.    On the status of the KwaZulu in South Africa, President  Mubarak said that the KwaZulu have no resources, oil, or  minerals, but they are closely linked to the apartheid regime.     "

0,FT934-17445 ,"FT934-17445 _AN-DJAC3AA7FT 931001   FT  01 OCT 93 / Who Knows Whom to be SA bestseller: ANC links in a publishing joint venture      By PATTI WALDMEIR   WHEN does a fledgling investment company with no track record, no assets to speak of, inexperienced management and no publishing expertise become the perfect joint venture partner in a potentially lucrative publishing deal? When that company has the probable future government of South Africa on its side. Thebe Investment Corporation, a black-managed company which has strong links with the African National Congress, this week announced it had reached agreement with Macmillan of the UK to launch an educational publishing company. Thebe will own 42.5 per cent of the new company, Macmillan 47.5 per cent and an existing small black-owned publisher, Skotaville, 10 per cent. Though all parties to the deal deny this, rivals believe that Thebe will use its excellent contacts with the ANC to see that the new company gets lucrative contracts to publish school textbooks - just as the ruling National party has for decades steered important public sector contracts the way of Afrikaner businesses which have in turn helped bankroll the party. The party channeled state business to other members of the white tribe of Africa, with the aim of lifting Afrikaners out of poverty and strengthening their hold on power. The Thebe deal has caused consternation in South African business circles, because the only apparent rationale for it is political. Many South Africans fear the country's new rulers will take their principles of governance straight from the National party. Black empowerment - the mirror image of Afrikaner upliftment - is Thebe's primary goal, says Mr Vusi Khanyile, managing director. Mr Khanyile was formerly head of the ANC finance department; another member of the Thebe board, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, is a chairman of the ANC in the powerful region around Johannesburg and is one of its most prominent leaders; a third board member, Mr Enos Mabuza, has strong personal links to the ANC though he holds no official position. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, and Mr Walter Sisulu, deputy president, are trustees of the Batho-Batho trust, Thebe's sole shareholder. Mr Khanyile angrily denies suggestions that Thebe is an ANC company, and insists that the political affiliation of Thebe board members is irrelevant. 'Our links with the ANC have nothing to do with the viability of our business or the market share it will have,' he says, denying that Macmillan can expect privileged access to the R500m (Pounds 100m) educational publishing market. Still, he adds: 'Business must ensure that it is in harmony with the environment in which it operates. Thebe tries to remain in harmony with that environment. So we wouldn't go out of our way to make enemies with any political organisation.' Thebe was set up late last year, relies almost entirely on loan capital and has been plagued by frequent press reports of financial problems and alleged irregularities since its launch. Asked why Macmillan should strike a deal with a company such as Thebe, Mr Khanyile says only that Thebe is the biggest black investment company. This claim is impossible to assess, as Thebe discloses no financial details of its operations. In any event, Thebe is not the only black company Macmillan could have chosen. It is simply the best connected. Mr Christopher Paterson, chairman of Macmillan's southern African operations, says of the deal, which will involve an initial investment of R2m from the three partners: 'It is a conscious act to come in and redress the balance in educational publishing by starting a company which in its demographic make up reflects that of South Africa' and which gives a high priority to black employment. Other businessmen dismiss these as 'pious platitudes'. One director of a leading corporation says: 'It's but a step to a Nigerian situation where no business is done on commercial logic. It's all done on . . . who you know.' 'Thebe adds no value to this deal,' says another. 'It could well lend itself to abuse.' A disgruntled publisher adds: 'One group of nationalists are just taking over the levers of power from another group of nationalists.' Many fear that in this, as in other areas of public life, the new South Africa could end up having far too much in common with the old.   Companies:-  Thebe Investment Corp.     Macmillan.

0,FT911-3496 ,"FT911-3496 _AN-BDXBTAFSFT 910424   FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: Rebuilding South Africa   THE LINK between South Africa's efforts to negotiate a post-apartheid constitution and the state of the country's economy is becoming increasingly important. The process of fundamental political reform is difficult enough at the best of times. It is especially hazardous when times are hard. Now that the irreversibility of change in South Africa is so clearly apparent, the least western governments can do to improve the economic climate is to hasten the end of remaining sanctions. And the African National Congress, still fighting a last-ditch battle against repeal, should instead acknowledge that sanctions have achieved their purpose, declare victory and withdraw. As President F. W. de Klerk has pointed out during his visit to London, the combination of population growth of 2.6 per cent a year, and an average annual growth rate over the last decade of 1.6 per cent, makes a grim backdrop to the constitutional process now under way in South Africa. There is a danger that this process can be derailed by the violence that wracks the country; and while political tensions are at the heart of the fighting, there is little doubt that these tensions are exacerbated by poverty and rising unemployment. Mr de Klerk is thus right to argue that economic growth and constitutional reform have to be mutually reinforcing. The lifting of sanctions combined with new investment is an essential condition to South Africa's economic recovery, which in turn is critical to growth in the whole region. Conflicting signals Unfortunately there continue to be conflicting signals from South Africa. Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, due in London today, can be expected to persist in the ANC's view that it is too soon to lift trade and other embargoes against Pretoria, arguing that continued outside pressure is needed if Mr de Klerk is to fulfil his pledge to create a non-racial South Africa. This argument held good until Mr de Klerk so convincingly demonstrated his commitment to reform. But by the end of June the last pillars of apartheid will have been repealed - the Group Areas Act, the Land Acts, and the racial provisions of the Population Registration Act. Even if the government wanted to, it could not now rebuild apartheid. The internal pressures that brought about the system's demise - demographic changes, the growth of black trade unions, the increasing importance of black consumers, shortages of white skilled manpower - are as powerful as ever. Meanwhile the new constitution for South Africa is slowly starting to take shape. The ANC's draft constitutional principles, published earlier this month, revealed encouraging common ground with Pretoria. Both parties propose a bill of rights, proportional representation, and a bi-cameral assembly. Sticking points On the face of it, the ANC demand that the constitution be drawn up by a constituent assembly, and its call for an interim government, are sticking points in the transition process. But there are signs that a compromise may be possible. Pretoria has indicated that once the multi-party conference, expected to convene later this year, has reached agreement on the principles of the new constitution, they could be placed before a multi-party conference instead of a constituent assembly. And yesterday in London Mr de Klerk went some way towards meeting the ANC's call for an interim government, offering all main political leaders 'a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions' during the period leading to a new constitution. These developments should encourage the business community whose support Mr de Klerk has been seeking during his visit to London. Of course, Mr de Klerk must convince would-be investors that the violence that continues to scar the country will soon be brought to an end. But they can play an important part in bringing this about by taking an important role in the building of a new South Africa.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

The average poverty rate during  the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations was 11.9%. Why has the poverty rate  averaged 14.2% over the last eight years? Why has the increase in poverty  rates, for all families including black families, occurred among both  married-couple families and female-headed families? Why has the poverty rate  for the black elderly risen from 31% to 33.9% and for the Latino elderly from  22.5% to 27.4% over this last year when the poverty rate for white elderly has  declined?     -- Are the welfare programs that are intended to aid the poor a major cause of  the poverty they are intended to relieve? More than 20% of all American  children live in poverty. The welfare program intended to assist poor children  and their families is called Aid To Families With Dependent Children (AFDC).  Given the low cash benefits provided, that program removes only 3% of poor  children from poverty. It is difficult to imagine a less successful  anti-poverty program. Yet, indignation about the growing impoverishment of the  nation's children is hardly detectable in the criticism one hears about  welfare. Are we more offended by the ""dependency"" of families who rely on  government than we are by their ""poverty""? In 1986, 52 of every 100 poor  children received an AFDC benefit. In 1979, 72 of every 100 poor children  received such aid. Those offended by ""dependency"" will find ""progress"" in these  numbers.

'The international economic environment is likely to be more favourable for developing countries as a whole during the 1990s than it has been in the last 20 years,' said Mr Michael Bruno, chief economist at the Washington-based development institution. 'Developing countries are projected to grow at a rate of 4.8 per cent per annum during the coming decade, considerably higher than the 3 per cent per annum recorded during the 1980s,' Mr Bruno said. Although growth in the industrialised countries has in the past had a large spillover effect on the rest of the world, the World Bank says in its annual assessment of global economic prospects, published yesterday, that the modest growth rates of 2.5 to 3 per cent likely in Europe, North America and Japan over the next decade need not hold back the developing nations. Mr Bruno said lower real interest rates, higher flows of private capital into the developing countries, fast growing world trade and a stabilisation of real commodity prices should create a more favourable environment for the developing countries. He warned, however, that generally strong growth could disguise severe disparities between regions and countries: while east Asia would probably continue to fare well, even modest improvements in growth rates were still likely to leave more people in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. East Asia's growth over the next decade is likely to be less spectacular than in the past, because the region will encounter infrastructural bottlenecks and environmental constraints. Nevertheless, growth rates in the region are likely to average more than 7 per cent a year. South Asia already improved its economic performance in the 1980s, and steady growth rates of around 5.3 per cent a year are projected for the next 10 years, while growth in Latin America and the Caribbean could accelerate to 3.4 per cent a year. Sub-Saharan Africa has an opportunity for modest acceleration of growth rates to 3.9 per cent a year, especially if the continent's civil wars abate. Nevertheless, the World Bank concludes, 'limited stock of capital equipment, infrastructure and human capital preclude any sharp improvement in living standards'. Mr Bruno said that much of the downside risk for the developing countries came from the possibility that the industrialised countries would falter in their efforts to tackle their budget deficits and to undertake supply side reforms, causing higher interest rates, lower growth and protectionist pressures.

0,FT933-11867 ,"FT933-11867 _AN-DG0CFAGBFT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (9): Hopes may be too high - Edward Balls examines some harsh realities for the future      By EDWARD BALLS   GHANA is perhaps the only African country to have accepted the spirit, as well as the letter, of the World Bank's list of market-based reforms over the past decade. But after 10 years of structural adjustment, the country has yet to receive the promised rewards. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take Ghana 20 years to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. Only then would the average poor Ghanaian reach the poverty threshold - defined as two-thirds of today's average consumption per head. To succeed, the World Bank's African role model must make the leap into accelerated growth and wean itself off foreign aid by attracting much more of the private and foreign direct investment that Africa so desperately needs. Failure to do so would mean, rightly or wrongly, a damaging blow to the Bank's reputation in the continent. Little wonder that understandably nervous World Bank officials hurry to damp down expectations about Ghana's future prospects while stressing the progress that has already been made. Yes, they acknowledge, Ghana remains a very poor country (average incomes averaged around Dollars 400 per head) and relies heavily on foreign assistance. But Ghana's economic performance has still been impressive over the past decade relative both to the previous 10 years and the rest of the continent. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. GDP growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1983; in sub-Saharan Africa the average is 2.1 per cent. These growth rates occurred while Ghana's terms of trade have fallen relentlessly. While gross aid flows have averaged 8 per cent of GDP a year, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses the net resource transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared to a sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent. In short, World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials argue, Ghana confirms that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for successful development. Low inflation, a realistically valued exchange rate, reduced tariff barriers and the removal of numerous restrictions on investment, have together delivered much faster growth. Ghana's experience, they argue, also undermines some common myths about adjustment. Does structural adjustment require a smaller public sector? Fewer civil servants, perhaps, but the share tax revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. Does adjustment hit the poor harder? The sketchy evidence, according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on average, adjustment has reduced the incidence of poverty by shifting resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions. But Ghana also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is insufficient for an acceleration of economic growth and a rapid fall in poverty. The obstacles to an acceleration in economic growth to the levels achieved by the east Asian developing economies over the past two decades will not be rectified by low inflation and liberalisation alone. Ghana lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and physical infrastructure, as the charts show. 80 per cent primary school enrolment is high by African standards but low compared to east Asia. And the capacity of Ghana's civil service to implement reforms remains disappointing, as Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, readily admits. Most worrying are the low level of private sector investment and the small share of manufacturing investment in GDP. Last year's balance of payments does, in fact, suggest that flight capital may be beginning to return. But inflows of foreign direct investment remain low. Senior government minsters call for a new 'agenda of activism' to address these deficiencies. Mr Botchwey stresses the need to attract foreign investment to supplement Ghana's small pool of domestic private savings and trumpets the new investment code. He talks of packages of tax cuts and tariff concessions to attract particular foreign investors. Meanwhile the Bank of Ghana is using all its powers of moral suasion to encourage the banking sector to bias its foreign exchange operations towards export-orientated business and offer cheaper term loans for new investments. The Bank has made it clear, says one banker in Accra, that 'importing second-hand cars is not consistent with sustainable development.' But the government appears undecided about whether to bow to pressure for infant industry protection, from members of the private sector advisory group, although the World Bank and IMF counsel strongly against it. 'Free trade means efficiency but it can also destroy domestic industry,' says one senior minister.' Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of Unilever Ghana, does not believe in protectionism. 'It breeds corruption and inefficiency,' he says. 'Most companies in Ghana asking for protection grew up in a shortage economy and have never had to justify their investment.' The missing ingredient is confidence. Senior ministers privately voice frustration at President Rawlings's occasional outbursts against particular private companies. Ghana's experience suggests some lessons for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Bank, Fund and government officials list some possible reasons for Ghana's success: Ownership: the Economic Recovery Programme was identified with the government, not the donors, and ministers took responsibility for mistakes as well as successes - at each stage, they worked hard to persuade interest groups that reforms were in their interests; Sequencing: reforms were carefully staggered - the devaluation occurred well before imports were liberalised - and not pushed through faster than the government's capacity limitations allowed; Aid: donor support was substantial and became available from the outset of the programme before the government had established a track record. But the missing element is politics. The military has consistently tried to align its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite who probably stand to lose more from adjustment in the early stages. And the government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10 year period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result. But the Rawlings government won the right to continue for a further term of four years, in an election which most western observers judged to be free and fair. That is perhaps the most encouraging sign yet that structural adjustment might work in Africa.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.

SIPP-CPS differences should be delineated for population subgroups defined in terms of salient characteristics such as marital status, more broadly defined aspects of family composition, including the presence of nonaged family members, age, race and ethnicity. Differences should, at a minimum, be characterized in terms of poverty counts, rates, and the poverty gap. Particular attention should be given to evaluating possible differences between the two surveys in the portrayal of poverty as it relates to increasing age. Given that the pattern of poverty by population subgroup is of particular interest, the relatively small sample size available in single SIPP panels as compared with the CPS is likely to be of some concern. If, as is suggested by review of published estimates, it can be shown that the basic patterns of SIPP-CPS differences are stable across the post-1984 SIPP panels, serious consideration should be given to pooling the post-1984 panels in order to support as detailed a subgroup analysis as is possible, given the substantially larger sample sizes available from pooled samples. If the combining of SIPP panels seems feasible, the combined panels should be employed to support the explanatory phase of the overall study, as well.   After developing a plan for documenting more fully SIPP-CPS differences in the portrayal of poverty among the aged, the grantee might discuss how the observed differences might be explained. In this regard a critical review of the literature that has considered the differences between poverty rate estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the CPS might prove quite useful in generating hypotheses and in formulating empirical approaches to testing the hypotheses. While several possible factors are likely to be suggested by this review (e.g., sample weighting, particularly that component of the overall weighting scheme designed to deal with panel attrition; differing operationalizations of the income unit; differing income concepts; and the quality of income data), emphasis in empirical work should be given to the last factor, the relative quality of the income data from the two surveys. However, some attention could also be given to the change in SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates that occurred with the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel.    1     The nature of each hypothesized factor to be considered and how it might cause the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences might be described. A closely reasoned plan for empirically assessing the possible impact data quality on the differences in SIPP-CPS poverty rates for the aged may be presented. Particular emphasis should be given to explaining the relevance of each proposed test for clarifying the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences, notwithstanding the fact that it may not be possible to devise fully unambiguous tests of the effects of income data quality on the observed SIPP-CPS differences.             1     The prospective grantee will find it useful to consult recent work conducted by the Bureau of the Census comparing income estimates for calendar year 1990 from the two surveys and Report no. 17, Studies in Income Distribution, for similar material related to SIPP/CPS differences for the 198384 period. Recent work conducted at the Bureau of the Census by Lamas, Tin and Eargle about the effect of attrition in the SIPP context on differences in SIPP-CPS poverty rates should also be consulted.        Given the level of available funding, empirical work should be limited to describing the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates (rates, counts, and gaps).   As much of the study will revolve around comparison of alternative estimates within or between survey contexts, issues of statistical inference also need to be given careful consideration. In particular, given the results of SSA research on the variance properties of SIPP-based estimates of the aged, standard errors for SIPP estimates should be based on the generalized variance parameters as estimated by SSA (see the note by Bye and Gallicchio appearing in the winter 1993 Social Security Bulletin) or calculated directly from the survey file using the methods outlined in the Bye-Gallicchio article.   Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding not to exceed 17 months in duration.   The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant.     "

'Poverty reduction must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development institution is judged,' he said. However, he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus. In congressional testimony this week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the US wanted to see more funding that 'will create social and economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strife and economic mismanagement. 'We will look for specific increases in the share of lending going for these purposes.' In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from Mr Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief. The share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for an increased emphasis on investment in people. At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress: a decade ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on poverty. But he said the bank had a 'long, long way to go'. While he expected an increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined to set precise targets for bank staff. Mr Preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen the bank's focus on poverty. The bank will publish annual progress reports charting its progress in poverty reduction. It will also seek the participation of the poor in the design as well as the implemention of projects. 'We want this to become the norm for our operations in the years to come,' Mr Preston said. He also released a report, 'Implementing the World Bank's Strategy to Reduce Poverty - Progress and Challenges,' that outlines progress to date. This highlights the diversity of performance on poverty reduction in the third world. East Asia has reduced the proportion of people in absolute poverty from over 30 per cent in 1970 to 10 per cent. Sub-Saharan Africa, however, had seen an increase in poverty which now affected half the people in the region. Mr Preston said bank efforts to reduce poverty could succeed only if governments concerned co-operated. Officials cited Indonesia, China, Mexico, and El Salvador as examples of countries that were co-operating well but declined to name poor performers. He said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitments for a Dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the International Development Agency (IDA), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.

Experts feel that poverty is  ancestral since its origins date back 500 years. Oaxaca State  has a poverty level of 11 percent and is the poorest state in  the country. Mexico City, with a poverty level of 0.1 percent,  is the least impoverished. Chiapas State's 111 municipalities  are poor. It is the second most impoverished state in the  country. The poverty there, as anywhere else, generates  ignorance. There is poverty, not misery, in Chiapas. Poverty  and the ignorance of those suffering from its consequences have  become a breeding ground for professional terrorists who have  pit the people of Chiapas -- luckily a minority of them --  against their institutions. Rural areas have the highest poverty  levels in this state. Monoculture is the chief occupation of  the people here. [passage omitted] It is in these areas where  the level of production and service infrastructure is very low.  About 60 percent of Chiapas residents live in rural areas.  Moreover, 99 percent of the state's 16,400 towns are rural.  Poverty in Chiapas has many indicators. For instance, 60  percent of the economically active population earns minimum  wages. Indians make up one-fifth of the population. Also, 19  percent of the people have no income. The illiteracy rate is 30  percent. There are no roads. [passage omitted]    [Lopez] Chiapas has a population of approximately 3.6  million. The current strife zone is located in six of its 111  municipalities. Four of these municipalities have a population  of a little more than 360,000 persons, or 11.8 percent of the  population. The majority of the people in Ocosingo, San  Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, and Comitan de  Dominguez, the site of last week's clashes, work the land. That  is where one cause of the conflict lies. With almost  nonexistent land reform following the victory of the revolution  and inadequate land distribution during the Cardenas eras,  pressure on the land has displaced a large number of people,  mostly Indians.

This is a victory which  thousands of members of COSATU have worked tirelessly for over  the last few months. It is fitting that workers were able to  celebrate this victory on May Day.    The decisive victory of the African National Congress is a  triumph for the people of South Africa in their struggle for  democracy and social justice. In particular it is a victory for  the working people. Workers voted for the ANC in their millions  because the ANC has represented their aspirations over the  years, and has a clear plan to build a better life for them and  their families.    The overwhelming majority of workers voted against the  negative and racist campaign of the NP [National Party]. They  voted in the knowledge that NP rule means exploitation,  division, and privilege for the few.    The ANC's positive message of peace, jobs, housing,  education, and a better life for all struck a deep chord in the  working people of our country. This message had credibility  because of the clear programme of reconstruction and development  [RDP] which the ANC put to the nation.    COSATU welcomes last night's statement of President Mandela  that the RDP will be the cornerstone of the government of  national unity, and that all parties will be expected to work  within this framework. We believe that this is the unambiguous  mandate given by the electorate. Trade unions and other  organisations of civil society will do all in our power to  ensure that the RDP is not blocked by any grouping elections [as  received]. We dip our flag in the memory of COSATU members and  leaders killed in their attempt to ensure free political  activity, including those comrades killed in Ulundi shortly  before the elections.    Now is the time for us to rebuild our country and  reconstruct  our economy. We call on business to join us and the democratic  government in creating jobs and basic social infrastructure for  all our people. The prospects for a significant economic boom  are extremely bright. We must not squander this opportunity on  speculative economic activity and white elephants. Our priority  is to restructure our industries in a manner which creates  sustainable economic growth and development aimed at addressing  poverty and extreme inequality. If all South Africans commit  themselves to this goal, we will witness an economic and social  miracle unprecedented in our country's history.     "
0,FT924-1254 ,"FT924-1254 _AN-CLRBYAARFT 921218   FT  18 DEC 92 / Popular movement urged to meet the needs of children      By DAVID DODWELL      GENEVA   THE United Nations Children's Fund yesterday called for a worldwide popular movement - 'the basic needs movement' - to raise Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.4bn) a year to meet children's needs for food, clean water and basic health care. Reaching this target would lower birth rates, and save the lives of more than 4m children a year, Unicef said in its annual 'State of the World's Children' report. This would create a breakthrough against 'the last great obscenity - the needless malnutrition, disease, and illiteracy that still casts a shadow over the lives, and the futures of the poorest quarter of the world's children'. 'The time has come to banish in shame the notion that the world cannot afford to meet the most obvious and basic needs of all its children,' said Mr James Grant, executive director of Unicef, pointing out that Dollars 25bn amounted to less than Europeans spend on wine each year, Americans on beer, and Japanese on business entertaining. This contrasts with about Dollars 750bn spent every year on the military. He added that progress depends not just on cash, but on sustained commitment and managerial competence by governments. 'It is an unacceptable disgrace to humanity for millions of children to be dying every year from diseases that can demonstrably be prevented and treated at almost negligible cost,' the report says. Unicef calls for two thirds of the Dollars 25bn needed to come from developing countries themselves. This could be achieved if governments spent 20 per cent of their budgets on basics such as food, water, sanitation, health care and family planning, the report says. It complains that at present, more is spent on the military, and on debt servicing than on health and education. The rest could be met out of aid funds if donor countries raised to 20 per cent the proportion of aid devoted to basic needs. At present, less than 10 per cent of the total Dollars 40bn provided as bilateral aid every year is targeted in this way. 'The problem today is not that overcoming the worst aspects of world poverty is too vast or too expensive a task: it is that it has not been seriously tried,' the report says. It says that a combination of new technologies, falling costs, and community-based strategies, is making it possible today to tackle aspects of poverty that historically have been the most stubborn - such as nutrition, clean water and basic education. For example, providing clean water in Africa today costs about Dollars 20 per person per year, half the cost of just six years ago. Unicef calls for a worldwide popular movement because of concern that the threat to children is a 'silent emergency' that passes unnoticed alongside more dramatic crises such as those in Somalia or Yugoslavia: 'No famine, no flood, no earthquake, no war, has ever claimed the lives of 250,000 children in a single week,' said Mr Grant: 'Yet malnutrition and diseases claim that number of child victims every week.' The report points out that 60 per cent of the 13m child deaths every year are caused by three diseases - pneumonia, diarrhoea and measles - all of which can be treated at low cost. Treatment for vitamin A deficiency, which can cause blindness and early death, can be controlled at a cost of about 10 cents per child per year, while iodine deficiency, which causes mental retardation, could be eliminated at a total cost of Dollars 100m. It is nevertheless encouraged by shifts away from military government, singling out Ethiopia, where military spending fell last year from 60 per cent to 30 per cent of the total spending, with health and education spending rising from 12 per cent to 20 per cent. A final critical concern is the 'financial famine' facing developing countries because of high levels of debt, low inward investment, and limited access to export markets. Developing country debt now totals Dollars 1,300bn, the report says, with capital and interest charges of Dollars 143bn falling due each year - three times the total of aid received from all sources.

Nevertheless, there are indications this issue could be  downgraded in the next hemispheric summit convened by U.S.  President William Clinton, which, according to him, must review  inter-American relations in the post-Cold War era.    Despite the fact that the summit is filled with injustice  from the start because of the deliberate exclusion of Cuba, U.S.  Vice President Albert Gore, during his quick tour of Bolivia,  Argentina, and Brazil, took time to hold an equally quick  meeting with several of the likely participants at the  hemispheric summit to issue propaganda about the forum.    Most likely, poverty will be one topic discussed at the  summit. What cannot be certain, however, is whether participants  will find the formula to eradicate this distressing problem  because most of the region's presidents are unrelentingly  applying neoliberal economic programs imposed on them by  international banks, which have been a main creator of poverty,  deprivation, and violence.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has said  poverty represents a new scourge within society, because it  poses security threats that cannot be fought with armies. He  stressed poverty is connected with hunger, terrorism, drug  trafficking, violence, and deprivation.    Aside from other personalities who have called attention to  poverty, such as the current OAS Secretary General Joao Baena  Soares, everyone is fully aware that there is a close  relationship between poverty and social violence. Nevertheless,  no one seems ready to tackle the problem.    Meanwhile, there are many bright individuals in Latin  America  who have not only realized that poverty is a national security  risk but who have called attention to the need for the region to  set up a new economic, political, and cultural integration  system as the only means of salvation in the face of an  increasingly competitive and isolationist world. Gradually,  strong integration programs, such as Mercosur [Common Market of  the South], the Andean Pact, and other treaties involving Latin  American and Caribbean nations, are being implemented. These  pacts are aimed at devising strategies to offset the ominous  effects of structural adjustment programs.    When the connection between poverty and violence is  discussed, the danger this poses to the stability of democratic  governments is also mentioned. This is particularly true when  one understands that 50 percent of the 200 million youngsters  under the age of 18 in Latin America are excluded from adequate  social, economic, and cultural benefits. In turn, this  undermines social equality and justice, which form the  groundwork of democracy. Therefore, the only way to avoid  allowing poverty to cause social catastrophe in Latin America is  by expediting integration, cooperation, and solidarity among our  peoples. The results may not be immediate, but in time they  will resolve the problems faced by the majority.     "

She made these remarks in an interview here this afternoon  with a group of Chinese journalists while talking about her  impressions from her study tour of China.    Mongella said that as with the three previous world women's  meetings, ""the main focus of the fourth conference has been on  the advancement of women in the areas of equality, development,  and peace.""    She noted that the Third World Women's Conference in 1985  adopted the Nairobi forward-looking strategies for the  advancement of women to the year 2000, covering almost all  problems in society.    The fourth conference, to be held here next year in Beijing,  will focus on limited critical issues such as the the impact of  growing poverty on women, equal chances for women's education,  women and problems related to their health, violence against  women, the effects of armed conflict and other conflicts on  women, and equal women's participation in the definition of  economic structures, policies and productive forces.    She told the journalists that in making preparations for the  conference, each member state ""should write a report"" on its  achievements and obstacles in implementing the nairobi  strategies and suggesting actions as well.    She said she also expects the member states to conduct a  wide  discussion of these concerned areas among men and women and in  government and non-government circles.    Mongella announced five regional conferences to be held in  the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, West Asia, Europe and  Africa in preparation for the fourth conference.    She expressed the hope that Chinese journalists will do more  promotion of the conference to work for its smooth staging and  to inform the 1.2 billion Chinese people about it.    It is imperative for Chinese journalists to popularize  Chinese women's achievements so that more people in the world  will understand China and Chinese women, she said.    This is also one of the major aims of the fourth world  conference, she added.    Mongella said she was ""very impressed"" by the women,  particularly the strength of women in China, adding that she  believed that very few people in the world know the truth about  women in China.    But, she said, when they come to recognize how much the  women  of China have achieved, especially in their work and managing  capabilities and rights for equal work, they will feel surprised.

The report is a blow to successive Bolivian governments, which since 1985 have embraced painful economic restructuring on the premise that benefits would eventually trickle down. The report says rural poverty has grown since 1965, when only 85 per cent lived below the poverty line. At the same time, Bolivia's rural population increased by 1.4m, to 3.4m, or more than half of the total population. The report blamed the increase in poverty on population growth unmatched by increases in agricultural productivity. 'There have been some attempts at redistribution of land. However, the majority of Bolivian farmers still work very small plots . . . without direct investment from the state,' said Mr Mohiuddin Alamgir, a co-author of the report. Mr Alamgir believes the situation will worsen unless there is direct policy intervention from government.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT943-1109 ,"FT943-1109 _AN-EIZD8AD4FT 940926   FT  26 SEP 94 / Leading Article: World Bank Group at bay   In the financial year ending June 1994, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the commercial lending arm of the World Bank Group, made net disbursements to developing countries of minus USDollars 731m. Such figures will be meat and drink to its critics. So too will the fact that administrative expenses have risen 60 per cent over the past six years, while gross disbursements have stagnated. Inevitably, the Bank is finding it difficult to convince the public that it knows what it is doing and is doing it efficiently and effectively. What makes the task particularly difficult is the changed international climate. Historically, the Bank had two groups of supporters in industrial countries: cold-warriors and do-gooders. The first group has now disappeared, while those who claim to have the interests of developing countries at heart now condemn the Bank for its stinginess, its heavy-handedness, its encouragement of environmental despoliation and its neglect of the cause of the poor. For all its might, the Bank lacks friends and, lacking friends, is politically vulnerable. But it will achieve nothing by pretending to be what it is not. It is a large, international public organisation that must work with, and through, governments. Its brief is, in essence, to assist developing countries achieve rapid, poverty-alleviating growth. Again, there is no huge mystery about how this is to be achieved. East Asian developing countries have shown the way. The trick - difficult in most places and hitherto impossible in some, notably in Africa - is to help others follow the same path. Economic returns The Bank must confront its critics. If it is to be blamed for its failures, it must point to such successes as East Asian development and the green revolution. It must also reject the notion that its brief is to transfer resources, something that could be done better by a check-writing machine. The wasteful use of oil revenues by so many oil-exporting developing countries demonstrates that the mere availability of money does not ensure economic development. The question, instead, is whether lending brings satisfactory economic returns to borrowers. True, the Bank has made big mistakes: over rural development lending, for example, the sustainability of the commercial bank lending of the 1970s and the durability of the 'energy crisis'. It is as important for the Bank to admit - and learn from - such mistakes as it is to stand up for itself. But the development record taken as a whole is not so bad. It can, and must, be defended. Less bureaucratic Yet if the Bank is to defend both itself and its core mission, it must also change. First, it must become leaner and much less bureaucratic. A start has been made on this. The recent proposal by Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank's president, to reduce the administrative budget by 6 per cent a year in real terms, will increase the pressure. Second, it must be more flexible. The one certainty in its environment is uncertainty. How many, just five years ago, foresaw the collapse of the former Soviet Union or the torrent of private capital pouring into middle-income developing countries? Third, it must be more aggressive with its critics, more aggressive with its clients, and also more aggressive, when appropriate, on behalf of its clients. The Bank cannot be all things to all people. If, for example, it believes there ought to be more generous official debt-relief for Africa, it should say so, loudly and clearly. There is much debate inside and outside the Bank about what sort of future it might have. Some believe the prospect is one of genteel decline, as its activities are progressively limited to Africa and South Asia. Others believe it could become an integrator of ideas and money world-wide, even in countries that do not need its direct financial assistance. Such choices do not yet have to be made. The challenges of eliminating extreme poverty and helping to integrate most of humanity within the global market economy remain huge. Notwithstanding its faults, the Bank represents a unique - and irreplaceable - repository of experience, skill and financial resources, dedicated to these tasks. Those assets must be used effectively. Their appropriate use must also be vigorously defended. These are the twin challenges confronting Mr Preston.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT942-8274 ,"FT942-8274 _AN-EEVAPAAQFT 940521   FT  21 MAY 94 / De Klerk's plea to win back 'lost generation': In an FT interview South Africa's deputy president backs the ANC's social aims, but warns over funding   Mr F W de Klerk, South Africa's joint deputy president yesterday forecast there would be a coalition administration after the government of national unity ended its five-year term, and urged the west to help South Africa play a constructive role in Africa. In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial Times, Mr de Klerk stressed the importance of economic growth to meet the needs of what he called 'a lost generation' of South Africans. But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to undermine the status of the Afrikaans language, saying it would drive many of his National Party supporters into the arms of the far right. A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of strain after a gruelling election campaign made clear that he looked forward to contesting the presidency in the next election. The National Party, he said, had won support from about 1m black voters in addition to over 3m votes from whites, coloureds and Indians. He was determined to help make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela work, he said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a share of success when contesting the next election. The party accepted the need to tackle housing backlogs and improve health and educational facilities for black South Africa - any difference with the ANC was 'not about the needs of the people, but how you fund the programme.' This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly through export promotion and encouraging foreign investment. He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development Programme drawn up by the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a single party, but of the government of national unity. 'But we must be assured that we will not give way on the need for fiscal discipline', he said. How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for the coalition government and the need for a watchdog opposition role? 'I am on a learning curve on this,' replied Mr de Klerk. But from discussions with leaders of coalition governments in Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two options. 'You can either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you can do your homework initially . . . and agree in detail what joint policy will be, and then test everything that happens against this (agreement)' - and this was the approach he had adopted. He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over the composition of the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister as one of the critical portfolios, in addition to agriculture, constitutional affairs, as well as his own role as executive vice president. Asked whether the government of national unity could become 'more or less permanent', Mr de Klerk replied: 'Not necessarily in this form.' 'Power sharing', he went on, 'should be a feature of the final constitution (to be drawn up by the country's National Assembly)' arguing, as he has done frequently in the past, that a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote should not get 100 per cent of the power. But he stressed that 'there are other ways of achieving it than though an enforced coalition. One would be to give to the regions more powers, though not necessarily more functions,' he said. 'For certain types of important decisions the president might not be able to take them on his own, he must call in the premiers of the nine provinces'. Alternatively, Mr de Klerk suggested, 'the senate could more effectively represent minority interests, to control the power of the party with the majority.' But he underlined the fact that 'it is not about vetoes - it is about effectively preventing the misuse of power to the detriment of language, religion, certain black minority groups'. 'I don't think we should have enforced coalitions,' Mr de Klerk went on, 'but when (the current system) falls away, we need to broaden the package of how to share power in other ways, through local government for example.' 'We have got to balance the situation between the fears of minorities and the democratic need to have real power which comes with being a majority (party).' 'An enforced coalition', he continued, 'will not wash, it won't work either. But I predict we are going to have coalitions any way.' Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de Klerk urged the international community 'not to remove us from their agenda. They need us, they need to address the problems of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play  -but only if we are successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa) to the full.' 'We need sustained dynamic economic growth,' said Mr de Klerk. 'We will be focusing on exports and developing the new markets that have become available to us, we have to get our productivity up, and develop the potential of tourism, with lots of jobs.' Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however, when he responded to questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was 'very dangerous' he warned, to undermine the language, pointing as an example to the dropping of announcements in Afrikaans on board South African Airways. 'It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the force that they are today . . . if you want me to lose their support, rub them up the wrong way about the language. You will drive back into the arms of the far right.' Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last minute decision of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, to take part in the election. 'Realism took over,' he said. 'If Chief Buthelezi didn't come aboard we might have faced a very very serious security situation'. All parties, including Chief Buthelezi, realised this. Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press that he had struck a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation, giving extra land to the former Kwazulu homeland within Natal. 'At no time was I involved in any discussion on that issue that was election related' Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk said it was 'at tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential' but it 'can be managed in an orderly way.' The government has 'already identified vast tracts of land' which could be made available to people dispossessed during the apartheid era. But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South Africa could play a major role in Rwanda. First the country's security forces had successfully to conclude the integration of regular units and members of the ANC armed wing. South Africa also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he said, notably the war in Angola. Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel Laureate lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a large middle class placed South Africa 'qualitatively and quantitively in quite a different league from any other African society,' he told the audience. 'We will be able to break the cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that many of our African neighbours share our success.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

In the Reality of Aid report earlier this year, NGOs working with the world's poorest communities noted the World Bank estimate that 40 per cent of world aid was diverted from poverty reduction to middle and high-income countries 'largely for political purposes'. The Overseas Development Administration has recently taken a number of important steps to increase its focus on poverty. The forthcoming European Community council of development ministers will consider a proposal to increase the poverty focus of EC aid, initiated during the British presidency. The record shows that, when the ODA is able to make poverty the priority, British aid can be very effective in areas such as humanitarian relief. The strong and consistent support of the public for UK aid targeted on poverty reduction was echoed in a June 1983 Actionaid/Gallup Survey, which found 87 per cent of MPs wanted more attention to be given in this category of spending to aid for basic needs. The National Audit Office report shows that the diversion of British aid for foreign policy purposes serves neither the interests of the poorest nor the taxpayer, nor indeed Britain's long-term commercial and political security. The government should end competition between the developmental, political and commercial interests in aid by stating explicitly (in line with the World Bank) that sustainable poverty reduction must be the primary determinant of British aid spending and the benchmark against which its success is evaluated.

""We want  to believe that the marchers are just the beginning of an even  larger Zulu community"" which ""will use its might to show the  world that it is not going to be a sacrificial lamb to save  Buthelezi's selfish political ambition.""

""While on one level it  demonstrates the decree to which the police have become  politicised, at another it reflects the extent to which they  refuse to be held accountable for their actions."" Weakness in  the presidency and Law and Order Ministry derive from ""the fact  that over the years of NP [National Party] rule"" the police  ""developed into an authority into itself, bent on protecting  party political interests rather than society"" and becasue  ""South Africa has no history of ministerial accountability.""  ""Accountability must be forced on De Klerk, Kriel and their  generals by the masses who have had to bear the pain of the  government's distain for black human life.""    BEELD    Zulu King Raising Temperatures in Natal -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans of 22 March points out in a page 14  editorial: ""King Goodwill Zwelithini has driven the political  pressure in Natal higher with his announcement on Friday  regarding the restoration of the Zulu kingdom -- not because he  is fighting for the maintenance of the Zulu kingdom, but because  he is holding out to his subjects the threat of protest against  the election as a means of achieving his goal. There must be  millions of Zulus in Natal who pledge loyalty to their king, but  who want to vote and want the election to take place. Where  will his call leave them? King Goodwill and his great advisor,  Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, have the fullest right to fight for  the preservation of the Zulu culture and traditions. But they  have no right to deny other Natalians and Zulu subjects and the  rest of South Africa the right to exercise their democratic  right. The king, Mr. Buthelezi, and the rest of South Africa who  are watching kwaZulu-Natal with bated breath, must know that  the ANC will not accept the king's call for an election boycott  lying down. Indeed, they are already making plans for mass  action and other disruptive activities."" ""In kwaZulu-Natal the  result will be much bloodier and messier that in Bophuthatswana,  but the outcome will be the same,"" and ""the party to benefit  most will be the ANC.""    Vote for All Prisoners A Mistake -- ""The unrest in prisons  in which prisoners demonstrated in support of participation in  the election by all criminals behind bars can be seen as the  fruits of an unfortunate compromise,"" says an editorial on page  8 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 23 March. ""What  those who support the vote for criminals forget is that  imprisonment is imposed with the aim of totally removing the  offender from society for a period. During that time his rights  as a member of society are withdrawn; it includes the right to  participate in political activities. The argument being raised  by the ANC, that it is unjust to prevent some prisoners from  exercising their most basic right -- the vote -- does not hold  water. The right to vote is not the most basic right; that  right is the right to life, and it is that right which the  majority of the criminals sentenced to death denied to others.""  ""The granting of the vote to all imprisoned criminals merely  compounds what is already an awful mistake.""    Caution Needed Over Police Generals -- A second editorial on  the same page notes: ""We would Nike to believe that State  President F.W. de Klerk, when he ordered three of the country's  top generals to take compulsory leave following the release of  the Goldstone report, did not act without very good reason. The  allegations against the generals are very serious, but it is  precisely for that reason that we have an uneasy feeling about  the course of events during the investigation by Justice  Goldstone."" ""A very important principle in law is that every  person must be given the opportunity to fully state his side of  the case, which was apparently not done here. In addition the  generals were not provided with legal assistance and they were  not given the opportunity to cross-examine the people who  presented evidence against them. So we ask: go steady with wild  accusations and allegations. Hold a full investigation in which  the law is properly applied, before crucifying people.""    Culture of Lawlessness Being Created -- A third editorial  points out: ""One of the most deplorable statements heard in the  election campaign comes from Mr. George Biya, president of the  Azanian Youth Organziation. Mr. Biya praised the looters who  stole goods during the uprising in Bophuthatswana. His  justification for this is: `No white man arrived from Europe  with a refrigerator or a bed. On the contrary, our people only  took what was theirs, and no apology is made.' Should one wish  to sink to the same level as Mr. Biya, one could point out that  it is precisely because of this kind of mentality by too many  too often in Africa that the continent finds itself in the state  it is."" ""Black entrepreneurs and the general public are daily  victims of looting in its various forms, encouraged by people  like Mr. Biya who are helping to create a culture of  lawlessness. Real leaders will have to take note that South  Africans of all colors are sick and tired of any form of  hooliganism.""     "
0,FT933-5764 ,"FT933-5764 _AN-DIAB3AGGFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (8): Devaluation is overdue - CFA      By EDWARD BALLS   IN PUBLIC, World Bank officials bite their lips at the mention of the CFA franc zone, and the severe economic difficulties of its 13 west and central African member states, In private, they tear out their hair. Fixing their currencies to the French franc and to each other was once a guarantee of low inflation and economic stability for the members - Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. Now this monetary union is transmitting a recession across the region. Since 1985, the combination of declining commodity prices, lax domestic fiscal and monetary policies and the appreciation of the French franc against the US dollar mean that the CFA group have suffered a huge real exchange rate appreciation of more than 30 per cent as the chart shows. The result was an immediate and sharp loss of competitiveness for exporters from the CFA zone. By 1991, average wages in Senegal, for example, had risen as a proportion of average income to three times the level in Ghana and six times that of Indonesia. The CFA franc is now about 30 per cent overvalued. This loss of competitiveness delivered a downward deflationary spiral in the CFA zone, fed by deflationary macroeconomic policies as countries tried to control the fiscal deficits that this shock opened up. Real output per head in the CFA countries had risen by around 2 per cent in the first half of the 1980s. It fell by an average 5 per cent a year between 1986 and 1991. Neither the French government nor the CFA members are willing to recognise either that the French franc-CFA parity, unbroken since 1948, is at the heart of the crisis or that a substantial CFA devaluation may now be the only way to preserve the zone. Instead, the CFA countries have tried to correct their severe external and fiscal imbalances through fiscal austerity and attempted wage restraint without recourse to devaluation. Most of the group have tried to adopt World Bank-style adjustment programmes in the late 1980s. The results have been disastrous. Battling against an uncompetitive exchange rate, growing capital flight, a powerful and a restive civil service, most of the CFA countries have been unable to meet the demanding macroeconomic and structural targets that internal adjustment demands. The poor have suffered at the expense of the urban elite able, with the help of aid flows, to preserve their purchasing power. In Niger and Chad, the civil service wage bill exceeds total tax revenue. The result is what bank officials call a 'silent crisis'. Inflation is low, there are goods in the shops and civil servants are still being paid. But poverty is rising, the infrastructure decaying: without devaluation combined with tight control on civil service salaries, the crisis will deepen.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      Secretary of State James A. Baker III, his consciousness sharpened by a quick  tour of South Africa's largest black township, said Friday that he is  distressed by what he saw and is even more determined to push for an end to  apartheid.    After four days of intense diplomacy in the affluent, swimming-pool-studded  neighborhoods of South Africa and neighboring Namibia, the trip through Soweto  marked Baker's first look at the living conditions of southern Africa's  majority black population.    Although Baker had deplored the apartheid system of racial segregation at every  opportunity, he had not had a chance to look closely at its victims.    ""It's quite distressing,"" Baker said. ""I think it is necessary for the system  to be abolished.""    Even in Soweto, the sprawling black township of 2.5 million outside  Johannesburg, Baker spent most of his time with the relatively well-to-do.    He breakfasted with anti-apartheid community leaders at a U.S. Information  Service library, conferred for about an hour with African National Congress  official Walter Sisulu at Sisulu's modest stuccoed house, watched preschool  children bounce happily on a trampoline and walked through an education center  financed by the South African business community.    It was only on a brief drive through the Mshenguville squatters camp that Baker  confronted the true poverty of tin-and-tar-paper shacks without electricity,  running water or other facilities.    Baker did not stop, viewing through the windows of his limousine the squalor of  life just 25 miles from the high-rise buildings of Johannesburg and the gold  mines that help support the South African economy. A motorcade of security  personnel and reporters followed in his wake.    Sisulu is a longtime associate of black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela,  and, like Mandela, has spent most of his adult life in South African prisons.  Sisulu urged the United States to withhold its support for South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk until the white-minority-led government keeps  its promise to end apartheid.    ""I think that Mr. De Klerk is making an effort,"" Sisulu said. ""We have  appreciated the start he has made. We want to urge Mr. De Klerk to be a bit  speedier about things. The very first stage has not been completed.""    Sisulu, recently released after 25 years in prison, talked to reporters after  showing Baker around the tidy kindergarten that is attended by his  grandchildren. The school is across the street from Sisulu's house.    ""I told the secretary that we are very grateful to the people of America for  the support they have given us over the years,"" Sisulu said. ""We will expect  more support as days go by.""    State Department officials arranged the visit to Soweto to balance Baker's  talks Thursday in Cape Town with De Klerk and other top officials of the  government, which marked the end of Washington's diplomatic isolation of South  Africa.    The visit was planned as a high-visibility ""photo opportunity,"" exploited both  by the State Department and the African National Congress.    While Baker was meeting with Sisulu and his wife, Albertina, children at the  school entertained television crews by shaking their fists and chanting ""ANC,  ANC, ANC"" as soon as the cameras began to roll.    The visit gave Baker a chance to renew his acquaintance with Albertina Sisulu,  an anti-apartheid leader who became the first ANC representative to meet  President Bush when she visited Washington last year.    Despite De Klerk's liberalizing steps, Sisulu told Baker that conditions for  blacks remain deplorable. Poor schools and inadequate housing, he said, amount  to ""dynamite for violence.""    Although De Klerk's government is scheduled to open unprecedented talks with  ANC leaders next month, Sisulu said true negotiations over the future of the  nation cannot begin until the government makes more fundamental changes than it  has carried out so far.      BACKGROUND    Soweto is synonymous with the struggle of South Africa's black majority against  apartheid. The sprawling township outside Johannesburg was the scene of a  famous, tragic protest by black schoolchildren. On June 16, 1976, thousands of  them marched against a decree requiring some classes to be taught in Afrikaans,  the language of the Dutch white minority. When pelted with stones, police  opened fire, felling Hector Peterson, 13. Riots ensued in what became known as  the Soweto uprising. Violence spread, and in the next eight months, hundreds  died in anti-apartheid protests.      Photo, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and ANC official Walter Sisulu at  Soweto news conference.

Mandela,  and, like Mandela, has spent most of his adult life in South African prisons.  Sisulu urged the United States to withhold its support for South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk until the white-minority-led government keeps  its promise to end apartheid.    ""I think that Mr. De Klerk is making an effort,"" Sisulu said. ""We have  appreciated the start he has made. We want to urge Mr. De Klerk to be a bit  speedier about things. The very first stage has not been completed.""    Sisulu, recently released after 25 years in prison, talked to reporters after  showing Baker around the tidy kindergarten that is attended by his  grandchildren. The school is across the street from Sisulu's house.    ""I told the secretary that we are very grateful to the people of America for  the support they have given us over the years,"" Sisulu said. ""We will expect  more support as days go by.""    State Department officials arranged the visit to Soweto to balance Baker's  talks Thursday in Cape Town with De Klerk and other top officials of the  government, which marked the end of Washington's diplomatic isolation of South  Africa.    The visit was planned as a high-visibility ""photo opportunity,"" exploited both  by the State Department and the African National Congress.    While Baker was meeting with Sisulu and his wife, Albertina, children at the  school entertained television crews by shaking their fists and chanting ""ANC,  ANC, ANC"" as soon as the cameras began to roll.    The visit gave Baker a chance to renew his acquaintance with Albertina Sisulu,  an anti-apartheid leader who became the first ANC representative to meet  President Bush when she visited Washington last year.    Despite De Klerk's liberalizing steps, Sisulu told Baker that conditions for  blacks remain deplorable. Poor schools and inadequate housing, he said, amount  to ""dynamite for violence.""    Although De Klerk's government is scheduled to open unprecedented talks with  ANC leaders next month, Sisulu said true negotiations over the future of the  nation cannot begin until the government makes more fundamental changes than it  has carried out so far.      BACKGROUND    Soweto is synonymous with the struggle of South Africa's black majority against  apartheid. The sprawling township outside Johannesburg was the scene of a  famous, tragic protest by black schoolchildren. On June 16, 1976, thousands of  them marched against a decree requiring some classes to be taught in Afrikaans,  the language of the Dutch white minority. When pelted with stones, police  opened fire, felling Hector Peterson, 13. Riots ensued in what became known as  the Soweto uprising. Violence spread, and in the next eight months, hundreds  died in anti-apartheid protests.      Photo, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and ANC official Walter Sisulu at  Soweto news conference.

Those States that, as of enactment of MCCA, offered eligibility to pregnant women and infants with incomes at 100 percent of the poverty level (or at some   lower income threshold between 75 percent and 100 percent) were required to continue eligibility at this level. A State had to provide an income level that reflected at least the percentage of poverty specified in an amendment to its State plan to cover these groups (whether the amendment had been approved or not). Even if there was no percentage specified in the State plan, the maintenance of eligibility requirement also applied to percentages established under a State's authorizing legislation or provided for under the State's appropriations in order to provide Medicaid to these individuals before July 1, 1989. MCCA also provided that, effective July 1, 1990, mandatory eligibility was required for groups of pregnant women and infants under age one with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines. In addition to creating mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants, the MCCA eliminated the requirement in section 1902(1)(4) that States cover both pregnant women and infants in order to cover either group and to cover both groups in order to cover children. We have interpreted this MCCA amendment to allow States to cover optional groups of pregnant women and infants separately and with different income levels. Coverage of groups of pregnant women or infants, or both, with incomes above the mandatory percentages (75 percent, effective July 1, 1989, and 100 percent, effective July 1, 1990) but at or below 185 percent of the poverty level and children age 1 year to age 8 years with incomes at or below 100 percent of the poverty level remained optional under the MCCA provisions.     The MCCA also amended section 1902(e)(7) to provide continued coverage to all of the revised groups of children under section 1902(1) until the end of their inpatient stays. It also amended section 1903(f)(4) to exempt from the FFP income limits all of the redefined mandatory and optional groups in section 1902(1) and specifically made the use of less restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2) apply to several groups, including the mandatory groups of women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), and to all optional categorically needy groups, including the optional group of women, infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX).     The changes made by section 302 of MCCA applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 1989, with respect to eligibility on or after that date.

0,FT922-4436 ,"FT922-4436 _AN-CFEA9ADSFT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (5): Battle to end the economic civil war - Poverty will remain the most profound threat to a stable state      By PATTI WALDMEIR   POLITICS is the least of South Africa's problems. For whether constitutional negotiations take months or years, whether apartheid gives way to democracy or autocracy, poverty will remain the central worry for most South Africans, and the most profound threat to a stable state. 'The urgent need to raise living standards and improve the distribution of income and wealth in South Africa poses a major challenge to policy-makers over the medium term,' says a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report entitled Economic Policies for a New South Africa. 'Unless the rate of economic growth rises to a level well above that of the last decade, there is little prospect for reducing the current very high level of under-employment in the economy or for generating address social needs on a sustained basis.' The irony of the new South Africa is that democratisation is itself impeding growth: ending apartheid has meant unprecedented social turmoil, as the battle for power pits black political groups against one another, police against township residents, organised labour against the government. Mr Derek Keys, the new finance minister, describes the situation as 'economic civil war'. His aim is to promote a social compact between business, labour and the unions, to develop a 'national consensus to grow'. 'My real first priority is to find the areas of consensus,' he says, noting 'you can't make people invest here, with all the political disruption that's taking place. I think if people see effective co-operation between business and labour and the state . . . I think that will be the biggest single contribution we can make to investment.' His message could hardly be more different from that of his predecessor, Mr Barend du Plessis, who resigned as finance minister six weeks ago after suffering a nervous collapse. Mr du Plessis clashed repeatedly with the largest union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), over issues such as the introduction of value-added tax, and gained a reputation for arrogance and intransigence which exacerbated economic hostilities. Cosatu had long demanded the formation of an economic negotiating forum, involving business, labour and the state, to debate the economic future. Within weeks of taking up his new post (Mr Keys became minister of trade and industry and economic co-ordination in January, adding finance to his portfolio in May), the new minister had met representatives of business and labour to plan the forum. The aim will be to find 'a national consensus to hold off on consumption expenditure and apply more to investment,' says Mr Keys. In a country where class and economic power divide society as sharply as race and ethnicity, this could prove a tall order. For South Africa's blacks are scarcely in the mood to be told to defer gratification now in the interest of sustainable long-term growth: they expect at least some minimum improvements in living standards - clean water taps in the squatter camps, decent shelter, better education - and the African National Congress (ANC) would ignore these demands at its peril. But the ANC knows that the key to future prosperity will be to promote investment in new productive capacity to stimulate growth and job creation. Certainly, the record of growth over the past decade could hardly be more dismal. Real gross domestic product per capita has fallen by 1.1 per cent annually for a decade, leaving an estimated 5.5m people, or 40 per cent of the potential labour force, unemployed. For the past three years - when growth could have done so much to smooth the path to political reform - the economy has been in recession, and severe drought has made it likely that growth this year will be negative as well. The deteriorating fortunes of the gold industry have also impeded growth. In the 1991/92 fiscal year gold contributed only one per cent of state revenues compared with 9.6 per cent in 1982/83. The imposition of international financial sanctions severely curtailed what growth there would otherwise have been. To service the country's debt rescheduling agreement with foreign banks, growth had to be choked off at a very low level to avoid a surge of imports, which threatened the balance of payments. That constraint should soon be removed: international creditors have recently proved much more willing to roll over maturing debts, and some new lending should be available from commercial banks (though this will depend on political stability); from the World Bank (which will make development funds available once a multiracial interim government is installed); and from the International Monetary Fund (once the US lifts its political veto over such funding). But Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank), believes an economic structural adjustment programme is needed first to create an environment conducive to growth. 'South Africa has an economy where you get equilibrium only at a low level of growth. The moment you push it higher, you get inflation, skills shortages, etc . . . We need to have higher growth without disequilibrium. That requires action on monetary policy, fiscal policy, trade policy . . . ' He argues that the Reserve Bank has succeeded in stabilising the financial situation over the past year, with money supply growth now limited to under 10 per cent per annum (compared with 27 per cent in the late 1980s), bank credit extension rising at a rate well below inflation, the exchange rate stabilised and gold and foreign exchange reserves substantially strengthened, at R9.5bn, enough to cover two months' imports. Inflation, too, is improving, though a large drop in producer prices has yet to feed through into consumer prices, which continue to rise at 15 per cent annually. But he says more remains to be done in terms of macro-economic restructuring. On this issue, Finance Minister Keys has so far said little. He believes that the economy is basically sound, agreeing with Mr Michael O'Dowd, a director of Anglo American Corp, who wrote recently: 'So far from being a 'basket case', the performance of the South African economy in conditions of great adversity has, in recent years, been most impressive.' If Mr Keys plans drastic restructuring to place the economy on a higher growth path, he is not letting on. He accepts the case for lower tariffs, but plans no dramatic cuts, arguing - against received wisdom among local economists - that South Africa is not a high tariff economy. He shrugs off the problem of inefficiency and corruption in the civil service, highlighted recently when a commission of inquiry found that the government department which administered the black homelands had wasted or embezzled millions, perhaps billions of rands. And he defends as necessary a budget deficit which will probably exceed 5 per cent of GDP. 'The economy is as strong as a horse,' he argues, 'but it's got too many jockeys at the moment.' With a characteristically colourful turn of phrase, he elaborates: 'Government is sitting facing forwards, hoping the horse will start off moving. The ANC is on it facing backwards, trying to get the horse to move backwards. Cosatu is sitting on sideways, hoping to claim the credit whether it goes forward or backwards. The private sector is standing holding the reins . . . bemused by what is happening on top of the horse. 'I see my job as persuading the private sector to start . . . leading the horse, regardless of what the jockeys think they are doing,' he concludes. He agrees with the IMF, that if economic growth is to be raised to 3.5 per cent a year (the minimum rate required to reduce unemployment) the ratio of investment to GDP will have to rise to 27 per cent from 19 per cent now. But under the IMF's scenario, that would mean a sharply reduced government budget deficit and average real wage growth of under 1 per cent a year. Both those goals are probably unattainable in the face of demands for increased social spending and for redistribution of corporate wealth. But that, in the end, is South Africa's predicament: democracy cannot survive without growth; but the road to democracy is littered with so many impediments to growth - political instability, demands for social spending which boost inflation, labour militancy - that the democratic goal may never be achieved. It could hardly be a more daunting prospect.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE AND CAPITAL FLOWS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade balance             2.7   10.0   10.8    9.0    6.0    6.0    6.2 Current accouunt         -2.4    4.1    4.3    3.6    1.4    1.3    2.2 Net capital inflow        1.2   -6.8   -3.6   -1.7   -3.1   -1.9   -1.1 Change in net reserves   -1.3   -2.6    0.7    1.9   -1.8   -0.5    1.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page III  "
0,FT933-16046 ,"FT933-16046 _AN-DGFC3ADTFT 930706   FT  06 JUL 93 / Success story's next chapter: Ghana is an African role model, but still relies on foreign aid      By EDWARD BALLS and LESLIE CRAWFORD   For a man responsible for black Africa's test case economy, Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's veteran finance minister, appears remarkably relaxed. With some justification. Ghana's 10-year structural adjustment programme has attracted Dollars 5bn in foreign aid, and the well has not run dry. Last week Dr Botchwey was back in Accra, two days after asking a Paris meeting of donors for additional funds and getting half a billion dollars more than he had asked for - a further Dollars 2.1bn over the next two years. Today, Mr Botchwey will attend a conference in London, sponsored by the Confederation of British Industry. He will try to woo foreign investors by publicising Ghana's streamlined investment code, which removes many curbs on multinational investment. Times have changed. Ghana, the first British colony to achieve independence in 1957, became synonymous with African state socialism and economic mismanagement in the 1960s and 1970s. Now it has embraced the market. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, starved of African success stories, are quick to present Ghana as a role model. Ten years of liberalisation, deregulation and devaluation, cushioned by annual aid flows amounting to 8 per of gross domestic product, have enabled the government to produce an average growth rate in income per head of 2 per cent a year since Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, then Ghana's military ruler, agreed to take the IMF medicine in 1983. Compared with the rest of Africa, this is impressive. Since the 'economic recovery programme' began, Ghanaian gross domestic product has grown by an average 4.9 per cent a year, more than twice the sub-Saharan average. It follows a decade in which real income per head in Ghana fell by 30 per cent. Yet, after 10 years of adjustment, Ghana remains desperately poor. Its average income per head was only Dollars 400 last year. The World Bank estimates that, at current annual growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population), it would take more than 20 years for the average poor Ghanaian to reach the current poverty threshold, defined as two-thirds of today's average consumption per head. A recent World Bank strategy document, 'Ghana 2000 and beyond - setting the stage for accelerated growth and poverty reduction', estimates that Ghana needs to raise its growth rate to 8 per cent a year to free the average poor person from poverty in 10 years. The government hopes that a leaner, export-led manufacturing sector will enable it to reach that rate by 2000. But Ghana's task is immense, as the World Bank report makes clear. The domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow commodity base - primarily cocoa and gold - for export earnings while manufacturing exports are tiny. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990, compared with 32 per cent in rapidly growing Thailand  - half the level at which Thailand started on the growth path back in 1965. Asia's newly industrialised countries, as well as Thailand and Malaysia, had also achieved universal primary education before they began to industrialise in the early 1960s. In Ghana, 20 per cent of young people are not registered at primary school. The east Asian economies provide a benchmark against which Ghana can measure the task ahead. East Asia's experience also suggests lessons for the Ghanaian government's strategy in the second phase of development. The focus of Ghana's policy over the past decade has been on reducing the role of government and, in some areas such as the privatisation of state industry, this focus continues. But the government also appears to be pursuing a form of intervention which goes beyond the traditional 'enabling' role for government: providing information and investing in education, health and infrastructure. The government now talks of 'a new agenda of activism' that will offer special incentives to investors. Mr Botchwey has asked the private sector to draft guidelines for the selective protection of infant domestic industries. 'Picking winners is a hazardous thing,' he concedes. 'The protection measures will have to be time-bound and the criteria must be clear and transparent, to avoid charges of political favouritism.' At the same time, following the removal of credit ceilings, the Bank of Ghana, the central bank, is using its indirect influence in the foreign exchange market to support the government's growth strategy. By keeping foreign exchange in short supply, the central bank has encouraged the commercial banks to direct their supply of foreign exchange towards export-orientated customers who might earn and return foreign exchange in the future. In the words of one banker in Accra: 'The banks now operate the Bank of Ghana's exchange control regime on its behalf.' A third focus of the government's new activism is foreign investment. The government plans to lure foreign companies with tax holidays and other fiscal incentives, particularly multinationals which have encountered quota problems in east Asia. 'A number of multinationals who quit in the 1970s are coming back,' says Mr Botchwey. 'They are looking at the comparative labour costs and are interested in producing on a large scale for export.' Sunquist, the tuna fish company, plans to invest Dollars 10m because it is encountering quota ceilings on exports from Thailand. So far, progress has been slow. Ghana's private sector success stories in export diversification are few, while additional substantial foreign investments have yet to materialise. One reason is that investors have been waiting to see how Ghana's transition to democracy will develop after more than a decade of military rule. The government is engaged in a painful battle to offset the fiscal and inflationary problems incurred in the run-up to November's election which saw Jerry Rawlings declared civilian president. Mr Botchwey has no illusions about achieving economic independence soon. Ghana's persistent current account deficit is expected to be 6 per cent of GDP this year. 'If you could assure me of an improvement in our terms of trade, and a greater measure of debt forgiveness, then Ghana could wean itself off aid in four to five years,' he says. Nowhere in Africa are structural reforms so far advanced, and the government's commitment so deeply rooted. But for Ghana to become Africa's success story, it must take the qualitative leap into accelerated, export-led growth. For now, it remains dependent on the patience of the international donor community.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0," FR940323-1-00009   FR940323-1-00005        In recent years, a number of statutes have been enacted that established new eligibility groups, revised existing eligibility groups, or expanded services to certain low-income individuals. On October 21, 1986, Congress passed provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99509, that amended the Social Security Act to expand the Medicaid eligibility groups. States were given the option of providing Medicaid to certain needy individuals who had incomes up to a certain specified percentage of Federal poverty income guidelines and who previously were not eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy. These individuals included pregnant women, infants, and children (section 9401) and aged and disabled individuals (section 9402). In addition, section 9407 allowed States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period on the basis of income eligibility only.    OBRA '86 also clarified Medicaid eligibility of homeless individuals who are residents of a State, regardless of whether or not they maintain a home at a fixed address or maintain it permanently (section 9405). In addition, section 11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act (title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law 99570), enacted on October 27, 1986, requires that a State Medicaid plan provide for a method of making medical services eligibility cards available to Medicaid-eligible individuals who do not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address.    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100203, enacted on December 22, 1987, made further changes in the Social Security Act to expand the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children and the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children under a certain age. OBRA '87 also allowed a State to impose a monthly premium on optional categorically needy pregnant women and infants with incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. In addition, section 4105 of OBRA '87 clarified Medicaid coverage of clinic services furnished outside of clinic facilities to homeless individuals.    The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100360, enacted on July 1, 1988, also further amended provisions relating to the eligibility groups of individuals with incomes related to the Federal poverty income level. MCCA made some of the low-income pregnant women and infants mandatory Medicaid eligibility groups (those at or below 75 percent of the poverty level and then, a year later, 100 percent of the poverty level) and amended the eligibility criteria for others.    The Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), Public Law 100485, enacted on October 13, 1988, made several technical corrections to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. These corrections related to the description of the eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children.    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101239, enacted on December 19, 1989, changed the mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants by increasing the income criteria to at or below 133 percent (instead of at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level; and added a new mandatory group of low-income children who are age one but have not attained age 6 who have incomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA '89 mandated a percentage greater than 133 percent of the Federal poverty level for the pregnant women and infants groups if the State had such a greater percentage in its State plan (whether approved or not) as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89, or established under State authorizing legislation or State appropriations as of December 19, 1989, when it covered these pregnant women or infants, or both, as optional categorically needy groups. Low-income children who are age 6 but have not attained age 7, or at State option, age 8 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level remained an optional categorically needy group. These provisions were effective on April 1, 1990.

On October 21, 1986, Congress passed provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99509, that amended the Social Security Act to expand the Medicaid eligibility groups. States were given the option of providing Medicaid to certain needy individuals who had incomes up to a certain specified percentage of Federal poverty income guidelines and who previously were not eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy. These individuals included pregnant women, infants, and children (section 9401) and aged and disabled individuals (section 9402). In addition, section 9407 allowed States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period on the basis of income eligibility only.    OBRA '86 also clarified Medicaid eligibility of homeless individuals who are residents of a State, regardless of whether or not they maintain a home at a fixed address or maintain it permanently (section 9405). In addition, section 11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act (title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law 99570), enacted on October 27, 1986, requires that a State Medicaid plan provide for a method of making medical services eligibility cards available to Medicaid-eligible individuals who do not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address.    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100203, enacted on December 22, 1987, made further changes in the Social Security Act to expand the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children and the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children under a certain age. OBRA '87 also allowed a State to impose a monthly premium on optional categorically needy pregnant women and infants with incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. In addition, section 4105 of OBRA '87 clarified Medicaid coverage of clinic services furnished outside of clinic facilities to homeless individuals.    The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100360, enacted on July 1, 1988, also further amended provisions relating to the eligibility groups of individuals with incomes related to the Federal poverty income level. MCCA made some of the low-income pregnant women and infants mandatory Medicaid eligibility groups (those at or below 75 percent of the poverty level and then, a year later, 100 percent of the poverty level) and amended the eligibility criteria for others.    The Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), Public Law 100485, enacted on October 13, 1988, made several technical corrections to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. These corrections related to the description of the eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children.    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101239, enacted on December 19, 1989, changed the mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants by increasing the income criteria to at or below 133 percent (instead of at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level; and added a new mandatory group of low-income children who are age one but have not attained age 6 who have incomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA '89 mandated a percentage greater than 133 percent of the Federal poverty level for the pregnant women and infants groups if the State had such a greater percentage in its State plan (whether approved or not) as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89, or established under State authorizing legislation or State appropriations as of December 19, 1989, when it covered these pregnant women or infants, or both, as optional categorically needy groups. Low-income children who are age 6 but have not attained age 7, or at State option, age 8 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level remained an optional categorically needy group. These provisions were effective on April 1, 1990.      "

The most recent debates on income distribution in the United States have  degenerated into a clash among statisticians and those who use those  statistics. Some experienced analysts conclude, from their inspection of the  data, that the distribution of income is becoming more unequal, and especially  that the upper income classes are gaining at the expense of people with lower  incomes.    Simultaneously, other professionals conclude that the degree of income equality  did not change significantly in the 1980s and that, when fringe benefits and  income-in-kind payments are properly taken into account, the poverty problem is  far less severe than it has been portrayed.    I take a ""plague on both your houses"" view. Whether the total tally of the poor  has been rising or falling, the hard fact is that there are a great many poor  people in the United States. The basic thrust of the debate should be shifted  to a far more useful set of questions: How do people fall into poverty? How can  they be helped to move out of poverty?    First of all, it is inaccurate for Americans to castigate themselves as a  heartless society. Over the past 25 years, federal spending for income support  to individuals multiplied over five times in constant dollars. Any way it is  measured, the per-capita outlay of public funds to fight poverty has been  expanding faster than inflation and real outlays also have grown faster than  the number of poor people.    The continuing problem is that, while these expensive efforts now represent a  far larger share of the nation's resources than was devoted when Franklin D.  Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the large outlays have  not produced the promised results.    There is virtually universal agreement in the United States that those who are  physically or mentally unable to support themselves should be helped by  society. Such assistance should be provided in adequate amounts and with a  minimum of hassle. Over the years, however, a profound broadening has occurred  in the qualification for such aid. Low or no income has become the only basis  necessary to qualify for the receipt of welfare. The earlier terms, ""handouts""  and ""charity,"" have been transformed into ""transfer payments"" and  ""entitlements.""    Many long-term welfare recipients are beset by deep-rooted personal and social  problems not quickly cured by money. There is a powerful connection between the  health of the family as an institution and the depths of the poverty problem.    A few examples will help. Nine out of 10 families on welfare are headed by  women. Men living alone have twice the unemployment rates of family men. Nearly  three-fourths of the children on welfare are on the rolls because neither of  their parents is willing to support them. Frequently, the father has left the  home or never took responsibility for the child in the first place.    Without judging the moral basis of these alternative lifestyles, it is apparent  that much of the cost of such actions is not borne by the individuals making  those decisions, but by the children and by society as a whole.    Focusing on a positive approach, a distinguished panel of both liberal and  conservative analysts issued a report, ""The New Consensus on Family and  Welfare."" The panel stated, ""An indispensable resource in the war against  poverty is a sense of personal responsibility."" The panel also noted that  climbing out of poverty is something the individual must do, albeit with some  help from society.    More often than not, all it takes for a person to leave the ranks of the poor  is three things: 1) completing high school, 2) getting and staying married  (even if not on the first try), and 3) staying employed, even if at modest pay  such as the statutory minimum wage. The three factors are closely interrelated.  The high school diploma helps in getting a job. The wages received enable the  person to get married and to begin raising a family. The obligation to support  a family encourages the person to stick with the job or to quickly find  another.    An examination of the available data is useful in destroying some widely held  myths. Poverty is primarily a children's, not a senior citizens', problem.  Three and a half million of the elderly are poor, while 13 million children  are. About three-fourths of the elderly own their homes. The average family  headed by someone 65 to 74 years of age holds more than twice the dollar assets  than the typical family headed by a person 35 to 44 years old. The older the  head of the family, the wealthier the family is likely to be -- through age 74.    Also, very few men, black or white, who are heads of households are even near  poverty -- if they just have a high school education. In 1986, less than 5% of  black males and less than 10% of black females who met these simple  requirements were in poverty. Of adult black males who were high school  graduates in 1986, 86% had family incomes more than twice the poverty level.    When a woman on welfare takes on a full-time job, the odds are overwhelming  that she is lifting herself out of poverty. Few women working steadily earn  only the minimum wage. The median annual earnings of full-time female workers  without a high school diploma are higher than the minimum wage. Raising a child  is often cited as a reason for unmarried women staying on welfare. The fact is  that most mothers are now working, including a slight majority of those with  children under six.    There is much that government can and should do to reduce poverty. That  includes conducting a sensible macroeconomic policy that yields a growing  economy, which in turn generates a rising supply of jobs. Strengthening the  educational system -- perhaps by opening up more competition -- would surely  help. And continuing to provide large sums of money to alleviate distress will  be necessary for the foreseeable future.    Nevertheless, the most important actions generating poverty are personal --  producing children out of wedlock, getting divorced, dropping out of school and  waiting for the dream job to come along before starting to work.    All in all, however, the message that arises from any detailed examination of  poverty in the United States is upbeat. The solution is within reach of most  people. Marriage and family prevent poverty. Schooling prevents poverty.  Working at almost any job prevents poverty. Individual actions -- rather than  more generous government expenditures -- are required to escape the poverty  trap.

The US Census Bureau reported yesterday that 35.7m people were living below the level it defines as poor - an income of Dollars 13,924 for a family of four, or Dollars 6,932 for someone living alone - compared with 33.6m in 1990. In addition, Census Bureau economists said that the wealthiest 20 per cent of families had incomes averaging 8.4 times the poverty level, compared with a ratio of 6.1 per cent 25 years ago. The new Census Bureau figures place 14.2 per cent of the population below the poverty line, up from 13.5 per cent in 1990 and 12.8 per cent in 1989, but lower than in 1982-1984, during the last US recession. Earlier this week, the Commerce Department announced that personal incomes last year failed to keep pace with inflation for the first time in nine years. Average personal pre-tax incomes rose by 2.4 per cent, to Dollars 19,092, compared with consumer price inflation of 4.2 per cent. Census Bureau statistics show that 40 per cent of adults defined as poor worked, and 9 per cent of them held full-time, year-round jobs. Nearly three-quarters received public assistance in some form, and 29 per cent had no medical insurance. Poverty was most pervasive in the south, where 16 per cent of the population were counted as poor. The poverty rate reached 14.3 per cent in the west, 13.2 per cent in the mid-west and 12.2 per cent in the north-east.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Speaking at a national conference on poverty reduction, Chen  Yaobang, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, said  that a sustained, healthy and rapid economic growth, together  with the fiscal reform, will gradually increase the central  government's financial ability to support poverty-reduction  efforts.    There are enormous difficulties involved in abolishing  poverty by raising the living standards of the 80 million  Chinese residents who do not have enough food to eat or clothes  to wear, the minister told several hundred officials from about  20 ministries and local governments.    However, a growing economy and increasing awareness of the  whole society of the importance of alleviating poverty and  expanding international co-operation will contribute to the  efforts, he said.    Vice Minister of Finance Li Yanling said that the fiscal  reform is mainly designed by the central government to gradually  increase its revenues, thus uplifting its ability for macro  economic control.    To narrow the gap between the booming coastal regions and  the  central and western areas, from now on the central government  will take the lion's share of the increased local revenues and  give a considerable part of its share to poor areas, in the  central and western regions and areas inhabited by minority  nationalities, Li said.    He urged financial departments to increase their investment  to the best of their ability in poverty-alleviation efforts.    The ministry has provided a total of 27 billion yuan for the  nationwide poverty-reduction drive during the past 14 years.     "

In their opinion,  poverty in our country is escalating from a social problem into  a political one: The lumpenization of society and the growth in  irritation, dissatisfaction, and wounded dignity in a  considerable section of the population which only recently was  considered perfectly successful in terms of its standard of  living do not lead to democracy but create preconditions for a  new dictatorship.    Duma Deputy Ella Pamfilova, former minister of social  protection of the population, believes that the way out can be  found by creating a long-term federal program to combat poverty.  It must be based on the package of draft laws which specialists  have already worked out: Deputies intend to submit it soon for  examination by the State Duma. The first thing in this package  must be a law on the minimum living wage, which should include  criteria for assessing the standard of living and the minimum  per capita provision, below which the state cannot allow itself  to fall.    Deputy Petr Shchelishch (""Yabloko"") is convinced that  poverty  is not only a problem of the poor but a problem of the moral  health of society. Since there are different paths to poverty  (nowadays they depend not only on the person himself), the means  of assisting the individual on the part of the state and society  must also be different: from direct poverty benefits for those  who cannot resolve this problem on their own to the creation of  a system to support those who are in a position to create the  basis of their prosperity by their own efforts (young families,  people who have lost their job, etc.). For this it is necessary  to reorient the state's system of priorities: Expenditure on  ""bread and shelter"" must be the top priority. Without this it  is impossible to transform society efficiently, since the growth  of the ""nouveau pauvre"" section narrows the base of economic and  political reforms.    Problems of poverty -- above all, the question of the  minimum  living wage -- will today be the subject of parliamentary  hearings in the State Duma organized on the initiative of the  Committee on Labor and Social Support and of parliament's  democratic factions. In their initiative the deputies of a  democratic orientation proceed from the premise that further  ignoring of social problems discredits not only the authorities  implementing the reform in the country but also the reforms  themselves.

Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, Qinghai has harsh  natural conditions and is often hit by natural disasters.    According to Ma Yuanbiao, vice-governor of the province, by  the year 2000 Qinghai's animal husbandry production will occupy  30 percent of total agricultural production, the per capita  income of farmers and herdsmen will be over 500 yuan, and some  50 percent of the total social production value in rural areas  will be made by township enterprises.    In the past eight years, the poverty-stricken areas in  Qinghai have constructed over 2,300 kilometers of highways and  improved farmland soil and grassland. The per capita income has  increased by 81 percent in the rural areas.    The provincial government has helped the poor areas to set  up  nearly 1,000 processing factories for farm and animal husbandry  products, mining and metallurgical plants and trained more than  1 million people.    In 1993, the total industrial output value in poor areas was  1.25 billion yuan (about 180 million U.S. dollars), 2.6 times  the figure eight years ago.    As a result of these efforts, nearly 70,000 people in the  province have escaped poverty every year. But there are still  1.19 million people under the poverty line, one-third of the  population in rural areas.    According to a new help-the-poor plan of the province, there  will be an average of 170,000 people escaping poverty each year,  and 14 percent increase of per capita income, through 2000.    The provincial government has issued policies to encourage  enterprises in developed areas to invest in poor areas.    Each year, the province issues 3 million yuan in  aid-the-poor  loans.     "

0,FT932-217 ,"FT932-217 _AN-DGABBABFFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / Economist with political nous: Lawrence Summers      By MICHAEL PROWSE   IN POLITICS your job is as important as you make it. This, at any rate, appears to be the modus operandi of Mr Lawrence Summers, the forceful under-secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury. Mr Summers is only the third-ranking official at the Treasury; yet this has not stopped him speaking out authoritatively on a range of issues, some of which would appear to be the responsibility of other departments. For example, in a series of speeches - most recently to Japanese businessmen in Tokyo - Mr Summers has set out the general principles underlying trade relations between Japan and the US. Mr David Mulford, who held Mr Summers' job in the Bush administration, tended to focus more narrowly on the financial services sector and left general trade policy to the US trade representative or the commerce secretary. While many appointees of President Bill Clinton are still struggling to find their feet, Mr Summers is rapidly carving out a position of influence. His stature in part reflects his having served the perfect apprenticeship for his job. As chief economist at the World Bank for two years up to last November's election, Mr Summers became familiar with nearly all the issues now confronting him, such as economic reform in Russia, policy co-ordination between Group of Seven countries and third world development. He also had a chance to build personal relationships with leading economic policy makers in Europe and Japan. As most members of Mr Clinton's economic team have been fully absorbed with domestic policy - especially the struggle to win congressional support for the deficit-cutting economic package, Mr Summers has had a relatively free hand to mould international policy. He has been instrumental in shaping a two-pronged global strategy consisting of a 're-invigorated multilateral effort' to strengthen global economic growth and an 'export-activist' trade policy designed to open markets and make other countries 'bear a greater responsibility for supporting the global trading system'. In both areas Mr Summers has tried to present policy in terms likely to appeal to Washington's Group of Seven partners. For example, he encouraged his boss Mr Lloyd Bentsen, to stress that economic co-operation is a 'two-way street' in which the US will respect the views of allies. Viewed from Tokyo, Mr Summers' brand of co-operation looks more like coercion: Tokyo is being pressed hard to adopt a more expansionary fiscal policy and to halve its current account surplus as a fraction of national income. Mr Summers has been active on many other fronts. He is one of the administration's strongest proponents of more generous US and international support for Russian economic reforms and is also showing greater sensitivity to the needs of developing countries than his Republican predecessors. He has signalled that the US would join other industrialised countries in offering more generous debt relief to low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. He is putting his inside knowledge of flaws in World Bank operational procedures to good use by pressing it (and other development institutions) to sharpen their focus on poverty relief and alter the way they conduct business.

Attending this forum were provincial leaders, including Ma  Guoliang and Sun Kuiwen, leaders of the province's 11 poor  counties and the cities and districts in these counties, and  responsible persons of provincial level departments concerned.    Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: In the process of acquiring  the new market economic structure, the policies, and scope and  degree of economic benefits, such as reducing or remitting  taxes, increasing loans, and striving for parity-price means of  production, will be gradually reduced. If the ideas of helping  poor counties shake off poverty and become prosperous still  remain in the stage of asking for money, materials, and policies  from the higher authorities, it will be very difficult to carry  out the work of enabling poor counties to shake off poverty and  become prosperous. The establishment of the new market economic  structure has brought new opportunity for this work. If we  promptly adjust our ideology and shift the planned economy to a  market economy, we will be able to more rapidly attain the aim  of enabling poor counties to end poverty and become prosperous.  He said: The key to success is to do a good job in the two  aspects of decontrolling and invigorating the markets and  guiding enterprises to enter the market. To invigorate the  markets, we must eliminate the obstacles. If we decontrol the  management of thousands upon thousands of markets and enable  them to develop production and create wealth independently, we  will have no problem in helping poor counties end poverty. The  problem now is that the traditional leadership concepts and  management system have tied the hands of peasants and  enterprises. When carrying out work, peasants and enterprises  have to ask for favors from various departments, and if they  fail to do so, they will be unable to carry out their work.  There are too many official procedures and shackles. The way  to solve this is to deepen reform, change government functions,  and streamline and reorganize organs. Government departments  should not manage things that are within the framework of the  decision-making power of enterprises and laborers. Departments  which have no work to do after changing functions and delegating  powers should be merged into other organs or abolished. Those  who extort money from enterprises and peasants or create  difficulties for them should be investigated and handled upon  discovery. He said: We must pave the road and build bridges  for enterprises and peasants to enter the market. Since  peasants have engaged in the natural economy and enterprises in  the product economy for a long time, they cannot adapt  themselves to the market as soon as it is decontrolled.  Particularly, the quality of enterprises and peasants are  relatively lower in poor counties. The contradictions between  the scattered small production units and large markets are very  prominent. It does not mean that the governments have nothing  to do or that they have taken on an attitude of noninterference  after creating benefits for the markets. They should guide  thousands and thousands of peasant households and enterprises  into the market and give prominence to the intermediate service  work for peasants and enterprises. Comrade Sun Weiben noted:  To help poor counties, we should adopt permanent measures,  focus the work on supporting poor counties by carrying out  explorative work and enhancing their ability to survive and  develop under market conditions, relatively concentrate efforts  on helping poor counties carry out some explorative pillar items  in agricultural and industrial production, and enhance their  self- development function. In addition to studying and  formulating regular policies to help and support poor counties,  we should also issue some relatively supportive policies in line  with the explorative pillar industries and projects they have  carried out. In formulating policies to help and support poor  counties, the general guideline is to try to the utmost to  decontrol enterprises.    At the forum, Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen summed up the  situation of carrying out the strategy of helping poor counties  across the province shake off poverty and become prosperous and  set forth demands on future work. He said: Since the  convocation of the provincial on-the-spot meeting on helping  poor counties shake off poverty held in Lindian County last  year, the strategy of helping poor counties shake off poverty  has been carried out in an all-round manner. Last year, the  total output value of 11 poor counties increased 13.7 percent  over that of the previous year, higher than the provincial  average by 8.8 percentage point; their financial revenue  increased 13.4 percent, higher than the province's county  average level; and the average per-capita income of people in  the rural areas increased 25.5 percent, higher than the  provincial average by 17.1 percentage point. He called on poor  counties across the province to strengthen confidence in shaking  off poverty and becoming prosperous, deeply carry out the  strategy of helping them shake off poverty, fully and rationally  develop and use land resources, steadily develop large-scale  agriculture, unceasingly raise the income of peasants, actively  develop county-run industry, and continue to expand local  financial resources. He called for efforts to further enhance  consciousness and initiative in carrying out the strategy of  helping poor counties shake off poverty, continue to support  poor counties with policies, organize social efforts to jointly  carry out this strategy, and strive to fundamentally change the  outlook of poor counties after several years of efforts.

ARNOLD: REGGAE'S HEAVYWEIGHTS DON'T  GO LIGHT ON LYRICS      By THOMAS K. ARNOLD      Two of Jamaica's most acclaimed musical exports, Burning Spear and Pato Banton,  will headline this year's Bob Marley Birthday Celebration. The ninth annual  tribute to the late, great reggae pioneer will be held Saturday night at the  California Theatre in downtown San Diego.    Burning Spear, whose real name is Winston Rodney, is the heir apparent to  Marley as the social conscience of reggae music. Unlike most contemporary  reggae artists, who prefer to sing about love, sex and ganja (marijuana), the  41-year-old Rodney concerns himself primarily with weightier topics.    In most of his songs, he either rails against the evils of oppression -- black  Jamaica's history of slavery -- or hails the virtues of achieving mystical  transcendence through the Rastafarian religion. Rodney will appear with the  nine-piece Burning Band from St. Anne's Bay, Jamaica.    Pato Banton is no lightweight, either. Although the Birmingham, England, native  first found success on the British charts a few years ago with such infectious  dance tunes as ""Allo Tosh"" and ""Mash Up the Telly,"" his music has since become  increasingly topical.    On ""Never Give In,"" his 1988 U. S. debut, Banton sings about everything from  apartheid in South Africa (""Sometimes I cry for my people in South  Africa/Brutalized and persecuted by apartheid law/Living under the rule of a  mass murderer/Who goes by the name of Mr. Botha"") to poverty in Jamaica  (""Because of the government joke system/A lot of families find it hard to make  a livin'/To be young and unemployed is an everyday thin'/That's why so many  youths gone ragamuffin'. "")    Also on the bill is Don Carlos, a founding member of Black Uhuru. Since going  solo a few years ago, Carlos has released nearly a dozen albums in Jamaica,  Africa and Europe.    The Bob Marley Birthday Celebration will also feature an exhibition of Jamaican  handicrafts and jewelry and a slide show chronicling Marley's career.    The biggest dance craze of the 1960s began in the eighth month of that decade.  In August, 1960, a young black man from Philadelphia named Ernest Evans -- who  a year before had quit his job as a chicken plucker in a local poultry shop,  rechristened himself Chubby Checker (in emulation of the similarly built Fats  Domino), and signed with Philly's Cameo-Parkway Records, under whose label he  topped the charts with his version of ""The Twist.""    The song was written, and originally recorded as a B side, by rhythm and blues  singer Hank Ballard in 1958. But it was Checker's interpretation that became a  hit -- one that soon had teen-agers all over the world dancing to ""The Twist""  and countless other rock acts jumping on the bandwagon with their own  variations of the tune.    There was Danny and the Juniors' ""Twistin' U. S. A.,"" Jimmy Soul's ""Twistin'  Matilda,"" the Marvelettes' ""Twistin' Postman"" and Sam Cooke's ""Twistin' the  Night Away."" There was the Beatles' ""Twist and Shout"" and Gary U. S. Bonds'  ""Twist, Twist Senora."" There were even three follow-ups by Checker himself:  ""Let's Twist Again"" in 1961, ""Slow Twistin' "" a year later and 1963's ""Twist It  Up.""    Checker, who will appear Thursday night at the Bacchanal nightclub in Kearny  Mesa, subsequently promoted several other, less successful dance crazes in  songs like ""The Hucklebuck"" (which went to No. 14 in October, 1960), ""Pony  Time"" (No. 3, January, 1961), ""Limbo Rock"" (No. 2, September, 1962) and ""Let's  Do the Freddie"" (No. 40, May, 1965).    But, by the late 1960s, the hits had stopped coming, the toes had stopped  tapping and Checker found himself relegated to has-been status. For the next  two decades, he was a mainstay on the oldies circuit, regularly touring the  country with rock revival shows.    Last year, however, Checker's remake of ""The Twist,"" with rap group the Fat  Boys, put him back on the charts for the first time in more than 20 years. Ever  since, he's once again been a top concert draw, this time attracting a whole  new generation of fans.    LINER NOTES: Veteran singing duo the Righteous Brothers, whose mid-1960s hits  include ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' "" and ""(You're My) Soul and  Inspiration,"" have picked San Diego as the site for their second retro-rock  diner. Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield have yet to settle on a name, but they've  already settled on a location: next to the abandoned Loma Theater on Rosecrans  Street in Point Loma. The combination restaurant-nightclub, modeled after the  one the pair built a few years back in Orange County, is scheduled to open in  November. There will be live music five nights a week, including regular  performances by the Righteous Brothers and other oldies acts.    The Pandoras will appear Saturday night at the Spirit nightclub in Bay Park.  The all-girl rock group's new album, ""Rock Hard,"" was produced by San Diego  guitarist Stevie Salas, who spent much of last year on the road with Rod  Stewart. . . . Local roots-rockers the Beat Farmers have finished recording  their fourth album, ""Poor and Famous,"" up at Indigo Ranch studios in Malibu and  are back in town for a brief respite before they head out on tour in late  March. The LP is due out around the same time on the MCA/Curb Records label.

Burning Spear, whose real name is Winston Rodney, is the heir apparent to  Marley as the social conscience of reggae music. Unlike most contemporary  reggae artists, who prefer to sing about love, sex and ganja (marijuana), the  41-year-old Rodney concerns himself primarily with weightier topics.    In most of his songs, he either rails against the evils of oppression -- black  Jamaica's history of slavery -- or hails the virtues of achieving mystical  transcendence through the Rastafarian religion. Rodney will appear with the  nine-piece Burning Band from St. Anne's Bay, Jamaica.    Pato Banton is no lightweight, either. Although the Birmingham, England, native  first found success on the British charts a few years ago with such infectious  dance tunes as ""Allo Tosh"" and ""Mash Up the Telly,"" his music has since become  increasingly topical.    On ""Never Give In,"" his 1988 U. S. debut, Banton sings about everything from  apartheid in South Africa (""Sometimes I cry for my people in South  Africa/Brutalized and persecuted by apartheid law/Living under the rule of a  mass murderer/Who goes by the name of Mr. Botha"") to poverty in Jamaica  (""Because of the government joke system/A lot of families find it hard to make  a livin'/To be young and unemployed is an everyday thin'/That's why so many  youths gone ragamuffin'. "")    Also on the bill is Don Carlos, a founding member of Black Uhuru. Since going  solo a few years ago, Carlos has released nearly a dozen albums in Jamaica,  Africa and Europe.    The Bob Marley Birthday Celebration will also feature an exhibition of Jamaican  handicrafts and jewelry and a slide show chronicling Marley's career.    The biggest dance craze of the 1960s began in the eighth month of that decade.  In August, 1960, a young black man from Philadelphia named Ernest Evans -- who  a year before had quit his job as a chicken plucker in a local poultry shop,  rechristened himself Chubby Checker (in emulation of the similarly built Fats  Domino), and signed with Philly's Cameo-Parkway Records, under whose label he  topped the charts with his version of ""The Twist.""    The song was written, and originally recorded as a B side, by rhythm and blues  singer Hank Ballard in 1958. But it was Checker's interpretation that became a  hit -- one that soon had teen-agers all over the world dancing to ""The Twist""  and countless other rock acts jumping on the bandwagon with their own  variations of the tune.    There was Danny and the Juniors' ""Twistin' U. S. A.,"" Jimmy Soul's ""Twistin'  Matilda,"" the Marvelettes' ""Twistin' Postman"" and Sam Cooke's ""Twistin' the  Night Away."" There was the Beatles' ""Twist and Shout"" and Gary U. S. Bonds'  ""Twist, Twist Senora."" There were even three follow-ups by Checker himself:  ""Let's Twist Again"" in 1961, ""Slow Twistin' "" a year later and 1963's ""Twist It  Up.""    Checker, who will appear Thursday night at the Bacchanal nightclub in Kearny  Mesa, subsequently promoted several other, less successful dance crazes in  songs like ""The Hucklebuck"" (which went to No. 14 in October, 1960), ""Pony  Time"" (No. 3, January, 1961), ""Limbo Rock"" (No. 2, September, 1962) and ""Let's  Do the Freddie"" (No. 40, May, 1965).    But, by the late 1960s, the hits had stopped coming, the toes had stopped  tapping and Checker found himself relegated to has-been status. For the next  two decades, he was a mainstay on the oldies circuit, regularly touring the  country with rock revival shows.    Last year, however, Checker's remake of ""The Twist,"" with rap group the Fat  Boys, put him back on the charts for the first time in more than 20 years. Ever  since, he's once again been a top concert draw, this time attracting a whole  new generation of fans.    LINER NOTES: Veteran singing duo the Righteous Brothers, whose mid-1960s hits  include ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' "" and ""(You're My) Soul and  Inspiration,"" have picked San Diego as the site for their second retro-rock  diner. Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield have yet to settle on a name, but they've  already settled on a location: next to the abandoned Loma Theater on Rosecrans  Street in Point Loma. The combination restaurant-nightclub, modeled after the  one the pair built a few years back in Orange County, is scheduled to open in  November. There will be live music five nights a week, including regular  performances by the Righteous Brothers and other oldies acts.    The Pandoras will appear Saturday night at the Spirit nightclub in Bay Park.  The all-girl rock group's new album, ""Rock Hard,"" was produced by San Diego  guitarist Stevie Salas, who spent much of last year on the road with Rod  Stewart. . . . Local roots-rockers the Beat Farmers have finished recording  their fourth album, ""Poor and Famous,"" up at Indigo Ranch studios in Malibu and  are back in town for a brief respite before they head out on tour in late  March. The LP is due out around the same time on the MCA/Curb Records label.      Photo, Winston Rodney      Column    "

[passage omitted]    III. Reasons for the Change in Perception of Childbearing  Among People in Poverty Regions    At the hand of a large array of examples, the participants  showed that although economic development was the ultimate cause  that led to the change in the people's perception of  childbearing, there was not at all a simple linear relation  between economic growth and the change in the people's  perception of childbearing. Under certain circumstances,  economic growth would even stimulate the desire to have more  children. As things are today, the limited economic growth in  poverty regions is not sufficient to induce changes in the  people's perception of childbearing. People in some poverty  counties have been comparatively quick to change their  perception of childbearing, mainly because of ideological  education and the guidance of government policy. For instance,  in the Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County of Guangxi  Province and in Panan County of Zhejiang Province, the leading  cadres at all levels had paid most serious attention to  population control affairs and had devoted considerable manpower  and material resources to propagandistic education. In the  Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County, per capita investment  in family planning is in excess of seven yuan. Moreover, the  change in perception of childbearing among the people of poverty  counties is also due to such factors as the development of  educational and public health affairs, a relative opening up of  society, and the spreading influence of the large and  medium-sized cities.    IV. Factors Restraining the Change of Perception of  Childbearing Among People in Poverty Regions    In the opinion of the participants, there are in the poverty  regions more than in ordinary regions factors extant that  restrain a change from the traditional perception of  childbearing to its modern perception. The following are some of  such restraining factors:    1. Poor natural conditions, backward productive forces.  Production methods and tools are rather primitive in poverty  regions, mechanization is at a low level, production relies  mainly on human labor, and there is, therefore, indeed,  objectively a need for many childbirths.    2. The educational level of the population is very low. For  instance, in Luchun County of Yunnan Province, over 70 percent  of the population are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Add to this  the fact that as a society they are also isolated, a fact which  seriously impairs their ability to accept new knowledge and new  concepts.    3. The unitary system of the production structure has a  detrimental effect on the employment of women. Women are  occupying a very low economic and social position.    4. The weak social security system and the traditional ways  of family-oriented care for the elderly has people believe in  the need to ""raise sons to provide for old age.""    5. The very deep-rooted influence of traditional culture and  customs. For instance, the people of Hani nationality in Luchun  County of Yunnan Province have the customs of early marriages,  of free premarital sex, the system of inheritance by the  youngest son, the belief in the transmigration of the soul, and  in the theory of the life-shortening effect of childbirths. All  this makes people desirous of early births and many childbirths.  The main group of Uygurs living in Shufu County of Xinjiang  Province are mostly following the rules of the Islamic religion  in matters of marriage and childbirths.    6. Some poverty regions have been receiving state relief for  a long period of time, and this has some people develop a  dependent mentality, which to some degree is hindering a change  in their perception of childbearing.

0,FT931-1043 ,"FT931-1043 _AN-DCZBZAF2FT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Lands where rich and poor are furthest apart: Poverty in Latin America - As the IADB meets in Hamburg, FT writers look at the plight of individual countries      By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor   LATIN America's governments have won wide praise for economic reform programmes credited with restoring growth and lowering inflation. Investors have responded enthusiastically. Net capital inflows to Latin America last year exceeded Dollars 50bn (Pounds 35.2bn), suggesting much of the region is at last emerging from the debt crisis of the 1980s. Yet the recession induced by the debt crisis may have left a more lasting legacy that could yet thwart the aspirations of these new investors and reverse the pro-market economic policies that encouraged them. The shift to democracy in much of the region may also be at risk. The problem is poverty and the related issue of income inequality. Income is more concentrated in the hands of the rich in Latin America than in any other region of the world. In the 1980s, inequalities worsened significantly and poverty increased. Meeting last year in Washington, the region's finance ministers decided this could undo all their good work. Social objectives - to enable the poor to benefit from growth - were pushed up their agendas. Partly as a result, social issues are a high priority at this year's annual meetings of the InterAmerican Development Bank, starting today in Hamburg. Yet raising national income is a complicated task; adding specific policies to improve income distribution makes it more so. As a two-year round of presidential elections approaches in the region, the question arises of whether both issues can be tackled in the framework of economic policies still regarded favourably by investors. 'Spending more is easy; spending better is difficult,' says Mr Gustavo Marquez, a Venezuelan expert on poverty. A study from the World Bank underlines the deterioration in social conditions in the 1980s. It suggests the number of people in poverty - defined as a household income in 1985 dollars of Dollars 60 monthly - in Latin America grew from 27 per cent of the population in 1980 to 32 per cent in 1989. Other estimates suggest a more dramatic increase in poverty through the decade from 130m to 180m, two-fifths of the population. The study also suggests income inequalities grew in all except four countries: Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay. In the 1980s, the study indicates, poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean became a mainly urban rather than rural problem. More of the poor now live in cities (69m) than in the country (64m); in 1980, most of the poor lived in rural areas (53m) rather than in urban areas (39m). Most poverty is concentrated in a few countries. Brazil alone, with one-third of the population, accounts for 44 per cent of the poor. Mexico had 11 per cent and Peru 9 per cent. A further 19 per cent lived in a small group of countries including Bolivia, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua. As much as 44 per cent of the total increase in poverty in the 1980s was in Brazil, and 14 per cent in Peru. Resolving the poverty issue is on the face of it simple, but in practice hugely complicated. Wealth is so concentrated in Latin America that a relatively modest sacrifice could apparently address the problem. As the World Bank's 1990 World Development Report suggested: 'Raising all the poor in the continent to just above the poverty line would cost only 0.7 per cent of regional GDP - the approximate equivalent of a 2 per cent income tax on the wealthiest fifth of the population.' Even if such taxes were levied - and, even less likely, paid - social programmes would still have to be implemented. These fall into two categories: trying to provide support to alleviate immediate suffering; and aiming at longer-term objectives, such as improving education and health standards to provide a way out of poverty. Yet Latin American experience has been that little of the money aimed directly at the poor reaches them, raising the question of how to manage poverty programmes. Furthermore, attempts to deal with issues such as health and education founder usually against the opposition of powerful vested interests such as teachers' and health workers' unions.

About 37 percent of Bolivian families live in extreme  poverty, 33 percent under conditions of moderate poverty, 13  percent are at the threshold of poverty, and barely 17 percent  have their basic needs satisfied. This is the official picture  of poverty in Bolivia, described in the ""Mapa de la Pobreza""  [Map of Poverty], prepared by the Unit for the Analysis of  Social Policies (UDAPSO), the National Institute of Statistics  (INE), the Population Policy Unit (UPP), and the Unit for the  Analysis of Economic Policies (UDAPE).    Social inequalities in Bolivia are extensive, as extensive  and dramatic as the poverty in which about 70 percent of the  people of Bolivia live, or rather more than two thirds of the  population. Meanwhile, more than one half million, or 640,000  people, are on the threshold of poverty, and only 17 percent of  the Bolivian people, somewhat more than one million, are not  poor.    Bolivia is not a country of beggars, as someone once defined  it in a disparaging way. However, these data prove that the  majority of the population of Bolivia, or 4.5 million people,  live at an atrocious level of poverty. This is a high figure for  this country, whose population was estimated at 6.4 million in  1992.    Details of These Numbers    The ""Map of Poverty,"" prepared by UDAPSO, INE, UPP, and  UDAPE, illustrates this study on the basis of data from the  Census of the Population and Housing, which took 1.4 million  family households as the national total, of which 1.3 million  live in urban areas and 577,000 live in the countryside.    Poverty was measured on the basis of satisfying human needs  for housing, services and basic needs, education, and health and  social security. The study stated that the categories of  housing, services, and basic needs relate to the way in which  the family carries on its life, while education, health, and  social security are related to the conditions of physical and  mental development of persons.    The study added: ""Levels of poverty in Bolivia are high. In  1992 a considerable proportion of the population, especially in  rural areas, did not have its essential needs satisfied, as it  did not have adequate access to such services and basic needs as  education, health services, and housing.""    Poor As Anyone    In 1992, 69.8 percent of the 1.4 million families surveyed  were poor. This represents 70.5 percent of Bolivia's population,  that is, 4.5 million out of 6.4 million people.    In the rural area, poverty affected 94 percent of all homes,  or 2.3 million people living in 542,644 families. In the urban  area poverty affected 51 percent of all homes, or 380,886  families -- rather more than 1.7 million people.    According to these data, poverty was more extensive in  smaller cities than in departmental capitals and in El Alto.    The report said: ""Living conditions of the Bolivian people  are, for the most part, poor, since many of the homes lack or  are inadequately provided with basic cleanliness, living space,  education, health, energy resources, and household equipment.""    It continued: ""About 74 percent of the homes do not have  adequate water and sanitation and/or facilities for the disposal  of human wastes. About 69 percent of the people live in  overcrowded conditions. Some 66 percent show signs of  educational shortcomings in terms of school attendance, years of  schooling completed, and illiteracy.""    The report stated: ""About 53 percent of the families do not  take adequate care of their health. Some 53 percent of private  homes do not have access to electricity and/or an adequate fuel  to cook with, and 49 percent of the homes are constructed of  poor quality materials.""    Differences Between the Countryside and the Cities    The study also brought out that poverty is more extensive  and  worse in the countryside, where shortages of facilities, as a  whole, are significant, although the most immediate needs  reflect basic standards of cleanliness.    About 94 percent of the homes in rural areas do not have  adequate water and sanitation and/or proper means for the  disposal of human wastes, as well as access to energy services.  About 93 percent of the homes do not have access to electricity  and/or appropriate kind of fuel to cook with. The report,  entitled, the ""Map of Poverty,"" referred to the fact that some  84 percent of all rural homes are built with poor quality  materials.    In urban centers the greatest problems involve housing  space.  About 68 percent of families live in overcrowded conditions.  Some 58 percent of homes in urban areas do not have adequate  provisions for water, sanitation, and/or for the disposal of  human wastes. About 51 percent of the families show some signs  of educational deficiency, the report added.    The Census of the Poorest    The list of departments in terms of their poverty level is  headed by Pando, Potosi, and Chuquisaca. Santa Cruz is the  department with the least poverty, but almost 60 percent of the  families in that department are poor.    The ""Map of Poverty"" states that in the Department of Pando  81 percent of the families are poor, compared to 80 percent in  Potosi, and 77 percent in Beni and Cochabamba.    In the rest of the departments about 70 percent of the  families are poor, with the exception of Santa Cruz, which has  the lowest incidence of poverty. Some 58 percent of the families  in that department are poor.    Of the four poorest departments three of them -- Chuquisaca,  Pando, and Potosi -- have a high level of poverty. The report  adds that poor families in these departments, on the average,  fail to meet 45 percent of their basic needs in terms of minimum  living conditions.    Classification of the Poor    The social classification of the poor shows that out of all  Bolivian families -- 1.4 million in all -- about 37 percent live  under conditions of extreme poverty. About 32 percent of all  families are destitute, while 5 percent live under conditions of  marginal poverty.    The report prepared by UDAPSO, INE, UDAPE, and UPP said that  this means that 2.1 million Bolivians live under conditions of  extreme poverty. Seventy percent of their basic needs are not  being met in terms of minimum living levels.    Furthermore, a large number, or 33 percent of the total  number of families, live in moderate poverty. That is, something  more than 1.9 million people, on the average, cover 75 percent  of their minimum living requirements.    On the threshold of poverty are 13 percent of all families,  or 787,907 people, who satisfy the minimum level of their basic  needs. Only 17 percent of all families, or 915,593 persons, have  their basic needs met. These people, on the average, satisfy 55  percent more than their basic, essential needs.    The Harsh Life in the Countryside    The official report states that the majority of families in  rural areas -- 57 percent in all or 1.4 million people -- live  under conditions of extreme poverty. About 11 percent, or  265,118 people, live under marginal conditions. About 26  percent, or 633,258 people, live under conditions of moderate  poverty. Only 6 percent, or 118,226 people, are not poor.    Within this latter group of people living in rural areas the  families whose basic needs are met amount to barely 1.9 percent,  while 4.1 percent of the total number of families are on the  threshold of poverty.    In urban areas the extent of poverty is not as great, the  study said.    About 34 percent of families living in urban areas, or 1.3  million people, live in moderate poverty. About 28 percent, or  884,107 people, are in the group whose basic needs are met. Some  20 percent, or 701,167 persons, live on the threshold of  poverty. About 13 percent, or 427,970 persons, live in extreme  poverty. Some 12 percent of the total number of families are  destitute, and 0.5 percent live on the threshold of being  destitute.     "

OBRA '90 created a new group of mandatory categorically needy children who are at least age 6 but have not yet reached age 19. These are children born after September 30, 1983 with family income at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA '90 made corresponding changes to the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children to include children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 and to allow States to use an earlier date of birth in order to include older children sooner than is mandated.     In addition, OBRA '90 mandated that a State provide continuous eligibility to pregnant women throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period without regard to changes in income. (This had been a State option.) OBRA '90 also   changed the requirement for newborns who are deemed to be eligible as a result of their mothers' eligibility status. Previously, a newborn was considered eligible at birth if the newborn's mother was eligible for and receiving   Medicaid. The newborn could remain eligible for as long as a year if the mother remained eligible and the infant was a member of the mother's household. With the OBRA '90 change, a newborn may still remain eligible for as long as a year if the mother loses eligibility but would remain eligible if   she were pregnant.     Finally, OBRA '90 made several changes to presumptive eligibility for pregnant women by eliminating the existing time limit on the presumptive period and allowing a pregnant woman to remain presumptively eligible until the State makes a determination on her regular application for Medicaid or,   if she does not file a regular application, the last day of the month following the month in which she was determined presumptively eligible. OBRA '90 also provided that the application given to a presumptively eligible pregnant woman could be the application used by the State to determine the   regular Medicaid eligibility of low-income pregnant women under section 1902(1)(1)(A).     This document proposes to incorporate provisions of OBRA '86, '87, '89, and '90, the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act, MCCA, and FSA in the Medicaid regulations, as outlined and discussed in the following section of this document. (Additional related provisions in these laws are being addressed in separate rulemaking documents.)         II. Discussion of Legislative Provisions and Proposed Amendments to Regulations         A. Low-Income Pregnant Women, Infants, and Children         Section 9401 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) and 1902(1) to establish optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and women during the 60-day period beginning on the last day of pregnancy, infants, and children up to   age 5 whose income does not exceed a State-established standard that is a specified percentage of the Federal nonfarm poverty income guidelines. Under OBRA '86, a State could establish this income standard at a level at or below   100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. A State had to cover both pregnant women and infants (it could not cover either group separately) and it had to cover both of these groups in order to cover children.     OBRA '86 also amended section 1902(e) to provide that States that have chosen to cover infants and children under section 1902(1) must continue to cover those infants and children under certain circumstances. Under section   1902(e)(7), if the infants and children are receiving covered inpatient services at the time they reach the age limits under the State plan, the State must cover them until the end of their inpatient stay if they remain otherwise   eligible. Also, OBRA '86 specifically exempted the group of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) from the limits on family income which affect a State's Federal financial participation (FFP) under section 1903(f)(4) of the Act.     Later legislation changed the age limit for children and the percentage of the poverty level for the income standard. Specifically, section 4101(c) of OBRA '87 raised the maximum age for low-income children from age 5 up to age   8. Section 4101(a)(1) of OBRA '87 increased the percentage of the poverty guidelines at which the income standard could be set to 185 percent for pregnant women and infants under age 1, effective July 1, 1988. However, for children age 1 up to age 8, section 4101 retained the percentage level at   no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines (or, if the State had chosen to cover pregnant women and infants with a percentage of income below 100 percent, the percentage for children had to equal the percentage used for the pregnant women and infants). Section 4118 of OBRA '87 also removed the reference to ``nonfarm'' in the description of the Federal poverty income guidelines to be used. In addition, section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 amended section 1916 of the Act to allow States to charge a premium to optional   groups of low-income pregnant women and infants who have family incomes above a specified level.

Under OBRA '86, a State could establish this income standard at a level at or below   100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. A State had to cover both pregnant women and infants (it could not cover either group separately) and it had to cover both of these groups in order to cover children.     OBRA '86 also amended section 1902(e) to provide that States that have chosen to cover infants and children under section 1902(1) must continue to cover those infants and children under certain circumstances. Under section   1902(e)(7), if the infants and children are receiving covered inpatient services at the time they reach the age limits under the State plan, the State must cover them until the end of their inpatient stay if they remain otherwise   eligible. Also, OBRA '86 specifically exempted the group of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) from the limits on family income which affect a State's Federal financial participation (FFP) under section 1903(f)(4) of the Act.     Later legislation changed the age limit for children and the percentage of the poverty level for the income standard. Specifically, section 4101(c) of OBRA '87 raised the maximum age for low-income children from age 5 up to age   8. Section 4101(a)(1) of OBRA '87 increased the percentage of the poverty guidelines at which the income standard could be set to 185 percent for pregnant women and infants under age 1, effective July 1, 1988. However, for children age 1 up to age 8, section 4101 retained the percentage level at   no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines (or, if the State had chosen to cover pregnant women and infants with a percentage of income below 100 percent, the percentage for children had to equal the percentage used for the pregnant women and infants). Section 4118 of OBRA '87 also removed the reference to ``nonfarm'' in the description of the Federal poverty income guidelines to be used. In addition, section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 amended section 1916 of the Act to allow States to charge a premium to optional   groups of low-income pregnant women and infants who have family incomes above a specified level.

At the conference, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech  entitled: ""Helping Poor Areas Through Development Is an  Important Strategic Task.""    The conference, convened by the State Council, ended in  Beijing today. Attending were Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Wen  Jiabao, Li Guixian, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan. Also  attending were leaders of democratic parties and the Federation  of Industry and Commerce, including Li Peiyao, Feng Zhijun, Feng  Kexu, Chen Xunli, Song Jinsheng, Lu Rongshu, Chen Mingshao, Cai  Zimin, and Chen Jingxin.    Today's conference was presided over by Chen Junsheng, head  of the Leading Group for the Economic Development of  Impoverished Areas under the State Council. At the conference,  leaders of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  under the central government, including Yunnan, Xinjiang, Hebei,  Shandong, Beijing, and Ningxia, made reports on their plans to  implement the National Poverty Elimination Plan.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin began by affirming the great  historic achievements scored in assisting impoverished areas  through promoting development since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee. He said: The most important  experience China has gained from its progress in poverty  reduction is the establishment of a new aid-the-poor principle,  shifting from merely relief aid to aiding poor areas by  promoting social and economic development. Practice shows that  aiding poor areas through social and economic development by  heeding market demands, relying on the advancement of science  and technology, exploiting local resources, and developing  commodity production, will not only provide enough food and  clothes for poverty-stricken people, but will also help them  free themselves from poverty and become well-off. Thus, the  principle of helping poor areas through social and economic  development by combining state assistance to poor areas, and the  self-reliant spirit and hard work of cadres and people in the  impoverished areas, constitutes a fundamental change in this  work; it is an important creation which must be continued for a  long time to come.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: We are still faced with arduous  tasks in our effort to help poor areas. To solve the problem of  providing sufficient food and clothes for 80 million people in  the next seven years, the State Council has drawn up a national  poverty elimination plan. This is a good plan. The key is that  we must have the determination to tackle the problem and  resolutely continue the work for a long time to come.    Pointing out that it is necessary to further understand the  importance of aiding poor areas through social and economic  development, Jiang Zemin said: Elimination of poverty to  realize common prosperity is required by the essence of  socialism and is the embodiment of the superiority of socialism.  In leading the people in making revolution and building  socialism, the party aims at emancipating and developing  productive forces to enable people to become prosperous. Since  the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, we  have allowed and encouraged some people and regions to become  well-off first. The aim is that common prosperity can be  achieved in a better way because people and regions which become  well-off first will give an impetus to other people and other  regions to strive for prosperity. In developing a socialist  market economic structure, we should not only seek efficiency in  resource allocation but also take into account the principle of  fairness, that is, we should do better in adopting effective  policies to assist impoverished areas. Jiang Zemin said:  Elimination of poverty to realize common prosperity is required  by reform and opening up to the outside world, and is also an  important condition for maintaining stability. Development in  various areas is uneven; some areas are developing fairly  rapidly, while other are developing relatively slowly. This is  unavoidable. However, in this process we must keep an eye on  economic development in the impoverished areas and help them  free themselves from poverty and become well- off, so as to  achieve the goal of common prosperity.    Pointing out that to resolutely carry out the work of  assisting poor areas through development for a long time to  come, party committees and governments at all levels must  improve leadership over this work, Jiang Zemin said: Helping  poor areas through development is not only an important economic  task but also a political task concerning the masses -- which  includes the building of material civilization as well as  spiritual civilization. Party committees and governments at all  levels should, as always, strengthen leadership over the work to  aid poor areas. Jiang Zemin called on the principal leaders of  party committees and governments at all levels to show concern  for this work, attend to it, and regard it as an important means  of caring for the masses' hardships and improving ties between  the party and masses. He also called on them to make an overall  plan, concentrate on tackling weaknesses, and make frequent  visits to poor areas and nationality minority areas to help  cadres and masses there solve practical problems. He said:  Principal leaders should dispatch cadres, on a rotational  basis, to poor areas to help with their work. Cadres should be  selected from provincial, prefectural, and county organs, and  sent to impoverished townships and villages to work there for a  certain period of time. While there, they should publicize  party policies among the masses, assist them in improving  leading bodies, and help them find a way to free themselves from  poverty and become well-off by bringing in professional  personnel and technologies, and organizing them to develop  explorative undertakings. Achievements in helping poor areas  free themselves from poverty should be used as a criterion for  evaluating and promoting county and township leading cadres.    Jiang Zemin said: Party committees and governments should be  good at mobilizing and organizing all sectors of society to  bring about a new situation in the work of assisting poor areas.  When conditions permit, state organs, the People' Liberation  Army, the democratic parties, social organizations, and  enterprises and institutions, should, as always, actively  support and take part in the work of aiding poor areas to the  best of their ability. In aiding poor areas, investment is  necessary. Financial and other monetary departments should  render their support by providing funds on preferential terms.  They should also organize comparatively economically developed  areas and underdeveloped areas to help one another in order to  promote mutual benefit, common development, and common  prosperity.    Pointing out that it is necessary to give full play to the  innovative spirit of self-reliance and hard work of cadres and  masses in impoverished areas, Jiang Zemin said: It is  absolutely necessary for the state to provide some assistance to  impoverished areas and for all sectors of society to participate  in helping these areas. However, in the final analysis, the  poor areas should rely on themselves to solve the problem of  food and clothing, and to free themselves from poverty and  become well-off. This requires cadres and masses in  impoverished areas combat adverse natural conditions and develop  their economy by displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard  work. Difficulties can easily be overcome with a hard- working  spirit. This spirit is our party's fine tradition and also  constitutes our basic experience in helping poor areas become  well- off.    He stressed: While relying on our own efforts and working  diligently, we should think of new ideas for helping poor areas  through economic development. We should free ourselves from the  fetters of traditional concepts and forces of habit, genuinely  implement reform, open up to the outside world, and invigorate  the economy. We should emancipate our minds and find the  correct path. Many impoverished areas have suffered losses  because they have not sufficiently emancipated their minds and  have not sufficiently opened up ways to develop their economy.  While their barren hills, slopes, and land still remain  uncultivated, their surplus labor also remains idle. Excessive  labor should be taken as an asset, not a burden. To do a good  job in helping poor areas through development, it is necessary  to exploit local resources. At the same time, labor should be  exported in an organized and planned way. He said: Training  professional people by adhering to the spirit of self- reliance  and hard work is the key to success. It is necessary to  transform this innovative spirit into a material force.  Finally, it is necessary to rely on giving play to the wisdom  and intelligence of laborers. Therefore, importance must be  given to helping poor areas and developing intellectural  resources by relying on science and education. At the same  time, family planning must be carried out successfully.    Jiang Zemin pointed out emphatically: Whether the innovative  spirit of self-reliance and hard work can be carried forward  depends, to a large extent, on how in touch leading bodies in  poor areas are and how strong the basic organizations of these  areas are. It is necessary to strengthen work in impoverished  counties. In line with the needs of the work to assist  impoverished areas through development, outstanding cadres who  are capable, can endure hardships, and maintain close ties with  the masses should be promoted to assume the posts of county  party committee secretaries and county heads. Relative  stability regarding these posts should be maintained. It is  necessary to strengthen the organization of party branches in  impoverished villages. A good experience has been learned from  the work of assisting impoverished areas -- that is, ""while  providing relief in money and material, it is more important to  build up a good party branch.""    Li Peng began his speech by stressing that it is the  historical responsibility of the CPC and the government to  assist poverty-stricken areas to change their undevelopment  features through carrying out the plan to eliminate poverty by  the year 2000. He pointed out: Solving the basic food and  clothing problems of 80 million people in rural areas and  assisting them to become comparatively well off during the next  seven-year period are historical responsibilities which  communists of this generation and people's governments at all  levels must not evade. We must ensure the success of this major  strategic plan, which has political as well as economic  significance. Leading comrades of party committees and  governments at all levels and persons in charge of all  departments must consider this project as an important task,  attend to it earnestly, and accomplish it according to schedule.    Li Peng stressed: Implementing the plan to eliminate poverty  by the year 2000 and assist poverty-stricken areas to develop  their economy is a strategic measure for gradually reducing the  differences between the eastern and western parts of China. He  said: Over 80 percent of the nation's 80 million people -- for  whom basic food and clothing problems have yet to be totally  resolved -- live in central and western parts of China, with the  majority living in southwest and northwest parts of China. In  this sense, solving the basic food and clothing problems of  people in impoverished areas and helping them shake off poverty  and become comparatively well off is an issue of reducing the  developmental differences between eastern and western parts of  China. He said: Differences do exist objectively. While it is  impossible to totally eliminate the differences within a short  time owing to historical, natural, geographical, social, and  economic factors, we must exert positive efforts to gradually  reduce and eventually eliminate the differences. We uphold the  policy of encouraging some people and some regions to become  affluent ahead of others through honest labor and legitimate  businesses and then guide and assist the less developed areas in  development. This is for the purpose of achieving nationwide  prosperity. If we all are poverty-stricken, then nobody is able  to assist anybody. Only when some regions have developed first  and have developed a stronger economic ability can they be in a  position to assist the less developed areas. He said: We have  accomplished a great deal of work in reducing differences and  achieving common prosperity. From a vertical point of view,  both developed areas and poverty-stricken areas are developing;  and from a lateral point of view, the differences between  poverty- stricken areas and developed areas are still widening.  Thus, party committees and governments at all levels must  attach great importance to this problem and take effective  measures to reduce the regional differences.    The eight measures which Li Peng mentioned in his speech  are:  Encouraging the prosperous and developed coastal areas and the  large and medium cities to guide and assist the poverty-stricken  areas; the state will provide poverty-stricken areas with  adequate financial and monetary support; the state will give  poverty-stricken areas preferential treatment with regard to  major construction projects; gradually rationalizing through  reform the prices of raw and semi-finished materials and primary  goods; improving the competence and scientific and technical  proficiency of people in poverty-stricken areas; carrying out  open, experimental aid-the-poor projects on the basis of  carrying out developmental aid-the-poor programs; mobilizing  people in all social quarters to support developmental and  construction projects in poverty-stricken areas; and encouraging  poverty-stricken areas to foster the spirit of self- reliance  and arduous struggle.    Li Peng stressed: To implement the plan to eliminate  poverty by the year 2000, graduated responsibilities, especially  responsibilities discharged by provincial governors, will be  carried out under the centralized leadership of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. This means that principal  leading comrades of provincial party committees and provincial  governments must be concerned with aid-the-poor programs and  properly attend to these programs. One point must be clear:  Provincial governors must take personal charge. Executing the  plan for eliminating poverty and resolving the masses' basic  food and clothing problems by the year 2000 is a systems  engineering project involving economic activities of financial,  banking, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, industrial,  and commercial sectors as well as operations of departments in  charge of culture, education, public health, and planned  parenthood. Thus, the government must have an overall plan and  make comprehensive arrangements. He pointed out: Whether this  plan can be accomplished according to schedule so that the basic  food and clothing problems in impoverished areas can be resolved  is a specific target which leading cadres at various levels must  meet to see whether or not they really do things which are in  the interest of the people and whether or not they care for the  plight of the people. When we judge the performance of a  province, a region, or a city, we cannot simply look at its  economic growth, we must also examine how good the results are,  how fast the people's living conditions have been improved, and  how the basic food and clothing problems in impoverished areas  have been resolved. Leading comrades at various levels should  not only pay attention to developed areas, but more importantly,  we must show concern for the problems of the people in  poverty-stricken areas. In accordance with the plan to  eliminate poverty in poverty-stricken areas by the year 2000,  all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must draw  up their individual plans. Moreover, they must check their  progress and performance every year. By no means should efforts  be slackened in the least. All government departments must  continue to consider the fulfilment of aid-the-poor  developmental programs as their own responsibility and draw up  their respective aid-the-poor programs in accordance with the  plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000.    Present at today's meeting were persons in charge of  governments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions; and persons in charge of relevant central departments  and committees.

Peruvian officials in Paris are lobbying representatives from 10 industrialised countries and multilateral organisations with the message that the heaviest costs of the country's stabilisation and structural adjustment programme, applied since 1990, have fallen upon Peru's poorest. Over 12m Peruvians (53 per cent of the population) are now classified as in 'critical' poverty. In some rural areas, that percentage is higher. The infant mortality rate, at 82 per 1,000 kive births, is the third highest in Latin America, behind only Bolivia and Haiti; 49 per cent of Peruvian children under the age of five are suffering malnutrition, and 9,000 a year die of it. In many rural areas, only 20 per cent of houses have piped water and sewage. All this has fuelled disease, particularly the recent cholera epidemic. Current poverty allev-iation efforts involve a social fund known as Foncodes. It finances small infrastructure projects, mostly for drinking water and sewage installations, and for building simple classrooms and health posts in outlying communities. With Peru's economy now on a more even keel, the government of President Alberto Fujimori is budgeting between 1 and 1.5 per cent of annual gross domestic product for poverty alleviation. Foncodes is planned to receive the equivalent of Dollars 500m between now and 1995 - Dollars 200m from the treasury, Dollars 200m in multilateral credits and Dollars 100m in donations. Peru moved a step nearer its target of a single, 15 per cent import tariff last week with cuts in duties on a range of luxury goods from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. About 97 per cent of all imports now enter Peru at 15 per cent. The move was largely aimed at curbing continued high levels of smuggling. Once sales and luxury tax is added to the 15 per cent import duty, total tax may reach 60 per cent, making smuggling attractive.   Countries:-  PEZ  Peru, South America.

In 1990 27.7 million Indonesians (15.08  percent) were living below the poverty line; according to a 1993  National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), this figure has dropped  to 25.9 million people (13.67 percent).    Minister of State for National Development Planning/Chairman  of BAPPENAS [National Planning Board] Ginandjar Kartasasmita,  Minister of State/State Secretary Moerdiono, Deputy Chairman of  BAPPENAS Rahardi Ramelan and Deputy Chairman of the Central  Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Sugito reported the results of the  1993 SUSENAS to President Suharto at the president's office in  Jakarta yesterday. The report also included preparations for  submitting the DIP [Approved Projects List], including REPELITA  VI [Sixth Five-Year Development Plan].    Ginandjar told the press that the decrease in the number of  people living below the poverty line or below the sufficiency  limit shows that development has resulted in fewer poor people,  in both absolute and relative terms.    The 1993 SUSENAS used new methods which are more accurate  and  broader and which had a lot of input from international  institutions, including the World Bank. ""The World Bank used to  criticize the way we made our calculations,"" he said. ""Now there  is a higher percentage of poor people in the villages than in  urban areas, whereas previously it was the opposite,"" Ginandjar  continued.    He also stressed that under the new way of calculating,  which  takes into consideration the pace of inflation and the price  index, the number of poor people, in the villages as well as in  the cities, has decreased in both absolute and relative terms.  ""So as we come to the end of the PJP I [First Long-Range  Development] the number of poor people has declined from the 70  million at the start of the New Order (about 60 percent) to 25.9  million (13.67 percent). This is a very satisfying figure,"" he  said.    Improved Method    Deputy Chairman of the BPS Sugito said that the method used  in 1993 for calculating the number and percentage of poor people  was an improvement over the method used in 1990.    He explained that the method had to be improved because  given  the developments that have taken place since REPELITA I there  are some commodities which the masses, even those of the lowest  class, had not consumed at that time but were being consumed a  lot now. Sugito said that formerly only 14 commodities were  consumed in urban areas and 12 in rural areas. Starting with  1993 and into the future 46 commodities will be used in the  nonfood commodities package. A distinction will be made between  rural and urban areas. The commodities will be the same, but the  patterns of consumption will differ.    For example, it turns out that expenditures for those 46  commodities are different for people in the lowest class in  rural and urban areas even though the commodities are the same.  The volume of consumption differs. For example, more meat is  consumed in the cities than in the villages.    Rice consumption is relatively higher in the cities since it  turns out that in the villages people consume corn, dried  cassava, yams, etc. as well as rice.    He said the number and percentage of poor people was  calculated by setting a sufficiency or poverty limit. The  figures used are SUSENAS's expenditure figures. The poverty  limit is calculated by adding the food sufficiency limit to the  nonfood sufficiency limit.    The food sufficiency limit used under the old method was  based on the minimum requirements for food in order to lead a  healthy life, i.e., the equivalent of 2,100 calories per capita  per day. The value of the food sufficiency limit was obtained by  calculating the rupiah value of 2,100 calories, without taking  into consideration the type of food commodities consumed.    Under the new method, the food sufficiency limit is  calculated by first determining the commodities package which  should be consumed by a person so that he can live a healthy  life, a caloric content of 2,100 calories. The BPS considers 52  food commodities representative of the consumption patterns of  lower-class people. The rupiah value of these 52 commodities is  defined as the food sufficiency limit.    Under the old method the nonfood sufficiency limit was  calculated by defining a number of nonfood commodities as the  commodities which should be consumed. A distinction was made in  the number of commodities in rural and urban figures, 14 for  urban areas and 12 for rural areas. This commodities package,  said the deputy chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics,  was felt to be increasingly unrepresentative of the consumption  patterns of our developing nation.    Under the new method the package of nonfood commodities  covers 46 commodities, undifferentiated for urban and rural  areas. So the difference in the value of the nonfood sufficiency  limit between the urban and rural areas may be due to a  difference in the volume and price of the commodities consumed.    The nonfood commodities were selected on the basis of the  weight given to each commodity in the consumption pattern of the  people, reflecting the quality, price and frequency [of the  commodities] which the people consume.    Results of the Calculations    The Deputy Director of the BPS said that under the new  method  the poverty line for urban areas in 1993 was 27,905 rupiahs,  which consists of a food sufficiency limit of 23,303 rupiahs and  a nonfood sufficiency limit of 4,602 rupiahs. The rural poverty  line was calculated at 18,244 rupiahs, which consists of a food  sufficiency limit of 15,576 rupiahs and a nonfood sufficiency  limit of 2,668 rupiahs.    He also explained that based on the new method there were  8.7  million poor people (13.45 percent) in urban areas in 1993 and  17.2 million (13.79 percent) in rural areas. The number of poor  people thus totaled 25.9 million (13.67 percent) in 1993. Under  the old method the total number of poor people was 25.5 million,  9.1 million (14.20 percent) in urban areas and 16.4 million  (13.13 percent) in rural areas. The number and percentage of  poor people under the new method was thus not much different  from the figures obtained under the old method.    Under the new method, the number and percentage of poor  people in rural areas was slightly higher than under the old  method. On the other hand, the number and percentage of poor  people in urban areas was lower than under the old method. This  difference was caused, in part, by the fact that under the new  method the nonfood sufficiency limit for rural areas was higher  than under the old method, i.e., 2,668 rupiahs compared to 1,149  rupiahs. The figures for the poverty level and the number and  percentage of poor people at the provincial level in 1993 are  shown in the table.     "

Understanding How Aged Beneficiaries Become Poor       Although poverty rates among the aged have declined substantially over the last 30 years, there are still some troublesome problems and poverty among aged women is a particular concern. Various legislative proposals have been made or discussed to improve the treatment of women under the Social Security program, including care-giving credits, increasing benefits at some age, eliminating the actuarial reduction for early benefit receipt at some age, modifying the Social Security special minimum benefit, and redesigning couple benefits in order to enhance survivor benefits. However, many of the proposals are not well targeted to the poor. Proposals for research are sought to increase our understanding of why aged beneficiaries, and especially aged women, become poor, which will improve our ability to form policy in this area.   Some of the key research questions are: To what extent is aged poverty a continuation of a lifetime of low income? To what extent is aged poverty a result of aged couples decumulating assets as they age? What are the economic effects of widowhood, including the extent to which sources of income are lost or reduced, and the extent to which high health care expenditures surrounding the death of a spouse are a major cause of high poverty rates among the aged who have become widowed? Is the type of social security benefit received (retired worker benefits, wife or widow benefits, worker benefits that are supplemented because of entitlement to a higher spouse or survivor benefit and those that are not, retirement benefits that were converted from a disability benefit at age 65 and those that were not) related to differing poverty rates in 1982, and are those patterns the same among beneficiaries 10 years later?

Changing Economic Status of Individuals With Disabilities and Their Families       We know that newly disabled individuals in 1982 were less well-off than newly retired individuals in terms of both income and assets. However, little or no research has been done to follow disabled individuals over time to determine whether they have particular problems maintaining an adequate standard of living. The well-being of many individuals with disabilities depends not only on their own income but also on the income and/or services provided by family members, such as the earnings of spouses, or help with activities of daily living that may mean the difference between living in the community and having to be institutionalized.

F. Low-Income Aged and Disabled Individuals        Section 9402 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X) and 1902(m) to establish an optional categorically needy eligibility group of aged and disabled individuals with incomes at or below the Federal poverty income level. Section 1902(m) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4118(p)(8) of OBRA '87 and section 301(e) of MCCA, describes individuals in this group as those who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled as determined under SSI, whose income does not exceed a standard established by the State that is set at a percentage (at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level, and whose resources do not exceed the maximum amount of resources allowed under SSI. If a State has a medically needy program with a more generous resource level, section 1902(m)(2)(B) allows a State to elect to use the medically needy resource level instead of the SSI resource level.    Between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989, States were permitted to provide eligibility to this optional group of low-income aged and disabled individuals only if they also provided Medicaid eligibility to the low-income group of pregnant women and infants under the provisions of section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 discussed earlier. Section 301(e)(2)(D) of MCCA removed the condition for providing eligibility to both groups, effective July 1, 1989.    Income eligibility for this optional group of aged and disabled individuals is based on a standard established at a level that is at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the size involved. The term ``family of the size involved,'' as used in section 1902(m)(2)(A), is not specifically defined in the statute. However, for this optional group of aged and disabled we believe that it would be appropriate to adopt for individuals and couples who seek eligibility under section 1902(m) of the Act the SSI program's distinction between eligible individuals and eligible couples, depending on whether the individual alone is eligible or both members of the couple are eligible under section 1902(m). Since the statute requires that income be determined using the principles of section 1612, which are SSI program rules, using SSI's individual and couple distinction as well as SSI's deeming rules enables States to have a clear understanding of the baseline for determining eligibility for members of this poverty level-related group. It also avoids potential conflicts with section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which could result if eligibility for this group were determined by pooling family income (if the family included individuals other than a husband and wife).    The SSI program determines eligibility for couples, or for individuals. If the SSI definition of a couple (i.e., the couple is married and they qualify for SSI benefits as an eligible couple) is not met, eligibility is determined on an individual basis. We propose to apply this principle to determine eligibility for the optional Medicaid aged and disabled group. If two individuals are married and are both eligible under section 1902(m), both spouses will be considered a couple even if only one spouse applied for medical assistance and their income will be compared to the Federal poverty level for a family of two. If both individuals in a family are not eligible as a couple under section 1902(m), their eligibility will be determined as individuals, with their incomes being compared to the poverty level for an individual, and deeming of income and resources from responsible family members using SSI deeming methodologies.

By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from  Washington.      The most-scrutinized numbers published by the Census Bureau are the annual  poverty and income statistics. In the 1980s, they have become a political  battleground. On the one side are those (mainly Democrats) who contend that we  face economic stagnation and growing inequality between rich and poor. On the  other are those (mainly Republicans) who claim that living standards are  steadily rising and that all is well. There ought to be a truce. The latest  census report proves both sides half right.    What the report shows is this: The 1980s have not been a period of joyless  prosperity, whose benefits have gone only to the filthy rich. But stubborn  poverty persists in the midst of plenty -- indeed, in the midst of increasing  plenty. Let me give you some numbers.    Since 1979, average household income ($34,017 in 1988) has risen about 10%  after adjusting for inflation. The gain since 1967 is roughly one-third. This  is almost identical to the increase in productivity (output per hour worked).    Higher living standards reflect our ability to produce. The more we produce  (cars, airline service or whatever), the more we can consume. For married  couples, average incomes ($42,801 in 1988) have increased 15% since 1980 and  nearly 40% since 1967. This is not stagnation.    But while most households are moving up, many low-income Americans have hardly  made any progress. In 1980, households with income of less than $10,000 were  18.7% of the total. In 1988, they were still 17%. (Again, all figures are  adjusted for inflation and are stated in today's dollars.) It's possible to  choose a variety of definitions of poverty. The conclusion remains the same:  The poor are being left further behind.    It's not only that the gap between the rich and poor is growing. The gap is  growing between the poor and the majority of Americans who are, broadly  speaking, in the mainstream.    What's depressing, then, is that the poverty trends remain unchanged. ""A rising  tide lifts all boats"" is one of Americans' favorite economic faiths.  Translation: Prosperity will make everyone better off. But this hasn't  happened. Some possible explanations make the problem look less daunting.  Others make it look virtually insoluble. Consider:    Family breakdown -- Since 1967, the proportion of households headed by a woman,  usually with children, has risen from 8.4% to 11.7% of the total. These  households have low incomes and nearly two-fifths of them fall beneath the  government's official poverty line. The situation is the same, though far less  extreme, for men heading households with children alone. Since 1967, they've  risen from about 1.8% to 3.1% of the total.    Immigration -- The influx of poor Latinos and other immigrants has increased  poverty and tended to reduce average incomes. Since 1980, the number of Latino  households has risen by about 50%; the rise in Latino households represented  one-fifth of the increase of all households in the1980s. The open question is  whether the new immigrants will permanently enlarge the poverty pool or, after  a while, climb up the income and social ladder.    Falling earnings of low-skilled workers -- By one theory, the poor earnings of  many men fosters family breakdown, because they aren't attractive husbands or  cannot hold a family together. In 1973, a man 25 to 34 with a high school  diploma earned 82% of what a college graduate of the same age did. By 1987, the  high school graduate's earnings averaged 72% of the college graduate's. No one  knows whether this slippage reflects a demand for higher skills, a cheapening  of a high school diploma, the impact of foreign competition . . . or something  else entirely.    The trouble with the great debate about general living standards is that it  distracts attention from what, if anything, government can do to reduce  poverty. There are real and important differences between liberals and  conservatives on this question. But that's where the argument ought to be  focused, rather than on the issues of whether living standards are declining.  This debate is mainly political theater masquerading as a serious inquiry.  Democrats want to stigmatize the economy. Republicans want to glamorize it.  Both stereotypes are misleading.    What's involved is psychology as much as economics. Between World War II and  the late 1960s, incomes and living standards rose so dramatically that  Americans came to expect rapid and constant improvement as preordained. It  wasn't. The subsequent slowdown is just that -- a slowdown. Some groups have  struggled more than others. Younger baby boomers have suffered generational  congestion. Their relative incomes have been depressed. But most Americans can  still expect a gradual rise in living standards. It's neither calamitous nor  glorious.

Section C. Statement of Work  Part I. Background      The United States is the only industrialized nation that lacks a comprehensive and coherent system to help its youth acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities, and information about the labor market necessary to make an effective transition from school to career-oriented work. Three-fourths of America's high school students do not attain four-year college degrees. Many of them do not possess the basic academic and occupational skills necessary for entry into high-skill, high-wage careers in the changing workplace or to pursue further education.  In order to create a national framework for high-quality, statewide school-to-work transition systems that enable young Americans to identify and navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace, the Secretaries of Education and Labor have developed the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Under this initiative, which is based on the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994,'' the Departments of Education and Labor are using current legislative authority in fiscal year 1994 to begin the development and implementation of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems in every State.  Helping youth who reside or attend school in impoverished rural and urban communities navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace will require extraordinary efforts due to the distinctive needs and limited resources in such areas. Within high poverty areas, existing family and community resources are often severely strained; traditional educational experiences in the schools fail to motivate many students to learn; high rates of joblessness and dependency exist among adults, restricting the number of positive role models; and access to high-skill, high-wage jobs and postsecondary education and training is severely limited. In order to permit a concentration of resources to address such barriers affecting the educational and training experiences of youth in high poverty areas, the Departments are conducting the competition announced in this notice to award grants to local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in urban or rural high poverty areas to develop and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives that meet the requirements established in the notice.  The overall purpose of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is to support the development and initial stages of implementation of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems within which local partnerships will apply to the State for funds to develop programs. Under the initiative, each State is expected to receive a State Implementation Grant, described below in ``Grant Program Schedule,'' under which the State will be required to expand the State's School-to-Work Opportunities system over time to cover all geographic areas of the State, including those with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. However, through separate competitions, local partnerships_including those serving youth who reside or attend school in a high poverty area_may apply directly to the Federal Government.  It is expected that the States will benefit from the experiences of the local partnerships and may incorporate successful elements of local initiatives into their statewide systems. Local and State programs may be developed by enhancing existing programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, youth apprenticeship, cooperative education, school-to-apprenticeship, and business-education compacts. However, the purpose of funding under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is not simply to augment existing programs, but rather to build statewide systems that provide opportunities for all students to achieve the benefits and outcomes of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Building comprehensive systems will likely involve a combination of enhancing existing programs, establishing linkages among them, and developing an effective framework that connects both existing and new programs in a meaningful way.  Youth in urban and rural high poverty areas may require academic and needs assessments prior to participation in School-to-Work Opportunities programs so that any skill deficiencies may be identified and elevated to grade-level performance and any participation barriers may be alleviated. Due to such additional measures that may need to be taken prior to local program implementation in a high poverty area and to the often high incidence of at-risk youth in such areas, achieving school-to-work objectives in a high poverty area may take more time, innovation, and resources than in those local areas where the incidence of high poverty is not so concentrated. Although the Departments recognize this,     the expected outcomes for all local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives are the same.     In addition, since the overall purpose of funding under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is to build statewide systems, a local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas will be required to consult with the State within which it is located on the State's plans for creating a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system, as well as consult eventually with the local partnership in the State-designated geographic area within which it is located. The purpose of such consultations is to assure that School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives funded under this notice meet the same high standards and lead to the same outcomes as other School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives throughout the State.

Chien, replying to an interpellation by Democratic  Progressive Party legislator Parris Chang, said the government  had foreseen as long as three and a half years ago that drastic  political changes would occur in South Africa, even though  bilateral ties with the white-ruled government at that time were  solid.    ""We indeed had promised a U.S.$60 million loan to help South  Africa finance a farming development project during F.W. De  Klerk's tenure as the president, but the loan has not yet been  given,"" Chien said.    The loan proposal was raised again when President Li  Teng-hui  visited South Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's presidential  inauguration on May 10, Chien said, adding that both countries  may re-start negotiations on the loan.    Chien emphasized that Li had not offered any new loans to  South Africa during his visit, but did agree to help South  Africa implement a vocational-training project. ""South Africa  will send people here to see for themselves how job-training  projects are implemented,"" Chien said.    He added that the ROC has agreed to share with South Africa  its successful experience in helping military personnel  assimilate into society after retirement.    Many legislators here are against any new economic aid to  South Africa on grounds that the Nelson Mandela-led African  National Congress, which now rules the new government, has  maintained close ties with Beijing for many years, and may  eventually shift diplomatic recognition away from Taipei.    On the contrary, though, Li's visit, previously perceived as  a last-ditch effort by Taiwan to salvage its relationship with  South Africa, seems to have paid off handsomely. A confident  Li, shortly after a meeting with Mandela, told a group of  Chinese and representatives of Taiwan-owned companies in South  Africa on May 11 that the bilateral ties between the two  countries are strong and steady.    South Africa is the largest country of the 29 with which the  ROC maintains official diplomatic ties.     "

Resource Standard         The statute allows States, at their option, to apply a   resource standard to the low-income eligibility groups of   pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1)   of the Act. Section 9401 of OBRA '86 establishes a floor   for the resource standard that is a specific and objective   standard. If a State chooses to apply a resource standard,   the standard may be no more restrictive than that applied   under SSI for pregnant women, and than that applied under   AFDC, for infants and children. (If Guam, Puerto Rico, and   the Virgin Islands elect to apply a resource standard, that   standard for pregnant women may be no more restrictive than   that applied under SSI under section 1613 of the Act. This   is because the reference to the resource standard for   pregnant women in the statute is to the standard that is   applied under title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to the   standard that is applied under the State plan program under   title XVI.)     The amendments regarding the different treatment of   income and resources for the mandatory and optional groups   of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children do not   require or permit this different treatment to be applied to   other Medicaid eligibility groups under the comparability   provisions of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act.         3. Applicability for States With Section 1115 Waivers and   for Territories         Section 302(c) of MCCA struck the original section   1902(1)(4)(A) of the Act and section 302(d) of MCCA added a   new section 1902(1)(4)(A). Under the new section   1902(1)(4)(A), as amended by section 6401 of OBRA '89 and   section 4601 of OBRA '90, States that are providing Medicaid   under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act must   provide mandatory categorically needy eligibility to   pregnant women and infants under age 1 with incomes at or   below 133 percent of the poverty level under section   1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), children age 1 but under age 6 with   incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level under   section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) and children who have attained   age 6 but are under age 19 with incomes at or below 100   percent of the poverty level under section   1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) in the same manner as other States.   States operating under a waiver granted under section 1115   of the Act must (as all other States must) cover the   mandatory groups at higher levels if they have already   chosen to use those higher levels. However, Guam, Puerto   Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern   Mariana Islands retain the option of providing Medicaid to   the otherwise mandatory groups of low-income pregnant women,   infants, and children. The Territories may establish   separate or identical income standards for pregnant women   and infants at any percentage of the poverty level at or   below 185 percent. However, if a Territory chooses to cover   children from age 1 up to age 6, it must cover all such   children with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty   level. Also, if a Territory chooses to cover children born   after September 30, 1983 who have attained age 6 but are   under age 19, it must cover all such children with incomes   at or below 100 percent of the poverty level.         4.

The amended provision (under clause   (VII) following what is currently paragraph (F) of section   1902(a)(10)) provides that the services that are available   to pregnant women under the section 1902(l) low-income   eligibility groups are limited to services relating to   pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, family planning,   and postpartum services) and to other conditions that may   complicate pregnancy. (Section 4101(e)(1) of OBRA '87   expanded services related to pregnancy to include ``family   planning.'')     The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act   (COBRA), Public Law 99272, enacted an earlier comparability   of services requirement for all pregnant women covered under   the State plan. This requirement appears under clause (V)   following what is currently paragraph (F) of section   1902(a)(10). This provision states that if a State makes   available ``services relating to pregnancy (including   prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services) or to any other   condition which may complicate pregnancy,'' the State is not   required to provide these services to any other individual,   except pregnant women, covered under the plan. The State   must provide its pregnancy-related services and services for   any other condition that may complicate pregnancy, in the   same amount, duration, and scope, to all pregnant women   covered under the State plan, including pregnant women whose   pregnancy is not the basis for their Medicaid eligibility   (e.g., those receiving AFDC or SSI).

He made a statement to this effect when he presided  over the ceremony at which the National Council Against Poverty  was established.    The organization, which held its first meeting on 24 May, is  made up of representatives of different national groups with  experience in the field of social development. The government's  intention was to bring together persons coming from the most  representative areas of national life, both from the government  as well as from the opposition, including social organizations,  employers and workers, churches, and nongovernmental bodies. The  names of the members of the council speak for themselves:  Alberto Echegaray, president; Benito Baranda, executive  secretary; Gonzalo de la Maza; Claudio Di Girolamo; Roberto  Fantuzzi; Bishop Erasmo Farfan; Jose Antonio Guzman; Juan Pablo  Illanes; Fernando Leniz; Haidee Lopez; Patricia Matte; Manfred  Max-Neef; Ana Maria Medioli; Eugenio Ortega; Maria Rozas;  Alberto Undurraga; Sara Vasquez; Humberto Vega; Monsignor Manuel  Camilo Vial; and Jose Zavala.    According to the decree which approved its establishment,  the  objective of this council is to coordinate the participation of  different social groups in answering the national challenge to  overcome poverty; to propose action, programs, and strategies to  make the social policy of the state more coherent in this sense;  to advise the president and the interministerial, social  committee; to propose ways of reducing poverty at the regional  level; and to contribute to the program that Chile will present  to the Social Development Summit Meeting of the United Nations.    President Frei was the only speaker at the ceremony. In his  speech he said: ""From this place we must be able to call on the  conscience of all Chileans so that the task of wiping out  extreme poverty will not just be a government policy but the  fundamental concern of the nation."" He recalled that the basic  priority of his administration is to concentrate its efforts on  the nine percent of the population, or about 1.2 million  Chileans, ""who live under subhuman conditions in the most  extreme poverty and destitution.""    At the same time he added that he will fight to raise  minimum  wages and to improve living conditions among some three million  people who live under precarious conditions.    As to where the emphasis will be placed in the national  program to overcome poverty, President Frei pointed out that  efforts will be concentrated on specific programs aimed at  infants, senior citizens who lack resources, young people,  women, urban and rural small businessmen, farmers, the  indigenous peoples, and the handicapped.    He stated: ""In short the program for overcoming poverty will  emphasize the development of backward sectors and will ensure  better opportunities for the most vulnerable groups of society.""    He emphasized that he hopes to see that an additional public  effort is made through the ""contributions and the generous  initiatives of employers, workers, academic personalities,  church leaders, and representatives of nongovernmental  organizations, who can design a program as ambitious or even  more so than what the government will do.""    For his part Luis Maira, minister of planning and  cooperation, announced that within the next two weeks the  interministerial social committee will unveil the national  program for abolishing poverty in the budget of 1994 and the  criteria for the preparation of the budget for 1995. He said:  ""These criteria are going to redirect public expenditures and  social priorities toward the poorest groups among the people,  such as the regions and territories which now have the greatest  cumulative problems.""    The minister also said that during the second half of June a  meeting will be held of all senior administrative officials,  called by minister of the interior German Correa, to discuss the  implementation of the plan at the national level.

Tremendous achievements have been made in the work  since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee. In particular, since reform and opening up, the  party and government have taken various measures to strengthen  work for helping the poor. For example, funds have been  increased and traditional means of helping the poor have been  readjusted and improved to change the nature of such work from a  relief to a development orientation.    It has been proven in practice that implementing  development-oriented work for aiding the poor by taking into  account market demand, relying on scientific and technological  progress, as well as developing and utilizing resources of  impoverished areas to promote commodity production, not only can  solve the problem of inadequate supplies of food and clothing,  but can also help get rid of poverty and encourage prosperity.  Currently, the measures have fairly rapidly changed the outlook  of a considerable number of long impoverished areas.    However, as China is a fairly large country with different  local situations and unbalanced development, progress in some  areas is still fairly slow and a number of people have yet to be  extricated from poverty. In particular, a small number of  people in especially poor areas are still living under very  difficult conditions.    Recently, the State Council formulated a program aimed at  extricating 80 million people from poverty in seven years, and  declared a final war against poverty. During the ongoing two  sessions [the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference National Committee], this  station reporter Yang Fan interviewed State Councillor Chen  Junsheng, head of the State Council's Leading Group for the  Economic Development of Impoverished Areas.    Yang Fan: ""Mr Chen, I am a reporter from the China National  Radio. One of our government's major tasks this year is to help  impoverished people. Can you tell us what the government's  tasks are in this regard?""    Chen Junsheng: ""The goal of our program for aiding the poor  is to extricate 80 million people from poverty in seven years.  We will help them solve the problem of inadequate food and  clothing. We will help them get rid of poverty and ultimately  become prosperous and achieve a comfortable standard of living.  We should not wait until the next century, but must accomplish  this task within the present century.""     "

""Today Africa stands at the door of total  political liberation as apartheid is about to be relegated to  the ignominy of history"", the organisation's secretary general,  Salim Ahmed Salim said.    Addressing the 59th session of the OAU Council of Ministers  which began in Addis Ababa Monday, Salim said at a time when  South Africa was undergoing fundamental transformation, Africa  which had invested so much energy and resources in support of  the liberation movements must make its presence felt in that  country.    He told the foreign ministers that Africa had a  responsibility to South Africa and must sustain interest and  keep the momentum of support to the on-going process in order to  accomplish the objectives it set for itself in the country.    ""Today, when we are walking the final mile and we are about  to see the results of years of struggle and sacrifice, we owe it  to ourselves and the people of South Africa not to relax our  vigilance or allow our enthusiasm to diminish"", he said. The  end of apartheid, Salim stressed, marked not only the closing of  one of the saddest chapters in the history of Africa, but also  the beginning of a new challenge of economic cooperation in the  southern African sub- region and Africa as a whole. ""We now need  to see how the immense potential which exists in South Africa in  terms of capital, resources and know-how, can interface with  those found in the rest of the continent, to forge an economic  partnership which can propel the continent to new heights of  growth and development"". Salim said for Africa to successfully  monitor the forth-coming South Africa elections, ""we need to be  there, in good time and in sufficient numbers, to support the  process and to encourage our brothers and sisters"". He said  that concerted action on the part of African countries would  make a difference similar to the success they achieved during  the Namibian election. Africa must give some material  assistance to the liberation movements to enable them compete  against a government ""endowed with almost unlimited resources  and the advantage of incumbency"", he added. The OAU scribe  urged African states to urgently contribute to the election fund  established at the OAU summit in Cairo in 1993 to support the  liberation movements.     "

If you go far enough to the left in American politics, you may bump into the  right, and there you will find that America is on the verge of a new war on  poverty.

Williams, a  black, has been poor most of her life. She still lives in the inner-city  Milwaukee neighborhood where she raised four children, spent some time on  welfare and finally, 20 years after graduating from high school, got her  college degree.    A few weeks ago, Williams took on the entire liberal Establishment of Wisconsin  by authoring a bill that would give poor parents in Milwaukee tuition vouchers  for their children. Each family that qualified would receive $2,500 per child,  which would be subtracted from the public school system's budget. The vouchers  could be used at any city school -- public or private.    To the chagrin of the liberals, a coalition of Republicans and conservative  Democrats made Williams' bill the law.    Williams did not discover the voucher idea by reading tracts churned out by  conservative think tanks. She simply concluded that when black parents wanted  education for their children, the power structure gave them integration.

Like  Williams, Gray is a former welfare mother. She had the first of her five  children at age 14 and has lived in public housing for much of her life. She is  a leader in the movement to allow residents of public housing projects to buy  their own apartments. To do this, she had to get a federal law changed and, in  so doing, she hooked up with a conservative -- Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development Jack Kemp.    Like tuition vouchers, tenant ownership of public housing used to be a  conservative idea. But in the hands of Gray and Williams, ideas that were  conservative become something else entirely. Gray taught Kemp a thing or two  about public housing; the bill that permits tenants to buy public housing  contains provisions that would renovate the properties before sale and would  reserve the properties for resale to moderate-income people. Thus, the  conservative notion of privatization became a vehicle for empowerment.    In the hands of Williams, vouchers, which in the classic conservative version  subsidized rich whites in private schools, were limited to families with  incomes up to 175% of the poverty level, thus giving poor parents some of the  choice that middle-class parents have. Says Gray, ""Our theme is empowerment,  empowerment of the people . . . .""    How well can poor people make choices for themselves? ""Low-income black  families,"" said Williams, ""know that the only way out is education . . . They  (bureaucrats) honestly believe that poor families can't make decisions.""    For both Williams and Gray, the enemy is not necessarily the right or the left;  it is the welfare bureaucracy -- a group referred to by Williams as ""the  poverty industry pimps -- the people in the middle."" Both women complained that  government money was going to the bureaucrats, not poor people.    Conservatives have been quick to celebrate and adapt to this new war on  poverty. Stuart Butler, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, has outlined a  poverty strategy in the National Review: Reach an accommodation on civil  rights, adopt a strategy of empowerment, attack the poverty industry and allow  states to be the innovators of antipoverty policy.    ""We are all registered Democrats,"" responds Gray, ""but we work very closely  with Republicans because they're the ones that seem to understand that we do  not want to stay a poor and permanent underclass.""    Social policy is an inexact science. Some pieces of the original war on poverty  were spectacular successes; others weren't. But the new effort has to contend  with a creation of the original -- an entrenched establishment of middle-class  people whose livelihood depends on the continuation of certain programs  regardless of their effectiveness.    Polly Williams laughs at the idea that her voucher bill for 1,000 poor pupils  is a threat to the public school system, but it is, she admits, a warning.

0,FT922-8871 ,"FT922-8871 _AN-CEKAUACXFT 920511   FT  11 MAY 92 / Mr Preston makes poverty his judge      By MICHAEL PROWSE   Suppose you are a middle-ranking World Bank official trying to put together a lending programme for a Third World country. What kind of loan will most enhance your promotion prospects? Judging from an unusually frank operational directive issued today by Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, the answer is a loan designed explicitly to reduce poverty. In a foreword to the directive, which is being distributed to Bank offices throughout the world, Mr Preston states: 'Sustainable poverty reduction is the overarching objective of the World Bank. It is the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured.' Mr Preston was under no obligation to make such a strong pledge. The idea of putting greater stress on poverty originated with his predecessor, Mr Barber Conable. If Mr Preston, who has spent his entire career on Wall Street, had been unsympathetic to this shift in Bank priorities, he could have let the Conable initiative quietly lapse. Instead, he is serving notice of a cultural revolution: staff who expect to be upwardly mobile during his presidency had better make poverty reduction their top priority. The sudden emphasis on poverty may seem rather confusing. After all, the Bank has been promoting economic development for more than four decades; surely this means that poverty alleviation has always been its 'overarching objective'. Alas, this is far from the case. In its first few decades, the Bank was addicted to project lending. It supported investments that had high rates of return, but made no special effort to locate them in areas of poverty or to ensure that the worst-off groups benefited. In the 1970s, it became aware that the poorest often gained little from general economic development, but it lacked a comprehensive strategy for tackling poverty. During the Reagan-Thatcher years, poverty took a back seat; the Bank swam with the ideological current, making the promotion of economic efficiency and growth its primary goal. As today's directive openly concedes: 'In the early 1980s, policy-based adjustment lending overshadowed the Bank's poverty reduction objectives.' Some conservative economists still argue that the Bank should strive mainly to promote growth, claiming that the poor will benefit from 'trickle down' effects. Today's leading capitalist economies grew rapidly, the argument runs, precisely because a low priority was initially placed on alleviating poverty. But would the Industrial Revolution really have been aborted if Victorian mill owners had cared about poverty? Modern research suggests not. By today's standards, the UK's Industrial Revolution was rather inefficient. Starting in 1780, the UK took 58 years to double its per capita income. In modern times, South Korea did the same in just 11 years. The acceleration partly reflects access to modern technology. But social policy also plays a role. If South Korea had paid as little attention to the education and health care of workers as Britain did in the 19th century, it would have developed less rapidly. By building 'human capital', poverty alleviation adds to, rather than subtracts from, a country's growth potential. The Bank's theoretical strategy for reducing poverty is well known. It consists of a 'two-pronged' approach: economic reforms to promote labour-intensive growth supported by improved social services to allow the poor to take full advantage of income-earning opportunities. The importance of today's directive is to ensure that the crucial second prong is implemented. As Mr Sven Sandstrom, one of Mr Preston's top aides, warned in a briefing, too often sensible policies 'are not followed through with sufficient vigour to have a significant impact'. The first important reform mandated by today's directive is a requirement that Bank officials undertake comprehensive poverty assessments in all client countries. No, you have not misread that sentence. For more than 40 years the Bank has tried to promote development without a road map - without a clear understanding of the extent and nature of poverty in the Third World. Poverty assessments will include profiles of the poor, details of existing safety nets, and summaries of the impact on poverty of existing government spending and regulatory policies. The second important reform is a commitment to make loans conditional on social justice as well as economic efficiency. The directive states that the volume of loans should be linked to the strength of a country's efforts to reduce poverty. Or as Mr Preston's press release puts it: 'Stronger government commitment to poverty reduction warrants greater support; conversely weaker commitment to poverty reduction warrants less support.' The release also says the composition of lending will be tailored to support local efforts to reduce poverty. Mr Preston's directive is an endorsement of Asian development strategies, which have generally placed considerable stress on social services. It makes a great deal of sense. But it will succeed only if pursued with firmness and tact. If 'social conditionality' is to take hold in the 1990s, attitudes will have to change fundamentally, both within developing countries and the Bank. Mr Preston, however, has left no doubt of the criterion by which he expects to be judged.  The Financial Times   London Page 34  "

Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; and (2) for fiscal year 1995 and beyond, it will be funded under the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' However, since programs begun in 1994 will be continued in fiscal year 1995 and beyond, the Departments have modeled the proposed grant program, to the extent possible, upon the recent legislation. The funds will be made available through a grants program administered cooperatively by the Department of Education and the Department of Labor that consists of_    (a) State Development Grants, which have been awarded to each State for developing a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities plan;    (b) State Implementation Grants, awarded competitively to States that can demonstrate substantial ability to begin full-scale operations and implement the Statewide plan (the first round of State Implementation Grants are expected to be announced in June, 1994);    (c) Local Partnership Grants, awarded competitively to localities that are prepared to implement School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives (the first round of Local Partnership Grants are expected to be announced in early July, 1994);    (d)     Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants, as announced in this notice, awarded competitively to local partnerships to support the development and implementation of School-to-Work Opportunities programs in urban and rural areas of high poverty;     and    (e) Grants for Territories and for Native American programs, to support School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in the territories and for Indian youth, respectively.    Local partnerships are eligible for direct Federal funding to implement programs throughout their entire local area and in high poverty areas, through separate competitions, in the current program year. The intent of this funding strategy is to begin implementation of local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives in ``leading edge'' communities and to provide supplemental resources to selected local partnerships serving youth residing or attending school in high poverty areas, even if the States in which they are located are still in the systems development phase. This will allow a State in the development phase to learn from innovative local partnerships in their own State and in others and will build incentives for States and localities to work together to maximize funding within the State. Local partnerships may apply for or request extensions of Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants serving high poverty areas even if they receive School-to-Work Opportunities funding through State grants or through direct Federal funding. The Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants are in addition to other funds for which the local partnership may be eligible.    A local partnership applying for a Urban/Rural Opportunities grant under this competition should consult with the State at the earliest possible time. These consultations will permit local initiatives to be designed so that they are, or will be, consistent with State plans for a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system. The current funding strategy could result in a State, a local partnership, and a local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in a high poverty area each receiving a competitive implementation grant award in 1994. Therefore, the possibility exists that an Urban/Rural Opportunities Grant may be awarded to a partnership serving youth residing or attending school in a high poverty area that is located within the jurisdiction or a larger local partnership and within a State that each receive Implementation Grants. Thus, consultation and coordination among the grantees are essential to the creation of a comprehensive statewide system that provides opportunities for all students to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives that meet the same high standards.        Part II. Program Description        a. Objectives        The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative provides for a substantial degree of State and local flexibility and experimentation, but all State systems and individual local initiatives will share several common features and basic program components as required by the ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' A local School-to-Work Opportunities initiative under this competition must include the following common features and basic program components:    1.

0,FT934-3717 ,"FT934-3717 _AN-DLHC7AAYFT 931208   FT  08 DEC 93 / Chile finds growth fights poverty: Politicians put poor on top of the agenda      By DAVID PILLING   From La Pintana, a desperately poor municipality in south Santiago, the Chilean economic miracle seems worlds away. Most of La Pintana's inhabitants, many forcibly relocated from more prosperous neighbourhoods during the military regime, live in rows of cramped, squalid government housing, often looking out on unlit, unpaved streets plagued with crime. La Pintana's 170,000 inhabitants have no hospital and only one secondary school. More than half live below the poverty line. According to the mayor, Mr Jaime Pavez, residents are four times less likely to have regular work than their fellow Chileans. They are nearly 200 times less likely to own a telephone. In spite of a decade of exceptional national growth, a third of Chileans still find themselves below the poverty threshold, while nearly one in 10 lives in extreme poverty. Huge discrepancies between rich and poor, long existent in Chile, are becoming more obvious in a country whose rapid growth has delivered the trappings of a consumerist, western lifestyle to large sections of the population. So much so that both left and right-wing candidates in the presidential election this weekend have put the issue of Chile's poor at the top of their agenda. Mr Eduardo Frei, the Concertacion coalition candidate widely expected to win the presidency, has pledged to eradicate poverty within six years. Although there is much to be done, Mr Frei says, the centre-left coalition has made considerable inroads during its four-year term. According to official figures, by November 1992 the percentage of people living in poverty had shrunk to 32.7 from 40.1 two years earlier and 44.4 in 1987. Given current growth rates, that figure should drop further to about 29 per cent by next March, according to Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister. 'Essentially, in 1987 you had 5.5m living below the poverty line and by the end of this administration it will be 3.8m. I think that's pretty impressive.' Mr Foxley also cites data showing that people in abject poverty - defined as those unable to afford basic food requirements - fell to 9 per cent in 1990 from 13.8 per cent two years earlier, and 16.8 per cent in 1987. Such progress, Mr Foxley says, has been the result of economic expansion (which has averaged 6.3 per cent over four years), the rapid creation of jobs, as well as specific policies to target Chile's poorest. Since 1990, the government has raised the minimum wage by '30 per cent in real terms', while family allowances have seen a 'big expansion'. Mr Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, agrees that there have been significant improvements. 'The recuperation that you are seeing now in part reflects the fact that, when this economy grows, you can pull people out of poverty in a relatively short time,' he says. 'In other countries you can pour a lot of money in, but you are unlikely to see results for a generation. The type of poverty you have here is qualitatively different from that found, for example, in Peru or Bolivia. The levels of education, infant mortality, health and so forth are quite different. 'In Chile the workforce is sufficiently skilled to take up opportunities as they arise. They are trainable. In many other Latin American countries, there comes a point where this is not true.' The creation of jobs is thus the over-riding factor, he says. Official figures show unemployment continuing to fall sharply. The number of jobless is 4.5 per cent, against 6.5 per cent in 1990 and 20 per cent in 1982. Although some observers question the accuracy of government jobs statistics, few disagree with Mr Rosenthal's belief that unemployment has 'clearly come down terrifically', nor with his assessment that wages at the lower end of the scale have risen markedly. According to Prealc, the world employment programme, Chile has bucked the regional trend by creating not only more, but 'better quality' jobs. Since 1985, the proportion of Chileans with low-paid, unstable work has steadily declined. Only 50 per cent of Chileans are self-employed or work for small businesses against 56 per cent in Mexico and 60 per cent in Colombia. 'Real salaries in Chile have shown a sustained recuperation since 1988,' Prealc's report says. 'Despite this, minimum wages are still below those of 1980.' The group estimates real minimum wages at 83.4 per cent of 1980 levels, up from 63.4 per cent in 1985. Mr Rosenthal says the government has struck the right balance between specific measures aimed at tackling poverty and policies intended to stimulate economic growth and job creation generally. 'If we were asked to grade the government in this area we would give them high marks. They seem to have got it about right.' From La Pintana, it is less easy to be sanguine. Mr Pavez feels the government has not done enough to help 'marginalised communities'. He is particularly aggrieved at the allocation of local taxes which, he says, favours wealthier municipalities. 'For example, in Las Condes (one of Santiago's richest districts) you have well-equipped public health facilities even though most people go to private clinics. Here, where there is much greater need, we don't even have a hospital.' Government housing too, he says, often fails to meet basic standards. He recently refused to attend a ceremony in his municipality intended to welcome residents to their new homes. 'Some houses didn't even have floors or staircases,' he says. 'I didn't go because I couldn't say 'welcome' - it would have been false.' Mr Pavez says districts such as La Pintana need what he calls 'discriminatory decentralisation', the channeling of funds from wealthier districts to poorer ones. In the absence of the necessary resources, he says, it will prove almost impossible to 'cut the vicious cycle of poverty. Without this we won't be able to incorporate our people into the world outside - the world of the Chilean miracle.'   Countries:-  CLZ  Chile, South America.

At  the report meeting, a videotape on the situation in Mashan and  Yaoshan was shown.

The goal was forwarded in a recent plan of the provincial  government, corresponding to a similar plan newly made public by  the central government.    According to the plan, the province will inject nine million  yuan every year into poverty-relief projects in the six poorest  counties in addition to funds from the central government for  the 28 poorest counties in the province.    Though painstaking efforts over the past eight years have  reduced the province's impoverished population from 13 million  to 7.6 million, the figure still accounts for one tenth of the  national total, the officials admitted.    By the end of 1993 the province still had 4,800 villages  whose per-capita incomes were under 300 yuan a year, the  official-set poverty line.    The officials said most of the impoverished people live in  places where the natural conditions are harsh, either too  mountainous or often hit by floods or drought, or where endemic  diseases are rampant.    The province still has over one million people and 400,000  head of domestic animals afflicted by water shortages, 2,300  villages inaccessible to motor traffic and 1,600 villages  without electricity, the officials said.    Large enterprises will also be encouraged to help poor areas  develop their own industries, as they have the technicians,  technologies and market information that poor areas often lack.    In addition, cities may be paired, the ones with relatively  better developed economies helping the poorer ones in  technology, marketing and training of technicians, the officials  said.     "

South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself  in international politics and there was an increased potential  for trade links with other African states.    He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy  would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South  Africans.

The IDA provides highly concessional loans for the poorest countries - those with per capita annual incomes of Dollars 765 (Pounds 503) or less. Mr Preston said the share of IDA resources devoted to social projects and direct poverty reduction would be steadily increased. He said poor people affected by programmes should play a bigger role in helping design projects. His restatement of IDA goals followed formal board approval of the 10th replenishment of IDA resources, covering the three years starting this July. Donor nations have agreed to provide SDR13bn (Pounds 11.83bn). This represents a small increase in resources compared with IDA 9, which was SDR11.7bn. However, in per capita terms the latest replenishment is less generous than IDA 9 because funds will have to be spread over more recipients; newly qualifying nations include several former Soviet republics. Donors also failed to provide an additional 'earth increment' to fund more ambitious environmental policies. Mr Preston praised donors for not forgetting the needs of the poorest countries, in spite of severe budgetary restraints at home. Officials said the overall replenishment would have been smaller but for a surprisingly large commitment from the Bush administration, which pledged Dollars 3.75bn, nearly 20 per cent more than its dollar contribution to IDA 9. Britain's contribution of Pounds 620m represented only 6.1 per cent of total resources committed, down from 6.7 per cent of IDA 9.   Companies:-  International Development Association.

0,FT932-3841 ,"FT932-3841 _AN-DFKB5AG0FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (2): Structural defects in an ailing economy - Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty and violence have taken their toll      By TONY HAWKINS   SOUTH AFRICANS have to believe that post-apartheid economic performance will break the post-independence African mould. For many such a belief has to be a triumph of faith over experience and possibly even logic, especially since for the past 20 years, the South African economy itself has performed no better than many in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of this year, per capita incomes, at 1985 prices, will have slipped below R3,100 to their lowest point since 1970. The South Africa economy is certainly not 'in ruins' as suggested in 1991 by Nelson Mandela, but then neither is it in anything remotely resembling peak condition. Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty, violence and mass action have taken their toll on the economy and continue to do so. The skills haemorrhage is resuming on a debilitating scale to be followed, no doubt, by an exodus of experience from the public sector as affirmative action takes off. Structural defects are highlighted in the recently-published Normative Economic Model (NEM) - the work of Pretoria officialdom. A decade of stagnation is blamed on double-digit inflation since the early 1970s, declining investment volumes and efficiency, increased government consumption spending - up to 18 per cent of GDP during the 1985-91 period from 12 per cent in the 1960s - and the juxtaposition of rising real wages and falling formal sector employment. Growth potential has slowed dramatically from an average of 5.5 per cent between 1961 and 1978 to 1.3 per cent in recent years. In narrow macroeconomic terms, this is the result of a decline in net investment to less than 4 per cent of GDP since 1985, falling below 1 per cent last year, while the capital output ratio has widened from 2.1 in the 1960s to 3.0, meaning that more investment rands are needed to increase output. A crucial structural defect, too, is the high level of capital intensity. According to the NEM, a prime goal of a labour-surplus country should be the promotion of labour-intensive techniques, but South Africa has been heading in the opposite direction. Since 1961, the capital-to-labour ratio has virtually doubled with the result that even were the economy to grow at 4.5 per cent annually for the rest of the decade, unemployment would continue to rise. Not everyone agrees with this analysis. Not only does it assume that future relationships between investment and employment will replicate the past - a generic weakness of such models - but it is guilty of what Mr Edward Osborn, chief economist of Nedbank, calls 'a fallacy of aggregation'. The NEM has several explanations for the rise in capital-intensity, including large capital-intensive projects carried out by the state which has left the country with surplus capacity in energy and transport, negative real interest rates which encouraged capital-intensive investments, existing consumption patterns and, of course, relatively high labour costs. Nedbank is more circumspect, pointing out that the growth in capital intensity in manufacturing is traceable to heavy investment in the steel, synthetic fuels and pulp and paper sectors. Whoever is right, the prospects for a reversal of this trend - fundamental to the NEM's aim of employment-generating economic growth - are belied by recent significant investment decisions. The principal commodity-based investment projects now being developed - the Alusaf aluminium smelter, the Oryx and Moab gold mines, the Namakwa Sands mining project, and the Columbus stainless steel complex - are all capital-intensive. This is not to criticise the model's appropriate focus on employment creation. As a supplyside model, the NEM concentrates on fostering a policy environment conducive to export-led, labour-intensive industrial growth. It says little about the demand side of the equation which, if the Alusaf and Columbus projects are any guide, points in the direction of continuing capital intensity. Similarly, the country's existing export portfolio reflects an essentially resource-based pattern of industrialisation with direct mining and agricultural exports accounting for more than 70 per cent of the total, and processed primary products for a further 5 per cent. The balance is dominated by iron and steel products (10 per cent) and chemicals (3.5 per cent). This leaves a little over 10 per cent for manufactured exports - dominated by textiles, machinery and equipment. Even that could well be an overstatement when account is taken of re-exports to the sub-continent. Private sector economists argue that in terms of productivity, labour costs and the cost of capital, South Africa is simply not a world class player in manufacturing. Officials say this is changing, predicting 5 per cent inflation in 1995/6 compared with a forecast 11 per cent this year, and arguing that the NEM's prescriptions of increased market competition and the phasing down of tariff protection and exchange controls will boost international competitiveness. In part, this optimism is based on the moderation in wage demands and awards that has followed four years of recession, and on the restructuring that has already taken place in gold mining where more than 120,000 jobs have been shed and in the state-owned railway system, Transnet, which has halved its workforce to 135,000 from 289,000 in 1982. If narrow economic considerations were all that mattered, such optimism might well be justified. But engineering a sustainable fall in inflation and a significant shift of resources from consumption to investment at a time of wrenching political change, when the majority of the population is expecting a 'liberation dividend' and when the underlying fiscal situation is far from healthy, will be exceptionally difficult. The signs are that the governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, the architect of monetary restraint, will be reappointed, thereby ensuring that monetary discipline is retained. But the planned halving by 1997 of the public sector deficit, from a forecast 6.8 per cent of GDP this year will be extremely difficult to achieve. Even before the transfer of power to a more 'people-oriented' administration, the Reserve Bank says the level of government spending is 'exceptionally high', reaching 31.4 per cent of GDP last year. There will be savings as the apartheid-driven duplication of public services is eradicated, but a significant peace dividend is unlikely given the proposed integration of the ANC's military wing into the armed forces. Spending on job creation, social upliftment and poverty reduction will put an enormous burden on the public purse along with the expansion of public sector employment, the cost of reintegrating the 6.5mpeople from the TBVC (homeland) states, and terminal benefits for many whites in the public sector and the security forces who will want to embark on fresh careers within and outside South Africa. Although South Africa is substantially underborrowed externally, domestically it is teetering on the brink of a debt trap. Interest payments which accounted for a mere 3.9 per cent of the national budget in 1976 will absorb 17.4 per cent this year. Unless government spending  - and the deficit - are tackled decisively, the public debt, currently 53 per cent of GDP, will escalate pushing the country ever deeper into a debt trap where increased borrowing will be needed to finance interest payments. African experience in structural adjustment is less than reassuring. Governments have been unwilling, or unable, to impose fiscal discipline. Why should South Africa be any different ? Possibly because it has excess infrastructural capacity, the strongest private sector and financial infrastructure in the continent, a strong skills base - by African standards - and the advantage of having travelled some distance down the learning curve before having to make hard economic choices. The ANC has moved a long way towards the centre largely dropping nationalisation from its policy agenda, softening its antipathy towards foreign investment and backing away from many of its interventionist ideas. There is a high degree of convergence in economic thinking with economists from the ANC and the labour unions reluctantly accepting that they will not be able to create a brave new world in a matter of a few years, and that wage restraint and fiscal and monetary discipline must remain at the head of the policy agenda for the foreseeable future. One businessman, who works alongside the ANC/Cosatu alliance in the tripartite National Economic Forum, representing business, government and the unions, is confident that the ANC will be 'ruthlessly pragmatic' in economic policy-making. This may well be the present game plan, but it assumes not only that the ANC will abandon much of the ideological baggage accumulated during its years in the political wilderness, but also that its constituencies  - the unions, the students, the peasants and the unemployed - will be willing to forgo butter tomorrow in anticipation of butter and jam in five years' time. The optimists argue that it need not come to this; that the recent surge in the gold price and the forecast world economic recovery will provide a window of opportunity taking the pressure off the balance of payments, the budget deficit and monetary policy. The upbeat scenario has a final agreement on the debt standstill in place before the end of this year, resumed access to IMF and World Bank funding during 1994, the rationalisation of tariffs and partial liberalisation of exchange controls, including abolition of the financial rand, and a significant rand devaluation to boost industrial exports. On this scenario, the four-year-long recession bottoms out in the latter half of 1993, and the economy rebounds on to a 4 per cent growth path from next year. Once devaluation is digested, inflation stabilises at 8 per cent to 10 per cent, and foreign investment resumes in the mid-90s when the international business community is satisfied that the mould really has been broken. For this upbeat scenario to materialise, a formidable array of conditions must be satisfied, most crucially the next government being sufficiently strong-willed to tread the finest of lines between satisfying its disparate constituencies and rebuilding business and investor confidence at home and abroad. A tall order for any administration, and especially one with a built-in mistrust of big business and a naive confidence in the ability of macro-economic policies to restructure an essentially third-world, commodity-dependent economy.  ----------------------------------------- GNP per capita  ----------------------------------------- Year         Rand*  ----------------------------------------- 1960        2,485 1970        3,078 1974        3,894 1980        3,981 1985        3,533 1990        3,345 1991        3,286 1992        3,103 1993**      3,060  ----------------------------------------- * 1985 constant prices; ** Forecast  ----------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank and FT forecast  -----------------------------------------  -------------------------------------- Investment  -------------------------------------- Year              %  -------------------------------------- 1978           26.2 1980           26.2 1982           27.9 1984           24.4 1986           20.2 1988           19.1 1989           20.8 1990*          20.0 1991           18.0 1992           15.9  -------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  --------------------------------------  ----------------------------------- Inflation  ----------------------------------- Year            %  ----------------------------------- 1986         18.5 1987         16.2 1988         12.9 1989         14.7 1990         14.4 1991         15.3 1992         13.9 1993*        11.3  ----------------------------------- * Forecast  ----------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank and FT forecast  -----------------------------------  ----------------------------------- Gross domestic product  ----------------------------------- Year         Growth rates %  ----------------------------------- 1984             5.1 1985            -1.2 1986             0.0 1987             2.1 1988             4.2 1989             2.3 1990            -0.5 1991            -0.4 1992            -2.1 1993*            0.0  ----------------------------------- * Forecast  ----------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  -----------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Africa Opens First China  Fair""]    [Text] South Africa's first commodity fair in China opened  yesterday in Beijing, marking a further step by the growing  African nation into the mainland market.    More than 300 South African business representatives are  attending the four-day event.    ""The exhibition is a landmark of the strengthened relations  between the two countries,"" said David Graaff, South Africa's  deputy-minister of industry and trade.    Companies at the South Africa China Exhibition 1994 come  from  31 industries including South Africa's strongest sectors such as  mining equipment, electronics and jewellery.    Many South African big name companies such as Sasol, Iscor  Mining  Steel Production, Saflec Electronics and Nampak are  seeking shares in China's flourishing industrial and commercial  market.    Graaff said he believes the exhibition ""will make an  important contribution to bilateral trade relations by  stimulating more joint ventures, flow of investment and tourism.""    Since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1992,  sound  trade ties have been achieved, he said.    Since then, bilateral trade volume has risen more than 30  percent to reach $658 million last year.    If trade through Hong Kong is included, the figure surpasses  $1 billion.    ""China is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and  we  always take her as an important trading partner,"" said the  deputy-minister.    He added that South Africa will continue to enjoy ties with  China for years to come.    After years of isolation on the world market, South Africa  has become a strong economic power.    Fifty-five percent of the nation's gross national product  comes from international trade, 30 percent of which is generated  by exports.    China mainly imports minerals and exports light industry  products to the South African nation.    Besides being rich in mineral resources, South Africa also  produces construction equipment.     "

The loan will fall in  a range of billions of yen and its disbursement is expected  after an international aid panel designates South Africa as an  eligible recipient this summer, they said.    The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the  request of South Africa and will include construction of roads,  ports and power plants, the sources said.    Tokyo intends to include South Africa among nations eligible  for aid because it is moving toward democracy, they said.    Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on  education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and  agricultural development, they said.    In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has  not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the  country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been  given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development's development  assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990.    Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa  under its new government following the African National  Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.

""Shaka Zulu"" has been traveling  across America in syndication since 1986, amassing impressive ratings, and now  gets its first national airing this week on cable's TBS network. It runs in  five installments, today through Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.    Made at a cost of $24 million -- including $2.5 million from the  state-controlled South Africa Broadcasting Corp. -- the 10-hour miniseries is  lavishly mounted, but so ineptly executed that it's mainly for viewers who like  seeing barbaric, semi-nude blacks running around carving each other up as  civilized whites look on in horror.    ""Shaka Zulu"" is a muddy window.    Watching ""South Africa Now,"" however, is like seeing through a clear window for  the first time.    Always spotty, American television coverage of South Africa has dropped off  considerably since the Pretoria government declared a state of emergency and  increased media censorship in June, 1986. And even in the best of times, the  time limits imposed on network news stories are not conducive to in-depth  reporting.    ""South Africa Now,"" a nonprofit series that has had a single focus since its  inception in April, 1988, has more than filled the coverage gap, drawing from a  variety of sources, ranging from Afrovision to free-lancers in South Africa who  smuggle their material out of the country at great risk. Although a culture  segment is slipped into each half hour, the heaviest emphasis is hard news:    * Black youths turn their bare backs to the camera to display ugly wounds said  to come from police whippings.    * An investigation reveals ways South Africa is said to circumvent a global oil  embargo.    * A white leader in the rebellion against South Africa's continued control over  the South West Africa territory of Namibia speaks about threats and attempts on  his life. He was assassinated after taping the interview.    * A renegade American conservative is accused of violating U.S. law by  representing South Africa's extreme-right, rigidly pro-apartheid Conservative  Party in this country without registering as its agent.    * Anti-apartheid journalists appear in an excerpt from an Irish documentary  about hazards faced by the dissident press operating inside South Africa.    Produced by the independent production firm Globalvision in association with  the anti-apartheid Africa Fund, ""South Africa Now"" surely is anti-apartheid,  which is about as dishonorable as being anti-Nazi.    ""South Africa Now"" is anything but a shrill soap box, however, and the  reporting is usually fiercely sober and thorough.    Produced on a relatively spare budget of $26,000 a week -- which is  underwritten by mainstream foundations and individuals, including Bruce  Springsteen -- this is also not a gleaming, elegant program with wide anchor  desks and dazzling technology.    Because of its diversity of sources, moreover, the quality of production varies  greatly from story to story. So does the quality of the anchors, who range from  rough-edged quasi-amateurs (who are in the show's training program for young  journalists) to producer Carolyn Craven, a polished former anchor-reporter for  KQED in San Francisco and former White House correspondent for National Public  Radio.    What makes ""South Africa Now"" special is that there's nothing like it anywhere  else. No other program sheds so much light on the dark continent.    Mainstream media coverage of Southern Africa does not escape its close  scrutiny. A segment on Sunday questioned New York Times reporter Christopher  Wren's use of ""shadowy"" to describe the ""mass democratic alliance"" against  apartheid in South Africa.    ""South Africa Now"" failed to clarify the context in which Wren had applied  ""shadowy"" to organized apartheid opposition. What it did do was demonstrate the  power and potential hair-trigger combustibility of words used to characterize  political or human rights movements.    Without a doubt, ""shadowy"" does apply to ""Shaka Zulu,"" whose resurfacing on TBS  also occupied a portion of Sunday's ""South Africa Now.""    Los Angeles-based Harmony Gold is listed as the producing company for ""Shaka  Zulu."" Directed by white South African William C.

The bottom line here  is image: At a time when Pretoria's white-minority government continues to  argue that South Africa's overwhelming black majority is unfit for self rule,  ""Shaka Zulu"" arrives almost on cue, filling the screen with black tribesmen  motivated only by barbarism and black magic.

This is a historic day for which  the world has long awaited and I dare say the path has well been  laid to welcome South Africa back to United Nations. Mr.  Mandela, when he visited New York and I had the pleasure of  speaking with him on that occasion, made it quite clear that the  United Nations will represent a cardinal feature of South  Africa's foreign policy and I think we there at United Nations  are very ready to welcome your country to the organization once  more.    [Robinson] Now those are very kind words, Mr. Insanally, but  the point that I am trying to make is this: It is a question of  South Africa being obliged to formally readmit credentials. Is  that the position or not?    [Insanally] I dare say South Africa will have to formally  express its desire to return and as I said I am pretty sure that  that request will be very spontaneously entertained. The other  matters, all the residual matters of financial standing, the  question of contributions, clearly are -- as in the case of all  countries -- there's a question of a assessment of  contributions. I imagine that this is a matter that will have  to be discussed with the South African Government. There is a  scale of assessment and I imagine this will have to be through a  dialogue between the government of South Africa and the United  Nations Secretariat.    [Robinson] As I understand it, South Africa is about $100  million in arrears. So what is going to happen as far as that is  concerned?    [Insanally] As I said, the primary criterion I imagine the  United Nations will use is to open its doors to South Africa, an  important member of the United Nations family. I do not believe  that the question of arrears will be a stumbling block to its  reentry into the organization. Clearly....    [Robinson, interrupting] But will South Africa have to pay  that amount?    [Insanally] I really can't say. I really would be  very...[pauses] I would be hazarding an answer there. It would  be for the committee on contributions to study the case. Let me  say that, you know, the United Nations is composed of a number  of bodies and South Africa has in fact not been entirely  excluded from participation in some of the agencies, so one has  to look at it in fine [as heard], and it would be very  presumptuous of me to give you a sort of blanket answer. As I  said, many countries are in arrears. I am sure that some  arrangement can be worked out which would facilitate South  Africa's entry as soon as it expresses a desire to return to the  international family.    [Robinson] The United Nations arms embargo against South  Africa is still in place. Are you going to take the initiative  to remove that?    [Insanally] That is a matter for the Security Council, and  again I do not wish to sort of tread on their prerogative. I  would think that in so far as it does not affect the general  purposes of the United Nations, such an embargo will be reviewed  with some...[pauses] with a new eye and in an attempt to respect  the sovereignty of South Africa. I am sure the Security Council  will take the necessary measures in that regard.    [Robinson] One of the bodies of the United Nations is the  Special Committee Against Apartheid. One might expect that the  duties of that particular committee will now lapse.    [Insanally] Oh yes, that I can say positively. I was,  myself, a vice president of the council for Namibia and that was  one body which I was very glad to see pass out of existence,  although it's left me without a particular job. The same will  occur for the Special Committee -- apartheid -- and as I said  we'll be very happy to see the end of it. It will take a little  time to dismantle, to redeploy, but that certainly will go now  that South Africa is now with us, fully, in the United Nations  family.    [Robinson] If South Africa reenters the United Nations, do  you see any specific or special role for South Africa in that  body?    [Insanally] Indeed I do. I see it as a sort of a two-way  street. I see, first of all, South Africa playing a very key  role in United Nations affairs, in all its aspects. South  Africa, indeed, is an important nation, not only within Africa,  and indeed I must say that we look upon South Africa as the  dynamo for development in the region, in all of Africa, and in  the political sense what South Africa has been able to  accomplish through excellent leadership, excellent vision for  the future, and the process of dialogue and reconciliation --  that can be a model for other countries in the region. At the  same time the United Nations, as I am sure the secretary general  may have mentioned to the president of South Africa, I think we  can look to South Africa also to making a contribution to  international affairs, in the areas of peace keeping, peace  making, technical cooperation. You are indeed, in this part of  the world, a very advanced country and, therefore, can play a  very preeminent role in the furtherance of peace and development  in the continent.     "

The report indicates that South Africa was the only likely source of the test,  noting that South Africa had an active nuclear weapons development program and  sufficient supplies of highly enriched uranium to build several small bombs.

0,FT922-13688 ,"FT922-13688 _AN-CDJA7ABZFT 920410   FT  10 APR 92 / Book Review: Food for thought      By MICHAEL PROWSE   BEYOND BEEF: the rise and fall of the cattle culture By Jeremy Rifkin Dutton books. Dollars 21. 353 pages Beef consumption represents one of the gravest threats to the future well-being of the earth and its human population. A week ago, I would have dismissed Jeremy Rifkin's claim as absurd. Having read Beyond Beef, I am not so sure. Mr Rifkin, an American author and green activist, has doubtless overstated his case. But his diatribe raises questions that deserve far greater attention. His first, startling point concerns the world's extraordinary reliance on beef. There are nearly 1.3bn cattle spread across six continents. They occupy nearly a quarter of the total land space and consume about a third of the world's grain harvest. This passion for beef is increasing poverty in the Third World, damaging the global environment and threatening the health of affluent consumers in the US, Europe and - increasingly - Japan. The argument about poverty is straightforward. An acre of cereal can produce five times as much protein as an acre devoted to meat production; an acre of legumes (beans or lentils) 10 times more; an acre of leafy vegetables, 15 times more. More than 1.3bn people in the Third World are reckoned to be chronically underfed. If only a portion of the land occupied by cattle were turned over to crop production, most could be fed at no net cost to the developed world. The environmental case against cattle appears equally compelling. The billions of hooves trampling the world's surface are destroying natural habitats, stripping away vegetation, eroding soil and contributing to desert-like conditions in Asia, Africa and the Americas. Some 40 per cent of the Amazon rain forest has been cleared for cattle-grazing, despite unsuitable soil conditions. The obsession with cattle is also leading to water shortages. Nearly half the water consumed in the US goes to grow feed for cattle and other livestock. Cattle account for a sizeable portion of all methane emissions, thus contributing directly to global warming. If red meat were good for us, all this might perhaps be justified. Yet scientific opinion is shifting towards the view that an ideal human diet would be based mainly on vegetables, grains and fruit. Some three-quarters of deaths in the US are reckoned to result directly from poor diets, including excessive intake of saturated fats and cholesterol. The incidence of colon cancer in the west, for example, is up to 10 times higher than in non-beef-eating Asian cultures. Beef addiction (nearly 7bn hamburgers a year are consumed in the US alone) also helps explain why more than a quarter of Americans are clinically overweight. While lack of grain leads to starvation in developing countries, these portly individuals spend Dollars 5bn a year trying to get thin. Billions of dollars are also wasted on wholly unnecessary medical bills. Rifkin, while strong on the practical cost to human beings of excessive beef consumption, also raises troubling ethical questions about the things we do to cattle. 'Modern meat is a testimonial to the utilitarian ethos . . . Cattle are dehorned, castrated, injected with hormones and antibiotics, sprayed with insecticides, placed on a cement slab, and fed grains, sawdust, sludge and sewage until they reach the appropriate weight. The animals are transported by truck to automated slaughterhouses, where they are killed, disassembled into their constituent parts, mixed, moulded, shaped and reconstituted into useful products . . .' Can we really justify this behaviour when more people could be fed - and more kept healthy - by growing beans? Rifkin reminds us that the word 'cattle' is derived from the words 'capital' and 'chattel'. In a fascinating historical discussion, he traces man's relationship with the bovine from ancient Egypt, where the bull and cow were worshipped as icons of our virility and fertility, to the mass concrete feedlots of the American mid-west, where they are raw industrial inputs. He shows how the British aristocracy's love for fatty cuts of beef - and its willingness to finance American ranches in the 19th century - helped change tastes throughout the world. And he documents how the cattle industry - the first form of mobile capital - repeatedly led developments in other sectors: Henry Ford, for example, got the idea of an assembly line from the Chicago meat-packers. The author sees the changed status of cattle as a metaphor for the evils wrought by modern capitalism: 'We have substituted mechanism for organism, utilitarianism for spiritualism, and market values for community standards, turning ourselves from beings to resources.' He exaggerates. But the over-production of cattle, while encouraged by public subsidies, remains a good example of the way capitalism can have globally irrational consequences if it fails to take all the costs of production into account. In calling for the renunciation of beef today, Rifkin is decades ahead of public opinion: in due course, however, I have no doubt that red meat will go the same way as tobacco. We must prepare to apologise for this anti-social and unhealthy habit.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

The multi-million dollar  programme focusses on a South African industrial trade expo in  New York City from September 20 to 23 where about 150 South  African firms are expected to show their goods and services.  ""South Africa and the USA: Strengthening the Link"", the expo is  being staged by the Department of Trade and Industry and the  South African Foreign Trade Organization (SAFTO).    Addressing a news conference in Washington, Mr Manuel said  the idea was to reintroduce South Africa--not as an emerging  market but as a emerging market with a highly sophisticated  physical and financial infrastructure. He said President  Mandela had set out a vision of South Africa's future based on  compromise, peace and stability. Now the ""battle royal"" was on  to give hard-won democracy some content. ""Now we have to ensure  that markets in South Africa are sharpened so that we can create  jobs and improve on our manufacturing, that we can move up the  value chain from our rich mineral endowment and re-position  South Africa in the global economy.""    Mr Manuel said South Africa's return to the Commonwealth,  while unlikely to make a significant difference in the narrow  sense of trade and economic terms, was part of the approach that  South Africa was back in the family.    Referring to government's Reconstruction and Development  Programme, he said South Africa had an enormous capacity to  build a consensus society in the context of partnership and  cooperation. This was the case between not only government and  business but also South Africa and its major trading partners.    A series of initiatives being worked about between the  United  States and South Africa would be announced in a few weeks, he  disclosed.    Mr Manuel said the development of southern Africa regional  trade and stability was an important element in South Africa's  drive into world markets. It was important for South Africa to  stimulate economic development across the region with its  100-million inhabitants. ""Any notion that you build an island  of prosperity in a sea ravaged by war is clearly a non-starter,""  he said.    South African Ambassador Harry Schwarz told the news  conference that trade was like a tango -- and it took two to  tango. With respect to the US and South Africa, one tango  dancer was a powerful economy and the other was a fast-improving  existing market. South Africans of all races were a proud  people, Schwarz said. ""We are not standing with a begging  bowl....We stand as a proud people wanting to build an economy  and saying that we have tremendous resources and the capacity to  become a major world power.""

0,FT922-11169 ,"FT922-11169 _AN-CD0A4AEAFT 920427   FT  27 APR 92 / Monday Interview: Avuncular provider of advice - Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank      By MICHAEL PROWSE and PETER NORMAN   Six months after taking over as president of the World Bank, the world's premier development institution, Mr Lewis Preston is dipping his toes in media waters. His handlers have finally persuaded him to start giving press interviews. They have not all gone well. A frosty piece in the New York Times described him as spending the interview 'slouched in the corner of a carved-wood sofa' and being more interested in his pictures of wild birds than in economic development. Today, the blue-blooded former Wall Street banker is sitting up straight and radiating charm. Peering over half-moon spectacles, a mug of coffee in one hand, he seems avuncular rather than gruff or intimidating. Indeed, one could almost believe this is not the World Bank president but an amiable retired banker who has wandered into the Washington office of an old friend. During a decade at the top of J P Morgan, one of the few big US banks to emerge relatively unscathed from the debt-ridden 1980s, Mr Preston studiously avoided publicity. Regularly consulted by the world's top central bankers, he preferred to wield influence from behind the scenes. It is clear he would like things to stay that way. 'The bully pulpit doesn't interest me a bit,' he declares. For Mr Preston, who devoted 40 years of his life to J P Morgan, it is institutions, not individuals, that matter. Already intensely loyal to his new home, he says the test of his performance will be 'what people think of the bank, not what they think of me'. But does the World Bank president, given his potential influence on development issues, not have a special duty to speak out? He rejects the argument. It is vital, he believes, for the bank to establish intellectual leadership, but it does not matter if issues are articulated by him or by other bank officials. What counts is how well the institution performs. So far, he says, he has found little wrong with the bank's policies. But 'hate mail' from development lobbyists suggests the execution of policies falls short of excellence. He hopes that tough management skills honed at J P Morgan and an 'ability to delegate' will enable him to make improvements. Bank officials have found the first few months of the Preston presidency bracing. He started by axing an entire tier of senior management, releasing around 240 staff for more productive roles. He has since turned his attention to the bank's opaque internal budget. This is so confusing, he says, that it is impossible to identify whether resources are misused. He is certain, however, that there is 'a lot of fat here'. The one policy that he has gone out of his way to endorse is poverty alleviation. He says he is not making a rhetorical flourish when he describes it as the bank's 'overarching objective'. But should this be the main goal? After all, at an early stage of development, poverty was the last thing to concern successful capitalist economies such as the US. Should the bank not aim mainly at stimulating growth? Mr Preston is clearly uneasy at the ideological overtones of the question. 'I don't think the trickle-down theory is very satisfactory . . . You have to have a social safety net in place for the most disadvantaged people.' Without such policies, you are wasting money: 'Ad-justment programmes won't work.' He hints that one of Mr Boris Yeltsin's initial problems was his failure to understand that Russia does not have an adequate safety net. Has the bank not been left behind in the former Soviet Union, where the International Monetary Fund has established itself as the principal outside adviser? No, says Mr Preston. The fund's lead role in the early stages reflects its macroeconomic responsibilities. 'We've been working awfully closely.' The bank is cranking up to lend heavily. From the middle of 1994, it will be lending Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn a year to the former Soviet republics. Eastern Europe will be receiving a further Dollars 3bn. All told, the former communist countries will get a quarter or more of all bank loans, significantly changing the character of the institution. Mr Preston concedes that the shift of resources - some of the bank's best personnel as well as cash - is making its traditional Third World clients nervous. But he says the timing of the collapse of communism was fortunate. The bank was underlent and now has considerable headroom for extra lending. Smiling broadly, he adds that the bank has anything but a shortage of economists. He does worry, however, that global competition for capital could adversely affect the poorest countries. The bank is trying to drum up support for the 10th replenishment of the International Development Association, its soft loan affiliate. If IDA 10 is to be as generous in real terms as the bank's previous effort, it will have to raise about Dollars 18bn. But Mr Preston believes significantly more money is needed, both to reflect the growing number of potential recipients (which now include Vietnam and Cambodia) and the expanding cost of measures to protect the environment. One lesson the bank has taught him is that there is no conflict between economic development and the environment. 'It is absolutely clear that they are not in tension,' he says. A recent trip to southern Africa helped convince him that the poor tend to suffer most from environmental degradation. But surely there must be a conflict at some level? Suppose everybody in China drove a car. What would happen to carbon emissions or global warming? Mr Preston hesitates. He knows his briefing papers must contain the answer. But he does not remember it. Perhaps his experience in southern Africa was too limited, he muses. What about the future of the bank? With more than 5,000 mostly Washington-based staff, is it not too big and remote? Could not some of its functions be undertaken by the private sector? After all, two of the bank's most senior officials have recently left to start up a private venture for channelling risk capital to developing economies. Mr Preston's thinking on such issues is at an early stage. 'We have no monopoly on brains,' he concedes, 'although we sometimes seem to have a monopoly on insensitivity.' He hints that there is nothing sacrosanct about present arrangements: 'If anybody can deliver a service better than us, we ought to be using them.' He also appears sympathetic to arguments for greater decentralisation. 'My instincts are that we should have more people in the field.' He says the big change already well under way is the bank's metamorphosis from a lending institution to a provider of advice. He is not embarrassed that the bank's net transfers to many clients are declining as old loans are repaid. This is happening 'all over Latin America' and is a sign of the success of past programmes. He says people are wrong to think loans are the only lever for influencing policy. At J P Morgan, he recalls, old clients did not reject his advice just because they no longer needed his loans. Looking ahead, he seems unruffled by the many problems confronting policymakers. The industrial economies are in a shaky condition. The former Soviet Union is in turmoil. Millions are starving in the Third World. Yet Mr Preston's elegant, two-storey penthouse office is a haven of tranquillity. The man seems as reassuring as his old furniture. You feel he will work patiently for practical solutions to complex problems, untroubled by strong ideological convictions. The bank has fallen into a safe pair of hands. Mr Preston does not pretend to be a development expert, an intellectual or an economist. But he appears to have other, rarer virtues: steady nerves, sound judgment, and enough confidence cheerfully to admit that he does not know all the answers. The one danger is that his four private decades at J P Morgan have left him not fully prepared for his role at the helm of a very public institution. Given the scale of today's problems, the bank needs more than a capable manager working on budgets behind the scenes. It needs somebody capable of articulating a vision for development, of providing global leadership on issues as controversial as the environment and the transition from communism. Mr Preston has yet to rise to such challenges.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1926 Born New York City.

0,FT911-1835 ,"FT911-1835 _AN-BEBBRAGWFT 910502   FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Politics and agriculture facing up to growth in world appetite      By JOHN MADELEY   THE PROSPECT of having half as many people again, in 30 years time, eating at a world table that is wobbling all over the place is beginning to concentrate wonderfully the minds of agriculturalists and politicians. 'By the year 2025 the world will have to feed an additional 3bn people from a natural resource base which is already seriously threatened by unsustainable farming practices and environmental pressures arising from other human activities.' So reads the opening sentence of the ""Den Bosch Declaration"" on sustainable agriculture and rural developments, agreed last month in the Dutch town of s-Hertogenbosch, at an international conference organised by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the government of the Netherlands. Conviction appears to be widening that a great deal of farming in both developed and developing countries is not sustainable and must change if yields are to be maintained on a more permanent basis. And although existing farming methods are producing enough food for the world, millions cannot afford to buy what they need and are caught in a poverty trap which forces them to eke out a living at the expense of natural resources which are their sole means of survival. The Bruntdtland Report 'Our Common Future' spoke of short sighted policies which are leading to 'the degradation of the agricultural resource base on almost every continent; soil erosion in North America, soil acidification in Europe, deforestation and desertification in Asia, Africa and Latin America.' FAO estimates suggest between 5m to 7m hectares of arable land is lost each year through soil degradation. The Worldwatch Institute, the Washington based study group, says the annual loss of top soil is running at 24bn tonnes, roughly equivalent to the amount on the Australian wheat lands. Soil is also overworked in some areas, losing the nutrients which feed plants, as little attention is paid to conservation measures. Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general, told participants at the conference from 124 countries that the threat to the environment was intensified by 'indebtedness, unfavourable terms of trade and falling world prices for export commodities'. Agriculture will have to meet the challenges, says the Den Bosch Declaration, 'mainly by increasing production on land already in use and by avoiding further encroachment on land that is only marginally suitable'. Changes are necessary to create the conditions of sustainability. 'This is particularly the case in the rural areas with a high population density and on marginal lands where small farmers and landless people can barely subsist.' The declaration was accompanied by an 'agenda for action' which urges the study of diverse forms of agriculture including low external inputs and organic farming systems. But it avoids the controversial issue as to whether the use of chemical fertilisers increase the acidity of certain soils, reducing their ability to sustain plant growth. At a recent international conference on permaculture (permanent agriculture) in Nepal, speakers pointed out that chemical fertilisers are increasing the acidity of soils in mountainous areas, putting many farmers on a downward spiral as far as crop yields are concerned. This was leading to a growing interest among Nepali farmers in organic methods such as intercropping, the use of green manures, planting trees and crops on the same land and the integration of crops and livestock.

The results of the  first multiracial general election in South Africa showed that  the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa led by  Mandela will win a majority of the vote. In South Africa, a  ANC-led national unity government will be formed. The result of  the general election showed that the last apartheid system,  which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to  an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born.  The vast number of black people being oppressed under the  racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they,  together with white people, have become masters of the country.  The success of the first multiracial general election in South  Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of  the South African people and the African people as a whole, but  was also an event of great historical significance in, and with  far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in  this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just  struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice  at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We  extend warm congratulations to them.    In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people  of  South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In  particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black  people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting  struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to  fight for South African black people's equal political and  economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into  dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no  longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace  talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The  multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were  attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties,  underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many  obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest  conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the  white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts.  However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of  most political parties cherished the spirit of racial  reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make  joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and  eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process  of peace and democracy in South Africa.    Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also  inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other  African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance  and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern  Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations,  other international organizations, and the international  community as a whole have also made positive contributions to  supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because  the struggle of the South African people won extensive support  and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving  people inside and outside the country, the situation in South  Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's  progress.    The success of the first whole-people-involved election in  South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African  people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists  among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of  the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and  carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations  of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be  hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule  and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people  believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves  from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be  able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the  course of racial reconciliation and national peace and  stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace,  and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.     "

During the  inauguration of the 20th extraordinary period of sessions of the  Inter-American Cooperation for Development General Assembly at  the Foreign Minister, OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena  Soares warned that the downtrodden need much more than just a  chance to be heard in order to maintain stability and democracy  in the region.    [Begin Baena Soares recording] Just giving the downtrodden a  chance to be heard is not enough to improve the fate of large  segments of our society, rescue them from scarcity and  exploitation, and ensure their full right to live with hope. We  need sustainable democracy to overcome extreme poverty. [end  recording]    Speaking to 20 Latin American foreign ministers and 34  special delegates from member countries, Baena Soares warned  government representatives of the danger that extreme poverty  and social injustice may break the region's democratic order.  Recalling the Mexico Declaration, signed in March 1945, which  emphasizes the right of equal opportunity for all people in the  hemisphere, Baena Soares hit the nail on the head when he  affirmed that more progress is made today consolidating wealth  than in halting the avalanche of extreme poverty and neglect,  although the growth of these factors dampens possibilities for  stability, development, and peace, which the countries of Latin  America require to advance on the path of democracy.    As an example, the OAS secretary general said that 230  million citizens in the region lack the resources to meet their  basic needs. He stressed that in at least 11 Latin American and  Caribbean countries, the available firsthand information reveals  that one-fifth of the population earns less than 6 percent of  the total per capita income. He noted that even those societies  that have achieved high levels of production exhibit serious  deficiencies linked to the displacement of indigenous  communities, neglected populations, a lack of food and housing,  high rates of crime and violence, the illegal trafficking and  use of drugs, and environmental deterioration.    Baena Soares noted that among the international community,  close to 6.5 percent of the labor force in the wealthier  countries is jobless. The unemployment rate of the hemisphere's  industrialized countries is almost 7 percent. This segment of  society, the poorest, must work an average of nine weeks to  acquire the resources earned in just one week by the richer 20  percent. Although cold and repetitive, the figures are a cause  for reflection after almost half a century of OAS assemblies,  where extreme poverty, injustice, and democracy are recurrent  themes. The OAS secretary general stressed the need for the OAS  member countries to ratify their commitment to base the  preservation of democratic order on an open struggle against  extreme poverty and on the consolidation of social justice.  American countries, he said, have the resources to defeat  poverty.    In turn, Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello, who was  elected president of the extraordinary assembly, stated during  the inaugural ceremony that Mexico is convinced that the  people's aspirations for justice and welfare demand an end to  the backwardness and neglect in which millions of Latin American  live. That, he said, can only be achieved as peoples and  governments make new commitments to cooperation and development.  The war on extreme poverty, Tello concluded, should become a  priority of the OAS, because inequality hurts everyone.     "

Family incomes of black and Latino  children have continued to decline, the report said. Overall, the median family  income of white children is more than 1 3/4 times that of Latino children, and  double that of black children, the report said. Between 1970 and 1987, the  median income of children living in single-parent families declined by 19%, the  report said.    Among low-income families with children, average family income declined 14%  between 1979 and 1987, compared with a 19% increase for the highest-income  families, according to the study. In 1988, 20% of all children had no form of  private or public health insurance, compared to 17% in 1982, the report said.      Prenatal Care    In 1987, the report said, one birth in 17 was to a mother who received late  prenatal care, or none at all.

[Ebok] For 21 years of its existence, we as the OAU have  confronted the problems in South Africa. At the first meeting  of the OAU, one of the first decisions which was taken was that  on decolonization and which led to the establishment of the  Liberation Committee at the OAU. That committee has more or  less attained its mandate having contributed to the  decolonization process, and also in a very significant way to  the ending of apartheid. That committee is winding up, so it  means a lot to us who had been attached to it with a sense of  nostalgia. It's like one era has ended. Now we would look  forward to a period, you know, in which we can pursue economic  emancipation with the same vigor that we have pursued the  political liberation.    [Xhobule] Let's talk about current conflicts on the  continent. With regard to conflicts happening in various parts  of the continent at the moment, what role would you see South  Africa playing?    [Ebok] One of the things which has impressed people all over  the world, not just in Africa, is the way South Africans  resolved their problems through negotiations. It has opened the  doors to that possibility that every conflict could be resolved  through negotiations, because I mean, if you look at it, when we  came here about two years ago we never thought that the  elections would come off so peacefully. A few months back we  never thought that we would have such a peaceful election. So  one of the things which South Africa had experienced, which  South Africa would bring to the organization, are its experience  in conflict resolutions.    [Xhobule] In practical terms, what would this entail both  for  the OAU and for South Africa?    [Ebok] Well, for the OAU it means that our membership has  been enriched. South Africa comes to the organization with some  leadership role. South Africa is a very advanced country  technologically and even politically. And so those experiences  are the experiences which we'll learn, which our organization,  as we move into the 21st century....[pauses] For South Africa,  I believe that for once it has stopped being the (?burial) state  -- we will stop talking about South Africa in very negative  terms at meetings of the OAU, and South Africa will be in a  position to benefit from some of the experiences -- positive  experiences -- which the rest of the continent has. It would be  able to interact with the rest of the continent because South  Africa will first be an African country before it becomes a  member of any other international community. So for South  Africa, it is back in the fold as a member of the family. It  can reach out to the whole world from Africa as a legitimate  entity, and that is the benefit for both of us.     "

With respect to the African economic integration, an  encouraging sign is that the number of the countries has  increased to 34 that have ratified the treaty on the  establishment of the African Economic Community, which was  signed by the African leaders in Abuja, new capital of Nigeria,  in June 1991. With the ratification by one more country, the  treaty will come into force.    Besides, progress has also been made in regional economic  integration in 1993 in the western, eastern and southern parts  of the continent. Treaties on the establishment of regional  common markets have been signed to facilitate the inter-regional  trade and economic development.    In order to promote the intra-Africa trade, the African  Development Bank (ADB) took the initiative in establishing the  ""African Export-Import Bank"" in Cairo, while the U.N.  secretary-general has proposed the establishment of a commodity  diversification fund for Africa.    Those efforts have obviously demonstrated the eagerness and  determination of Africans to overcome the economic crisis and  step up the economic development on the continent.    As regards the economic situation of Africa in 1993, many  countries have appeared to set on course to harvest the benefits  of peace. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  estimated that the economic growth in Ethiopia might reach 9.3  percent, 5.3 percent in Mozambique and 7.1 percent in Uganda due  to the relative peace and stability in the countries.    However, the economic situation in Africa as a whole was  still marked by a meagre growth in 1993. According to an ECA  preliminary estimation, African economy grew by only 1.4 percent  in the year, representing an improvement over the 0.7 percent  growth of 1992. This is barely half of the regional population  growth rate.    Analysts pointed out, in addition to the deep-seated  problems  including lack of domestic resources, poor infrastructure and  domestic political deficiencies, there are three major factors  that are hindering the African economic growth.    First of all, it is the continuing civil conflicts and  political crises in several countries that restrained the  economic growth. For example, the economic growth in Zaire is  estimated to have dropped by 4 percent in 1993 following a more  severe decline of 12 percent in the previous year because of the  political unrest resulting from disputes over democratization  process in the country. Nigeria's economy may have only grown by  about 3.7 percent in 1993, far below the annual average of 6.2  percent in the 1988-1992 period due to political upheaval.    The natural disasters, especially the drought that struck  eastern and southern Africa in the year, are another factor that  has suppressed the economic growth. Due to the worst drought,  Zimbabwe's economy is estimated to grow by 1.4 percent in 1993  as compared with the 8.5 percent growth in 1992. Parts of  Ethiopia and Eritrea have also experienced crop failures because  of the drought.    The third factor is the unfavorable international economic  environment. The weak growth in major industrial countries led  to a sluggish demand for main African products. And the weak  demand in turn led to the continuing fall in prices of fuel and  non-fuel commodities. As result, Africa's export earnings are  estimated to have shrunk by about 2.7 percent to 72 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, following a drop of 1.1 percent in 1992.    Besides, external debt has further deteriorated in 1993.  According to the ECA, the share of multi-lateral debt of Africa  in aggregated debt stock has risen to 24.2 percent in 1993  compared to 20.5 percent in 1992 and 19.5 percent in 1991. This  shows that Africa's external debt will be above 275.15 billion  U.S. dollars in 1993.    Meanwhile, external resources flowing to Africa are  declining. According to the latest estimation of the World Bank,  sub-Saharan Africa's share of total official development  assistance of the bank has fallen from 37.1 percent in 1990 to  36.3 percent in 1992. Net lending commitments by the World Bank  to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 percent or 1.2 billion  U.S. dollars in its last financial year. Non-project lending to  sub-Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to 455 million U.S.  dollars from 895 million U.S. dollars the previous year.    IMF also reported a downturn in lending to Africa in its  latest financial year. The disbursements totalled some 525  million U.S. dollars in the year ending April 30, 1993 compared  with some one billion U.S. dollars for the previous year, a fall  of nearly 50 percent.    All those factors have added more difficulties to the lack  of  resources of African countries that need capital to develop  their economies.    With respect to the prospects for African economy in the new  year, it does not allow much optimism because all the factors  that have hindered the African economic performance in 1993 will  remain a constraint to the growth. Besides, with the loss of  some preferences conceded to Africa after the GATT Uruguay Round  agreement was signed and with the reduction of aid and resources  flowing to Africa from World Bank and other international  institutes, Africa will face more crises. In face of the  challenge, Africans have uttered stronger voice for  self-reliance and intra- Africa cooperation in developing the  continent's economy.     "

Bulger]    [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- An African National  Congress [ANC] government would downplay South Africa's role as  a regional power in southern Africa, ANC foreign affairs  director Thabo Mbeki said on Friday. Mr Mbeki was presenting a  discussion paper, Foreign Policy in a Democratic South Africa,  to members of the media and diplomatic corps at the World Trade  Centre in Kempton Park.    The document outlines South Africa's likely international  orientation after the April elections. Rather than projecting  itself as a regional power, South Africa would emphasise  co-operation as defined in agreements with fellow southern  African nations. It would attempt to address the marginalisation  of the African continent in the world economy and would join the  Organisation of African Unity.    ""Closer regional co-operation and economic integration after  apartheid will benefit the entire region,"" the document says. ""A  democratic South Africa should explicitly renounce all hegemonic  ambitions in the region. It should resist all pressures to  become the regional power at the expense of the rest of the  sub-continent. Instead it should seek to become part of a  movement to create a new form of economic interaction in  southern Africa based on principles of mutual benefit and  interdependence.""    South Africa would contribute to conflict resolution  mechanisms and peacekeeping in Africa. South Africa would also  take part in discussions about the United Nations and would  support efforts to ""democratise"" that body by giving  traditionally less powerful nations more scope and influence.    The foreign policy document stresses South Africa's role in  promoting human rights around the world. South Africa would  actively involve itself in international forums in pursuit of  this goal.    An ANC government would foster links with the Islamic  community of the Middle East and follow international law and  practice in its relations with Asian countries. Relations with  the European Community would be emphasised as well as bilateral  relations with individual European countries.    Diplomatic ties would also be established with Cuba. ""We  believe that Cuba's right to self-determination is important in  the maintenance of international norms and principles,"" the  document says.    It notes its concern at the failure to finalise the Uruguay  Round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  (GATT) and says this could lead to damaging protectionism among  the northern countries.    On the UN, the document says: ""We support endeavours to  democratise the UN. This entails reviewing the brief of both the  General Assembly and the Security Council.""    On security, the document says South Africa will sign the  Geneva Convention and protocols and will be committed to  resolving disputes peacefully.    South Africa would actively support non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    South Africa would return to the Commonwealth.    A new foreign service would be established independent of  party political considerations. ""We will immediately take steps  to ensure that, within a reasonable period, the diplomatic corps  will be fally representative of South Africa's people,"" the  document notes.     "

President Mandela is representing  South Africa officially for the first time at both meetings.  Estelle Pienaar filed this report:    [Begin Pienaar recording] Key developmental issues for  Africa, and in particular southern Africa, tops the agenda in  Harare. The Zimbabwean capital today played host to the meeting  of the Global Coalition for Africa and will tomorrow be the  venue for the meeting of the Frontline states. The body was  founded as a front of neighboring countries against South  Africa. Now that South Africa has shed its apartheid burden,  and is back with a vengeance in the international community and  the brotherhood of African countries, the organization has lost  the very reason for its existence.    However, it's believed that Zimbabwe is keen to see the  establishment of a new organization to replace the Frontline  states. But other parties feel that such a body would have  little value as most of the issues affecting southern African  countries could be dealt with by the Southern African  Development Community, SADC. Zimbabwean newspapers report that  the name Frontline States is expected to be dropped in  preference for something that sounds less confrontational.  Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, the future of  southern Africa will hopefully never be as divided as its past.    In recent years the world has increasingly turned its back  on  Africa. Any organization which unites South Africa with the  rest of the sub-continent in the interest of regional peace,  stability and economic growth, might just provide the impetus to  prove that this region can survive, and indeed prosper.

0,FT941-5497 ,"FT941-5497 _AN-ECFAYAFAFT 940305   FT  05 MAR 94 / Books: Homage to The Devils - Fiction      By JDF JONES   THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG by J M Coetzee Secker  Warburg Pounds 14.99, 250 pages John Coetzee is a Capetonian academic who writes slim novels of extraordinary power. Dusklands, in 1974, was a touch experimental - two linked novellas announced his fascination with what his next book was to describe as 'the barbarous frontier'. That second book, In The Heart Of The Country, drew strength from its remote South African setting and even relied on a fair amount of Afrikaans dialogue. The masterpiece arrived soon: Waiting For The Barbarians, his 1980 tale of the sympathetic magistrate who governs a remote district between 'the Empire' and the encroaching 'barbarians'. Life And Times Of Michael K, a terrifying fable of a simple, hare-lipped gardener caught up in a South African civil war won him the Booker Prize. Next came Age Of Iron - an unforgettable story of a woman dying of cancer attended by an alcoholic vagrant who becomes her angel of death - and Foe, a break with South Africa, an ingenious re-telling of the story of 'Cruso', Friday and 'Daniel Defo'. The Master Of Petersburg also proclaims its distance from South Africa (though its theme of the great novelist harassed by the secret police can hardly be accidental). It is, I suggest, a first faltering of a huge talent: a disappointment. The narrator is Dostoyevsky, the year 1869, and the writer has returned from exile to St Petersburg in response to the death - suicide? murder? - of his beloved stepson. The narrator discovers that the young man has been associated with a group of anarchists led by a certain Sergei Nechayev. The police confiscate first the stepson's papers, containing a list of assassination targets, and then his father's passport. 'Dostoyevsky' becomes involved with his landlady, and with her precocious girl-child Matryona, 'a conductor of souls'. Evidently we are in the world of The Devils (sometimes called The Possessed), which Dostoyevsky started to write in the same 1869. Nechayev was indeed a young nihilist, a disciple of Bakunin and the probable model for Peter Verkhovensky in The Devils. It is known that Dostoyevsky was aware of the conspiracy of the 'Society of National Retribution' led by Nechayev - he used it for the novel. At this point Coetzee's re-writing of history becomes irritating, even perverse. The fact is that the real-life stepson, Pavel, was not killed either by the police or by his fellow conspirators - he was to survive his real-life stepfather. Dostoyevsky never met Nechayev (although their relationship is central to The Master Of Petersburg). He did not return to Russia until 1871. He was not a inclined to paedophilia. True, Coetzee gives us elements of a portrait of Dostoyevsky: references to Poor Folk and Crime And Punishment; epileptic attacks; the Siberian exile; the gambling obsession; 'fathers and sons: foes: foes to the death'; and hints of some of the Russian writer's higher themes. There is also a sense of Kafka-esque menace that has been a frequent feature of Coetzee's work. Above all, this is a book about desperate tragedy and distress. What is the point of this re-imagining, this re-arrangement, of Dostoyevsky's life history? I suspect that there is a private sub-text which it would be impertinent to investigate. Taken as a fiction, there is a fascination in the portrait of a society in which one's fate is determined by bureaucrats and policemen, in which extreme poverty co-exists with autocracy and luxury, in which dedicated young political activists are prepared to give their lives to change the social order. But it would have seemed hard to imagine Coetzee writing a dull, inert book about Dostoyevsky. Perhaps The Master Of Petersburg should best be seen as a fine writer's hommage to The Devils.

0,FT922-12153 ,"FT922-12153 _AN-CDVA7AAEFT 920422   FT  22 APR 92 / An Ecu for Europe's poor: Delors wants to put poverty higher on the agenda      By ALAN PIKE   THE EUROPEAN Community's leading anti-poverty programme has a budget of Ecu55m (Pounds 38.6m), about one Ecu for each of the 50m-plus deprived people estimated to be living in EC countries. The EC's Poverty 3 programme is consuming its Ecu55m over five years, reducing annual expenditure to around one-fifth of an Ecu per poor person. This is, European Commission officials admit, a pitifully poor sum to be devoting to one of the most challenging social issues of the day. Both in the commission and among anti-poverty organisations, however, a wish is growing for the EC to become more involved in promoting measures to support Europe's disadvantaged citizens. Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, intends to produce a document on poverty and social exclusion aimed, first, at increasing political and public awareness of the issues and eventually establishing a charter of rights. Mr Delors admitted at a conference in Brussels this month that the fight against poverty is an area where the EC has little to boast about. National governments still took the view that 'each parish has its poor people' and did not want the next parish, much less the commission, involved. But he voiced a willingness to use the commission's influence to help lift issues of social exclusion and disadvantage to a higher point on Europe's political agenda. Poverty was a cumulative process, said Mr Delors, and 'if it takes place against a backdrop of indifference in society, at some stage the problem will become intractable.' Definitions of poverty are themselves the subject of frequent disagreement. Current EC estimates that some 50m of its population - 15 per cent of the total - live in poverty are based on a calculation of the number of people receiving less than half the average income in the country where they live. Some politicians would argue with this definition but Mr Wim Van Velzen, president of the European Parliament's social affairs committee, says that on the same basis 30m people were in poverty in 1978. In spite of economic growth and aid to less developed regions, the proportion of poor people in Europe has grown each year. This arises largely from the consequences of industrial restructuring and long-term unemployment, factors which have also helped change the nature of 'typical' west European poverty. Once traditionally associated with such groups as the elderly, it is now far more likely to afflict younger, unemployed families and single parents. The concept of what is meant by poverty is also changing - the phrase 'social exclusion' is increasingly used to indicate that poor people lack not only money but access to a range of other services and opportunities. Notions of poverty being about more than shortage of money have gained strength since the mid-1980s when Faith in the City, the Church of England's influential report on urban areas, described it as being about 'how people are treated and how they regard themselves; about powerlessness, exclusion and loss of dignity'. Some welfare campaigners are concerned that if this view is carried too far, however, the link with lack of money may be lost to such an extent that poor individuals are seen by others as being responsible for their own plight. 'It is right to talk about exclusion but poverty is still about money,' says Mr Quintin Oliver, president of the European Anti-Poverty Network which co-ordinates the work of the voluntary sector. 'It is caused by lack of money, and money helps solve many of the problems.' In late 1990 the EC set up a support group of independent specialists to examine the prospects for developing a European strategy to fight poverty and social exclusion. The group has concluded that the EC has a substantial and potentially useful part to play 'despite its meagre resources for direct action'. Although local projects funded by the EC were unlikely to add up to an effective policy for fighting poverty, they should continue as a means of supporting innovative approaches and exchanging information. The group recommends that the commission produce an annual report on the state of human development in the EC, enabling the social consequences of development to be measured alongside economic ones. Rising EC interest in the problems of poverty and social exclusion reflects fear about the potential consequences of leaving a large section of Europe's population living outside the mainstream, particularly at a time when extreme-right political parties have been gaining ground in some EC countries. Time may be short. The support group's report warns of a 'veritable explosion' for society, with parts of large towns tending to become urban ghettos for marginalised people where 'moonlighting, fraud, delinquency, prostitution and drug-trafficking seem infinitely more remunerative than all the benefits that could possibly be paid out by the welfare system.'

From  the point of view of the Israeli defense industry, these are two  countries that stopped being excellent customers after going  through changes of regime.    The tremendous arms purchases that Iran made under the shah  were cut off when Khomeyni took power. South Africa is in a  transitional period now, leading to transfering power to the  black majority, and from being an important customer of the  Israeli defense industry, it is turning into a serious rival. In  this race, it is making wide use of Israeli advanced technology.    Over the years, foreign sources published many reports about  the close ties that had been woven between the defense  establishments in Israel and South Africa. Israel--so it was  reported--helped South Africa to build an arms industry that  produces everything from light weapons to warplanes and missile  boats.    Not long ago, the president of South Africa announced that  his country had also produced six atomic bombs. Foreign sources  claimed that these weapons, too, were produced with active help  from Israel, and that in return South Africa had allowed the  Israelis to test their nuclear weapons within its boundaries.  THE WASHINGTON POST also claimed that the South African  authorities sent enriched uranium (which is used to produce  nuclear weapons) to Israel, so that it will not fall into the  hands of the blacks when they take power in April 1994.    But from a partner and an ally, South Africa has turned into  a serious commercial rival. Today, at almost every international  arms fair, it shows off the products of its defense industry. It  does not even try to blur the source.    Its Cheetah jet is a perfect copy of the Israeli Kfir; the  sea-to-sea missile it produces is the twin brother of the  Israeli Gabriel; the assault rifle its soldiers carry is another  version of the Israeli Galil; and even skilled professionals  have trouble distinguishing between the Israeli pilotless plane,  Pioneer, and the South African pilotless plane, Siker; or  between the Israeli pilotless bomber, Harpy, which sails toward  its target and blows it up, and the South African pilotless  bomber, Lark. Air-to-air missiles of the Kukri type,  manufactured in South Africa, are amazingly similar to the  Israeli Phaeton missiles. And this is just a partial list.    Even the advertising the South Africans do for their weapons  systems is Israeli in character. At the weapons fair that was  held at the beginning of November in the Emirate of Dubai, there  was an unusually large number of exhibitors from South Africa.  The leaders of the South African arms industry explained to  reporters covering the fair that the international embargo,  which had been imposed on their country, and was in force until  not long ago, forced them to develop many systems on their own.  This kind of advertising has been characteristic until now of  the sales representatives of the Israeli defense industry.    For many years, South Africa was not been able to sell the  weapons its defense industry produced, because of the  international embargo imposed on it in protest against its  apartheid laws. Now, with both apartheid and the embargo lifted,  markets have opened up for South Africa all over the world.    Sources in the Israel defense establishment say that the  South Africans operating an aggressive marketing system in many  countries around the world, and it seems that they are ready to  sell ""at any price""--mainly to establish their position as a  country producing advanced systems.    Looking back, was it a mistake to cooperate so broadly with  the South African arms industry? Opinions are divided on this.  There are those who argue that South Africa was a good customer,  and Israel also profited well from cooperation with it.  According to foreign sources, over the years South Africa  acquired weapons systems and know-how from Israel that were  worth more than 5 billion dollars. Others argue that we should  have taken into account the political changes that were going to  come in this country, and to maintain our defense cooperation  with it accordingly.    The reports about Israeli engineers who went to South Africa  to work after the Lavi project was canceled were perhaps a  little exaggerated, but for many years, South Africa absorbed  not only finished products from the Israeli defense industry,  but also much know-how. You see the results now at almost every  arms fair.    ""Although so far they have still not caused us any real  harm,  they are turning into more than just a mild headache,"" a senior  source in the defense establishment said.     "

At the Organisation of African unity summit in  Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow  African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his  aides to squash ""exaggerated"" hopes for financial aid and  intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take  sides in international disputes. In developments this week:    -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between  the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces.  Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace  fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to  Rwanda.    -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite  three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States,  led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for  military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the  Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in  Cape Town last week.    -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan  conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading  role in this initiative.    -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement  full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country  sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is  teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its  nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its  side.    -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the  Frontline States for their assistance in the war against  apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa  would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region.    -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion  backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United  Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU  meeting.    A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid  being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new  government was also aware that, as a ""newcomer"", it had to be  sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the  government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands  before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent.    In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz  Pahad  outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the  chief priority of securing resources for the country's  Reconstruction and Development Programme.    Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and  Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: ""It appears  that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to  exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve  better results if we fit in with the strategies already started,  instead of starting our own independent initiatives.""    He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with  the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to  mediate. There were three other ""perfectly competent"" African  leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he  added.    On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had  been  asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko,  he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique  President Joaquim Chissano.    After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member  of  the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had  not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the  economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear  that South Africa would not hand out material resources except  to help raise living standards.    On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and  delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual  would solve Africa's economic and social problems.    Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an  interview in Tunis: ""Of course they (African countries) have  expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South  Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts.    ""At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South  African delegation has been warning against expecting too much.""    OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were  being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to  strengthen the African economy. ""The best contribution South  Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then  gradually impact on the continent,"" he said.    However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He  said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace  fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount  of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle  against apartheid.

However, since it has been shunned by the international investment community for so long, South Africa is playing hard to get with the numerous banks that have come courting. Although the gold and foreign exchange reserves have fallen, there is no urgent need for South Africa to raise funds internationally. An Dollars 850m loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be forthcoming by the end of the year and South Africa also has access to short-term credit lines from several banks. Nevertheless, bankers expect South Africa to launch its first international bond issue since January 1992 after the elections. South Africa is likely to test the waters with a Eurobond issue denominated in D-Marks. If the D-Mark Eurobond issue is successful, South Africa will then consider an offering in the higher-profile eurodollar sector. Offerings from parastatal issuers are likely to follow. The main bone of contention is the interest rate South Africa would have to pay to raise funds in the Eurobond market. Borrowers who want to raise funds in the Eurobond market have to pay a 'spread' or premium over the yield in the domestic government bond market. The size of the yield spread is determined by the market's perception of the borrower. The bigger the spread, the riskier the borrower. Bankers say that as long as South Africa is classified as an emerging market it will have to pay a yield spread of between 225 and 275 basis points over underlying government bonds. This is well above the yield spread of around 175 basis points which South Africa is prepared to pay. As a result, South Africa could refrain from coming to the international bond market until the pricing issue has been resolved.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

At a press  conference to mark the end of the two-day heads of state summit,  he said the committee would deal with African conflicts at  ambassadorial, ministerial and summit levels.    It would implement an early-warning system to identify  potential flashpoints and introduce measures to manage and  resolve conflicts throughout the continent.    Other African states serving on the committee are Tunisia,  Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Benin, Chad, Egypt and Ethiopia.    Dr Salim said the mechanism, established in Cairo last year,  needed financial support to function efficiently.    He said conflict resolution and peace-keeping had enjoyed a  high priority in the leaders' summit.    ""There was a clear determination to see an end to the  conflicts plagueing Africa. This culminated in the significant  achievement of the agreement by both parties in the Rwanda  conflict to introduce an immediate ceasefire.""    Dr Salim said the Rwanda Government and rebel forces were  both committed to ending the devastating civil war and allowing  the United Nations troops to provide protection and humanitarian  assistance to refugees displaced by the conflict.    Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia have each  contributed a batallion of 800 men to the UN mission in Rwanda  while Mali, Nigeria and Congo would send about 100 soldiers each.    South Africa had pledged humanitarian assistance and  possibly  logistical support in the form of approved personnel carriers.    Dr Salim also praised South Africa for paying its OAU  membership subscription in full and called on member states who  are in arrears to emulate their example.    He said the best contribution South Africa could make to  Africa was to remain a united, stable and peaceful society.    In the long term, South Africa would contribute  significantly  to the OAU and Africa, particularly in the sub-continent.    ""We can expect South Africa in the future to play a major  economic, political and security role in the continent,"" he said.     "

Already a lot of international aid has been  pledged to South Africa. America alone has promised $600  million. Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor and a country with  its own experience of racial division, is one of the countries  most likely to lose out in the battle for international aid.  President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is in London on a state  visit, and Julian Marshall asked him if Zimbabwe was now  competing with South Africa for international aid.    [Begin recording] [Mugabe] Some competition is inevitable,  and after all why shouldn't there be competition? If South  Africa will have that investment, well and good, but there are  also forms of investment which, because of the advantage that we  have over South Africa, will come our way. Anyway, we can say  that today as things stand, we are more peaceful and stable than  South Africa, that we have had areas of greater development and  progress than South Africa because of the problems they have  had, and that this gives us here in some way and some areas that  needed advantage.    [Marshall] How important is the white population in Zimbabwe  -- I am thinking particularly of white farmers -- to the  continued prosperity of the country?    [Mugabe] Very important. We still need commercial farming,  and don't forget that commercial farming has to do with just  more than production of food. We need cash crops; we need  greater productivity in the commercial sector so we can compete.  So, apart from the fact that we need more land from the  commercial sector, and how acquiring this land is going to  affect some of the farmers, apart from that problem, there is no  other problem. Really, the commercial farmer, I mean, the white  commercial farmer, is a happier person in Zimbabwe.    [Marshall] So, you do intend to continue with the process of  the equitable redistribution of land?    [Mugabe] It is equity we are aiming at -- land which must  come into the possession of the peasant community -- so that the  peasant community has a resource and asset for the improvement  of their economic position.    [Marshall] So, finally, given the experience of the white  population in Zimbabwe in 14 years of independence, what is your  message to the white people in South Africa?    [Mugabe] Our message is that they should look at how and why  community in Zimbabwe -- white and black community -- have  reconciled to each other, and I am glad that President Mandela  has pronounced the policy of national reconciliation and  national unity as guidelines for the people of South Africa, and  I hope they do respond to his call in a social and economic way,  reacting to it positively, trying to work together with the  majority of the people in South Africa, and trying also to  enhance the lot of the poor in their country. That way, there  will be greater harmony and greater stability, and the whites in  South Africa needn't fear of any repercussions, any policies of  retributions in the future -- if this happened.

This follows a series of missions to South Africa by  representatives of the African Development Bank group since  1991. The Development Bank of South Africa [DBSA] said it had  been decided that the republic would officially enter into a  series of consultations with the African Development Bank group  on the terms and conditions of South Africa's membership.    These consultations would be pursued under the auspices of  the government of national unity and might eventually lead to  South Africa becoming a fully fledged member of Africa's premier  development financing institution, the DBSA said.    The group has earmarked between R720-million [rand] to  R1.26-billion a year over the next five years for financing  investment projects and programmes to both South Africa's public  and private sectors, to enhance economic and social development.  The funds could come in the form of long term loans to finance  public sector project investments in agriculture, public  utilities, transportation, education, health and industry, or  long-term lines of credit to national development banks to  finance private sector projects or medium- to long-term loans  and equity investments, in all productive sectors of the  economy, made directly to the private sector.    The DBSA said it was probable a significant portion of the  group's resources to South Africa would be targeted at  disadvantaged South Africans. However, it was up to South  Africa to decide finally on such resource allocation from  African Development Bank sources.    There were also opportunities for South African firms to  supply goods and services for the execution of the group's  projects throughout Africa. In addition, South Africa could  draw on the group's grant-based technical assistance.    South African representatives would attend the group's  annual  general meeting in Nairobi from May 11 to 13, at which the  declaration of intent would be tabled. A series of joint South  African/African Development Bank Group consultations would  follow the successful adoption of the declaration of intent, the  DBSA said.     "

The president,  who was opening the seventh Pan-African congress at the  conference center in Kampala today, told the congress  participants that in order to emancipate ourselves from foreign  domination we as Africans must know what to do. He described  the Kampala congress as a good moment to make a correct  diagnosis so that Africa gets an answer.    Mr. Museveni attributed Africa's problem to internal African  weaknesses both now and in the past and to external greed by  outside powers. He identified the main internal weaknesses of  Africa as lack of technology and poor organization but stressed  the question of poor organization as having played the most  crucial role. He said that countries such as China, Ethiopia,  and Japan, although inferior in technology, were able to defend  their sovereignty due to a high level of organization.    Mr. Museveni also attributed Africa's problems to Africa's  self- inflicted damage. He explained that one of the most  important factors to be independent is production, and yet  African governments have continuously interfered with production  by imposing various obstacles such as roadblocks, visas, and  marketing monopolies. He said African governments have  themselves interfered with sovereignty in Africa. He therefore  called upon the seventh Pan-African congress to examine their  self-inflicted damages and come up with solutions.    On the question of reparations to Africa by Europe and  America, Mr. Museveni said that these countries have a moral  responsibility to pay for the damage inflicted on Africa by  their ancestors. He stressed that Africa will emancipate  herself with or without the sympathy of her former oppressors.  However he was of the view that compensation for the past  injustices is likely to come when Africa demands it from a  position of strength not from one of weakness. He therefore  commended the seventh Pan-African congress slogan of Organize  But Do Not Agonize, saying that it is definitely within our  means to end domination.    Mr. Museveni elaborated that he personally had been fighting  to end domination for the last 29 years and, although he has not  ended domination completely, he has pushed it back. Elaborating  on who are the members of the Pan-African movement, Mr. Museveni  categorized these as the black Africans on the African  Continent, the Africans in the Arab region, the Africans in the  Diaspora, and whites in South Africa whom he referred to as a  new African tribe. He appealed to all Pan-Africanists not to  draw ideology into the movement but to accept all  Pan-Africanists, both radical and reactionaries, as members of  the movement. [passage omitted]     "

That adage, from veteran South African entrepreneur Anton Rupert, forms the rationale around the world for regional integration: the argument is that a sated neighbour is a stable neighbour, unlikely to turn belligerent. And with peace and stability come economic development. Four years ago, southern Africa's prospects looked unrelievedly bleak, with Angola and Mozambique sunk in civil war, Zambia in turmoil, Zimbabwe in economic decline and South Africa exhausted by decades of repression. Today hopes are high that South Africa will prove the region's economic saviour. But the post-apartheid government in Pretoria is likely to pay little attention to the problem of hungry neighbours until it can solve the far more dangerous problem of hungry citizens. And that could take until the end of the decade, even on an optimistic timetable, dampening hopes that South Africa will be the 'locomotive' of rapid growth in southern Africa - at least in the short term. First among the problems is the political transition in South Africa itself, where violence and instability have severely depressed economic activity and deterred foreign and local investors. Until South Africa is stable, accelerated economic growth in the region remains a pipe dream: and achieving stability in the republic may prove a lengthy process. Similarly, political upheaval in other countries of the region will inevitably delay growth. The most economically promising country outside South Africa - Angola - looks set to languish in civil war for the foreseeable future; Mozambique's future is far from certain, in spite of plans for multi-party elections; Zambia is struggling under the burden of decades of past mistakes, economic and political; Zimbabwe is weak economically. The economic basis for regional integration is also shaky. Prospects for significantly increasing trade within the region are uninspiring: first and foremost, because most of the countries of southern Africa simply cannot pay, at least not with hard currency. To get around the payment problem, South Africa could extend the rand monetary area to include other countries - a far too costly option, given the lack of monetary discipline exhibited by most of the region's central banks - or resort to countertrade. But it will be difficult to boost two-way trade links given the fact that South Africa's neighbours are far less developed than the republic (in a market worth Dollars 130bn, South Africa already has an 80 per cent share) and because regional complementarities are few, outside of a limited range of raw materials. Little can be expected from the lifting of sanctions in this area either: even under sanctions, regional states grouped together under the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (since renamed the Southern African Development Community) imported R2.4bn of goods from the republic, or almost 60 per cent of Pretoria's African exports. The most promising areas could well prove inter-regional trade in services, such as power and water, with Eskom, the South African electricity utility, proposing a southern African electricity grid; Pretoria already imports water from Lesotho through the Highlands Water project. But important as this co-operation is, the record to date suggests there is little evidence that SADC politicians in the region are prepared to relinquish enough economic autonomy to form a truly integrated regional community. In the longer term, there is no alternative to regional integration. In a world of economic and political power blocs, southern Africa cannot hope to prosper in its present fragmented state. The risk is that, unless the region achieves political stability soon, it will simply miss the boat.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT943-15421 ,"FT943-15421 _AN-EGJAPABVFT 940709   FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: More means testing is no answer to rise in poverty      From Ms SALLY WITCHER   Sir, Contrary to what was stated in your editorial, 'Work and benefits' (June 27), it is not welfare benefits which trap their recipients, so much as those which are means tested. Means-tested benefits are withdrawn as income rises: it is from means-tested benefit paid to the husband that a wife's earnings are deducted. These are just some of the reasons why they are such a poor response to the increasing insecurities of today's 'flexible' labour market. It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that the advent of the job-seeker's allowance - which brings with it more means testing - is greeted with enthusiasm in your editorial. Yet there is no avoiding the truth that means testing brings with it work disincentives, and not because benefits are paid at too high a level. Income support has been shown to be inadequate to meet even a low-cost budget. Between 1979 and 1991, the number of people in work who are living in poverty (defined as less than 50 per cent average income after housing costs) has increased from 4.1 per cent to 11.7 per cent, as a percentage of all in employment. No longer does being in work mean being out of poverty. The problem is not that benefits are over generous, but that rates of pay are far too low. Contributory and universal benefits, such as child benefit, do not bring with them the work disincentives of means testing. They can even go some way to alleviating them - child benefit forming a helpful bridge from unemployment into work. Cutting benefits and introducing more means testing will do nothing to halt the dramatic increase in poverty (particularly child poverty) experienced in the UK over the last 15 years.

The European Union says it plans to invest about 700 million  rands in South Africa to help the government fulfill the  expectations of the country's citizens. A member of the Union's  executive, Mr. Hans van den Broek, said in Pretoria that the new  government would need foreign aid for the difficult work that  lies ahead. He said people were justified in having high hopes  but that it would be a hard task satisfying them in the short  term.    Meanwhile, Canada announced the extension of General  Preferential Tariff treatment to South Africa, which makes it  easier to export to Canada. Application of the General  Preferential Tariff means that the rate of duty pay on eligible  imports from South Africa will be reduced by at least 33  percent. Australia announced that it would give an extra 17.1  million rands in aid to South Africa over the next three years.  This brings the total amount of aid to South Africa to about 90  million rands.    Promises of aid and support also came from Germany. The  German minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, said South  Africa's new government needs international confidence and  support. He pointed out that nowhere else in Africa were the  chances for development and healthy and continuous growth so  great as in South Africa. Other nations who announced plans to  boost relations with South Africa are Indonesia, Morocco,  Bangladesh, China, India, and Singapore.     "

The ministries, including major economic decision-makers,  told the National Conference on Poverty Reduction that they will  continue to support economic and social development in poor  areas, making water, electricity, education, roads and  telecommunications services available to China's 80 million  poverty-stricken citizens.    Chen Yaobang, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission  (SPC), said that SPC will continue to give priority to the poor  areas in industrial and agricultural planning, investment  allocation and material distribution.    Most of the 80 million poor live in remote mountainous  regions, plateau areas and remote deserts, making it an arduous  task to produce enough food, have adequate drinking water and  access to electricity, and provide education and health services.    Despite the difficulties, the minister said he is optimistic  about the completion of the poverty reduction plan.    The experience China has gained from past poverty reduction  efforts, the growing awareness of the whole society and  expanding international cooperation, will help fulfill the task.    Vice-minister of Finance Li Yanling promised to increase  investment to the best of the ministry's ability.    According to Vice-Minister of Power Industry Lu Yancha, 120  million people had no access to electric power by 1992.    Under a plan drawn up by the ministry, the majority of all  the towns and villages will have access to electric power,  making it available to 95 percent of rural families.    Vice-Minister of Communications Li Juchang said that  inaccessibility is one of the major causes for the backwardness  in poverty-stricken areas.    The huge potential for economic development in China's vast  poor areas, which are rich in land, mineral, forest, labor and  tourism resources, cannot be tapped without convenient  communications, the minister said.    Vice-Minister of Water Resources Zhou Wenzhi promised that  water conservancy departments will step up the construction of  water supply projects in rural areas and work hard to complete  the task set by the central government to solve the drinking  water shortage for the majority of the poor and their domestic  animals.    Officials from other ministries, such as the Ministry of  Telecommunications, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television,  the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Labor, also  announced their plans to help the poor areas.

HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the percent of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit of general local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately for this factor. Applicants in each group are compared in terms of the percentage of their population below the poverty level. Individual scores are obtained by dividing each applicant's percentage of persons in poverty by the highest percentage of persons in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75.   c.     Program Impact_General    . In evaluating program impact, HUD will consider:          _Extent and seriousness of the identified needs;   _Results to be achieved;   _Number of beneficiaries, given the type of program;   _Nature of the benefit;   _Additional actions that may be necessary to fully resolve the need;   _Previous coordinated actions taken by the applicant to address the need;   _Environmental considerations;   _Whether displacement will be involved and what steps will be taken to minimize displacement and to mitigate its adverse effects or related hardships; and   _Where appropriate, housing site selection standards.             Assessments are done on a comparative basis and, as a result, it is important that each applicant present information in a detailed and uniform manner.   In addressing Program Impact criteria, applicants should adhere to the following general guidelines for quantification. Where appropriate, absolute and percentage figures should be used to describe the extent of community development needs and the impact of the proposed program. This includes, but is not limited to, appropriate units of measure (e.g., number of housing units or structures, linear feet of pipe, pounds per square inch, etc.), and costs per unit of measure. These quantification guidelines apply to the description of need, the nature of proposed activities and the extent to which the proposed program will address the identified need.   Appropriate documentation should be provided to support the degree of need described in the application. Basically, the sources for all statements and conclusions relating to community needs should be included in the application or incorporated by reference. Examples of appropriate documentation include planning studies, letters from public agencies, newspaper articles, photographs and survey data.   Generally, the most effective documentation is that which specifically addresses the subject matter and has a high degree of credibility. Applicants which intend to conduct surveys to obtain data are advised to contact the appropriate HUD office prior to conducting the survey for a determination as to whether the survey methodology is statistically acceptable.   There are a number of program design factors related to feasibility which can alter significantly the award of impact points. Accordingly, it is imperative that applicants provide adequate documentation in addressing these factors. Common feasibility issues include site control, availability of other funding sources, validity of cost estimates, and status of financial commitments as well as evidence of the status of regulatory agency review and approval.   Past productivity and administrative performance of prior grantees will be taken into consideration when reviewing the overall feasibility of the program. Overall program design, administration and guidelines are other feasibility issues that should be articulated and presented in the application, since they are critical in assessing the effectiveness and impact of the proposed program.   (1)     Program Impact_Single Purpose Grants    . Each project will be rated against other projects addressing the same problem area, so that, for example, housing projects only will be compared with other housing projects, according to the criteria outlined below. It should be noted that each project within an application will be given a separate impact rating, if each one is clearly designated by the applicant as a separate and distinct project (i.e. separate Needs Descriptions, Community Development Activities, and Impact Description and Program Schedule forms have been filled out, indicating separate project names).   In some cases, it may be to the applicant's advantage to designate separate projects for activities that can ``stand on their own'' in terms of meeting the described need, especially where a particular project would tend to weaken the impact rating of the other activities, if they were all related as a whole, as has been the case with some economic development projects. If, however, the projects tend to meet the impact criteria to the same extent, or the weaker element is only a small portion of the overall program, there is no discernable benefit in designating separate projects.   Applicants should bear in mind that the impact of the proposed project will be judged by persons who may not be familiar with the particular community. Accordingly, individual projects will be rated according to how well the application demonstrates in specific, measurable terms, the extent to which the impact criteria are met. General statements of need and impact alone will not be sufficient to obtain a favorable rating.   (a)     Program Impact_Single Purpose_Housing    . There are three distinct types of Single Purpose Housing projects: Housing Rehabilitation, Creation of New Housing and Direct Homeownership Assistance. Separate rating criteria are provided for each type of project.   (i)     Housing Rehabilitation. Needs    . Each application should provide information on the total number of units in the project area, the number that are substandard, and the number of substandard units occupied by low- and moderate-income households. The purpose of this information is to establish the relative severity of housing conditions within the designated project area compared to other housing rehabilitation applications. The application also should describe the date and methodology of any surveys used to obtain the information, including an explicit and detailed definition of ``substandard''.            "

The move should go ahead soon after South Africa's first universal suffrage elections on April 26-28, when the EU should have finalised its 10-year review of the GSP system, held up until the recent completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 'This is aimed as a substantial gesture of support for the elections,' said an aide to Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner. 'This is what both the government and the African National Congress have been asking us for.' But ministers resisted a British-led move to get the EU to commit itself now to a fully-fledged trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa as the next stage in closer links. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium prefer a more evolutionary approach, and got reference to yesterday's decision as an 'interim' agreement struck out of the Council of Ministers' conclusions. Behind their lukewarm enthusiasm is reluctance to treat South Africa as a developing country, although its relatively high average earnings mask huge income gaps within its population. Nevertheless, all 12 EU states agreed to treat South Africa as a special case. The EU runs a substantial trade deficit with South Africa, from which it largely imports minerals and precious metals, most of which already enter duty-free. In 1992, the Union had an Ecu3.7bn (Pounds 2.84bn) deficit on imports from South Africa worth Ecu9.1bn, over two-thirds of which were raw materials. For the first nine months of last year imports were Ecu6.7bn, against exports to South Africa of Ecu4.1bn, for a deficit of Ecu2.6bn. Because of the small flows of finished goods that South Africa exports, GSP treatment will at first be of limited benefit, even with, as ministers also agreed in principle, flexible rules on so-called accumulated rules of origin, or treating as South African goods which include components from neighbouring countries. However, along with recommendations that member states conclude bilateral investment protection and promotion pacts with South Africa, and a request to the European Investment Bank to extend its development financing to the republic, 'we are creating the climate for investors to take South Africa more seriously,' as a British official put it.

'There is an awareness that South Africa is a promising market,' says Mr Sota Sakai, manager of the Middle East and Africa Section at Marubeni, the trading house. 'But when it comes to investment, this is like a marriage so it will take more time to reach that point,' he notes. While Japan was South Africa's fourth largest trading partner in 1990 after West Germany, Great Britain and the US, due to international sanctions there has been no Japanese direct investment in South Africa for at least the past 10 years, the ministry of finance says. The political situation is still a strong concern. The Japan Bond Research Institute, gave South Africa a 5.9 general rating in its latest July report, which was up from 5.4 in January and 4.0 in January, 1989. The Institute attributed the higher ranking to the positive aspects of the government's fiscal and monetary policies as well as enhanced international trust in South Africa. Geography is also a problem. 'Japan is not that internationalised yet,' explains Mr Sakai. Japanese businesses also believe that the entire business environment in South Africa needs to be improved before the country can expect to see a significant influx of investment from Japan. Greater communication between the two countries is also necessary before Japanese businesses are likely to feel comfortable with the idea of investing in South Africa. For much the same reasons, there is little interest in Japan in South Africa's capital markets. Meanwhile, the activities of Japanese banks with regard to South Africa have been frozen since the country declared a debt standstill in 1985. It is believed that no new lending will be forthcoming from banks, Japanese or other, until that situation is resolved.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting  simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the  officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns.    This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again  to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become  acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in?    Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South  Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows  about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror  sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color  lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites  love cricket.    If only every issue in South Africa were so simple.    The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back  into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the  solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South  Africa's legislators.    After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It  wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried  everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They  have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not  been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past.    ""We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no  one will meet with us,"" said Gert le Roux, director of the South African  Amateur Athletic Union. ""We are never welcome, and some of these people used to  be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel  lobbies.""    The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the  South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a  founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is  effectively banned.    ""Every year, South Africa is on the schedule,"" he said. ""Every year, no one  comes.""    In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a ""sports  ambassador"" from South Africa in London.    Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on  a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His  mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how  integrated it was.    Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job  was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international  anti-apartheid lobby.    In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant  discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid.  He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and  it was their lack of response that drove him to quit.    ""If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political  ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is  wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated,"" he said.    ""The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power  games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political  tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for.""    Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's  sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning,  South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the  world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have  been correct.    Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South  Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear  that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place --  apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that  hasn't been brought down.    So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports  officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give  either way.    ""In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the  pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the  past."" said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic  Committee. ""That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and  maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They  didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa  took over the United Nations, the IOC.""    Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the  mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in  favor of ""white"" countries in which it felt more kinship. Now, in an era of  reconciliation, African countries are not in the mood to overlook past slights  -- or present conditions.    But the delicate relationship with the rest of Africa is crucial to South  Africa's future in the Olympic movement, for Olympic officials have made it  clear that the way back for South Africa must wind through Africa.    Two workmen are sitting in a tin shed by the Eastbank Hall swimming pool in  Alexandra, waiting for the delivery of paint for the bottom of the pool. They  have been waiting for two weeks. When the pool was built, the wrong paint was  used, and ever since it hasn't been right. Sometimes someone comes by with some  paint for the pool, but it isn't right, either.    So, here in the middle of South Africa's summer, the only pool in this black  township is closed.    Alexandra's best soccer field was partially covered with brown grass and  potholes because residents weren't able to water, resod or bring in equipment  to grade it.    Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, relies largely on its schools to  provide sports facilities for the black children. It is a faint hope, however,  in a country where schools are segregated and the government spends five times  more money to educate its white children than its black.    ""They are telling you lies abroad,"" said a community activist in Soweto who  would give only his first name, Rapu. ""They tell you our facilities are equal.  You can see they are not. South Africa belongs to all who are in it. We must  work to make a country for all the people. Sport has a significant role to  play. But there are priorities. You can't have a society that has thousands of  sports facilities when you have people who are not healthy enough to play the  sports.""    Rapu is fully behind the sports boycotts, even though he acknowledges that  black South Africans are doubly punished: They are not allowed free and open  competition within South Africa, and, as South Africans, they are not allowed  to compete against the rest of the world.    There is an argument advancing the notion that rather than stifling sports in  South Africa, those who seek to bring about political change ought to encourage  sports and nourish them. This argument holds that the interaction among races  that sports bring, the camaraderie it engenders, is a far more effective tool  to bring people together than laws and edicts.    Jannie Momberg, a Member of Parliament from the Democratic party, agrees with  this view and says that in South Africa, sports has another role.    ""I would say that sport has been used by the South African government as a kite  -- to see which way the wind was blowing in the country,"" he said. ""If it  worked in sports, they put it in place elsewhere in society.""    This kite is difficult to fly in a wind so strong that it seeks to bring it  down. However, in the last year, three historic meetings took place that may  have changed the direction of the anti-South African wind.    On Sept. 11, Johan du Plessis and J.B. du Plessis, the director of the South  African National Olympic Committee, met in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Juan  Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. The topic:  How to get South Africa back into the Olympic movement.    Samaranch explained that for South Africa to get back, it must work through its  continent -- only the IOC members from Africa will be able to help South  Africa. ""If they accept you, the rest of the world will accept you,"" Samaranch  said.    Events moved swiftly. On Oct. 11, the Du Plessises (they are unrelated) met  with Judge Keba Mbaye, an IOC vice president from Senegal. Mbaye told them that  Africa was their ticket back, and expected no less than the abolition of  apartheid.    That paved the way for a meeting on Jan. 9 in Paris with Sam Ramsamy and Fekrou  Kidane, who are advisers to the IOC Commission on Apartheid and Olympism.  Ramsamy, in particular, has devoted his life to the anti-apartheid sports  movement. The South Africans were excited about the unprecedented meeting.    Obviously, apartheid was singled out as the biggest problem. Another was the  IOC's concern about lack of unity among South African sporting bodies. In some  sports, there are five or six governing bodies. The IOC, through Ramsamy, told  the SANOC to unify its sports bodies under one umbrella and get rid of any  discrimination.    The South Africans came away from the 5 1/2-hour meeting excited about the  future for the first time in decades.    ""It was the first time we had concrete suggestions,"" Johan du Plessis said. ""We  didn't talk about politics. We talked about sports. We know what we have to  do.""    Some sports administrators here are angry at what they see as the IOC's  selective boycott of South Africa. Ray Moore of the South African Tennis Union  said: ""Listen, in 1980 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the IOC saw fit to  hold the Games in the capital city of the invading nation. Where is the line of  demarcation? Is there a set of standards for Africa?"" Moore said.    ""If you want to go into human rights in Africa . . . most of the countries in  Africa are governed in tyranny. They have dictators. You have people who have  sworn themselves into a presidency or as king for life. Ethiopia . . . what is  happening in Ethiopia is unbelievable. And Uganda. They are in the Olympics.  They are a respected member of the IOC. This was during a time when Africa was  becoming more powerful internationally. They could turn the whole thing the way  they wanted it to turn.""    In their excitement about the opening of a dialogue with the IOC, South African  officials are overlooking other signs. Last month Samaranch was asked about the  possibility of South Africa being readmitted in time for the 1992 Olympics.  Samaranch said it would not be possible. And the African nations are no less  militant regarding their neighbor to the south.

We've done a lot in certain areas  to integrate, but then we have segregated schools.

""    One likely scenario for South Africa is for sports to be recognized piecemeal,  federation by federation. The IAAF could allow the South African track  federation back, for example, the international governing body for swimming  could recognize South Africa's federation, and so on. In this way, South  Africans may compete internationally before they compete as a team in the  Olympic Games.    South Africa has its friends within the IOC, proof enough that its years of  lobbying have not gone to waste. But others have read the IOC charter and see  no allowance for a country where apartheid is still the law.    ""We are all held hostage by apartheid -- the black athletes in South Africa,  the white athletes in South Africa,"" said Anita De Frantz, a U.S.  representative on the IOC. ""The black and white athletes in the rest of the  world are held hostage by that system. That's why it must be dismantled.    ""Our charter says you cannot discriminate. I don't know if it's politics and  sports not linking, but it's part of the rule of the Olympic movement.

""Of course, the rejoinder is, 'Well, what about places where there are human  rights violations?' Yes.

South Africa's inability to pull the  rope, or to allow itself to be tugged, has kept this athletic landscape static.    ""We have done all we can do,"" they say to the world. ""Let others compromise.""    While black and white athletes clamor to break free of the borders of South  Africa's exile, sports officials are held hostage by politicians who are held  hostage by apartheid.    And so South Africa remains, clenching its fist and stamping a tiny foot  against the world.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting  simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the  officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns.    This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again  to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become  acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in?    Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South  Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows  about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror  sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color  lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites  love cricket.    If only every issue in South Africa were so simple.    The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back  into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the  solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South  Africa's legislators.    After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It  wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried  everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They  have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not  been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past.    ""We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no  one will meet with us,"" said Gert le Roux, director of the South African  Amateur Athletic Union. ""We are never welcome, and some of these people used to  be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel  lobbies.""    The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the  South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a  founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is  effectively banned.    ""Every year, South Africa is on the schedule,"" he said. ""Every year, no one  comes.""    In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a ""sports  ambassador"" from South Africa in London.    Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on  a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His  mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how  integrated it was.    Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job  was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international  anti-apartheid lobby.    In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant  discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid.  He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and  it was their lack of response that drove him to quit.    ""If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political  ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is  wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated,"" he said.    ""The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power  games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political  tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for.""    Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's  sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning,  South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the  world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have  been correct.    Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South  Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear  that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place --  apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that  hasn't been brought down.    So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports  officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give  either way.    ""In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the  pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the  past."" said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic  Committee. ""That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and  maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They  didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa  took over the United Nations, the IOC.""    Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the  mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in  favor of ""white"" countries in which it felt more kinship. Now, in an era of  reconciliation, African countries are not in the mood to overlook past slights  -- or present conditions.    But the delicate relationship with the rest of Africa is crucial to South  Africa's future in the Olympic movement, for Olympic officials have made it  clear that the way back for South Africa must wind through Africa.    Two workmen are sitting in a tin shed by the Eastbank Hall swimming pool in  Alexandra, waiting for the delivery of paint for the bottom of the pool. They  have been waiting for two weeks. When the pool was built, the wrong paint was  used, and ever since it hasn't been right. Sometimes someone comes by with some  paint for the pool, but it isn't right, either.    So, here in the middle of South Africa's summer, the only pool in this black  township is closed.    Alexandra's best soccer field was partially covered with brown grass and  potholes because residents weren't able to water, resod or bring in equipment  to grade it.    Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, relies largely on its schools to  provide sports facilities for the black children. It is a faint hope, however,  in a country where schools are segregated and the government spends five times  more money to educate its white children than its black.    ""They are telling you lies abroad,"" said a community activist in Soweto who  would give only his first name, Rapu. ""They tell you our facilities are equal.  You can see they are not. South Africa belongs to all who are in it. We must  work to make a country for all the people. Sport has a significant role to  play. But there are priorities. You can't have a society that has thousands of  sports facilities when you have people who are not healthy enough to play the  sports.""    Rapu is fully behind the sports boycotts, even though he acknowledges that  black South Africans are doubly punished: They are not allowed free and open  competition within South Africa, and, as South Africans, they are not allowed  to compete against the rest of the world.    There is an argument advancing the notion that rather than stifling sports in  South Africa, those who seek to bring about political change ought to encourage  sports and nourish them. This argument holds that the interaction among races  that sports bring, the camaraderie it engenders, is a far more effective tool  to bring people together than laws and edicts.    Jannie Momberg, a Member of Parliament from the Democratic party, agrees with  this view and says that in South Africa, sports has another role.    ""I would say that sport has been used by the South African government as a kite  -- to see which way the wind was blowing in the country,"" he said. ""If it  worked in sports, they put it in place elsewhere in society.""    This kite is difficult to fly in a wind so strong that it seeks to bring it  down. However, in the last year, three historic meetings took place that may  have changed the direction of the anti-South African wind.    On Sept. 11, Johan du Plessis and J.B. du Plessis, the director of the South  African National Olympic Committee, met in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Juan  Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. The topic:  How to get South Africa back into the Olympic movement.    Samaranch explained that for South Africa to get back, it must work through its  continent -- only the IOC members from Africa will be able to help South  Africa. ""If they accept you, the rest of the world will accept you,"" Samaranch  said.    Events moved swiftly. On Oct. 11, the Du Plessises (they are unrelated) met  with Judge Keba Mbaye, an IOC vice president from Senegal. Mbaye told them that  Africa was their ticket back, and expected no less than the abolition of  apartheid.    That paved the way for a meeting on Jan. 9 in Paris with Sam Ramsamy and Fekrou  Kidane, who are advisers to the IOC Commission on Apartheid and Olympism.  Ramsamy, in particular, has devoted his life to the anti-apartheid sports  movement. The South Africans were excited about the unprecedented meeting.    Obviously, apartheid was singled out as the biggest problem. Another was the  IOC's concern about lack of unity among South African sporting bodies. In some  sports, there are five or six governing bodies. The IOC, through Ramsamy, told  the SANOC to unify its sports bodies under one umbrella and get rid of any  discrimination.    The South Africans came away from the 5 1/2-hour meeting excited about the  future for the first time in decades.    ""It was the first time we had concrete suggestions,"" Johan du Plessis said. ""We  didn't talk about politics. We talked about sports. We know what we have to  do.""    Some sports administrators here are angry at what they see as the IOC's  selective boycott of South Africa. Ray Moore of the South African Tennis Union  said: ""Listen, in 1980 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the IOC saw fit to  hold the Games in the capital city of the invading nation. Where is the line of  demarcation? Is there a set of standards for Africa?"" Moore said.    ""If you want to go into human rights in Africa . . . most of the countries in  Africa are governed in tyranny. They have dictators. You have people who have  sworn themselves into a presidency or as king for life. Ethiopia . . . what is  happening in Ethiopia is unbelievable. And Uganda. They are in the Olympics.  They are a respected member of the IOC. This was during a time when Africa was  becoming more powerful internationally. They could turn the whole thing the way  they wanted it to turn.""    In their excitement about the opening of a dialogue with the IOC, South African  officials are overlooking other signs. Last month Samaranch was asked about the  possibility of South Africa being readmitted in time for the 1992 Olympics.  Samaranch said it would not be possible. And the African nations are no less  militant regarding their neighbor to the south.    Rise like Lions after slumber    In unvanquishable number --    Shake your chains to earth like dew    Which in sleep had fallen on you --    Ye are many -- they are few.     -- Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Mask of Anarchy    Despite political changes and some historic talks with the IOC, South Africa is  no nearer to being readmitted to the international sports community.

AFRICA;    MORE OF ITS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PRETORIA SINCE IT  BEGAN DISMANTLING APARTHEID. DIPLOMATIC TIES, THOUGH, MAY HAVE TO WAIT.      By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NAIROBI, Kenya      Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in  Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement  to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship  carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years.    But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of  Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It  is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa.    It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the  complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as  they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a  post-apartheid era.    The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in  September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de  Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African  countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast.  South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those  it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved  opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar  President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds  from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal  air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa.    These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing  until last year.    In the period of black independence, the only African government that  maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose  autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that  despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries  are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it.    That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy  whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new  Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's  rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil  war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas.    But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still  far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa  balloon in many places.    In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of  apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress  during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on  Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time  Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African  gasoline.    ""As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater  respectability,"" says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of  foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, ""for us to take up our role as an  important African country.""    There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from  supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except  informally.    Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they  could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may  disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might  also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside  investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking  for new investment opportunities.    South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up  for sale in Madagascar.    The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a  region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many  businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency  licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries.    ""The potential is enormous,"" says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's  regional vice president for Africa. ""If this part of the world became  acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world  scale.""    A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, ""Any (African)  businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down  there"" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African  companies.    Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official  disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries,  who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing  South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants.    With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South  Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of  industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa.    ""The whole of this area will stop looking to London and start looking to  Johannesburg"" for imported goods, says one East African businessman.    These include anything from military hardware, necessarily an industrial  specialty of sanction-beset South Africa, to automobile assembly kits for  plants in Zimbabwe and Kenya and fruits and vegetables that grow better in  South Africa's temperate climate than in the tropical zone girdling the rest of  the continent. South African wines, barred by trade sanctions from European and  American shops, are world-class.    ""A lot of things that Ivoirians consider indispensable to their lives, like  scrunchy apples, salad greens that don't grow here and wine, are cheaper coming  from South Africa than from France,"" says one diplomat in Abidjan, the capital  of affluent Ivory Coast.    Accordingly, planning in many countries for post-apartheid relations with South  Africa has been going on for far longer than their governments admit.    Kenya Airways's preparation for flights to Johannesburg began as long as a year  ago, sources say. The airline's purchase of three Boeing 757 aircraft, to be  delivered in January, was predicated partly on its ability to use two of them  to service the new Johannesburg route.    The World Bank's Jaycox says that not only the group of so-called front-line  states in southern Africa, but also the African National Congress and the  Pan-African Congress, have asked his institution to draw up economic forecasts  based on a new relationship between black-ruled Africa and South Africa.    But whether South Africa will be able to export prosperity to its neighbors is  open to question. Although some analysts suggest that South African  manufacturers might open satellite plants in neighboring countries to take  advantage of their cheaper labor, others note that these businesses will be  under pressure to first raise black South Africa's standard of living by  creating more jobs at home, not abroad.    So South African industry might view black Africa largely as an untapped market  for its exports. The net result of increased South African involvement in  Africa's economy could be harmful competition from its better-equipped and more  efficient manufacturers and growers.    A major victim could be Zimbabwe, whose once-impressive industrial structure,  built during its own period of isolated white-minority rule in the 1960s and  1970s -- is falling apart from old age and the total absence of outside  investment during its 10 years of black-ruled independence.    ""Manufacturing in Zimbabwe will crash,"" says one businessman with extensive  experience in Africa, ""because they can't compete with the efficiencies down  south.""    For all that, South Africa's apparent interest in reuniting with the rest of  its continent is based on more than just economics. One of the enduring  self-images of the Afrikaners of South Africa is that they are a white African  ""tribe,"" a view that underscores the group's discomfort at being so politically  isolated.    ""Yes, I am an African,"" De Klerk said last month during his state visit to  Senegal. ""My family fought in the first war in Africa against colonialism (the  Boer War), and I don't want to go anywhere else in my life.""    But the road to genuine political and economic cooperation will be marked by  large potholes; most business leaders and politicians knowledgeable about  improving ties choose to speak off the record, for political animosity to the  South African regime remains potent in black-ruled Africa.    ""There's lots of exploration going on now, but lots of countries are  constrained because they want their policies and actions to remain in harmony  with black South Africans,"" says Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a prominent African  banker.    Anyone seeking a hint of the pitfalls still confronting South Africa's desire  to become a regional player needs look no farther than the Kenya-South Africa  airline agreement.    The arrangement was announced in Nairobi on Oct. 4, with twice-weekly flights  set to begin Saturday. Travel agents began booking South African tourists into  Kenyan lodges, and seats on the first flights from South Africa quickly filled  up. Then African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela passed through  Nairobi's airport Oct. 14 in transit. He called an airport press conference to  blast the Kenyan government for what amounted to prematurely lifting sanctions.    Eleven days later, Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi, presumably cognizant that  the ANC could be ruling South Africa some day soon, unilaterally suspended the  airline deal until South Africa ""dismantles"" apartheid.    Kenya Airways officials privately acknowledge that they or the government  should have informed the ANC well in advance of the impending deal, in the  hopes of defusing any opposition. Business leaders and others in Nairobi now  regard the affair as a damaging lost opportunity to secure South African  goodwill and trade concessions.    ""It would be good to be first into South Africa,"" says one leading East African  businessman. ""You certainly don't want to be last.""    The Weekly Review, Kenya's most authoritative news publication, estimated the  potential lost revenue for Kenya Airways at nearly $23 million a year.    Perhaps the sector with the most to lose is tourism. Kenyan travel agents  estimated that easing travel restrictions could bring as many as 200,000 South  Africans annually to Kenyan game parks and, even more inviting, its beach  resorts. That would make South Africa the biggest source of tourists in Kenya  and increase total visits, which in 1988 came to 680,000 and brought $400  million into the country, by nearly 30%.    Prospects for reinstating the flight agreement are unclear right now -- the  suspension has still not been publicly acknowledged in Johannesburg -- but  Kenyan travel professionals say the important thing is to establish the flights  in time to attract beachgoers during the South African winter, beginning in  April or May.    Across Africa, open links with South Africa will bring to the surface plenty of  activity that has been going on quietly for as long as South Africa has been a  political pariah.    Sub-Saharan Africa's covert trade with South Africa has always been the  continent's worst-kept secret. In even the remotest up-country shops in Ivory  Coast, for instance, it is possible to buy a can of Coca-Cola with the legend  ""Keep South Africa Tidy"" embossed on the top. The labels of some consumer goods  found on the shelves in Zimbabwe supermarkets are written in Afrikaans.    Other ties are more subtle. Every Friday, a new, generally full Zambia Airways  plane takes off from Johannesburg for Lusaka, Zambia, and then continues to New  York. Few passengers ever get on or off the flight in Lusaka, and it is  considered largely a Zambia-assisted subterfuge allowing South Africans to  evade an American ban on direct flights to the United States from Johannesburg.    Of the 10 countries in the so-called Southern African Development Coordination  Conference (SADCC), a band of staunch anti-apartheid South African neighbors,  only two -- Tanzania and Angola -- officially bar all South African goods.  About 30% of the SADCC countries' total imports came from South Africa in 1986,  the latest year for which statistics are available. The share of SADCC exports  going to South Africa, 7%, exceeds the 4% that represents trade among the  conference members themselves.    About 32% of all South Africa's manufacture exports go north to black-ruled  Africa, says Kent Durr, the South African minister of trade and industry, and  the figure is growing. The South African government contends that of the 51  member nations of the Organization of African Unity, only one, Libya, has no  economic link with South Africa whatsoever. But only 13 of those countries  acknowledge having any ties.    Ivory Coast is perhaps one of the best examples of how a country can maintain  informal partnerships with South Africa. The country's main airport at Abidjan  has for years been one of the few permitted refueling stops for South African  Airways planes on the way to Europe.    Ivory Coast might be one of South Africa's most important diplomatic catches  because President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is considered the doyen of African  leaders, particularly in the set of former French colonies in West Africa.    Houphouet has never been a strict observer of political and economic sanctions  against the apartheid regime. For instance, South African Foreign Minister  Roelof F. (Pik) Botha was among the honored guests in September at the  consecration of Houphouet's massive new Roman Catholic basilica by Pope John  Paul II.    But diplomats and other political observers believe that Houphouet's opening of  official ties with South Africa will be a signal to other African leaders that  it is safe to move ahead on trade and diplomatic ties.    ""Once Houphouet's done it,"" says a diplomatic observer in Abidjan, ""quite a few  others will come scurrying in his wake.""

AFRICA;    MORE OF ITS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PRETORIA SINCE IT  BEGAN DISMANTLING APARTHEID. DIPLOMATIC TIES, THOUGH, MAY HAVE TO WAIT.      By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NAIROBI, Kenya      Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in  Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement  to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship  carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years.    But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of  Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It  is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa.    It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the  complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as  they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a  post-apartheid era.    The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in  September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de  Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African  countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast.  South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those  it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved  opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar  President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds  from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal  air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa.    These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing  until last year.    In the period of black independence, the only African government that  maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose  autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that  despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries  are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it.    That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy  whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new  Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's  rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil  war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas.    But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still  far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa  balloon in many places.    In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of  apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress  during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on  Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time  Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African  gasoline.    ""As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater  respectability,"" says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of  foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, ""for us to take up our role as an  important African country.""    There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from  supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except  informally.    Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they  could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may  disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might  also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside  investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking  for new investment opportunities.    South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up  for sale in Madagascar.    The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a  region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many  businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency  licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries.    ""The potential is enormous,"" says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's  regional vice president for Africa. ""If this part of the world became  acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world  scale.""    A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, ""Any (African)  businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down  there"" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African  companies.    Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official  disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries,  who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing  South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants.    With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South  Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of  industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa.    ""The whole of this area will stop looking to London and start looking to  Johannesburg"" for imported goods, says one East African businessman.    These include anything from military hardware, necessarily an industrial  specialty of sanction-beset South Africa, to automobile assembly kits for  plants in Zimbabwe and Kenya and fruits and vegetables that grow better in  South Africa's temperate climate than in the tropical zone girdling the rest of  the continent. South African wines, barred by trade sanctions from European and  American shops, are world-class.    ""A lot of things that Ivoirians consider indispensable to their lives, like  scrunchy apples, salad greens that don't grow here and wine, are cheaper coming  from South Africa than from France,"" says one diplomat in Abidjan, the capital  of affluent Ivory Coast.    Accordingly, planning in many countries for post-apartheid relations with South  Africa has been going on for far longer than their governments admit.    Kenya Airways's preparation for flights to Johannesburg began as long as a year  ago, sources say. The airline's purchase of three Boeing 757 aircraft, to be  delivered in January, was predicated partly on its ability to use two of them  to service the new Johannesburg route.    The World Bank's Jaycox says that not only the group of so-called front-line  states in southern Africa, but also the African National Congress and the  Pan-African Congress, have asked his institution to draw up economic forecasts  based on a new relationship between black-ruled Africa and South Africa.    But whether South Africa will be able to export prosperity to its neighbors is  open to question. Although some analysts suggest that South African  manufacturers might open satellite plants in neighboring countries to take  advantage of their cheaper labor, others note that these businesses will be  under pressure to first raise black South Africa's standard of living by  creating more jobs at home, not abroad.    So South African industry might view black Africa largely as an untapped market  for its exports. The net result of increased South African involvement in  Africa's economy could be harmful competition from its better-equipped and more  efficient manufacturers and growers.    A major victim could be Zimbabwe, whose once-impressive industrial structure,  built during its own period of isolated white-minority rule in the 1960s and  1970s -- is falling apart from old age and the total absence of outside  investment during its 10 years of black-ruled independence.    ""Manufacturing in Zimbabwe will crash,"" says one businessman with extensive  experience in Africa, ""because they can't compete with the efficiencies down  south.""    For all that, South Africa's apparent interest in reuniting with the rest of  its continent is based on more than just economics. One of the enduring  self-images of the Afrikaners of South Africa is that they are a white African  ""tribe,"" a view that underscores the group's discomfort at being so politically  isolated.    ""Yes, I am an African,"" De Klerk said last month during his state visit to  Senegal. ""My family fought in the first war in Africa against colonialism (the  Boer War), and I don't want to go anywhere else in my life.""    But the road to genuine political and economic cooperation will be marked by  large potholes; most business leaders and politicians knowledgeable about  improving ties choose to speak off the record, for political animosity to the  South African regime remains potent in black-ruled Africa.    ""There's lots of exploration going on now, but lots of countries are  constrained because they want their policies and actions to remain in harmony  with black South Africans,"" says Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a prominent African  banker.    Anyone seeking a hint of the pitfalls still confronting South Africa's desire  to become a regional player needs look no farther than the Kenya-South Africa  airline agreement.    The arrangement was announced in Nairobi on Oct. 4, with twice-weekly flights  set to begin Saturday. Travel agents began booking South African tourists into  Kenyan lodges, and seats on the first flights from South Africa quickly filled  up. Then African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela passed through  Nairobi's airport Oct. 14 in transit. He called an airport press conference to  blast the Kenyan government for what amounted to prematurely lifting sanctions.    Eleven days later, Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi, presumably cognizant that  the ANC could be ruling South Africa some day soon, unilaterally suspended the  airline deal until South Africa ""dismantles"" apartheid.    Kenya Airways officials privately acknowledge that they or the government  should have informed the ANC well in advance of the impending deal, in the  hopes of defusing any opposition. Business leaders and others in Nairobi now  regard the affair as a damaging lost opportunity to secure South African  goodwill and trade concessions.    ""It would be good to be first into South Africa,"" says one leading East African  businessman. ""You certainly don't want to be last.""    The Weekly Review, Kenya's most authoritative news publication, estimated the  potential lost revenue for Kenya Airways at nearly $23 million a year.    Perhaps the sector with the most to lose is tourism. Kenyan travel agents  estimated that easing travel restrictions could bring as many as 200,000 South  Africans annually to Kenyan game parks and, even more inviting, its beach  resorts. That would make South Africa the biggest source of tourists in Kenya  and increase total visits, which in 1988 came to 680,000 and brought $400  million into the country, by nearly 30%.    Prospects for reinstating the flight agreement are unclear right now -- the  suspension has still not been publicly acknowledged in Johannesburg -- but  Kenyan travel professionals say the important thing is to establish the flights  in time to attract beachgoers during the South African winter, beginning in  April or May.    Across Africa, open links with South Africa will bring to the surface plenty of  activity that has been going on quietly for as long as South Africa has been a  political pariah.    Sub-Saharan Africa's covert trade with South Africa has always been the  continent's worst-kept secret. In even the remotest up-country shops in Ivory  Coast, for instance, it is possible to buy a can of Coca-Cola with the legend  ""Keep South Africa Tidy"" embossed on the top. The labels of some consumer goods  found on the shelves in Zimbabwe supermarkets are written in Afrikaans.    Other ties are more subtle. Every Friday, a new, generally full Zambia Airways  plane takes off from Johannesburg for Lusaka, Zambia, and then continues to New  York. Few passengers ever get on or off the flight in Lusaka, and it is  considered largely a Zambia-assisted subterfuge allowing South Africans to  evade an American ban on direct flights to the United States from Johannesburg.    Of the 10 countries in the so-called Southern African Development Coordination  Conference (SADCC), a band of staunch anti-apartheid South African neighbors,  only two -- Tanzania and Angola -- officially bar all South African goods.  About 30% of the SADCC countries' total imports came from South Africa in 1986,  the latest year for which statistics are available. The share of SADCC exports  going to South Africa, 7%, exceeds the 4% that represents trade among the  conference members themselves.

In an interview in Tunis, where he is attending the  Organization of African Unity conference, Nzo confirmed that the  Cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian assistance in  Rwanda, but had not yet decided on the form it would take. The  decision, he said, might be influenced by proposals emanating  from the OAU conference, which might assign specific tasks to  certain member states. The Minister said the types of  assistance contemplated by South Africa included helping to ease  the burden imposed on Tanzania's resources by the influx of  thousands of refugees from Rwanda. This could include food and  medical aid.    While South Africa was not ready to contribute to any  international military force sent to enforce peace in Rwanda, it  would inevitably become involved in such operations in future  crises, he said. South Africa would, however, place much  greater emphasis on mediation, recognising that peace could not  be imposed from outside, as had been demonstrated in Somalia.    ""That would be the ideal -- for African countries themselves  to try to resolve their problems in an African way, which would  mean that mediators should come from African countries. We have  expert negotiators in our country who could very well be  deployed to assist in negotiations.""    Asked whether these negotiators might become involved in the  Angola dispute, Nzo said this might happen if the Angolans  wanted it. The recent upgrading of diplomatic relations between  South Africa and Angola enhanced the opportunity to discuss the  situation with Angolan government representatives. The contacts  would not be with the MPLA government alone, however. ""Unita  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] must not  be made to feel that sides are being taken because that could  produce an unfortunate result ...that would be  counter-productive.""    On the question of changing the nature and title of the  Frontline states now that confrontation with South Africa was no  longer necessary, Nzo said exchanges were taking place at the  OAU conference as a follow-up to the recent meeting of Frontline  leaders in Harare, where agreement was reached in principle to  the changes. Whatever body was set up in place of the Frontline  states would be structured to deal primarily with regional  co-operation on security matters. He believed that while the  grouping should still be confined to southern African countries,  it should be enlarged to bring in states like Swaziland and  Lesotho.    He said no policy had yet been worked out by the Government  on membership of or relations with the existing regional  economic groupings: the Southern African Customs Union, the  Southern African Development Community and the Preferential  Tariff Agreement grouping.    Expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome given to  South Africa at its first OAU conference, Nzo said he saw this  not as a honeymoon that would fade but as a beginning that had  to be consolidated. He rejected any concept of South Africa  inevitably dominating its neighbours. ""There must be relations  of mutual benefit all the time. We want from the beginning to  have relations based on trust, on total friendship.""    Nzo confirmed that President Mandela would visit Morocco on  his way to Tunisia for the OAU summit next week. The purpose  was to complete talks that could not be finalised during his  previous Moroccan visit.     "

The ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Council session,  adopted a whole series of measures intended to offer support to  the new government that will emerge from the elections on 26 and  28 April 1994. The promise of aid to South Africa is a  Community action falling under the heading of European foreign  policy.    From the outset, however, the EU specified that respect for  human rights and democracy were an essential element of  relations between the EU and South Africa.    First of all, the Twelve promise to work toward canceling UN  sanctions against Pretoria, which are still being imposed.    The current support program for the peaceful transition to  democracy in South Africa is continuing provisionally, and the  Union must continue to earmark the funds required for this  action, maintained the ministers. They recalled that they  intend to contribute mainly toward improving the standard of  living of the poorest sectors of the population.    As for long-term relations, the Twelve emphasized that they  do not consider South Africa as a developing country, but that  they are inclined to allow it to benefit from the same  commercial advantages as such countries. They also promised to  contribute toward the establishment and development of regional  cooperation between southeast African and Indian Ocean  countries. The EU is calling for mutual investments, encouraged  and guaranteed by various agreements. To this end, it will ask  the EIB (European Investment Bank) to extend its activities to  South Africa.    The Twelve said they were ready to collaborate in a large  number of areas, such as education and training, industry,  trade, telecommunications, research, and technology.    As soon as the new government takes office, the EU intends  to  support the establishment of political dialogue and encourage  the South African cabinet to work toward social justice and to  eliminate all forms of racial, political, religious, and  cultural discrimination.    The Twelve also confirmed that they wanted to hold an  international conference on 6 and 7 September 1994 in Berlin,  gathering together all the countries of southern Africa.     "
0,FT922-4428 ,"FT922-4428 _AN-CFEA9AD0FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (15): New market beckons for banks - Complicated merger streamlines financial services sector      By PHILIP GAWITH   THE South African financial services sector is in healthier shape than it was a year ago, and the man most responsible for this is Mr Piet Badenhorst, the formidable chief executive of Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa). Driven by a healthy ego and massive determination, he is a feared and respected figure in the banking community. Last year, he was the driving force behind the complicated merger which brought the United Building Society (UBS), Volkskas, Allied and part of the Sage group together to form Absa. This year he took the process a stage further by swallowing up Bankorp, the weakest of the big five banks in South Africa, in the process making Absa by far the largest bank in the country in terms of assets (the Standard Bank group remains largest by market capitalisation). Absa have a lot of digesting to do, and not all of it will be pleasant. 'Merger business is hell on wheels', in Mr Badenhorst's own graphic phrase. Apart from having to effect a very high number of retrenchments, Absa also have to come to terms with the rotten apples which constitute part of Bankorp's inheritance. As one senior banker notes: 'The last bite of the cherry may not be so sweet as the first."" While Absa, for some time yet, will remain preoccupied with putting its own house in order, the impacts of the shake-up in the sector promise to be far-reaching. Mr Badenhorst believes the formation of Absa will have two main effects: 'maverick marketing', the product of too many institutions competing for the same business, and epitomised by 'ridiculous rates of interest being paid and credit being offered without proper screening', will cease with four institutions now under the same umbrella. Second, with less competition for employees, terms of employment will become more realistic as, in Mr Badenhorst's words, the 'artificial scarcity of skills' disappears. 'The employment market is shifting to the employer,' he says. The significance of the Absa merger is that the operational savings are large enough to give the group a fundamental advantage in terms of providing a low-cost banking service. South Africa has a very sophisticated financial services sector, but it is very much oriented towards the needs of the white, essentially First World, community. The challenge of the future is to address the needs of the developing market - largely black, and Third World in nature. Mr Louis Shill, chairman of the Sage group and also chairman of the Life Offices Association (LOA), believes that the challenge facing all providers of financial services in South Africa is to 'get down our unit costs to provide mass market products'. The challenge to be overcome is that it is very difficult to be profitable with below-average sized products, whether they be bank accounts or life policies. Mr Shill believes that addressing the needs of the new market will require new structures. 'We can't take our company that is aimed at the very upper end of the market and adapt it to a completely different market. There's a world of difference between Harrods and Pick 'n Pay (a South African supermarket), though they both supply food.' New products will also be required and intensive education of staff and clients. Mr Shill notes, for example, that at the lower end of the market, life policies are primarily seen as savings devices, and it is not always appreciated that the money is not available on call. At the moment, addressing the needs of the black market tends to take the form of the large groups setting up satellite operations, such as Liberty's Charter Life and Southern's African Life, in the insurance field, and First National Bank's Future Bank initiative. Mr Badenhorst, however, argues that the process must go one stage further. He says there is a perception and a need in the black community that they need their own institutions. He envisages these developing, probably with the assistance of existing banks, initially at the lower end of the housing finance spectrum. Although the jockeying for position in the developing market is driven by a keen sense of where new business is going to come from, it goes further than this. Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, comments: 'The conflict between poverty and democracy is South Africa's greatest dilemma. If we want to survive in a democratic society we First World institutions must get involved.' He notes that the commercial banks play more of a role in the urban areas where their activities are centred. Addressing the financial and developmental needs of the rural communities is a burden, he suggests, which will have to be carried more by parastatal bodies. Other than addressing the developing market, the main strategic challenge facing the local banking industry is their re-integration into the world community. On the one hand, this involves setting up offices abroad. Local banks are anxious to 'follow the flag' and set up offices abroad so they can provide services, primarily trade finance and foreign exchange advice. On the other hand, banks are facing the prospect of foreign competition on the home front. The areas where this is most likely to come is in the 'blue-chip' corporate market and project finance. Foreign banks can set up representative offices, unrestrained by local capital requirements, and offer off-shore credit lines at lower rates than local banks. Their experience in project finance will probably also allow them to obtain a share of the business if significant capital projects such as the Columbus stainless steel venture get the go-ahead. Foreign banks will not attempt to compete with high-street banks and local merchant banks are also considered to have a strong hold on mergers and acquisitions business. The main day-to-day challenge for the banks is maintaining profitability in an inflationary environment. Although the impact of a protracted recession is evident in the sharply higher provisions for bad debts at the large banks, these have been more than offset by the comfortable interest margins of about 4 per cent that are being enjoyed. Recent results from the Standard Bank group, First National Bank and Nedcor saw earnings per share rise by 20 per cent in the case of the first two and 13 per cent in the case of Nedcor. Although all the banks are anxious to put assets on their books, demand for credit is low and banks themselves are lending very selectively. South Africa's main banks are all adequately capitalised, though it is difficult to maintain this position through retentions alone given the high inflation rate. This explains Standard's offering of a scrip dividend option and the recent rights offer by First National Bank, taking advantage of a favourable market rating.

0,FT923-6707 ,"FT923-6707 _AN-CHYBZABHFT 920822   FT  22 AUG 92 / Ugly scrum in South Africa: A symbolic battle for political power at the rugby ground      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Strange as it may seem for the land that invented apartheid, racial hatred seldom darkens a normal day in Johannesburg. But these are not normal times in South Africa. A raw battle for political power is under way, and the battlefield stretches from township street to rugby stadium. Thousands of rugby-mad whites at Cape Town's Newlands stadium will today have a chance to show whether they value the country's sense of interracial goodwill which has for so long defied the logic of apartheid - but which is under serious strain. They will be called upon to stand and observe a minute's silence for the victims of South Africa's political violence - almost all of them black. The occasion will be white South Africa's chance to demonstrate a spirit of reconciliation. Such gestures have become rare in recent months, whether from average citizens or from political leaders, white and black. The prospects for peace and progress in South Africa will partly depend on the rugby crowd's behaviour. The omens of the past week are not favourable, however. Last Saturday, when South Africa's rugby side met New Zealand's All Blacks, white fans defiled the sporting atmosphere with a loud and emotional rendering of the South African national anthem, a potent symbol of Afrikaner nationalism and for blacks, the ultimate token of apartheid. One liberal spectator tried to convey the ugly tone of the incident: 'People who didn't even know much Afrikaans (the language in which die Stem is written), who had certainly never sung it before, were singing so loud that the veins were standing out on their foreheads.' In the emotionally charged atmosphere of South Africa's first international rugby match for eight years - a match made possible by the anti-apartheid movement's decision to drop sport sanctions against Pretoria - some local newspapers commented that the incident had amounted to an obscene gesture directed at the new multi-racial South Africa. 'The very first chance we get to demonstrate new attitudes, to make some gesture towards reconciliation, we succeed only in showing ugly intransigence,' commented a shamed spectator in the weekly Financial Mail. But the incident reflected more than racial intolerance. It demonstrated an explosive anger among whites at their new and unaccustomed sense of powerlessness in the face of black political power. After 350 years as the dominant race, whites at the Ellis Park stadium found they had to accept restrictions by blacks, in the form of the African National Congress (ANC), which had banned the official display of national symbols, such as flags and anthems, at the match. Their response was defiance - they waved thousands of small flags, and twice spontaneously sang the national anthem, die Stem. It was also played officially, an act of defiance from a renegade rugby administrator. The message from Ellis Park was clear - whites may have voted to abolish apartheid in this year's referendum, but they did not vote for black rule. Ellis Park became just one more battlefield in the contest for power in the new South Africa - a chilling expression of ethnicity which both sides ignore at their peril. That contest, which has led to the breakdown of constitutional talks over the issue of black majority rule versus multi-racial power sharing, sparked a two-day general strike earlier this month and widespread labour disruption. It has left 7,000 dead in black townships since 1990, and has also taken a heavy toll on the country's morale. Immigration lawyers from Australia have found it fruitful to visit Johannesburg again, as white confidence plumbs new depths and professionals plan their escape from a troubled multi-racial future. 'Planning to emigrate?' asks the cheerful voice of the local radio announcer, ready with advice on international removals companies. Business, too, is fed up with political failure at the highest levels, and is casting around for its own separate peace with the unions to permit economic life to go on. Indeed, this month's general strike was nearly averted by a deal between the employers' body, Saccola, and the largest union federation, Cosatu. It involved agreement on a one-day work stoppage and on issues such as training and job creation. The accord failed in the end, but could be revived in future. Businessmen acknowledge such a deal would be largely a stop-gap measure. Business and the unions, on their own, cannot bring growth to an economy more troubled than at any time in recent memory. Real per capita GDP is expected to have shrunk by 9 per cent between 1990 and 1992, according to the Old Mutual, one of the country's leading insurers. Nothing short of a political deal can attract the investment needed for significant economic expansion. Such a deal - either involving agreement on a multi-racial interim government to restore order or a more comprehensive constitutional settlement yielding multi-party democracy - has so far proved elusive. Yesterday's news of a meeting between government and ANC officials is at best only a step to the resumption of talks. Both Mr FW de Klerk, the president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, his ANC counterpart, have repeatedly failed to rise above partisan political concerns in the interest of a broader national agenda. Indeed, Mr de Klerk seems to believe that strengthening his National Party serves the national interest by ensuring a powerful opposition to black majority rule. He also continues to prove unable or unwilling to take sufficiently strong action against his security forces. Both men should take note. Most blacks are fed up with the violence and poverty which for black South Africans are the most salient facts of life after apartheid. They are unlikely to support the open-ended campaign of mass action favoured by ANC radicals. Whites, meanwhile, are at best despondent, at worst angry. South Africa needs a deal soon to restore at least a measure of stability. The country's leaders may find that, if they miss this opportunity for peace, another may not open up for some time.

0,FT922-4440 ,"FT922-4440 _AN-CFEA9ADOFT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (1): Democracy in the balance - The transition to multiracial rule is proving difficult and slow as whites battle to preserve power and privilege. Patti Waldmeir assesses the prospect for establishing freedom and stability in one of the most divided societies in the world      By PATTI WALDMEIR   WHAT will replace apartheid in South Africa? Will South Africans rise above their 350-year history of division and exploitation to build a liberal, multiracial democracy, a model to divided societies worldwide? Will they experiment with democracy, but fail, leaving black domination to replace white oppression? Or will the country's politicians, black and white, do an unholy deal to stifle dissent and restore civil order, jointly imposing authoritarian rule? After two years of horrifying political violence, tortuous negotiations which have yielded little obvious progress, an accelerating decline in black living standards, and an explosion of crime, many South Africans are suffering from a crisis of confidence about their future. The tremendous sense of relief and elation which greeted the release from prison two years ago of Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress (ANC) president - and the vision of a brave new egalitarian future which he inspired - has proved difficult to sustain under the pressures of political transition. The historical imperatives which drove white and black to the negotiating table remain the same - in spite of the failure of last month's plenary session of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional negotiating forum. Codesa is floundering, and the installation of a multiracial interim government, which had been expected within weeks, now seems likely to be delayed. But the reality remains that neither the ANC, the largest black group, nor the ruling National Party, the most powerful white party, can run South Africa on its own. They need each other, and sooner or later, they will strike a deal. What is not certain is whether it will be a fully democratic deal. 'There is nothing inevitable about a democratic outcome to transition in South Africa,' says Professor Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, a former liberal politician who has stimulated debate on future political systems. 'I think we have the capacity to become democratic, but if I have to be very frank, I cannot see us approaching it within the next 10 years . . . The dynamics of the transition may precipitate undemocratic options.' None of the 19 parties to Codesa exhibit truly democratic instincts. They all pay lip service to democracy. But the National Party has only recently discovered the need for political tolerance - now that its own interests are at risk - and the ANC permits dissent only so long as it does not threaten unity. Both are deeply suspicious of the press, intolerant of criticism, dirigiste in their economic policies and authoritarian by nature. Indeed, the two sides have already largely agreed that a multi-party interim government should retain similar emergency powers to those exercised so brutally by the National Party, which detained 40,000 people in the late 1980s. In a passage chillingly reminiscent of the bad old days of apartheid, a working document agreed to by all the Codesa parties notes that 'special measures are necessary to deal with the threat to public order during the transitional period', including detention without trial (subject to unspecified 'procedural controls'), and powers to declare a state of emergency on the advice of an unelected interim executive appointed by Codesa. Senior National Party officials admit privately that they envisage a period of authoritarian rule until the end of the decade - imposed in the interests of stability and economic growth - and the ANC, worried about its ability to control its own constituents, seems likely to agree. Both have already agreed to rule by coalition, in a government of national unity aimed at reconciling all South Africans to a new constitution. The duration of the coalition is still in dispute: the government wants coalition government to be entrenched in an interim and a permanent constitution. If the National Party has its way, South Africa will be governed for decades by a coalition which would guarantee the political role of whites. The ANC, for its part, is intent on achieving majority rule - though it favours voluntary coalition for the first two to five years of the new regime. Some moderate ANC officials believe the government of national unity should last until the end of the century. For the National Party, though, coalition government on its own will not be enough to prevent abuse of power by the (black) majority. It wants a constitution which devolves power substantially to regional and local government - making it impossible for central government to dominate. The party's position is that South Africa's fragmented and fractious society cannot be governed peacefully from the centre. That may well be so, but the drive for regionalism has a more immediate goal: to accommodate the political ambitions of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who would be guaranteed power in his ethnic base of Natal. He could never compete as a national politician but he would resist - perhaps violently - being sidelined under a unitary constitution. Strong regional government would achieve another cherished National Party goal. It would ensure that the Western Cape, the only region where blacks do not form the majority, would become, in the words of one junior minister, a kind of 'haven for civilised western values'. (This assumes that whites and coloureds (mixed-race peoples) would make common cause together against Africans, probably a realistic assumption.) The ANC, with its ideal of non-racialism, finds such notions abhorrent but its officials are realistic enough to admit that ethnicity cannot simply be wished away, and that devolution can help accommodate it. In a recent paper entitled 'Rooting Democracy on African Soil', ANC constitutional lawyer Zola Skweyiya argues: 'It is necessary to consider the challenge that ethnicity poses to democratic transformation and the way in which this challenge may be diffused. 'The experiences of independent Africa, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the former USSR have demonstrated clearly how difficult it is to replace individual ethnic identities by a commitment to a single overarching nationalism.' But Mr Skweyiya acknowledges that his view is not received wisdom within the ANC and many tough battles lie ahead before the new government's structure is agreed. Indeed, the next few months could prove the most difficult so far in the transition. Codesa must resolve the central question of who wields power in the new South Africa. Will whites have an effective veto, through an upper house packed with political minorities? Will they exercise a veto over the new constitution, by insisting that all clauses are passed by three-quarters majority? How much power will devolve to regions? The ANC will not easily relinquish its demand for a majority-rule constitution, but this is incompatible with the National Party's bottom line  -a large political role for whites, guaranteed indefinitely. The movement will be tempted to exercise its own veto over the process of reform, by calling for a general strike and other forms of mass protest. Meanwhile, economic growth - which is so crucial to stability - will continue to be sabotaged by political upheaval. But given South Africa's peculiar legacy of apartheid and ethnic diversity, poverty and isolation, nation-building was never going to be easy. With any luck, the inter-racial goodwill which persists against all the odds, the Christian commitment of most South Africans, and the desire for economic advancement will ensure that South Africa avoids the risk of social disintegration. It remains to be seen whether democracy will survive the strains of the transition.  The Financial Times   London Page I  "

The federal cabinet decided to end the 19-year-old ban and  has instructed public and private institutions that obstacles no  longer existed for dealing with South Africa, they sa?d.    Diplomats said the cabinet decision to end the boyco?t would  pave the way for establishment of diplomatic ties between the  UAE and South Africa.    The Dubai-based daily AL-BAYAN said the cabinet decision  cancelled a 1975 federal law banning any form of dealing with  South Africa because of its former system of apartheid.    The decision coincides with Pretoria's attempts to enter the  Gulf market, which is dominated by Japan, western countries and  other industrial powers.    South Africa's drive has already produced results. Its trade  with the UAE surged to around 150 million dirhams (40.8 million  dollars) in 1993 from less than 20 million dirhams (5.4 million  dollars) in 1992.    Officials from both sides expect trade to grow steadily in  coming years given their large business potential.    ""South Africa enjoys great economic and trade potentials,""  the director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  'Abd-al- Rahman al-Mutaywi, said after returning Saturday from a  business trip to Johannesburg.    He said South Africa planned another major trade exhibition  in Dubai in May following the success of its first Middle East  fair in 1992.    Officials said South Africa was still planning to open a  commercial office in the United Arab Emirate of Dubayy to boost  exports to Iran and the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,  Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE.

By SHARON BERNSTEIN      Claiming that the series ""South Africa Now"" is biased in favor of the African  National Congress, programmers at Los Angeles public-television station KCET  have decided not to carry the public-affairs program when its new season begins  in November.    The Committee on Media Integrity, a conservative media coalition, claimed  victory Friday for the decision. The group, led by David Horowitz, a former  Ramparts magazine editor who went on to co-author the book ""Destructive  Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s,"" has been waging a letter-writing  campaign and threatening legal action against KCET Channel 28 for airing ""South  Africa Now"" and other programs that it claims have a leftist bias.    Horowitz, who said he is opposed to apartheid but also is opposed to the  African National Congress, said that he had had several meetings about ""South  Africa Now"" with Stephen Kulczycki, senior vice president and station manager  at KCET.    ""I felt that the show was posing as a news report, but it was really just doing  propaganda,"" Horowitz said.    Kulczycki denied Friday that pressure from Horowitz's group had anything to do  with his decision not to renew the series, which has been running on Sundays at  9 a.m. He said that ""South Africa Now,"" which is produced in New York by  Globalvision Inc. and is seen on 80 U.S. public-TV stations, gives only cursory  attention to views of liberal whites and blacks, as well as to the South  African government and others who differ with the policies of the African  National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela.    ""As time has gone by, it appears more clear that the main issue in South Africa  is not whether there will be apartheid, but what kind of anti-apartheid  government in South Africa would come into power,"" Kulczycki said. ""When it  ('South Africa Now') was an advocacy program and the only issue was apartheid,  that was something many people were willing to accept. But in recent weeks and  months, the story has become more complicated and the producers don't seem to  want to present a broad spectrum of views.""    Kulczycki said that KCET was planning to run a number of specials about South  Africa, which would present all sides of the issues there. And he said that if  Globalvision were to produce specials instead of a series, he would consider  them ""on a case-by-case basis.""    The decision not to renew ""South Africa Now"" has sparked anger and surprise  among leaders in Southern California's African-American community, who have  begun to wage a telephone and letter-writing campaign of their own to urge the  program's re-instatement.    ""Whatever happened to the marketplace of ideas?"" said Gerald Horne, a professor  of black studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""I guess  KCET is saying that their marketplace is limited, that you can only do a  certain amount of shopping there.""    Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell, who has been active in the  anti-apartheid movement, said Friday that he is so outraged by KCET's action  that he is considering asking the council to withhold funding from the station  next year. Last year, city-approved grants to KCET totaled $25,000.    ""KCET puts its integrity on the line with this decision,"" Farrell said. Even if  the program does focus on the African National Congress, Farrell said, ""The ANC  is in fact engaged in a discussion with the South African government leading to  what is going to be a democracy in South Africa. (KCET) says the ANC is not the  voice of the South African majority -- (South African President) F. W. De Klerk  obviously thinks it is.""    Farrell said that he is working with other leaders in the black community to  oppose the decision. And the councilman said he plans to meet personally with  members of the KCET board of directors and with station president William  Kobin.    Horne said that he has watched ""South Africa Now"" every week since it went on  the air in 1989 and does not believe that it is biased.    ""It covered the black consciousness movement, it covered Desmond Tutu, it  covered the Pan African Congress, and it covered the white minority regime,""  Horne said. ""I take it that those who opposed 'South Africa Now' would also  have opposed a show on opposition to Idi Amin or the opposition to Germany in  1936 and wanted balance there.""    Danny Schechter, executive producer of ""South Africa Now,"" said that he  resented the claim that his program was biased. ""I have won several news Emmys,  including two national Emmys for work on (ABC's) '20/20,' where I was a  producer for nine years,"" Schechter said. ""I've been a Nieman Fellow at  Harvard.

Direct investment in  South Africa has stagnated at around 2 billion German marks [DM]  since 1989. Martin Kraemer, manager of the Africa Association,  is content if German investors are able to keep their position  at all. Well-established companies, such as Bayer, BMW,  Hoechst, Mercedes, Siemens, or Volkswagen might manage a smooth  transition to the time after the elections. Yet, as many as 300  German companies, that is about half of all German investors in  Africa, are represented in South Africa, employing a total of  36,000 staff.    According to the Africa Association, the fact that German  exporters could maintain their business with the continent's  most important trading partner ""in spite of the reform process""  is a success. While German exports stagnated at DM3.27 billion,  German imports from South Africa declined by 18 percent, to  DM1.95 billion, last year. After sanctions were lifted, South  Africa increased its exports of gold, copper, manganese, and  other ores to the Far East, East Europe, and the Middle East.    The Federal Government, which will hold the European Union  [EU] presidency in the second half of 1994, is skeptical about  African National Congress politicians' attempts to join the Lome  Agreement with the EU. The accession process is too lengthy,  and the system for stabilizing raw materials prices would not  cope very well with the membership of raw-materials supplier  South Africa, Christian Democratic Party development expert  Volkmar Koehler said at the African Economic Day in Hamburg.  Also, membership of the threshold country would lower the  amount of aid for the total 69 poor countries in Africa, the  Caribbean, and the Pacific area (ACP). Not only would all ACP  and EU countries have to agree to membership, but it is also  doubtful whether South Africa would meet the criteria of a  developing country.     "

AFRICAN IMAGE GAINS FROM NAMIBIA REBELS' MISSTEP      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South African military intelligence detected a buildup of rebel forces across  the Namibian border with Angola back in January. South Africans monitored  guerrilla meetings, saw the arrival of fresh uniforms and heard talk of an  invasion to ""finally chase the Boers out.""    But when South African officials complained to the world, as they often do, few  believed them.    Just as South Africa had warned, though, the guerrilla buildup developed into a  major cross-border incursion by the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), beginning only hours after a U.N. independence plan went into effect  April 1.    SWAPO's violation of the peace accord shook the world's high regard for the  liberation movement. But, at the same time, it gave South Africa -- often  considered the chief destabilizing influence in southern Africa -- a rare  moment on the diplomatic high ground.    Long accustomed to international scorn, South Africa's white minority-led  government suddenly has found itself in the world's good graces. SWAPO, with  U.N. support, had battled for 24 years to end South African rule of this  territory, sometimes called South-West Africa. But, literally overnight, South  Africa's troops were fighting SWAPO with U.N. blessing. And, after some initial  skepticism, the United Nations and Western governments that are often critical  of South Africa began believing Pretoria's version of events here.    South African officials, in a smug, I-told-you-so mood, have jetted in and out  of Windhoek, capital of this vast territory, to bask in their new credibility.  Even though the fighting has diminished and SWAPO insurgents are said to be  crossing northward back to their refuge in Angola, South Africa has yet to tire  of reminding foreign journalists that South Africa abided by its agreement to  follow the U.N. plan for Namibian independence while SWAPO did not.    ""There is not a responsible government in the world today that does not know  exactly whatSWAPO has done,"" South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. (Pik)  Botha, said recently. ""We wish it had never occurred. If the result is that  SWAPO's leadership pays a heavy price for it, that was not of our doing.""    Any threat to SWAPO's image is welcome in Pretoria, where the country that has  governed Namibia for 74 years fears that a Marxist SWAPO government will come  to power in November's U.N.-monitored elections. Despite widespread  condemnation of SWAPO's invasion, the insurgent movement remains the probable  winner of Namibia's first free and fair elections.    SWAPO's political opponents, chief among them the multiracial, capitalistic  Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), have taken to the streets with a  well-funded campaign to discredit SWAPO.    Several hundred black Namibians wearing alliance T-shirts turned up this week  at a South African military base in the northern Namibia city of Oshakati --  SWAPO's political power base -- to protest the incursions.    The alliance supporters carried signs reading ""Don't Sabotage 435,"" referring  to the U.N. independence plan for Namibia, and ""SWAPO -- Don't Kill the Peace.""    Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's president, ""failed hopelessly in his attempt to take over  Namibia by force,"" said Barney Barnes, head of a small political party that  merged with Democratic Turnhalle this week. ""In the process, he annoyed the  whole international community.""      A Shifting Story    Nujoma first said his forces were already inside northern Namibia before the  peace process began, but few world leaders believed him. Later, Nujoma  acknowledged that some of his rebel forces did cross the border, but only to  turn themselves over to the U.N. peacekeeping troops. Now Nujoma has accused  South Africa of hiding its advance knowledge of the infiltration in order to  justify an attack on SWAPO and have an excuse to back out of the independence  process.    Many international leaders not accustomed to siding with South Africa admit  that they agree with Botha. And even SWAPO's most ardent supporters in Africa  have criticized Nujoma.    Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has provided sanctuary for the  rebels, said his country ""regrets that the SWAPO leadership could not exercise  total control over its guerrillas at the critical moment.""    Botha goes much further. ""I don't see how the SWAPO leadership could have been  so stupid,"" the foreign minister told viewers of state-run television recently.    But the insurgents' support among Namibians remains strong. Several thousand  SWAPO supporters turned out Sunday in a black township near Windhoek for a  memorial service for guerrillas killed in 10 days of conflict. The service was  for the 38 fighters that SWAPO says were killed, but Namibian security forces  say more than 275 guerrillas have actually died in the battles.    ""We are here to pay tribute to heroic Namibians who have lost their lives in  the north of our land,"" the Rev. Jackie Basson told the mourners. ""The  independence we have been fighting for for years is being threatened by  unprovoked attacks by South Africa.""    Botha has lately suggested that SWAPO's actions have made South Africa less  willing to negotiate with other liberation movements, such as the outlawed  African National Congress, the principal liberation movement in South Africa.    ""We have no more illusions,"" Botha said. ""This perfidy by SWAPO has dealt the  good and positive prospects of negotiation politics a blow. One doesn't know  anymore who one can believe.""    For all its newly charged rhetoric, though, South Africa has passed up several  opportunities to scuttle the peace process here.    ""They had their chance to sweep it off the table and they didn't,"" a political  analyst in Namibia said recently. ""That must mean they're serious.""

0,FT923-7882 ,"FT923-7882 _AN-CHRANAEDFT 920814   FT  14 AUG 92 / Bullishness in Buenos Aires: John Barham assesses new confidence in Argentine investment      By JOHN BARHAM   MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, confidently predicts that his country is on the verge of investment growth the like of which it has not seen since the eve of the third world debt crisis. He expects investments to double by the end of this year to 20 per cent of gross domestic product from 10 per cent last year. If he is right, it would be as significant an achievement as the defeat of hyperinflation. It would ensure a long life for his market-oriented reforms by generating the 6 per cent a year growth he has targetted and rekindling Argentina's hopes of joining the developed world. Investment rates have fallen to sub-Sahara African levels since they peaked at 22.8 per cent of GDP in 1980 - a large part of which was hugely wasteful public sector capital spending financed by a rising foreign debt. The result has been a visibly collapsing infrastructure, obsolete industry and worsening poverty. The economy is still the same size as in 1980, but the population has increased by 14 per cent since then. Now it is all change. The atmosphere for investment has rarely been so good: inflation has fallen to 19 per cent a year, the economy has been thrown open to free competition and the government has scrapped laws that discriminated against foreign investment. Not everybody shares Mr Cavallo's optimism but something is stirring in the rotten hulk of Argentina's economy. Companies are retooling as they slowly regain confidence. New apartment blocks are sprouting all over Buenos Aires, a capital city that has seen hardly any new building for more than a decade. Business consultants and investment bankers are overwhelmed with work re-organising chaotic corporate structures and tangled finances. Investment is being focused in three areas. First, in newly-privatised utilities, which are expected to invest the equivalent of Dollars 32.93bn in the next eight years, comparable with an average of 2.3 per cent of GDP a year. Fiel, an industry-funded thinktank, says infrastructure investments made by private companies should be far more productive than the corrupt state, which it reckons to have wasted Dollars 35bn-plus in 1970-1991. Second, investment is being channelled into the services sector where profit margins are still attractive. Money is going into shopping centres, housing, tourism and entertainment - almost any sector shielded from the avalanche of imports that began pouring into Argentina 18 months ago. Last comes industry. Although hard data do not exist, Mr Cavallo points to indicators, such as the 123 per cent increase in capital goods imports to Dollars 1.11bn in 1991. This confirms anecdotal evidence that cautious businessmen are retooling to increase productivity of existing plant before beginning any ambitious greenfield investments. It is difficult to estimate what part of the hoped-for investment recovery might be from abroad. However, foreign direct investment, which peaked at Dollars 927m in 1981 before the debt crisis, is showing firm signs of recovery. Last year it was up to Dollars 465m, compared with Dollars 333m in 1990. Despite these encouraging trends, there are a number of disturbing signs. To begin with, most independent economists disagree with Mr Cavallo's optimistic forecasts. They estimate investment at only 12-14 per cent of GDP, doubting whether it will reach 20 per cent of GDP this year, and expect growth of just 2-3 per cent a year. Industrialists also complain that the government is not doing enough to encourage investment in export-oriented manufacturing. Most industrial investment is taking place in sectors that do not compete with imports or are aimed at meeting domestic demand. They question the promises by Mr Cavallo of improvement in the economy's overall efficiency. Argentina remains an inefficient, high-cost economy unable to compete internationally except in agricultural commodities. Wages are high and productivity low and the crumbling infrastructure is a serious drag on profitability. What is worrying is that Argentina's experience so far with privatisation has resulted in inefficient and costly services, rather than the reverse. Mr Jose Luis Machinea, a respected opposition economist, adds that investment seems to be funded mainly from foreign sources and he warns this could have an 'enormous impact on the balance of payments in future years'. He reckons Argentina needs to import at least Dollars 5bn in capital this year and Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn in 1993. He warns that this may be unsustainable if investors lose confidence in Mr Cavallo's reforms. One source of concern is a deteriorating trade balance. Argentina ran a Dollars 302m trade deficit during the first quarter this year and could register its first annual deficit since 1981. If that does happen, confidence in government policy could be shaken. Another concern is that business people may lack the skills to survive in a stable, open economy. Mr Eugenio Reynal, a director of Merchant Bankers Asociados, an investment bank, says: 'Companies are realising they lack the management to deal with change. There really are very serious problems with management.' What's more, Argentina has never created a stable business environment. Laws, rules, regulations - even ministers and entire policies - can shift with bewildering unpredictability. Mr Miguel Angel Broda, a leading management consultant, says political concern is rising, now that the government is under increasing pressure to dilute reform as incomes fall, demand weakens and businesses fail. He says: 'The question is - will (President Carlos) Menem stand firm? We are entering an 18-month period of risk. I think his survival instinct will make him fight for stability.'

The EU's Ministerial Council of Foreign Affairs said in a  statement: ""The Union intends to send a strong political signal  to the incoming government and to the South African population.""    The Council agreed in principle to include South Africa in  its general system of preferences (GSP) comprising low tariffs  on manufactured imports from developing countries.    The decision was the centrepiece of proposals for the rapid  deepening of economic and political relations with South Africa  pending the negotiation of a comprehensive new system of  political, trade and economic links.    A formal decision on the GSP issue is expected following the  EU's 10-year review of its GSP system in May, and consultations  with other developing countries linked to the EU in the Lome  trade-and-aid agreement.    The EU also agreed in principle to extend its ""rules of  origin"" to South Africa, which means that South African  components of goods partly manufactured in other countries of  the region would also benefit from low tariffs.    And the Council agreed to pursue schemes for promoting and  protecting foreign investments in South Africa, and to boost  cooperation in such areas as education, industry,  telecommunications, science and technology.    ""We want South Africa to become a motor of economic growth  in  southern Africa,"" an EU spokesman said, adding that the GSP  break would boost South African exports of manufactured and  high-tech goods.    The EU is South Africa's biggest trading partner, but most  of  its imports of South African products currently comprise raw  materials.    Trade between the two sides totalled ECU10.8 billion (12  billion dollars) over the first nine months of 1993, resulting  in a trade surplus of ECU2.59 billion (2.95 billion dollars) for  the EU.    The EU has already dismantled all economic sanctions against  South Africa, and Tuesday's decision is the first element of a  new era of EU-South African links to replace the frosty  relations of the apartheid years.    The EU Council also proposed to open negotiations for a  strong interim agreement with the new South African government  soon after the elections, linking comprehensive cooperation with  respect for democracy and human rights.    And it agreed to use its influence at the United Nations to  have lifted the last remaining sanctions against South Africa --  an embargo on arms sales and military cooperation.     "

On behalf of the State Council, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua told  the conference that there are three essential requirements in  bringing about rural electrification: policy implementation,  self-reliance, and vigorous utilization of rich local  resources. He said that the CPC Central Committee and State  Council have always been deeply concerned about agriculture,  rural areas, and farmers. They are also deeply concerned about  the process of rural electrification. He urged electricity and  other departments and sectors to cooperate with each other;  enlist the support of local governments and people; redouble  their efforts in implementing the project of using electricity  supplies to alleviate poverty; help the broad masses overcome  poverty and achieve prosperity; and make new, solid  contributions to a thriving rural economy.    It has been learned that China's rural electrification  process, which started in the 1960's, has achieved remarkable  progress since China started implementing the policy of reform  and opening up. By the end of 1993, electricity consumption at  the county and lower levels reached 249 billion kwh, or 35  percent of the nation's total; 97 percent of townships, 93  percent of villages, and 89 percent of farmers' households had  been provided with electricity, showing an increase of 5.2,  14.9, and 23.7 percent, respectively, over the 1980 levels. Per  capita annual electricity consumption for the rural population  reached 48 kwh in 1993, 7.9 times the figure for 1978.  Nationwide, 144 counties have accomplished rural electrification  while plans for rudimentary electrification through the  development of hydroelectric power stations are being carried  out smoothly in 200 counties. Power stations are being built in  the countryside nationwide at different levels and through  multiple channels. A structure of rural power sources that  include electricity supplies from the major power grids, small  hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations, and wind and solar  energy is beginning to take shape.    However, due to the restraints of a multitude of historical  and economic factors and natural conditions, there are still 28  counties, 1,269 towns, and 54,860 villages that have virtually  no electricity supply. About 120 million farmers in  poverty-stricken areas in a dozen provinces and autonomous  regions, mostly in central and western China, are waiting to get  electricity. These areas, often sparsely populated and  economically undeveloped, are the most difficult to electrify  because they are far from major power grids, and the local  finances are tight.    At the conference, the MPI put forward the ""Program for  Electrifying China's Countryside in the 1990's."" Among its  primary targets are supplying electricity to all counties by the  year 2000 so that most of the poverty-stricken villages and over  95 percent of farmers' households will have electricity. It  also calls for building 1,000 counties with electricity across  the country. These targets have been incorporated as key parts  of the State Council's plan for helping 80 million people  overcome poverty in the next seven years.    It has been learned that the MPI's ""project of alleviating  poverty and bringing about common prosperity through the supply  of electricity"" has received vigorous support from local  governments. The Shandong Provincial Power Bureau, for example,  has announced a six-point preferential policy. The Inner  Mongolian Autonomous Region worked out a plan of providing power  supplies to all villages. Shaanxi Province has announced a plan  of electrifying impoverished areas in three steps. The meeting  urged local governments and national departments in charge of  planning, economics, electricity, and poverty alleviation to  work as one and make contributions to providing electricity to  farmers' households across the nation.

The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to  supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for  the announcement of the results of the South African elections,  in order on that basis to organize relations with the next  government in Pretoria.    Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349  [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at  that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in  Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations  between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90  percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran.  Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National  Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in  South Africa. In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa.

0,FT941-15081 ,"FT941-15081 _AN-EAQCKAEGFT 940117   FT  17 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets This Week: A growing trend towards Africa - The Emerging Investor      By PHILIP GAWITH   Will 1994 be Africa's year, the year in which international investors finally get the 'virgin' continent into their sights? Certainly there is a growing body of opinion, both in Africa and beyond, that believes this will be the case. Indeed, it can be argued that this trend is already under way. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange foreigners were prominent throughout 1993, initially in the gold and bond markets and later as buyers of industrial stocks too. Figures supplied by Barings Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthening in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. They have also been evident in Botswana, while foreign buying on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange between late June and December was enough to cause the Industrial index to more than double. Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Management, the London-based adviser to many of the world's largest emerging market funds, is one who believes that the continent's time has come. 'Looking at Africa is very much at the top of their (emerging market funds) agenda. There is a terrific willingness to believe in the African story.' This can be traced to three important structural changes. Clearly the catalytic event has been South Africa's rehabilitation as a respectable investment destination. This has caused great excitement in the US and the re-examination of the JSE has inevitably rebounded to the benefit of other regional markets. Without the JSE, it would be doubtful how much attention emerging market investors would devote to the other markets. Since Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, called for an end to financial sanctions against South Africa in September, there has been a veritable stampede of US visitors to Johannesburg. Significant investment flows have followed and the outlook for 1994 appears even more cheery. Mr Morland reckons that the first half of 1994 will see at least five South Africa or Southern Africa funds launched. Taken together with other African funds and country funds, he believes there will be at least 10 funds channelling money into South Africa next year. The second important change concerns Africa itself. If the 1960s saw the political winds of change blow through the continent, then the 1990s are witnessing some equivalent economic changes as governments increasingly embrace market economics after costly socialist experiments. The catalyst for these changes has been the end of the cold war, meaning no more eastern European bloc hand-outs, and the inexorable impoverishment of African economies through deteriorating terms of trade and poor economic management. Now, as Mr Morland comments, 'You either eat at the IMF's table, or you don't eat at all.' This has led to a huge shift in economic orientation, including a more favourable outlook towards equity markets. In 1983, for example, Mr Bernard Chidzero, the Zimbabwe finance minister, was able to extravagantly denounce the ZSE as 'the prostitute of the economy'. Ten years later the same Mr Chidzero used his budget to introduce reforms aimed at encouraging the development of the ZSE: foreign investors being allowed to buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE; reductions in capital gains tax on share market investment to 10 per cent from 30 per cent and the withholding tax on dividends declared by quoted companies to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. The final change concerns the burgeoning emerging market movement, particularly in the US, with an increasing portion of assets earmarked for emerging markets and offshore investment. A November survey by the US firm Kleiman International Consultants found that international institutional investment in emerging markets had risen by 3 per cent to 13 per cent of international funds in 1993, with allocation over the past five years rising more than five-fold. Even within this trend, Africa has a lot of catching up to do. A recent survey by Micropal of global emerging market funds found that the 54 largest of these funds had invested only about Dollars 40m out of Dollars 11.5bn (0.35 per cent). Clearly, if Africa in general and South Africa in particular becomes a focus for emerging market funds, then this in itself will be good reason to be invested there. To this rosy scenario, however, some cautionary caveats about Africa must be entered. Firstly, even by emerging market standards, Africa is an unusual beast. On the one hand, the JSE with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 105bn is much larger than the Dollars 20-Dollars 60bn average for emerging markets. On the other hand, most of the other African markets - Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe (with Zambia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania all on the point of opening) - are minuscule. A recent survey by Mr Michel ZhuParris of Morgan Stanley Asset Management found that between them Africa's newly emerging markets had only 12 liquid stocks with market capitalisations greater than Dollars 100m (with seven of these trading in Morocco). Second, although Africa is fairly cheap compared with many world markets, it has been cheap for a long time and for good reason. A major factor here is that investors are, with the exception of the Botswana pula, investing in very weak, devaluing currencies. Another problem is that the markets are shallow, illiquid and small. Also, in some cases, not the JSE, there is a dearth of domestic investors to piggyback on which can cause liquidity problems. Mr Mark Tunmer, chairman of the ZSE, comments: 'Our big problem is that we've got all the demand but nothing to sell.' He reckons that if the ZSE had been able to satisfy demand, foreign flows would have been four to five times larger. This problem has also affected the JSE, where buyers have had to get used to the idea that fulfilling a big order can take more than a week. These liquidity problems should, however, ease over time. If markets do enjoy a bull run this will stimulate new issues and rights issues, thereby increasing the amount of stock in circulation. A further factor to consider is that African markets are much more dependent on commodity prices and politicians than many other emerging markets. Investors not fully aware of developments could well burn their fingers. On the commodity front, developments are good. Important commodities like gold, cocoa and coffee have broken out of long bear cycles. The politicians may be behaving better, but in some cases the depth of commitment to financial discipline and good government remains to be tested. In the final analysis, what happens in South Africa will probably determine the extent to which other regional markets flourish.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Friday      Week on week change Stock                    Country      close          Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)     Brazil       0.02           0.01     67.6 Eczacibasi Ilac           Turkey       1.11           0.38     53.2 Kordosa                   Turkey       0.98           0.32     49.3 Banco Itau (Pfd)          Brazil       0.30           0.09     47.4 Alarko Holding            Turkey       2.44           0.76     45.4 Eczacibasi Yatirim        Turkey       0.95           0.26     38.9 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)      Brazil       0.02           0.01     36.9 Arcelik                   Turkey       1.90           0.42     28.4 Turk Demir Dokum          Turkey       1.52           0.29     23.3 Brisa                     Turkey       2.22           0.41     22.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT931-1042 ,"FT931-1042 _AN-DCZBZAF3FT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Venezuela: little trust of state among the poorest      By STEPHEN FIDLER   BARRIO Union, rising up the slopes of the mountains east of Caracas, is by no means the worst of the slums in Venezuela, one of the region's richer countries. It is a comparatively old barrios bajos, having emerged in the 1950s. Most houses are built of cinder-block rather than the chipboard that dominates newer slums. The residents paint a depressing picture of a decline in the 1980s which progressively worsened. 'The years 1988, 1989 and 1990 were disastrous for the Barrio Union,' says a community leader, Ms Cira Macado. In almost every contact with the state, the citizens of Barrio Union are given reason for deeper distrust. They see police in league with the drug traffickers; soldiers arriving with weapons to sell to criminals; politicians who arrive just before election time laden with promises. The country is Latin America's most urban society - 85 per cent of the population lives in the cities. The government put in place 'targeted' poverty programmes after the February 1989 food riots. Yet claiming the food and other benefits often means travelling long distances, and hours in queues waiting for handouts. These targeted measures are described by Mr Gustavo Marquez, an expert in poverty at the Caracas business school IESA, as 'the most important effort ever made by any government in Venezuela to support low income groups through an economic crisis'. However,although in 1991 the government spent close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 704m) - 2 per cent of GDP - on these programmes, he says they were too little to compensate the poor for the fall in real incomes. Mr Marquez says the exclusive emphasis on poverty alleviation is misplaced. 'We need to produce policies that are able to integrate the poor as consumers and producers in a growing economy. Growth and enhanced availability and access to high-quality social services, particularly education and health, are the proven way out of poverty.' The quality of health and education provision has declined sharply through the 1980s. Government spending on these did not drop drastically, but the allocation of resources is uneven, and often heavily weighted towards administration costs. Yet not all is not pessimism. The government has enlisted the help of voluntary organisations. It has sought a decentralisation of power and to enhance the role of state and local government. Channelling money into local projects has, in areas such as Nueva Tacagua, met with significant success. Nueva Tacagua, a barrio perched high over the west of Caracas, is home to 100,000 people. In 1989, it suffered fires, floods and collapse of mountainside houses. The lack of official response prompted residents to take matters into their own hands. In an unusual exercise of democracy, they established a programme for developing the area. Out of it emerged a local leadership, not linked to political parties, and an organisation covering education, health and environment. However, the extent to which small community groups can be expected to administer a nationwide system of poverty alleviation is open to question. And there is no guarantee that current programmes will continue when the new administration takes power early next year.   Countries:-  VEZ  Venezuela, South America.

[Begin Robaina recording] (?The fact that) it is a meeting  with the continent that most contributes a presence of  supporting votes in whatever international battle Cuba wages, I  think also gives it special significance.

The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has  been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting  and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the  birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for  ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and  racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry.    Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be  used  in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well  as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa.

On the eve of his departure from Port Louis,  Qian Qichan discussed the situation in Africa and China's  African policy in an interview with XINHUA reporters.    Qian Qichen said: During the current African tour, he has  been deeply impressed by the African people's new sense of  awakening sparked by drastic changes in the international  situation. Many African countries, while seeking economic  development, have focused their attention on safeguarding  national stability and at the same time, strengthened regional  cooperation. Noting the establishment of security mechanisms by  OAU and the breakthrough achieved in peace in South Africa, he  pointed out that the struggle against foreign intervention and  for national independence and sovereignty is making headway. In  short, Africa is facing challenges as well as historic  opportunities and is not without hopes, he added.    He said: Under the new situation brought about by the end of  the Cold War, regions are interrelated in their endeavor for  peace and various countries have become more and more  interdependent on each other in economy. World peace is  inseparable from Africa's stability; and an underdeveloped  African economy is not conducive to the global economic  prosperity. For this reason, the international community should  show concern for Africa, and the developed nations are  duty-bound to help the African countries. Africa needs  attention, not indifference; it needs help, not intervention.    Discussing China's African policy, Qian Qichen emphasized:  To strengthen unity and cooperation with the African and other  developing countries is the basis of China's foreign policy.  China shares much common ground with the African countries as  far as the international and regional situations are concerned.  China wholly respects the social system and development mode  chosen by the African countries in light of their national  conditions, and firmly supports the African countries' struggle  to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. We support  the African countries' efforts to ensure internal unity, to  develop economy, and to improve the people's livelihood; and we  also support the series of rational proposals by African  countries for reducing and exempting debts, protecting economic  interests, and strengthening South-South cooperation and  South-North dialogue.    On China's economic and trade relations with African, Qian  Qichen said: China's economic cooperation with the African  countries symbolizes the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance  and common development. He added that although China's  assistance to African countries is limited, it is sincere and  without any political strings attached.    He pointed out: Amidst constant changes in the international  and African scenes, the friendship between China and Africa has  withstood tests of history and become more solid. China will  never forget Africa's profound sentiments of friendship in times  of needs. He reiterated that regardless of changes in the  international and African situations, China will never alter its  principle of developing unity and cooperation with the African  countries. We deeply believe that our friendship with Africa  will definitely continue to grow and strengthen in the days and  years to come; and the lasting, stable, and mutually  beneficially friendship and cooperation between China and Africa  will further solidify and develop.

The quality of educational and employment opportunities is often uneven among high poverty area youth, thus requiring that careful consideration be given to enhancing both the access and availability of opportunities to all area youth.  Under this competition, awards will be made to local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas to address their special needs and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives, as defined in this notice. Approximately $10 million are available for awards under this notice. The Departments expect to award 15 to 25 12-month grants. The amount of the awards will be based on a number of factors, including the scope, quality, and comprehensiveness of the proposed initiative and the size of the population to be served. While there are no limitations on the size of a high poverty area, the Departments expect that the resources available for individual grants will effectively serve areas of no more than 50,000 in population. The Departments are not bound by the estimates in this notice.  The Departments intend to conduct subsequent competitions for Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants, on an annual basis, under the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' A local partnership shall be eligible to receive only one (1) grant under this notice, with grant renewals to be awarded depending upon fund availability.      Section B. Application Process      1. Eligible Applicants      A local entity that both meets the definition of ``local partnership'' and proposes to serve youth residing in areas meeting the definition of ``high poverty area'' in section B.7. of this notice is eligible to apply for an Urban/Rural Opportunities Grant. An eligible partnership must include employers, representatives of local educational agencies and local postsecondary educational institutions (including representatives of area vocational education schools, where applicable), local educators (such as teachers, counselors, or administrators), representatives of labor organizations or nonmanagerial employee representatives, and students. Other entities appropriate to effective development and implementation of the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative, particularly community-based organizations with experience, expertise, and demonstrated success in addressing the needs of youth within the targeted area, should also be included in the partnership.      2. Submission of Application      Applicants must submit an original and four (4) copies of the application. The application shall consist of two (2) separate parts:  Part I shall contain the Standard Form (SF) 424, ``Application for Federal Assistance,'' and SF 424A, ``Budget'' (Appendix A). All copies of the 424 Form must have original signatures of the designated fiscal agent. In addition, the budget shall include"," FR940620-2-00100   FR940620-2-00062        8. The quality of educational and employment opportunities is often uneven among high poverty area youth, thus requiring that careful consideration be given to enhancing both the access and availability of opportunities to all area youth.  Under this competition, awards will be made to local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas to address their special needs and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives, as defined in this notice. Approximately $10 million are available for awards under this notice. The Departments expect to award 15 to 25 12-month grants. The amount of the awards will be based on a number of factors, including the scope, quality, and comprehensiveness of the proposed initiative and the size of the population to be served. While there are no limitations on the size of a high poverty area, the Departments expect that the resources available for individual grants will effectively serve areas of no more than 50,000 in population.

As he was leaving  for South Africa to take part in the inauguration ceremony,  Buwayz clarified that Lebanon's relations with this country have  been normal and natural since it eliminated racism. However,  the application of this decision requires some time. We have  this report from our colleague Darwish 'Ammar from Beirut  airport:    [Begin recording] ['Ammar] Mr. Buwayz, you leave today for  South Africa to take part in President Nelson Mandela's  inauguration ceremony. What would you like to say on this  occasion with regard to Lebanon's participation in this ceremony?    [Buwayz] Of course, the election and inauguration of  President Mandela after the historic reforms in South Africa are  considered an international, nay, even historic event. This is  so because of the developments that have taken place there and  also because of the effects of this development on the political  and humanitarian level. By this I mean the cancellation of  racial discrimination and openness toward democracy and freedom.  There is no doubt that Lebanon should not stay away from this  event. It should not be kept away from the significance of this  event, both from the aspect of democracy, freedom, and  coexistence, and from the aspect of the extensive historic and  ancient Lebanese presence in South Africa, where there is a  large Lebanese community.    Proceeding from this, the visit on this occasion acquires a  special character. Therefore, Lebanon had to attend this  international celebration.    ['Ammar] When will the Arab League's resolution on ending  the boycott of South Africa come into effect in Lebanon?    [Buwayz] The resolution to cancel the boycott is a decision  that was made in the Arab League during the last session over a  month ago. The Lebanese Council of Ministers applied this  resolution in the session before last by canceling all aspects  of the political, economic, and trade boycott. Thus, relations  now between Lebanon and South Africa are natural and very normal.    ['Ammar] Will there be diplomatic representation between the  two countries?    [Buwayz] We now have a general consulate there. We have  made the decision to normalize diplomatic relations. Of course,  the implementation of this decision requires some material and  financial support which might not be available immediately.    ['Ammar] On the sidelines of the visit to South Africa, will  you hold meetings with the participants in the inauguration  ceremony such as representatives of various countries taking  part in the ceremony?    [Buwayz] As with every international meeting of this  caliber, the celebration will include a large number of heads of  state, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. This event might  provide the opportunity for side meetings with some officials.    ['Ammar] During your stopover in Paris, will you hold talks  and meetings in the French capital?    [Buwayz] No. Our stopover in Paris is purely mechanical.    ['Ammar] Mr. Minister, there are some rumors about a  possibility of your visiting the United States. Will you be  going to the United States?    [Buwayz] I was supposed to visit Florida in response to an  invitation from the University of Florida to deliver a lecture  on Lebanon and the peace process here. However, some events  have made me change my plans. It has been postponed to an as  yet unspecified date. [end recording]     "

0,FT941-12426 ,"FT941-12426 _AN-EA4DIAAAFT 940131   FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (1): Global pressures are getting worse / An examination of the prospects for young people in a world where inequality of opportunity is all too common      By EMMA TUCKER   It is one of the greatest achievements of medical science that of the millions of babies born this year, more than ever before will live to the age of five. Beyond that, the advances of modern society become harder to detect. Whether coping with childhood in a Bombay slum or a Chicago ghetto, the world's youth faces growing pressures. Unstable communities, inadequate education opportunities, a lack of adult role models and slim prospects for employment are hallmarks not just of the developing world, but of the industrialised world too. The worries are likely to get worse. According to United Nations reports, more than 6bn people will inhabit the earth by the year 2000. About half of them will be under the age of 20. The implications are staggering. The aspirations of young people, from rich and poor countries alike, will put untold strain on global resources. Yet the world's policy makers and business leaders have not addressed the problem of how they will cope with, let alone fulfil, these hopes. Already the pressures show. In low-income countries, too many children still lack basic education and health care. The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) has calculated that while more than 90 per cent of the developing world's children start school, half, in many countries, drop out in the first few years. As a result there are now an estimated 100m children aged 6-11 not in school. Two-thirds are girls. Mexico's economic reforms are applauded, but 1m new jobs will have to be created every year to match the rate at which young people are entering the work force, according to the University of California Centre for US Mexican Studies. Child labour, and the serious exploitation of working children, remain widespread as families struggle for survival under the pressures of grinding poverty and growing consumerism. Rural to urban migration adds to the social problems, placing families under enormous stress as they put up with overcrowding, unemployment and poor living conditions. And growing poverty in urban areas has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of street children - as many as 100m, according to some estimates. The difficulties facing youth are not confined to the poorest countries. Even societies with the highest levels of income are failing to provide for the needs of all their young people. Low academic achievement, school drop-outs, alcohol and drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, vandalism and violence are on the increase in the industrialised world. According to Unicef, the US - with 20 per cent of its children living below the national poverty line - has more than double the child poverty rate of any other industrialised country. In the UK, according to a study from Fordham University's Institute for Innovation in Social Policy, children are worse off today than they were in 1970. Rising divorce rates and the increase in single parent families, together with the failure of governments to alleviate poverty through social services, have also resulted in children increasingly being deprived of parental time and attention. The consequences of growing stresses in family life are beginning to show up in some disturbing statistics. Many nations face a steady rise in teenage violence and suicide, drug abuse and - harder to quantify - disaffection, demoralisation and disillusionment. 'We have tended to avoid this issue of values, feeling that it is a sensitive area, best left to parents and schools,' says Mr James Himes, director of the International Child Development Centre, for Unicef. 'But schools do not do a good job of teaching values, and families, particularly low income families, have such trouble holding together just to survive that they do not have time to worry about the ethical dimensions of child raising.' The economic and business implications of neglecting these problems speak for themselves. Few governments have addressed the problem of how their economies can create enough new jobs to absorb the rapid growth in the number of young job seekers. Furthermore, there is an enormous price - social and economic - associated with the increasing number of people born in poverty - and likely to remain in poverty with little education and few job related skills. For business, this promises to be a long term problem. Employers rely on youth to provide a good, dependable workforce. They also represent companies' future consumers. 'It is enlightened self-interest for us to invest in young people,' says Mr Joe Stewart, the senior vice president of Kellogg. 'We are investing in them as future human beings, but also as future strong consumers. How better to operate than with a strong market around you?' The long-term benefits of investment in youth for governments and the private sector are clear. For example, the East Asian countries that have enjoyed such breathtaking growth over the last decade invested heavily in human as well as physical capital. A report from the World Bank shows that in eight east Asian 'superstar' countries, a bigger share of education spending was allocated to basic primary and secondary education - vital for a skilled workforce - than to universities. For example, in the mid-1980s, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand spent more than 80 per cent of their respective education budgets on basic education. Compare this against the primary and secondary education spending figures in Argentina and Venezuela, with respective allocations of less than 50 per cent. Education - especially for women - is associated with lower fertility. In turn, children from smaller families tend to have more years of schooling and perform better at school than those from larger families. The impact that educating women can make shows in Kerala, the southern Indian state. Its female literacy rate of 66 per cent is almost double that of its nearest rival, while its fertility rate has fallen to the astonishingly low level of 2.3 children per woman - lower than in China, Thailand, the former Soviet Union, and Ireland. One significant factor in explaining Kerala's success, says the United Nations Population Fund report, is the priority given by the state government to spending on education and health. But in a world of diminishing financial resources, where the prevailing economic philosophy in many countries is for governments to scale down state involvement in society, how are the aspirations of youth to be met? There is no substitute for caring parents, but supportive adults, good schooling, proper health care and effective charitable programmes can start to make a difference. Throughout the world there exist thousands of programmes which are improving the environments in which young people live - and raising our consciousness of their needs. Yet philanthropy alone cannot solve all the problems. Even if young people are provided with a good education, there is no guarantee that there will be jobs waiting for them. Likewise, forging ties between young people and their communities will not ensure that, as adults, they will not be forced to migrate from their homes in search of a better life. The growth in the world's population calls for decisive action by partnerships formed between government, business, non-governmental and non-profit making organisations, aimed at channelling resources towards people growing up in the 1990s. Only then will all those who make it through their first crucial years as babies hope to flourish in youth, leaving in their place a better legacy for those who come after them.

On January 4, Barbados Foreign Minister Brandford Taitt and  South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha had exchanged letters  indicating their intention to establish formal relations.    For over 30 years, Barbados had maintained a firm distance  from South Africa because of apartheid. The thaw in relations  occurred after South Africa started dismantling the system of  racial segregation. This process will lead in April to the  country's first all-race elections, expected to be won by Nelson  Mandela's African National Congress (ANC).     "

'The progress made within South Africa has opened the way for her to take her place in the international community,' he said. 'The question of South Africa's relationship with the Commonwealth will be one for a future South African government and for the Commonwealth as a whole to decide.' South Africa became a republic and withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961. Mr de Klerk arrived in Britain earlier in the day from Washington, where he called for international financial aid and corporate investment to develop fully South Africa's natural resources and help move the country toward a multiracial democracy. Mr Major backed Mr de Klerk's call for investment, saying: 'We shall support lending by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to South Africa. I warmly welcome the lifting of economic sanctions. The South African economy has huge potential. Outside help to regenerate it and create more jobs will be vital to the transitional process.'

Therefore, we must adhere to  the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic  line, be based on reality, fulfill the plan on schedule and  without fail, and win a victory in handling the knotty problems.    Attending yesterday's conference were leading personnel from  the regional level organs, including Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei,  Liu Zhen, Zhang Tingwu, Yang Zizhen, and Alatanaoqier.    In his speech Wang Qun pointed out: The ""8-7"" plan  formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  for helping 80 million poor people throughout the country deal  with their problems of dressing warmly and eating their fill  during the seven years before the end of this century has a  bearing on the whole situation. It is a big event that has a  bearing on the interests of China and the Chinese nation. Over  the past half century, the CPC has experienced countless  complications in leading the people of various nationalities  across the country and also scored great achievements attracting  worldwide attention. However, there are 80 million people in  the country and 30 million people in the region, who are still  in poverty status. This warrants leadership at all levels  meditate. In this sense, fulfilling the ""8-7"" specific plan  marks a great historical change in which China and Chinese  nation have thereupon cast off the poverty and entered a  brand-new, wealthy, civilized, and developed period. Only by  thoroughly casting off poverty can we eloquently prove that  poverty and polarization do not belong to socialism. Only  commonly becoming wealthy represents the socialism with Chinese  characteristics and can prove that the CPC is completely and  thoroughly working for the happiness and interest of the vast  majority. Wang Qun pointed out: We should implement the spirit  of directive given by Comrade Jiang Zemin with regard to  ""thinking of new ways in helping the poor."" Specific measures  adopted by the region in fulfilling its ""3-7"" plan chiefly are  as follows:    1. It is imperative to foster the viewpoints of the market  economy in helping the poor by handling the knotty problems.  The establishment of systems of socialist market economy has  brought about an excellent opportunity of development to the  poor localities. The volume of demands raised by both vast  domestic and foreign markets to the professions of planting and  raising and to the industries of natural resources has become  increasingly large. This is just a good opportunity for the poor  localities to vigorously carry out their plans. We must renew  our concepts and accelerate the development of the large-scale  commodity economy. We cannot become wealthy by engaging in the  production of petty commodities and will certainly be rich by  engaging in the production of important ones.    2. We must first help the poor foster their confidence while  giving support to them. We should direct the poor localities  and households to wage an arduous struggle, to be self-reliant,  to define their own goal in line with their reality, and to be  determined to cast off poverty and become wealthy.    3. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  should be based on deepening the reform in rural and pastoral  areas. According to the market law, a good job should be done  in readjusting the industrial structure and product mix of rural  and pastoral areas. First, we should stabilize the household  responsibility system linked with their output of rural and  pastoral areas. Based on this foundation, we should establish  or improve the dual system with the integration between  centralized and decentralized management and gradually expand  the scale of collectively owned economy to enhance the actual  strength of collectives in helping the poor. Efforts should be  made to bring into play the enthusiasm of collectives and poor  households so as to give full expression to the socialist  superiority.    4. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  must adhere to the principle of supporting the poor in the  course of development. Supporting the poor in the course of  development means that it is necessary to rely on the joint  forces fostered by the state support and the cooperation of the  masses to develop or build the projects of casting off poverty  and becoming wealthy. In view of the autonomous region,  measures to conduct capital construction among farm fields and  pastoral farms and to build the projects of ecological benefits  should be adopted to improve the productive conditions and to  build some proper-scale bases of farm and livestock commodities,  which have stable and high yields as well as high benefits.    5. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  should concentrate our financial and material resources on  giving priority to dealing with the key problems encountered by  poor localities and households and on creating necessary  conditions for them.    6. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we  should bring political strong points into play. The region has  had a long-standing tradition of unity among the nationalities  and progress, as well as of equality and mutual assistance among  various nationalities. We should carry out the activities of  encouraging the masses to commonly become wealthy, issue the  letter of responsibility to every household, and turn the  activities into the conscious act of the masses.    7. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, a  good job should be done in conducting intellectual, scientific,  and technological support. In conducting poverty control, we  must first carry out ignorance control and vigorously conduct  the activities of social education. Efforts should be made to  forcibly make cultural knowledge popular, to popularize science  and technology, and to enable the poor households to obtain one  or several capabilities in technology.    8. Tasks adopted for helping the poor by handling the knotty  problems should be fulfilled within the given date. Leadership  at all levels should integrate without conditions or haggling  the principle of having the people, townships (sumu), banners  (counties) become wealthy with the development of the  banner-county level economy, as well as of township and vanguard  enterprises. They should develop enterprises with various  ownerships and be winners in having markets well in mind and in  casting off poverty.    Lastly Wang Qun stressed: Party committees and governments  at all levels should enhance their leadership over the work.  Principal leading personnel should take personal charge of the  work and leading personnel sharing the tasks in this regard  should earnestly grasp the work. They should strengthen their  services and realistically assume the duties imposed on them by  history. Efforts should be made to establish the systems of  supervision and inspection in this regard and to win a new  victory in deepening the reform, fostering unity and stability,  and making the economy leap forward.    During the work conference, Wu Liji also delivered a speech  in which he pointed out: In fulfilling the region's ""3-7"" plan  for helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, it is  imperative to achieve in adhering to the following seven  principles:    First, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  work of dealing with the problems of dressing warmly and eating  one's fill with that of becoming better-off and wealthy.  [passage omitted]    Second, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  work of helping the poor in the course of development with that  of helping the poor while conducting opening up. [passage  omitted]    Third, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  work of encouraging the people to become wealthy with that of  encouraging townships, banners, and counties to do so. [passage  omitted]    Fourth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating  economic development with intellectual development. [passage  omitted]    Fifth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating  material production with population growth. [passage omitted]    Sixth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the  material civilization drive with that of spiritual civilization.  [passage omitted]    Seventh, we should adhere to the principle of integrating  state support with local self-reliance. [passage omitted]     "

0,FT932-14 ,"FT932-14 _AN-DGACVAHGFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / An economist with political nous: Larry Summers has made his mark      By MICHAEL PROWSE   IN POLITICS your job is as important as you make it. This, at any rate, appears to be the modus operandi of Mr Lawrence Summers, the forceful under-secretary for international affairs at the US treasury. Mr Summers is only the third-ranking official at the treasury; yet this has not stopped him from speaking out authoritatively on a wide range of issues, some of which would appear to be the responsibility of other departments. For example, in a series of speeches - most recently to Japanese businessmen in Tokyo - Mr Summers has set out the general principles underlying trade relations between Japan and the US. Mr David Mulford, who held Mr Summers' job in the Bush administration, tended to focus more narrowly on the financial services sector and left general trade policy to the US trade representative or the commerce secretary, the two top trade officials. While many appointees of President Bill Clinton are still struggling to find their feet, Mr Summers has set about rapidly carving out a position of influence within the administration. His stature in part reflects his having served the perfect apprenticeship for his job. As chief economist at the World Bank for two years up to last November's election, Mr Summers became familiar with nearly all the issues now confronting him, such as economic reform in Russia, policy co-ordination between Group of Seven countries and third world development. He also had a chance to build important personal relationships with leading economic policy makers in Europe and Japan. But Mr Summers also brings intellectual gifts to the job. Still technically on leave from Harvard University, Mr Summers has just won an award he long coveted: the John Bates Clark Medal, presented every two years to the 'outstanding American economist under the age of 40.' Academics do occasionally get political posts but it is rare for a young economist to drop research for the hurly-burly of Washington politics. As most members of Mr Clinton's economic team have been fully absorbed with domestic policy - especially the struggle to win congressional support for the deficit-cutting economic package, Mr Summers has had a relatively free hand to mould international policy. He has been instrumental in shaping a two-pronged global strategy consisting of a 're-invigorated multilateral effort' to strengthen global economic growth and an 'export-activist' trade policy designed to open markets and make other countries 'bear a greater responsibility for supporting the global trading system.' In both areas Mr Summers has tried to present policy in terms likely to appeal to Washington's Group of Seven partners. For example, he encouraged his boss, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, to stress that economic co-operation is a 'two-way street' in which the US will respect the views of allies. Viewed from Tokyo, Mr Summers' brand of co-operation looks more like coercion: Tokyo is being pressed hard to adopt a more expansionary fiscal policy and to halve its current account surplus as a fraction of national income. Mr Summers has been active on many other fronts. He is one of the administration's strongest proponents of more generous US and international support for Russian economic reforms. Soon after arriving at the treasury he began to put pressure on the International Monetary Fund to agree new more flexible rules for lending to formerly communist countries. The so-called 'Systemic Transformation Facility' was duly announced in April and the IMF announced the first tranche of a Dollars 3bn loan to Russia this week. Mr Summers is also showing greater sensitivity to the needs of developing countries than his Republican predecessors. He has signalled that the US would join other industrialised countries in offering more generous debt relief to low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. He is putting his inside knowledge of flaws in World Bank operational procedures to good use. He has pressed the World Bank and other development institutions to sharpen their focus on poverty relief and alter the way they conduct business by placing less emphasis on the approval of loans and more on the supervision of projects.

Fidel discussed possible Cuba-South Africa  ties, and Mandela's historic victory.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this  month,  an ANC [African National Congress] representative discussed the  preceding events, and explained that once Nelson Mandela was  inaugurated, South Africa would proceed to establish diplomatic  relations with Cuba. That is their intent. They even included  this in a document known as the New South Africa Foreign Policy  Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] [Words indistinct] of our relations with Mandela,  the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We have had  close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we are  family. Regarding foreign relations [words indistinct]  conditions, the closer our friendship with a country, the less  we ask to establish ties. We allow circumstances and the  appropriate moment to determine the establishment of ties to  occur. In the special case of South Africa at this time, we  could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son. We  have  not pressed the issue of formal ties, however. I believe that  perhaps tomorrow, it will be brought up in the talks with the  foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with the  foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps, he will bring this up and ties will be established  immediately. We will not bring it up however. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up like a demand or as a  request from us.    It seems something, however, [word indistinct] that those  ties will be established quickly because there are few countries  with whom we have stronger ties in common -- kinship and  fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I did not speak with  ministers from other countries. We talked like old relatives. I  am convinced all of them want the quick establishment of ties,  but out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    [Reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and South Africa  had great differences because of Angola. Did you ever think  then, or later, that you would be here today in the former  capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South African nations. We have  to return to its history. For specific reasons, strong clashes  took place. Now, however, there is a new South Africa in which  such clashes no longer exist, just peace, harmony, respect, and  affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. [Words indistinct] the independence of Angola. We were  in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning of intervention by  foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our support -- for 15  years. So many things happened. We did not have a strong  presence, but it was strong enough because we could not, nor did  it depend on us alone, to attain a position was the problem.  [sentence as heard]    In Angola, we fought with the greatest selflessness. The  rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would said that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted, difficult but not through our fault. Cuba fulfilled  its duty. Cuba contributed to solve the highly difficult  problems that arose. I do not want to criticize anyone. I  believe today is not a day to criticize. Perhaps history will  record this.

The meeting summed up and exchanged experience in helping poor  and mountainous regions in economic development and discussed  the policies, measures, and ways for poor and mountainous  regions to develop the economy and free themselves from poverty.  Responsible comrades of 37 poor counties and mountain counties  (cities), as well as the prefectures, cities, and provincial  departments concerned, attended the meeting.    Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial party committee,  and  Governor Fu Xishou delivered important speeches at the meeting.  Wang Zhaoyao, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial  party committee and vice governor of Anhui, conveyed to the  provincial meeting the guidelines of the national meeting on the  work of helping poor regions to develop. Fang Zhaoxiang, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the  meeting and gave a summing-up speech.    Other provincial leaders present at the meeting were Yang  Yongliang, Wang Taihua, Chen Jiyu, and Wang Sheyun. Also  present was Cui Jianxiao, adviser to the provincial leading  group the help-the-poor work.    In his speech, Lu Rongjing discussed the following five  points on how to further understand the great significance of  helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development and  how to help them shake off poverty and achieve prosperity as  soon as possible:    1. Helping poor and mountainous regions achieve prosperity  sooner is an important economic task, as well as an important  political task, and we must always pay great attention to it.    Lu Rongjing said: To wipe out poverty and achieve a common  prosperity is the essence of socialism, as well as its  superiority. More than one-third of Anhui's counties are rated  as poor counties or marginally poor counties and entitled to  state and provincial aid, and about one-third of the land in the  province is mountainous. It is evident that if the poor and  mountainous regions cannot shake off poverty and achieve  prosperity soon, they will impede Anhui's economic development  and seriously prevent the province from attaining its goal of  becoming fairly well-off on schedule. Most of Anhui's  mountainous regions are old revolutionary base areas,  particularly the Dabieshan region and the southern Anhui  mountainous regions. During both the revolutionary war period  and the socialist construction period, the people in the  mountainous regions have displayed selfless dedication and made  great contributions. Over many years, some poor regions along  the Chang Jiang and the Huai He have repeatedly made great  sacrifices to bear flood losses in the interests of the whole.  We have the obligation to help those regions develop faster and  make the people there improve their living standards sooner.  For this reason, helping poor and mountainous regions achieve  prosperity sooner is not only an important economic task, but  also an important political task.    2. To Accelerate Development, Poor and Mountainous Regions  Must Firmly Establish the Notion of Self-Reliance and Hard  Struggle, and Earnestly Rely on Their Own Efforts To Improve  Their Situation.    Lu Rongjing said: Of course, the government will, as always,  help poor and mountainous regions shake off poverty and achieve  prosperity sooner. However, those regions must regard the help  of the government and others merely as a motive force, and they  must mainly rely on their own efforts to improve their backward  situation. In development, poor and mountainous regions indeed  have great difficulties, but they also have great potential. In  particular, they have the advantage of possessing certain  natural resources. With a strong desire to shake off poverty  and achieve prosperity, the people in those regions have an  extremely great initiative and creativity for developing the  economy and improving their backward situation. If the masses  are widely mobilized, their enthusiasm for braving the elements  is aroused, and their potential and strength are brought into  play, they will be able to blaze a new trail and truly shake off  poverty and achieve prosperity.    3. It Is Necessary To Consider Local Realities, Give Play to  Local Strong Points and Salient Features, and Constantly Explore  and Improve the Ways of Economic Development for Poor and  Mountainous Regions During the Course of Practice.    Lu Rongjing said: The practice of reform and development has  told us that the concept of economic development has an  important bearing on the speed and efficiency of economic  development as well as on the changes in the economic situation.  The most fundamental way to straighten out an economic  development concept is to adhere to the ideological line of  ""emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts,"" judge  everything by whether it is conducive to the development of  productive forces, and respect the initiative of the masses. We  should consider local realities, find out the right place to  make a breakthrough, and give play to our superiority and  salient features. Any development concept which conforms to  local realities should be upheld persistently and implemented  step by step.    4. It Is Necessary To Fully Understand the Opportunities  Created in the Transition From a Planned Economy to a Market  Economy and Make Best Use of it To Vigorously Resolve the  Prominent Issues Existing in Poor and Mountainous Regions.    Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's poor and mountainous regions are  endowed with rich natural and human resources. The gradual  establishment of a market economy has created unprecedented  opportunities and broad prospects for the development of these  regions' resources. We must increase our awareness of current  opportunities and do everything possible to seize them and take  advantage of them. Currently, we must pay special attention to  resolving several prominent issues. First, we must use the  market as our guide to step up structural adjustment. Second,  we must strengthen socialized service and market construction,  and we must unclog distribution. Third, we must increase  investment and strengthen the building of infrastructure.  Fourth, we must improve science and technology education and  raise our population's standards.    5. It Is Necessary To Strengthen Leadership Over Work in  Poor and Mountainous Regions, Make Concerted Efforts, Pool All  our Wisdom and Efforts, and Jointly Fulfill our Important  Historic Mission of Helping the Poor Cast Off Poverty and Become  Prosperous.    Lu Rongjing said: Party committees and governments at all  levels in poor and mountainous regions must always help peasants  cast off poverty and become prosperous, and they must regard  this as their foremost task. As always, they should be  duty-bound to strengthen leadership over the work of helping the  poor to develop. We must be resolved to earnestly change our  leadership and work style, go deep into the grassroots and among  the masses, conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth  manner, and earnestly implement policies on helping the poor to  develop. We must try to discover models, review our  experiences, give different guidance to suit different  conditions, and earnestly carry out work in this respect.    Grass-roots organizations and cadres play a role that will  determine whether or not poor and mountainous regions can  accelerate the pace to cast off poverty and become prosperous.  We must strengthen the functions of towns and townships through  constant in-depth reform to make it possible for town and  township party committees and governments to effectively  exercise their power, more successfully implement the party's  relevant principles and policies, and organize and lead the  masses in carrying out development. Village organizations, which  are on the frontline of helping the poor to develop, are vital  to the success of this work. Therefore, we must earnestly  strengthen the building of party branches at the village level,  particularly by doing a good job of selecting branch  secretaries. We must pay attention to maintaining stability of  cadres in poor and mountainous regions; there should not be  excessive personnel changes.    In his speech, Fu Xishou first analyzed the situation in  helping our province's poor and mountainous regions to develop  and the tasks facing us. He said: Since the beginning of the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the  vast number of cadres and masses in our mountainous and poor  regions have upheld reform and opening up, relying on themselves  to build up their regions through thrift and diligence. As a  result, the local economy has developed considerably and their  overall strength has increased notably. In 1993, the 37  counties (cities and districts) accounted for 27 billion yuan of  the GNP, their gross industrial and agricultural output value  reached 47.4 billion yuan, and their revenues totaled 1.4  billion yuan, an increase of 2.5 times, 3.2 times, and 2.2  times, respectively, over 1978. Construction of infrastructure  has steadily increased with more than 5,000 kilometers of  highway opened to traffic, and program-controlled telephones set  up in all of the county towns. Our peasants' per capita income  last year was 636 yuan, an increase of 7.4 times that of 1978.  The number of people below the poverty line in 21 poor counties  has decreased by 3 million from 1985. However, the task of  helping the poor to develop in our province is still difficult.  As a whole, the economy in the mountainous region is still  fairly backward. We must not overestimate our achievements.    Fu Xishou pointed out: To accelerate the pace of helping the  poor and speed up economic development in poor and mountainous  regions, we must successfully carry out the following six tasks  in a down-to-earth manner: 1) We must earnestly do well in  agriculture to lay a strong foundation for the development of  poor and mountainous regions. Anhui's mountainous and poor  regions are endowed with rich agricultural resources and have a  variety of farm produce. However, its rich resources have not  been fully exploited. We must use the market as guide to  comprehensively develop their agricultural resources and  vigorously develop a type of farming that provides high yields  of fine quality with maximum efficiency. With enterprises as  the leader, we should link thousands upon thousands of families  in the regions with domestic and foreign markets and take the  road of forming economic associations that combine agriculture  with manufacturing and trade. 2) We must not let up on the  development of village and town enterprises but vigorously  promote them. We must begin the task by developing whatever  projects are possible, based firmly on actual conditions. We  should respect peasants' choice of types of ownership and allow  them to operate as collectives, individual households, private  enterprises, or shareholdings. We should treat everybody  equally without discrimination. 3) We must run county-owned  industries, particularly state enterprises, effectively. We  should strive to follow market changes with interest, strengthen  technological transformation, readjust the product mix, and  improve enterprise management. 4) We must invigorate commodity  circulation as well as concentrate our efforts on establishing  transportation carriers and improving the circulation  environment. We must do a good job in developing the commodity  market and introducing peasants to the market. 5) We must  insist on promoting development with reform and opening up.  While taking measures to manage collectives' land ownership  well, we must strengthen land-use rights. All localities must  realistically study and formulate specific methods for  quickening forestry and water resource development, so as to  centralize as well as bring about collective operations and  increased efficiency in land-use. 6) We must meticulously  manage our financial and taxation matters to bring them into a  better position as soon as possible. Fu Xishou said:  Governments and departments at all levels must continue to  increase their input in poor and mountainous regions. This  year, the state has decided to increase the amount of existing  funds, with Anhui's development fund for the poor topping 600  million yuan. We must effectively develop education and assist  the poor through science and technology. We must implement the  9-year compulsory education system, develop vocational and  technical education, and train personnel in practical and  specialized skills. We must mobilize all social forces to  jointly undertake the tasks to become well-off. Last year, the  provincial government decided to adopt a system whereby  provincial departments, cities under the jurisdiction of the  provincial government, as well as large- and medium-sized  enterprises were asked to help their counterparts in 21 poor  counties. The policy will be implemented unchanged for several  years until the poor regions cast off poverty. We must  encourage well-off regions to help poor regions. And,  economically developed regions should take the initiative to  help poor and mountainous counties. They should utilize their  edges in technology, personnel, market, information, and  material resources to develop the resources of poor and  mountainous regions through various channels such as economic  cooperation, technical services, employment of labor services,  and product distribution. They should cooperate with these poor  regions in joint development on the basis of mutual benefit and  supplementing one another with individual edges. The provincial  party committee has decided that, beginning this year,  provincial organizations will transfer department-level cadres  to work with their counterparts in poor regions. Prefectural  (city) and county offices will also transfer cadres to work with  townships (towns) and administrative villages to help these  regions cast off poverty more quickly.    Regarding several specific policies on supporting economic  development in mountainous regions, Fu Xishou said: Based on  investigation and study, the provincial party committee and  government have readjusted some policies on mountainous regions  and formulated some new policies and measures, which all  localities and relevant provincial departments must earnestly  implement.

The social research organisation says that the gap between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in cities widened between 1981 and 1991. Most cities have areas where low incomes, unemployment and low levels of car and home ownership are becoming the norm. These are often close to more prosperous areas where people own their own homes and many households have two incomes and two cars. The areas of intense poverty are mostly in northern cities and inner London, according to an analysis of data in the 1991 census. But less localised poverty is spread over most old industrial areas such as the south Wales valleys, northern England and central Scotland. The Geography of Poverty and Wealth 1981-1991.

In a state plan for poverty elimination, which is made  public  today, the State Council said that to attain that goal, it will  concentrate China's manpower, materials and funds and mobilize  all sectors of society.    ""Although poor people constitute a small proportion of  China's rural population, the task for eliminating poverty is  extremely arduous,"" the plan said.    That is because these people are concentrated in areas with  harsh natural conditions, such as high mountainous areas, desert  areas, loess highlands and areas where much of the land has been  taken for reservoirs, it explained.    The plan outlined the following points for solving the food  problem for these 80 million people by the end of the century:    -- The overwhelming majority of poor households will score a  big increase in per-capita earnings;    -- Poor households will be assisted in creating basic  conditions for solving the food problem, such as cultivating  stable and high- yield farmland, orchards and woods, expanding  livestock breeding and sideline production;    -- The problem of insufficient drinking water will be solved  by and large;    -- Most poor townships will be linked by highways and have  electricity;    -- Primary education will be made universal and illiteracy  among adults will be eliminated;    -- Vocational education and technical training will be  promoted among adults; and    -- Endemic diseases will be prevented and brought under  control.    The plan said that officials and farmers in poor areas will  be encouraged to achieve prosperity by becoming market-oriented,  relying on the use of science and techniques, developing local  resources and expanding commodity production.    Rural residents living in areas with extremely harsh natural  conditions will be relocated, it added.    According to the plan, the State Council has decided to  increase appropriations for the poverty-elimination program from  1994.    The plan mandated local governments at all levels to  increase  funding for the program.    It also emphasized the need to promote exchanges and  cooperation with the international community in poverty  elimination.    It is imperative to try to improve the investment  environment  in poor areas and encourage overseas investors to start  productive enterprises to make full use of natural resources  there, it noted.    The plan also banned the government of any poor county from  buying cars, building luxury hotels or constructing office  buildings before the food problem is solved among local  residents.     "

The sources, with  whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq  has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the  following five main objectives:    1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells  not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells.  Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main  design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company  coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that  purpose.    2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South  Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies  (mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely  advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled  with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and  heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies  were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a  state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of  missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that  kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some  offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing  equipment.    3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has  been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a  complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery  shells.    4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim  has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources  said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South  Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and  London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the  visas were issued for ""the crescent state,"" the expression used  in official correspondence.    5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in  South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had  indeed received some offers in this connection.     "

In China the poverty line means that people have an annual  income of less than 200 yuan per capita and less than 200 kg of  grain a year.    A provincial official in charge of the aid-the-poor project  said that Shandong has made progress in this field over the past  decade and the number of poor people has dropped to four million  at present.    These people are mainly distributed in remote mountainous,  beach and lake areas with adverse production and living  conditions.    According to the plan, the governor will be in charge of the  overall work, while local officials' promotion will be linked to  the project.    While allocating more funds, the province will speed up the  construction of infrastructure facilities in rural areas to  ensure that every village is linked with roads, and supplied  with electricity and fresh water.

That all state institutions, industrial, commercial,  financial, and transport enterprises, banks, and private  individuals under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation  shall proceed from the fact that the restrictions established as  of 1962 by the UN General Assembly on relations with the  Republic of South Africa in the political, economic, financial,  scientific and technological, cultural, sports, and other fields  are canceled.    2. That the abolition of the restrictions specified in  Clause  1 of this decree shall not extend to military and  military-technical cooperation prohibited by current decisions  of the UN Security Council.    [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation    [End box]    ""Russia, as distinct from the United States, where the 1986  Anti-Apartheid Act has been in operation, never adopted  independent decisions restricting trade relations between the  two countries--it subscribed to the sanctions imposed against  South Africa by the United Nations,"" was how Leonid Safonov,  chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Africa Desk, commented to  KOMMERSANT on the title of the Council of Ministers' decree.  Nonetheless, it is well known that (aside from the sanctions)  trade with South Africa in Soviet times was held back by one  further essential factor--ideology: relations were maintained  merely with the ANC, the opposition at that time, and its  leader, Nelson Mandela.    Now both the ideological and economic restrictions have been  lifted. But Boris Kolokolov, deputy minister of foreign affairs  of Russia, specified in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent that together with the restrictions on arms  supplies, the embargo on trade with South Africa in oil and  petroleum products imposed by the UN Security Council in 1977  remains in force also. It is expected that all restrictions will  be abolished only after the first free elections have been held  in South Africa, a black and white government of national trust  created, and a constitution adopted, that is, not before May  1994.    It should be observed for fairness' sake that trade between  Russia and South Africa, in spite of the international  sanctions, has been conducted, nonetheless, and particularly  actively in recent years. It is interesting here that the  information on the extent of bilateral trade made available to  KOMMERSANT by Russian and South African departments differs  considerably. According to data of the Russian side (the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Trade and  Industry Chamber of Russia), commodity turnover in the past year  was not in excess of $800,000, with the significant  preponderance of Russian exports ($500,000), what is more. South  African statistics, meanwhile, put reciprocal commodity turnover  in the first half of 1993 alone at $100 million.    Russian specialists see as the reason for this disagreement  in the data the fact that South Africa's statistics record  contacts at all levels--as distinct from the Russian statistics,  which only take account in practice of deals between major  (primarily state-owned) companies. Indeed, ""unclassified  commodities"" in fact representing nothing other than small-scale  wholesale consignments of wine (of excellent quality, in  experts' estimation) and a variety of consumer goods, costly and  not so costly, and not necessarily manufactured in South Africa,  what is more, account in the South African statistical summary  for a large part of the trade turnover--$80 million.    In the trade in ""classified"" commodities, on the other hand,  imports into Russia of products of agriculture and food industry  (approximately $3.5 million), textiles and wool ($7 million) and  electronic equipment and precision instruments ($370,000)  accounted for the bulk of these. In addition, a pronounced place  in trade is occupied by products of chemical industry (imports  from South Africa, $290,000; exports, $80,000).    Civil servants from the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations of Russia and the South African Embassy believe that  the very modest amounts of commodity exchange do not correspond  to the two countries' possibilities and interests. As Leonid  Safonov put it, ""One has the impression that Russian  entrepreneurs' ideas of Africa are shaped on the basis of the  novels of Louis Boussenard."" Meanwhile, according to him, not so  much merchandise as unique technology could represent the main  interest in South Africa for the Russian side. The knowhow of  the Sasol firm, for example, permitting the production of liquid  fuel from coal. It is this technology that under the conditions  of the embargo on oil supplies has enabled South Africa to  provide for 70 percent of the country's liquid fuel  requirements. The technology of South African mining companies  permits mining operations in very deep mines--up to 5 km. Many  of South Africa's medical developments are assessed as being far  above those of America and Europe. As we know, it was in South  Africa that the world's first human heart transplant operation  was performed, almost entirely with local equipment, what is  more.    In turn, as specialists of the Russian Trade and Industry  Chamber believe, national entrepreneurs also have things to  offer contracting parties in South Africa. According to  information from the Trade and Industry Chamber, the well-known  South African firms Strategic Material Supplies, Balmoral,  Feninx Steel, and Development Resource Group have given the  Russian side their requests for structural and high-alloy  stainless steel, pig iron, hot-rolled sheet steel, and billets  for rolled products.

International, Latitude  Links, Plumb Contracts, and Bregowa are interested in supplies  from Russia (and, possibly, other CIS countries) of cathode  copper, tungsten, aluminum, zinc, titanium, magnesium, electric  cable, and wire. Through the mediation of the Trade and Industry  Chamber office in Pretoria, they have established direct  contacts with the Tsvetmeteksport and Sovkabel all-Russia  joint-stock companies, the Inferkom group, and the  Zarubezhtsvetmet VAP [expansion unknown], and, according to  KOMMERSANT information, precontract agreements have already been  concluded. Interest is being shown in South Africa in Russian  cement also.    In addition, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has  reached agreement on the sale via the Rusaf Trading, MANNCONN,  Cinofoto, and Midas firms of test consignments of motorcycles,  Krasnogorskiy Plant cameras, experimental Aviatika airplane  models, and Vikhr boat engines, and also 3 million meters of  viscose fabric. As the Trade and Industry Chamber observed, the  prospects of supplies to South Africa of aviation equipment on  leasing terms and the creation of a system of its maintenance  are considered quite good, and there are opportunities for the  joint creation of a system of passenger shuttle helicopter  routes.    Purchases of tropical fruit and animal husbandry products  (which are not inferior in terms of quality to their American  and Australian counterparts, but which are cheaper) could be of  interest in South Africa to Russian importers.    Specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  advise entrepreneurs to think seriously of consolidating on the  South African market to consider the quite complex domestic  political situation in this country. Despite the fact that  President De Klerk and the leaders of the ANC are endeavoring to  avoid civil war, both white and black extremism is a reality,  nonetheless. And even after the elections on 27 April 1994 and  the formation of a coalition government, racial conflicts cannot  be ruled out. It would thus be advisable to take account of the  political instability factor when concluding contracts--and,  accordingly, stipulating the parties' responsibility in the  event of drastic changes in the political situation.    In addition, it is essential to take account also of the  following fact. An agreement on trade and economic cooperation  has been concluded between Moscow and Pretoria which proclaims  the principle of most-favored-nation status in trade. It was  signed on 22 October, that is, before the Council of Ministers'  adoption even of the decree on measures in connection with the  abolition of sanctions in respect to South Africa. But the  cooperation agreement is of a framework nature, that is, it  describes merely the most general principles of mutual  relations. Two documents of fundamental importance for the  development of business--on the protection of investments and  the avoidance of dual taxation--have yet to be signed. Mutual  contacts at expert level on these matters continue, but owing to  the general situation in South Africa, these documents will not  be signed before the elections. Thus, prior to the conclusion of  these agreements, a favorable customs tariff will operate in  respect to the commodities imported into Russia from South  Africa, but taxes on the profits obtained from commercial  activity will be collected by both sides. The same thing applies  to the income tax for persons who are not public servants--if a  citizen of Russia receives his earnings in South Africa, he must  pay tax both in Russia and in South Africa.    Foreign citizens working in South Africa are taxed here,  according to this country's laws, on a par with ordinary  citizens of the country and are required to pay a progressive  income tax. True, the interest computed for foreign individuals  and companies (which are not managed and not controlled by South  Africa) has since 3 June 1993 been exempted from income tax.    KOMMERSANT NOTE: According to information of the  Embassy of South Africa, foreign shareholders are taxed at the  rate of 15 percent of the sum total of the dividend. The maximum  rate of income tax in South Africa is 43 percent, and the level  of income subject to the maximum tax depends on sex and family  situation. Thus, for married men this income has to be 80,000  rand (approximately $27,000) or higher, and for single men,  $56,000 rand ($18,600). Value-added tax is 14 percent. The rate  of profits tax is 40 percent.    To return to the question of how promising South African  technology is for Russian entrepreneurs, it is worth mentioning  that the purchase thereof would seem highly beneficial from the  taxation viewpoint. The point being that in accordance with  Russian legislation--even with the absence of an agreement  excluding dual taxation--Russian entrepreneurs are exempted from  the payment of VAT when purchasing rights to technology. Customs  duty, on the other hand, may be paid off in equal installments  over the whole of the period of which these rights are acquired  (and in practice such terms make it possible to reduce annual  payments to negligible amounts).    And, finally, it is essential to take account of the fact  that there is in South Africa the concept of ""white"" and ""black""  business, and even the interests of entrepreneurs of different  races are represented by particular associations--the Afrikaner  Businessman Institute of Commerce (AHI, represents the interests  of ""white"" business) and the National Federative South African  Trade and Industry Chamber (NAFKOK, the association of black  entrepreneurs). The commercial interests of Russian businessmen  in South Africa are protected by the Trade and Industry Chamber  of Russia office, which opened in Pretoria in the summer of  1992. In the year that it has been working in South Africa, the  Trade and Industry Chamber office has concluded an agreement on  cooperation with both the above-mentioned associations, and also  with the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB). In addition,  protocols on cooperation with the South African Foreign Trade  Organization (SAFTO) and the Mining Chamber have been signed.  All these organizations represent the interests of about 80,000  South African companies--practically all which are of more or  less note among the country's entrepreneurs. Inasmuch as trade  relations between Russia and South Africa are as yet of a  sporadic nature and Russian entrepreneurs lack, as a rule,  permanent partners in South Africa, the Trade and Industry  Chamber office could help them in their search.

0,FT934-7738 ,"FT934-7738 _AN-DKRC7AGQFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (16): A dip in uncertain waters - France      By DAVID BUCHAN   A DELEGATION from the French employers federation was in South Africa last week to restore the country's position in South Africa's economy. The political turmoil and violence of recent years, coupled with strong French government backing for international sanctions against apartheid, had the effect of reducing France's share in foreign direct investment in South Africa from 8.6 per cent in 1980 to around 2 per cent today. Recent negotiation between South Africa and France of treaties on reciprocal protection of investment and avoidance of double taxation should encourage more French companies to dip their toes in South African waters. It is to help smaller French companies in the South Africa market that the French Patronat employers federation and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa last year set up a joint organisation, aimed at modernising South African industry and developing higher value-added exports by South Africa. There has long been a traditional French interest in South African gold stocks. Several South African gold stocks are quoted on the Paris Bourse and, for example, a majority of the shares in East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM) are held by French individuals, according to one French banker. 'But this traditional interest in gold has not spread to other South African shares,' the banker says. The latter are relatively expensive, with a high price/earnings ratio, he says. This is due to the controls on capital movements which mean that South African investors have difficulty investing abroad. But the French investor's main worry says Mr Christian Graeff, leader of last week's Patronat delegation, is 'the current image of violence and the prospect that there will be no coherence in policy for some time to come'.

0,FT932-4285 ,"FT932-4285 _AN-DFJB6ABJFT 930610   FT  10 JUN 93 / Bolivia rewards radical reformer: Christina Lamb on an unlikely victor in presidential elections      By CHRISTINA LAMB   MR GONZALO Sanchez de Lozada is living proof that radical economic reform can bring political rewards. Since implementing a tough structural adjustment programme as Bolivia's planning minister in 1985, he has twice finished ahead of his rivals in presidential elections and this time seems assured of winning his prize by actually being named president. After polling strongly in the popular vote on Sunday, he found his way virtually clear yesterday when former military ruler General Hugo Banzer, his nearest rival, withdrew from a run-off vote in Congress in August. Gen Banzer said that Mr Sanchez de Lozada would be named president. He is an unlikely head for South America's poorest country. Raised in the US, 62-year-old Mr Sanchez de Lozada owns Bolivia's largest private mining concern and is one of the country's richest citizens. He jokes: 'When I was campaigning in the interior, many people thought I was a foreigner who'd got off a plane in La Paz and decided to run for president.' But he is deadly serious in his desire to build on his neo-liberal reforms of 1985 which brought down inflation from 24,000 per cent and created a market economy - the first Latin American country to do so under democratic government. After eight years of austerity, Bolivia now has inflation of 9 per cent - the lowest in South America and both democracy and stability seem consolidated. But growth has been minimal and poverty is described by the World Bank as at sub-Saharan Africa levels. 'The problem now is to get the economy moving again, get the money to the people and make sure no one steals it,' says Mr Sanchez de Lozada. His ambitious targets are for 8 per cent annual growth for the first three years in office and 11 per cent in the last, creating 500,000 jobs and practically wiping out unemployment. An obvious way to start raising investment would be to privatise the main utilities following the lead of neighbouring Argentina. But it was Mr Sanchez de Lozada's party, the MNR, which nationalised these companies in the 1950s and privatisation is sensitive in highly unionised Bolivia. He explains: 'The state oil company was born out of the Chaco war in which 50,000 Bolivians died. How can I sell it to foreigners?' Instead, he has devised an innovative 'capitalisation' plan under which investors can buy 49 per cent of the companies. While this leaves control nominally with the state, the companies will be run by a foundation comprising 'notables' and the private investors. Once the companies are running efficiently, the state's part will be handed back to the Bolivian people as freely tradeable shares worth an estimated Dollars 4,000 per person - five times per capita income. Mr Sanchez de Lozada believes in this way he can transfer 50 per cent of gross national product to the people in five years, easing the massive income gap. To carry out this 'popular capitalism' will require foreign investment. Although local businessmen are doubtful about the attraction of investing in companies of which they do not have control, they say that Mr Sanchez de Lozada with his native English, sharp mind and considerable charisma is the best possible salesman for the country. Pointing out that 'in a country with just 7m people, a small amount of investment has tremendous impact', he believes that capitalisation of the six largest state companies will be 'like a motor to start up the economy'. Estimating their assets at Dollars 2bn, he hopes to attract as much again, boosting state and private investment, including borrowings, to Dollars 8bn over four years - double the current rate. Before he can do all this, Mr Sanchez de Lozada must be formally approved as president by Congress. In the 1989 elections, he narrowly topped the polls but a deal between the runners-up led Congress to choose the third-placed candidate. This time his main rival has cleared the path by stepping out of the run-off. 'I'd like to be president, not just the guy who keeps winning elections,' he says.

Fifteen african countries were not party to any  drug-control treaty, according to the International Narcotics  Control Board (INCB) 1993 report.    It said the worldwide drug menace had outgrown its  traditional classification as a criminal and social issue to  penetrate international politics and economics.    Although the INCB recognised prevailing political, economic,  social and even climatic conditions that created obstacles for  African governments, it said limited law enforcement and weak  control over the pharmaceutical market had contributed to  increased drug abuse. Increased cultivation of dagga was  attributed to growing domestic demand and trafficking to  European markets. Supplies came from local cultivation and  regional trafficking, said the report, which annually reviews  the world drug scene and international compliance with three  major drug control treaties.    Heroin abuse, which a few years ago was a limited  phenomenon,  was increasing because African airports were being used to  smuggle the drug into mainly European markets. A similar trend  had been observed with cocaine, mainly in west Africa.    The current drug pattern in Africa showed how quickly abuse  and trafficking could spread in a region, notably central Africa  and most recently to southern Africa where the report  highlighted the illicit manufacture and distribution of  methaqualone (mandrax).    Established in 1968 as an independent and quasi-judicial  organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug  conventions, the INCB seeks to identify weaknesses in national  and international drug control.

Preliminary success has been achieved. The aided projects  have created tax-yields and profits of 330 million yuan and  benefited some 700,000 families in the past eight years.    In addition, public facilities and infrastructure facilities  have been improved: 49 highways -- 1,800 kilometers in all --  and more than 100 new bridges were constructed. New irrigation  channels and wells were upgraded. Drinking water problems for  more than 1.24 million people and 260,000 head of livestock in  these areas have been solved.     "
0,FT943-10556 ,"FT943-10556 _AN-EHDDVAC6FT 940804   FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poverty - a limited truth, but alarm bells should be ringing      From Ms GABRIELLE COX   Sir, There is only limited truth in the assertion by Mary Campbell (Personal View, August 2) that the government's Households Below Average Income statistics give an incomplete picture of poverty in the UK. She is right that to talk of vast increases in people in poverty is unhelpful if the benchmark has itself risen dramatically, as is the case with average income. However, she overlooks the fact that more people are now living on income lower than half the 1979 average. Thus, in 1979, 9 per cent of the population (5m people) were living on income less than half the average. If this 1979 income figure is uprated by inflation, we find that 11 per cent of the population (6m people) have income below this level. There is a particular impact on children, with rises from 10 to 15 per cent and from 1.4m to 1.9m children. These figures are after housing costs. Such a measure gives an indication of the amount of income a family has to live on after the key component of housing has been accounted for. Before housing costs, income has risen for many families not because they are better accommodated, but because the government has forced up both council and housing association rents through its housing finance policy, leading to increased income in housing benefit. Mary Campbell calls for statistics which reflect people's needs. She seems to be unaware that the low income families statistics, which related income to what a family would get on benefit, were discontinued by the government. However, a report for the social security committee showed 11.35m people living on or below income support rates of income in 1989. Alternatively, the figures for means-tested benefits should sound alarm bells. In 1979, 7.9 per cent of families with dependent children claimed one or other of the two key income support benefits, but by 1992 this had risen to 31.2 per cent. The debate on what to do about poverty is not helped by suggesting the problem is not really a very serious one.

Mr Nathan, director of the Cape-Town based Centre for  Conflict Resolution, said a number of arguments had been  presented in recent weeks for maintaining or increasing the  defence budget.    The argument that it was necessary to maintain a credible  defence capability was correct as a general principle, but its  application depended on circumstances. South Africa was  over-armed in the regional context as none of the Southern  Africa Development Community states was capable of posing a  military threat. There was no foreseeable military threat from  outside the region.    ""The potential in fact exists for a high level of political,  diplomatic and security co-operation in the post-apartheid  southern Africa,"" he said.    ""Disarmament in South Africa would facilitate disarmament  throughout the subcontinent, releasing resources for development  and potentially leading to greater internal stability.""    In South Africa the greatest threats to citizens' security  were non-military problems such as poverty, unemployment and a  lack of adequate social services.    ""The bottom line is that money spent on defence could  otherwise have been used for development programmes and welfare  services,"" Mr Nathan said.    To argue that South Africa's foreign policy, particularly in  southern Africa, would depend heavily on a military role was  dangerously close to South Africa's regional policy under  apartheid and would undermine regional confidence.    To claims that the defence budget, at 2.6 per cent of gross  national product, was not high by international standards, Mr  Nathan said the United Nations and World Bank considered two per  cent an acceptable figure for developing countries.    ""This benchmark should be regarded as a general guideline  rather than a fixed rule,"" he said. ""It may in fact be too high  in the case of South Africa since current defence spending is  several times greater than total military expenditure in the  rest of the region.""    Noting that in 1992/93 Armscor [Armaments Corporation of  South Africa] had made R110 million [rand] from domestic and  foreign sales and received a state subsidy of R10 million, he  said it was ""untenable"" to say ethical considerations should  play no part in the arms trade.    Weapons were not a neutral commodity and it was not ""overly  pious"" to ask whether South Africa wanted to boost its economy  through killings in other countries.    The defence establishment could not seek to maintain a large  budget on the grounds of international instability and  simultaneously contribute to that instability through arms  exports.    Mr Nathan said South Africa had to establish clear foreign  and national security policies and conduct a transparent  investigation of its arms industry before it could make rational  decisions about the defence budget.    It required a clear policy on arms exports and a way of  overseeing whatever criteria were laid down. Ways to cut the  defence budget should also be investigated.    All of these objectives should be open to public debate, he  said.     "

During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message  to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik  de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message  from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South  Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz  al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on  10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president.    The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the  abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation  laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing  equality for all citizens in accordance with the new  constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli  conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard,  the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just  and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian  Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon.    Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the  continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of  violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing  of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed  that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that  henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the  expense of its new relations with the Arabs.    The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future  prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after  the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab  and international embargo on dealing with South Africa.    The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual  concern about establishing good relations between the two  countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other  fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume  contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations  between them are established.    Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the  foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic  Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa  Department at the Foreign Ministry.

The attractions lie in the country's well developed industrial infrastructure, a cheap labour force and the market of 125m consumers in southern Africa. The downside is equally obvious and can be summed up in one word: instability. 'German companies will invest,' commented a German diplomat in South Africa earlier this year at a trade fair to promote trade between the two countries, 'but only when the framework is in place: that means stability, a market economy and the removal of the danger of nationalisation.' As the BDI, the Federal Association of German Industry, put it in a memorandum last month, the next government in South Africa will face massive challenges in restoring the country's economy. That government may indeed find itself on a collision course with the expectations of the black majority. For the moment German companies have less risky, highly attractive markets on their own doorsteps, in the countries of the former eastern block. China and other markets in the far east are growing so quickly that they form a central part of many Germany companies' medium-term expansion plans. That said, German investment in South Africa should not be underestimated: there are about 350 German businesses or subsidiaries of large German companies in the country, employing 50,000 people. German investors and trade-partners are well-liked in South Africa - not least because German companies adopted a pragmatic approach to sanctions. But that liking is unlikely to be reciprocated further until South Africa offers a degree of stability to investors.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

More than 2,000 peaceful  black demonstrators have lost their lives at the hands of South African police  since the most recent round of resistance and protest began in the early 1980s.  The courage of these martyrs focused the attention of the world on the brutal  state of emergency imposed by the government. Soon after, nations around the  globe imposed economic sanctions against South Africa. In October, 1986, the  U.S. Congress, over the objection of President Ronald Reagan, and led by Rep.  Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), passed a sanctions bill.    Today, this strategy bears fruit. According to a recent bank study, foreign  economic sanctions cost South Africa $32 billion to $40 billion between 1985  and 1989, including at least $11 billion in net capital outflow and $4 billion  in lost exports. South Africa's isolation during the 1980s has helped turn  around the thinking of its leaders, who now recognize that the course of  democratic change is irresistible and inevitable.

He made the  announcement at an ANC fundraising dinner in East London on  Saturday [19 March]. ""It is planned that the new president,  Nelson Mandela I think, will be installed, inaugurated on the  10th May, a big occasion in Pretoria."" It had to be in Pretoria  because Pretoria was the seat of power and government in the  country. ""For years we fought against the Pretoria regime. On  the 10th May we ought to be (talking of) the Pretoria  government.""    He said the ANC had been receiving numerous queries from  heads of state and of government in other countries asking  whether there would be victory celebrations after the April  election, or an inauguration of the new president. ""Everybody  wants to come,"" he said. The mayor of Pretoria and ""all sorts  of people"" were concerned about the prospect of having the  inauguration in the city. ""They are very worried not because  they don't want change,"" he said, to laughter from his audience,  ""but because they say Pretoria won't be able to handle the  volume of visitors that are going to come"".    Mr Mbeki said if South Africa failed to make the transition  to a peaceful and successful democracy, it would disappoint  millions of people across the globe. ""And that we can't do.  Too much has been invested by the rest of the world in ending  apartheid.""    There was a picture in many peoples' minds that Africans  were  incompetent, always holding out a begging bowl, had no respect  for democracy, were always at each others' throats and that  Africa was ""generally a disaster"". ""The rest of the continent  is expecting this new South Africa will change all that so the  rest of the world will see an African country that is a success  in terms of a political system, human rights, an absence of  conflict and prosperity...so the rest of the world can begin to  say our understanding of Africa was wrong.""    These expectations meant that in the end, South Africa had  to  make a success of the process of change. Other countries where  racism had raised its head, such as Sweden, France, Germany and  England, were hoping South Africa would provide the lessons that  would enable them to deal with their own problems. ""I'm saying  we've got to solve, we've got to succeed here in the interest of  making a better world for millions of people.""    He also said South Africa needed a strong ANC government to  ensure that the country's millions were all brought into the  settlement. If the ANC was too weak to do so, other people  would move into the vacuum. Some of them might preach revenge  against the whites who had oppressed them for three-and-a-half  centuries.    He said the country would also need a strong National Party  to bring white civil servants, the police and white business  into the settlement.     "

The committee, in a statement issued at the end of its  session, praised all parties to the peace process in South  Africa for the spirit of tolerance they showed, which  contributed to achieving this accomplishment.    In its final statement, the South African Committee  emphasized its overwhelming support for democratic process in  South Africa, which serves the great interests of whoever is  living there, regardless of any ethnic considerations. The  committee voiced its regret for the recent acts of violence in  South Africa and called on all parties to show tolerance and a  sincere spirit of reconciliation to put an end to the chaotic  massacres and provide the appropriate atmosphere for holding the  elections in the country. The committee paid tribute to the  urgent efforts exerted by the transitional executive council and  the Government of South Africa to contain the explosive  situation in Bophuthatswana.    The committee called on all political leaders in South  Africa  to take the necessary measures to safeguard and guarantee the  unity and territorial integrity of South Africa. It called on  the international community to continue its backing for the  process of democratic change in South Africa and reject any  attempt to partition the country.    On behalf of the OAU leaders, the committee expressed its  hope to welcome a ""new South Africa"" as a member in the  organization following the April elections and the formation of  a democratic government.    The following is the text of the statement:    The 10th session of the OAU's South African Committee of  heads of states and governments met in Harare, the capital of  Zimbabwe, on 19 March 1994 to review the developments in South  Africa on the eve of the first democratic and nonracial  elections in that country. Participating in the meeting were  Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the current chairman  of OAU; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, president of the  host country and head of the front-line states; Botswana's  President Ketumile Masire, Cape Verde's President Antonio  Mascarenhas, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, Mozambique's  President Chissano, Namibian President Dr. Sam Nujoma, Tanzanian  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, and Zambian President Frederick  Chiluba.    Also present at the meeting were Angolan Prime Minister  Marcolino Moco; Lieutenant General D. O. Diya, Nigerian Chief of  the General Staff and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive  Council; Benjamin Bounkoulou, Congolese minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation; Ahmed Djebbar, Algerian  minister of national education; Osman Kamaza, Senegalese  ambassador to Zimbabwe [name and title as received]; OAU  Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim; Johnson Mlambo, chairman of  the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania; Alfred Nzo, member  of the African National Congress [ANC] Executive Council [name  and title as received]; and in the capacity of observer, Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's representative in South  Africa.    The committee examined a report prepared by the OAU  secretary  general following his visit to South Africa and his extensive  discussions with all concerned leaders there.    The committee listened to reports on the current situation  in  South Africa presented by the leaders of the PAC and ANC  delegations.    The committee referred to the Harare Declaration, which it  adopted on 21 August 1989 during its third regular session and  which included the principles and directions for the negotiating  process, and the program for ending apartheid and establishing a  united, democratic, and nonracial state in South Africa.    The committee welcomed the considerable progress achieved  since its last meeting and the splendid success achieved by the  multilateral negotiations, which produced historic agreements  providing for democratic elections in South Africa on 26, 27,  and 28 April 1994 and the establishment of transitional  structures to hold those elections.    The committee praised the spirit of tolerance shown by all  parties involved in the peace process and the flexible attitudes  which made the above achievement possible.    The committee voiced regret at the escalating violence in  the  country and grave concern at recent reports about the  involvement of senior officers in South Africa's security forces  in the continuing violence. The committee urged all parties in  South Africa to show tolerance and sincerely seek reconciliation  to put an end to the reckless massacres and prepare a suitable  climate to hold peaceful elections.    The committee welcomed the PAC's decision to halt armed  struggle unilaterally as of 16 April 1994. The committee termed  this decision a contribution toward free and honest elections.    The committee applauded South Africa's Transitional  Executive  Council and Government for their prompt efforts to contain the  explosive situation in Bophuthatswana and urged them to continue  their task of maintaining order, security, and law and  guaranteeing free political action throughout the country so  that the April elections can be held in an atmosphere free from  violence and threats.    The committee voiced support for the efforts to bring about  national accord within the framework of an all-embracing  process. Thanking all the leaders and parties involved in the  electoral process, including those who joined it recently, for  their sense of responsibility and perseverance, the committee  regrets the decision by some parties to boycott the upcoming  elections.    The committee commended the Transitional Executive Council,  which took firm measures to involve Bophuthatswana in the  electoral process.    The committee welcomed the meeting held recently between ANC  Chairman Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi and urged both leaders to continue the  course of dialogue and cooperation, not just between themselves,  but also with all the other political figures to end the  devastating wave of violence and to pave the way for elections  in a secure and peaceful atmosphere to build a new, democratic  South Africa.    The committee categorically rejected and candidly condemned  recent threats and acts of violence by those who deliberately  wish to wear down the people and prevent the majority of South  Africans from exercising their lawful right to choose their  leaders and turn the page on the tragic chapters of the past for  the first time. It appealed to the patriotic spirit of party  leaders boycotting the elections and threatening to obstruct and  dismantle the electoral process to reconsider their position and  refrain from depriving their people of the right to partake of  the biggest and most serious change in the history of South  Africa. It also appealed to them to do their utmost to  guarantee freedom of political activity all over the country and  to hold the elections in a safe, peaceful atmosphere.    In this context, the committee expressed its deep concern  over recent statements by kwaZulu leaders, statements that seek  to destroy the country's unity. The OAU had rejected all  attempts to partition the country, since they dramatically  threaten peace and stability in the southern part of the  continent and the entire region, and viewed these attempts as  absolutely unacceptable.    The committee invited the South African Government and all  political leaders in South Africa to take the necessary measures  to protect and guarantee South African territorial integrity.  The OAU called on the international community to maintain its  support for the democratic process in South Africa and to reject  any attempt to divide the country.    The committee reiterated its firm support for the democratic  process in and the unity of South Africa, the process that  serves and protects the greater interests of those living in the  country, regardless of ethnic, cultural, or religious  considerations. The committee is eager to see a new, democratic  South Africa join the OAU house to enhance the organization and  play its natural role in the greater international community.    It welcomed the participation of the international  community,  including the United Nations, the European Union, and the  British Commonwealth, in monitoring the elections. It urged all  South African parties to cooperate fully with the international  observers in their mission. In this context, the committee  expressed its appreciation of the OAU member states that pledged  to send observers to monitor the elections and urged those that  have not done so to do the same.    On behalf of all OAU member states, the heads of states and  the heads of delegations taking part in the 10th ordinary  session of the Southern African Committee welcome the new South  Africa as a member of the OAU after the April 1994 elections and  the establishment of a democratic government.    The heads of states and governments and delegation chairmen  expressed their deep appreciation and gratitude for His  Excellency President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the  government and people of Zimbabwe for their hospitality and the  excellent facilities they have provided to them during their  meeting.

AFRICA;    LARGEST REMAINING U.S. FIRM BELIEVED TO BE SELLING ASSETS      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Mobil Oil Co., the largest U.S. company remaining in South Africa, is selling  its operations at bargain prices to the oil subsidiary of a South African  mining conglomerate, newspapers reported today.    Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United States declined to comment  on the reports.    Business Day of Johannesburg quoted ""banking and other sources"" as confirming  the sale of about $400 million in assets for $150 million and said the Mobil  properties would be sold in separate deals over a period of time.    Mobil has been in South Africa for 90 years, and its four subsidiaries employ  almost 2,800 people. The oil company has been a symbol of foreign business  reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the  white-minority government's suppression of the black majority in the system  known as apartheid.    Partly because of South Africa's race policies, more than 170 American  companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Most have sold their  operations at low prices to South African-controlled businesses.    Since Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil concern, pulled out of South Africa in  1986, Mobil had insisted it would not bow to pressure to disinvest, despite  pressure on the company by anti-apartheid groups in the United States.    The South African Broadcasting Corp. reported Wednesday that Mobil may have  changed its stance on disinvestment because of a bill passed by the U.S.  Congress in its rush to adjourn before Christmas in 1987. The bill by Rep.  Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) removed the right of U.S. taxpayers to credit taxes  paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S. government.    At least two shareholder resolutions exhorting Mobil to vacate South Africa are  on the agenda at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for May 11.    The Star of Johannesburg, the nation's largest daily, reported that ""industry  sources confirmed"" Mobil was selling its South African assets for an estimated  500 million rand, roughly $125 million.    The Citizen, another Johannesburg daily, quoted ""local and overseas"" sources as  saying Mobil was considering disinvesting. The paper said Mobil is the largest  non-South African controlled employer in the country with 1,000 gasoline  stations, a $225-million investment in an oil refinery and a distribution  network.

AFRICA;    LARGEST REMAINING U.S. FIRM BELIEVED TO BE SELLING ASSETS      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Mobil Oil Co., the largest U.S. company remaining in South Africa, is selling  its operations at bargain prices to the oil subsidiary of a South African  mining conglomerate, newspapers reported today.    Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United States declined to comment  on the reports.    Business Day of Johannesburg quoted ""banking and other sources"" as confirming  the sale of about $400 million in assets for $150 million and said the Mobil  properties would be sold in separate deals over a period of time.    Mobil has been in South Africa for 90 years, and its four subsidiaries employ  almost 2,800 people. The oil company has been a symbol of foreign business  reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the  white-minority government's suppression of the black majority in the system  known as apartheid.

Tonight in our program we focus on the manifestos of the Freedom  Front and the African National Congress [ANC]. Later on the two  parties debate these manifestos. The question of a volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland] raised a lot of eyebrows when it was first  mooted and it remains one of the most contentious issues to come  to the fore in recent years. I am now being joined by the  Freedom Front's General Tienie Groenewald and the ANC's Carl  Niehaus. Good evening gentlemen and welcome. What is the real  state of affairs? Are we going to have a volkstaat? Mr. Nelson  Mandela proclaims that during his lifetime there will never be a  volkstaat. What is the latest?    [Niehaus] Well, Leslie, the important issue is whether we  are  keen to address the concerns that everyone in this country has  of different languages and different cultures. The ANC says we  are. We are keen to try and work out a feasible and a workable  plan on how to address these concerns. You know, this is not a  new thing. We had said since 1955 that all the languages and  all the cultures in this country must be able to grow and  develop, but we also say there are practical ways of doing it  and there are impractical approaches, and an impractical  approach is to insist on a geographical area, a specific piece  of land, and the reason why we say that is very simple, not  because we try to deny anyone in this country their rights,  their culture, their language, but because the reality is that  nowhere in South Africa are the Afrikaners or that group of the  Afrikaners who support a volkstaat, and they are a minority,  even amongst Afrikaners, nowhere are they in the majority in any  geographical area. And the citizens ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Okay, but ...    [Niehaus, continuing] Can I just conclude this, because it's  crucial. The people who live in that area are in every area --  the majority are black people, and what I hear from the  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] is that those people will  not be able to have full citizenship. They won't have voting  rights. They will be in a position of second class citizens.  That is unacceptable. The ANC had fought since 1912 for  nonracialism, for an inclusive democracy which will grant rights  to everyone. We cannot now come and grant rights to one group  to the detriment, at the cost of the majority of our people.    [Mashokwe] Tienie Groenewald, the ANC's manifesto says the  land belongs to all who live in it. In a way it is an inclusive  document which seems to be addressing some of your concerns.    [Groenewald] You'd like my comment on the ANC's statement  that the land belongs to everyone? Certainly, we do not deny  that but in South Africa we have all three major causes for  conflict. There are only three causes for conflict. The first,  is disputes over territory, secondly, disputes over ethnicity or  nationalism, and thirdly, disputes over religion or ideology.  There is not one single unitary state in the whole world where  these three causes of conflict are present in states that are  democratic states. The only states where this occurred was  where you had a dictatorship, such as the old Soviet Union and  in Yugoslavia, and the moment you imposed a democracy these  states fell apart, which proves one thing -- that when the  causes of conflict are present, and the three causes of conflict  are present in any particular state, then you must look at a  different dispensation. Now in this respect what we've done in  South Africa is -- we have been led by the ideological thinking  and the constitutional thinking, mainly from the communist  sphere of influence on the one side, and secondly, by American  thinking as to what is good for South Africa. We never looked  at the European examples, examples such as Switzerland, examples  such as Belgium. Now if we take those examples we find that  these were countries where you had the same causes for conflict,  and they went for a constitutional dispensation in which power  was basically brought down as close to the people as possible.  Now this, this is where the basic difference is in the ANC's  policies and our policies. Now coming back to the points that  Mr. Niehaus made, now first of all, could I correct a few  statements. He said first of all there is no such area in which  there is a concentration of Afrikaners, in which the Afrikaners  are the majority. In the discussions that we've had with the  ANC, we have presented to them a scientific map in which there  is an area of approximately 14 percent in which there is a  majority of Afrikaners. Now this is the first point which I  think is extremely important.    [Mashokwe] Where is this area?    [Groenewald] This area has Pretoria as the center, with a  part of the eastern Transvaal, a part of the western Transvaal,  and a part of the northern [Orange] Free State. Now let's come  back to the second point. That second point was that in this  volkstaat only Afrikaners will have the vote. Now let me say  that this question is still being debated, and we are still  negotiating with the ANC, and there is an accord which is  presently being negotiated which specifically addresses this  particular point, of voting rights within the volkstaat. That  question has not been resolved yet.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Niehaus, you want to respond quickly?    [Niehaus] Well, first of all, the question of voting rights  is not resolved because there is a continuation and an  insistence from the Volksfront that they want to give special  rights to what they call the Afrikaner group who they want to  see as exclusively in control of that area, but secondly,  nowhere in South Africa, I repeat again, is there an area where  Afrikaners are in the majority. Of course you can go and take a  small little area in Pretoria, where because of the Group Areas  Act there may be a majority of whites living there, but that  area is an integrated part of an economic system and Pretoria is  integrated with Mamelodi, with Atteridgeville, and all the areas  surrounding it. It's an impractical suggestion, except if Gen.  Groenewald is saying that those areas such as Mamelodi and  Atteridgeville should be used in the old racist and apartheid  system, as satellites to the Pretoria area where they will be  able to monopolize the economic power and make use of people who  come in on the basis of migrant labor, moving in and out to work  there and not being able to deal in the richness and in the  economy of that area.    [Mashokwe] Let's get Gen. Groenewald to explain his position  with regards to the areas -- the black areas around Pretoria for  instance, because you mentioned Pretoria particularly.    [Groenewald] Now I can give you examples, in the United  States for example ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let's look at Pretoria.    [Groenewald] Okay, but let me give you an example of what is  acceptable in the rest of the world. In the United States they  have demarcated certain constituencies, one in particular which  is a hundred miles in length, and at one place a hundred yards  wide, specifically to draw in an area in which the negroes have  a majority so that they could have more negro seats in the  senate. In Belgium they have drawn ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let's look at Pretoria. I am  worried about time.    [Groenewald] Now what I'm saying is we should also look at  how these problems are solved in the rest of the world, and we  find in Belgium, in particular, the boundaries have been drawn  very strictly along language lines. Now whether you draw the  boundary in such a way that Pretoria is in the Volkstaat, and  for example Mamelodi and Atteridgeville is outside, that does  not really matter. What matters is what happens to the  industrial areas, in the areas in which the wealth is created,  in those areas where people work and where the jobs are, on  which side of the border ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] It doesn't answer the question on  what do you do with the people around there. Do they become  part and parcel of the volkstaat, of the Pretoria volkstaat as  it were, or are they migrant laborers as its was the case in the  past?    [Groenewald] No, there's no reason whatsoever why they  should  be migrant laborers.    [Mashokwe] Dormitory townships?    [Groenewald] Yes, there is no reason whatsoever ...    [Mashokwe] What do they do? Do they then have their own  little black volkstaat outside of Pretoria?    [Groenewald] If they want it. This is the advantage. If  they want it. Now the point -- let me just explain this to you.  We are not talking of a South Africa which is economically  completely segregated. We are talking about an area in which  economically we are still integrated as we are in South Africa  today. There's no reason why we cannot do that.    [Mashokwe] Let me get Carl to respond and react quickly to  this.    [Niehaus] Leslie, we are talking about a lappieskombers  [patchwork quilt], as we say in Afrikaans -- little pieces of  land torn apart, but the reality is this kind of proposal  doesn't take into consideration that throughout South Africa,  through all the different cultural groups, through all the  language groups -- now no group that says as a majority they  want a volkstaat. There is a small minority in the Volksfront  who say they want a volkstaat, and the reality is that in this  country there are political divides that cut across all the  different language groups and all the different cultural groups.  I'm sitting here tonight. I'm an Afrikaner. I don't want to be  part of a volkstaat and the vast majority of the Afrikaners  don't want to be part of a volkstaat, so the concept, as it was  set out for some of the European nations, doesn't work for South  Africa because in this country we have a South African nation  where people, regardless of whether they are Afrikaners, Zulus,  Xhosas, are identifying themselves with particular political  ideals set out in the ANC, in the Volksfront, in the National  Party, in the Democratic Party, all of those parties.    [Mashokwe] Could you respond quickly.    [Groenewald] That is what the negotiations with the ANC is  about, to prove substantial support and by means of  participating in the election, to also prove exactly where the  boundaries of such a volkstaat should be. In other words, what  I'm saying, is the whole question of support and the question of  boundaries is a question which will be resolved in the election  on the 27 April, so let's not argue about that now. We'll see  what happens on the 27 April as far as substantial support is  concerned. Let me also add that all the opinion polls, all the  meetings we have had at this stage, proves beyond all doubt that  70-80 percent of Afrikaners in South Africa want a volkstaat.    [Mashokwe] The one question that always bothers people is  that who are the Afrikaners, who are the Boere and who are these  people? That seems to be confusing the issue all the more  Tienie.    [Groenewald] Yes, certainly, but in every nation, in any  ethno-cultural group you have divergent views.    [Mashokwe] Are you Boer or are you Afrikaner?    [Groenewald] I'm an Afrikaner Boer and I can explain that to  you, but I think the point is you took a statement made by Mr.  Robert van Tonder. He is not a member of the Volksfront and he  is not a member of our party.    [Mashokwe] But he is one of the Afrikaners, one of the  Boere.    [Groenewald] Okay, he is one of the Boere. Now the point I'd  like to make is, Carl considers himself an Afrikaner, as I  certainly do, now the first point I'd like to make -- an  Afrikaner knows whether he is an Afrikaner or not. There are  two requirements. First of all you must classify yourself as  something, and secondly, once you have classified yourself to a  particular group then that group must also recognize you as part  of that group. Those are the basic two criteria.    [Mashokwe] Thank you. Carl you were going to respond to Gen.  Groenewald.    [Niehaus] Yes, it immediately links with what Gen.  Groenewald  is saying. Who is the Afrikaner? The Afrikaner is diverse.  There is no center really of who the Afrikaner is. I am an  Afrikaner, Gen. Groenewald is an Afrikaner, but the real issue  is, is there anyone who tries to talk on behalf of the  Afrikaner, who put themselves so to speak at the gate of  Afrikanerdom, and is arrogant enough to say that they talk on  behalf of Afrikaners? There I must take issue, because Gen.  Groenewald and the Afrikaner Volksfront very often says that  they are talking on behalf of the Afrikaner and I don't know on  whose behalf they are talking. They are definitely not talking,  and I repeat again, on behalf of the majority of Afrikaners.  The Markinor survey of a few weeks ago said exactly the  opposite of what Gen. Groenewald is saying about support for the  volkstaat, in fact, it said that six out of every 10 supporters  of the Afrikaner Volksfront is not prepared to leave their  territory, to leave their land, and sacrifice anything for the  sake of a volkstaat. So it's very weak support even amongst  those groups who identify themselves.    [Mashokwe] Okay Carl, let me get Gen. Groenewald here to  explain to me exactly what is going to happen then to the people  who happen to be in those areas that are designated as the  volkstaat.    [Groenewald] Let me say first of all that we don't expect  anyone to leave any part of South Africa and to move to the  volkstaat. The idea of a volkstaat ...    [Mashokwe interrupting] What about people who are in the  volkstaat -- in the areas that you designate as a volkstaat?    [Groenewald] Exactly the same thing. We do not expect mass  movements of people. This is not what the intention of the  volkstaat is. What we are saying is that we'd like a center  somewhere where we as a people can survive, where our culture  can grow, where we have the political power to determine our own  future. It's a matter of...[pauses] We have been talking about  the volkstaat all the time, but the critical question is the one  of self-determination. It's a matter of being in the position  where you determine, as a people you determine your own future.  Now this does not mean that in South Africa we are looking at  mass movement of people. This is certainly not the intention.    [Niehaus] There are two questions: The first one is, if  there  is not going to be mass movement of people out of the volkstaat,  will every person who lives in that volkstaat have exactly the  same rights as every Afrikaner? Will they vote there? Will  they be able, if they are the majority, when they have a  political party, to take over the government of that area?  That's the first question. And the second question, in addition  to that is, are we actually saying to each other that it is  possible to talk about self- determination without a  geographical area, because the ANC says, we believe it is -- we  believe we can address the center of concern that Gen.  Groenewald is talking about without granting a particular  independent geographical area, and that is, can I just  emphasize, that is exactly the crux of the question that we have  been debating and what that memorandum that Gen. Groenewald is  referring to is trying to address.    [Groenewald] Let me answer that question quickly by saying  no  people has ever, in the history of mankind, survived without  having their own geographic area. That is the first and a vital  question, so geographic area is very much a part of the survival  of any people. Secondly, as far as citizenship is concerned and  as far as civil rights is concerned, and as far as voting rights  is concerned, whatever system we eventually negotiate in the  volkstaat will have to conform to international accepted  standards.    [Mashokwe] So you will not discriminate against people who  are not Afrikaners?    [Groenewald] No, no certainly not.    [Niehaus] So there will be the chance for the black majority  in that area to take control and to rule that area together with  a united South Africa.    [Groenewald] I'm not saying that.    [Niehaus] That's the crux of the question.    [Groenewald] No, that's not the crux of the question. The  question is: We have a South Africa, and a South Africa which  belongs to everyone, now what we are now saying is let us in  this South Africa find a place for everyone of the different  ethno- cultural groups. That's the first and vital question.  So we don't want a situation ...    [Mashokwe] Is there such a place?    [Groenewald] Yes, there is such a place. I have indicated  this to you, but you see what you've done is you have  concentrated so far on the volkstaat, you've concentrated on the  question of self-determination, but we should start looking at  the alternatives. We should start looking at the ANC  alternative, because what we have done so far is we have limited  this discussion ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Okay. What problems do you have  with that one?    [Groenewald] Okay, now let me tell you what the basic  problem  is, and this is the crux of the political problem in South  Africa, is the fact that the ANC wants to concentrate all the  power at the center so all political power must be at the  center, and in the present constitution, and certainly according  to the viewpoints of people like Mr. Joe Slovo, and people that  we have negotiated with, that there is not single, not one  single critical function that has been devolved to provinces or  to the different states, not one. There is no exclusive powers  whatsoever in the provinces. This basically means that because  all the power is at the center, and as far away from the people  as possible, this is an absolute requirement for the creation of  a Marxist state or a socialist state where you have central  planning. We say no. We want the power as close as possible to  the people in the provinces.    [Mashokwe] Let me respond to that -- power to the people.  Don't you believe in that?    [Niehaus] With respect, I don't agree at all with Gen.  Groenewald that the African National Congress and the other  negotiating parties have not taken great care and went to great  lengths to try and accommodate the concerns of the Freedom  Alliance. That is why we had another session of the negotiating  council and why a number of powers were actually devolved to the  regions, and Gen. Groenewald knows that those powers as they  were set out at the last session of the negotiations council  actually were exactly the powers that were negotiated and  discussed with the Freedom Alliance, so that is not correct, but  secondly, let us talk actually about economic policy because  that is the crux of the matter.    [Groenewald] I think we must, we must first talk about this  issue of exclusive powers, because a wrong statement was made by  Mr. Niehaus and we must correct that statement.    [Mashokwe] Correct it now and we have to move on.    [Groenewald] Certainly, we'd like to move on. The point I'd  like to make is -- the functions negotiated and passed on to  provinces in the changes in the constitution were powers  previously that presided with local authorities, like abattoirs,  and it was now pulled up to the second level of government.    [Mashokwe] But are you not happy with that at least?    [Groenewald] Of course, because they are not exclusive,  because there are at least seven provisions -- subjects -- so  there is not one function that has been allocated to provinces.  Secondly, all the functions of provinces can be changed by the  central government without the authority of the provinces.    [Mashokwe] Is it not a fact Carl?    [Niehaus] Leslie, the fact is that those powers, including  the powers of abattoirs were exactly the ones that were asked  for by the Volksfront and especially that the leader of the  Conservative Party, Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg, had asked for. The  sad thing is that it seems that Dr. Hartzenberg and members of  the Volksfront have not even known exactly what they were asking  for, because once we gave it to them then they complained that  they were not getting the powers that they wanted, and we gave  them exactly what was discussed.    [Groenewald] That is not true. That's simply not true.    [Mashokwe] Gen. Groenewald, let's look at how you are going  to address the issue of the disadvantaged people and the fact  that we had a situation where the Afrikaners were poor and now  they are the economic powerhouse of this country. Are you going  to address that one?    [Groenewald] First of all, when we look at the volkstaat as  such, or the proposed volkstaat, it only -- it provides for  approximately 12 percent of the GNP of the whole of South  Africa, so it's one of the poorer areas of South Africa. I  think this is the first and the most important point. The  second point I'd like to make is in the volkstaat we'll have an  absolutely freemarket economy. You cannot always create wealth  by taking away from the rich and giving to the poor. I think  this is the first point.    [Mashokwe] But there was an important thing that happened in  1929 when the Afrikaners were poor, there was a deliberate  effort at empowering them economically. Are you going to do the  same in addressing the demands and the wishes of the black  majority in this country, or are you at all worried about that  problem?    [Groenewald] No, of course we are. The important thing is  that everyone has a responsibility towards the socioeconomic  upliftment of those people who are less advantaged. This is a  commitment which we all have. The question is how do you do it.  Do you do it through a program by creating a socialist economy  or do you do it by creating wealth through a freemarket system.  Now our point is that if you employ a socialist sys?em there is  no way in which you are going to get foreign investment.    [Mashokwe] You are not suggesting that the ANC is ...    [Groenewald] Of course they are. Of course they are.    [Niehaus] Well, that's surprising because the ANC is not  having a socialist system. We say that we have an economic plan  that must create jobs and we say that we work in an integrated  and complex economy where those jobs must be created. You  cannot do it in little pieces of land. It must be an integrated  process of having the necessary public works programs, laying on  electricity to all our people, building roads, running water,  all of those issues.    [Mashokwe] But then how are you, Carl, how then are you  going  to have the state playing such an important role in creating all  these jobs?    [Niehaus] Well, the state will play an important role in  helping to direct this process together with the private sector.  We are saying we will enter into a partnership where the state  will help with the creation of a public works program, but we  will also, together with the private sector, help with the  creation of small business and that again is an issue which  cannot be addressed in small areas. It must be a national  approach, of course devolved through the nine provinces that we  have, and the ANC says that as the Afrikaners in 1929 and 1948  were trying to change around an unjust system, I agree,  Afrikaners were disadvantaged, they were being discriminated  against, so has the majority of people in this country got the  right to change that system around but not through an unjust and  divided economy. Through an integrated economy that will serve  ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Okay, let's get into this point ...    [Niehaus] Just give me a chance. I think Gen. Groenewald has  been receiving quite a lot of time. And the ANC says, yes, let  us work together. Let us get also the expertise of the  Afrikaners, and I think the Afrikaners have got a lot of  important expertise to ensure that jobs are being created for  all our people, but let us not isolate the Afrikaner and  sideline them and put them in that area that only has 12 percent  of the gross national product, and actually create a new  situation where the Afrikaner will be impoverished by this plan  of standing apart from the rest of South Africa.    [Mashokwe] Tienie?    [Groenewald] I can assure you one thing, that we will not be  impoverished, but I think the important thing is, and this  really is the Achilles heel of the ANC -- let's leave the  economy to private enterprise and not to the state, because this  is the basic, the real basic difference between the policy of  the Freedom Front and the policy of the ANC. The policy of the  ANC is centralizing everything -- political control, the  economy, everything. The state must control every individual.  What we say, the state has but one responsibility, one prime  responsibility, and that is to see that the individual is not  exploited and that the individual is safe. That's basically it.  Let's leave the economy over to industrialists, to private  enterprise.    [Mashokwe] But Gen. Groenewald, the Nationalist Party  government took the bold step of addressing the Afrikaner  problem. How are you then going to address the black problem  this time of deprived people, disadvantaged people? Do you care  for their vote? Should they vote for you?    [Groenewald] Let me say, first of all, as far as black  people  are concerned. Of course you have to create jobs, but so far  experience throughout the world has proved one thing, and that  is that socialism, state control of the economy has destroyed  job opportunities and not created it. This is the experience of  Africa. This is the experience of every Marxist state throughout  the whole world. What we do find is those economies that have  grown, that have relieved the problems of poverty amongst the  people has been those states in which you have a private sector.    [Mashokwe] You are not answering my question on affirmative  action General with due respect.    [Niehaus] But Leslie, with respect ...    [Groenewald] I beg your pardon?    [Mashokwe] You are not responding to my question on  affirmative action.    [Niehaus] But can I just come in quickly, because Gen.  Groenewald ...    [Mashokwe] But let him respond to that one.    [Niehaus] I think he can respond but he keeps on harping on  socialism. The ANC is not presenting a socialist program. We  are presenting a plan where the private sector, the different  trade unions, all the people of this country, all the different  economic interest groups have worked together in the national  economic forum and also in the plan that we have developed in  the Reconstruction and Development Program.    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let me get Gen. Groenewald to  respond first to my question. Thank you, Carl.    [Groenewald] To the whole question of affirmative action?    [Mashokwe] Yes, what are you going to do on that one?    [Groenewald] Let me say that we have been busy with  affirmative action for a very long time. Let me give you an  example. From 1970 -- from 1970 until 1990 there has been a  real increase in black wages of 70 percent.    [Mashokwe] We are talking about the Freedom Front please.    [Groenewald] No I'm just indicating to you that we have been  busy with a whole program of affirmative action for the last 20  years. There has been enormous changes. Now affirmative action  is something which should be related first of all to your  productive capacity -- the creation of wealth in the country  through private enterprise, and jobs being created, certainly,  by private enterprise and not by the state. Now this is the  first and important question, so it's a very delicate measure of  having a system of taxation ...    [Mashokwe] Let me hold you right there. Carl Niehaus,  respond quickly.    [Groenewald] Let me just complete it. Let me just complete  my point.    [Mashokwe] Let him respond.    [Niehaus] Well, you interrupted me so now can I proceed.    [Mashokwe] Please continue. We'll come back to you.    [Niehaus] General Groenewald knows very well that no  economy that is successful in Western Europe and in the United  States is only, simply a private enterprise. It is a  combination of state and private enterprise, and the ANC says,  let us first of all acknowledge that there was an unjust system  in this country and that system needs to be turned around and  the state, together with private enterprise has got a role to do  it. And with respect Gen. Groenewald, the National Party who  you seem to refer to as having implemented some kind of program  of affirmative action in the past, has not done so. If we look  at the World Bank's economic index, the one category where South  Africa comes first is on the category of the most divided  society and the most unequal society in the world. That has to  be addressed ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let him respond quickly Carl.    [Groenewald] Look, I'm not arguing about that. We are  talking about the future, first of all, and the point that I  wanted to make is that in your system of taxation, which is the  base and which will be the base of the ANC's program of  affirmative action, it's a matter of a delicate balance, whereby  you can have enough funds available for investment through  private enterprise and enough funds available for so-called  affirmative action.    [Mashokwe] Carl, you were still explaining one thing or the  other with regard to the economic policies. Yes, the hand of  the state seems to be very strong. To what extent would you  then say the private sector is able to maneuver and create jobs?    [Niehaus] Well, the private sector will be able to maneuver  and create jobs very well. If you look at our plan we say there  are certain sectors where obviously the private sector will have  a real problem in providing for all the needs like the provision  of electricity, but we say let us work together, for example, on  the building of houses in a combination with the private sector.  The state will help through a public works program, through  providing some resources and so will we expect from the private  sector to do so, and Gen. Groenewald agreed with me, although he  initially just spoke about free enterprise, that in no state  that is truly successful there is only free enterprise.    There is always this combination and those countries like  Chile during the last few years that have been truly successful  have worked out a plan, and it is a comprehensive plan that  includes the whole geographical area. It can't be a plan that  is divided by the kind of volkstaat concept that Gen. Groenewald  has. That is the plan for poverty and that is a plan for  division and eventually for a total destruction of the South  African nation.    [Mashokwe] Okay, let me get Gen. Groenewald here. I asked  you earlier whether you want black votes.    [Groenewald] At this stage our intention is to get a  volkstaat, but certainly, everyone, everyone who cherishes the  question of self-determination, will find in the Freedom Front a  party that will do everything in their power to achieve a  constitutional dispensation in South Africa where  self-determination plays a central role.    [Mashokwe] Do you want black votes?    [Groenewald] We are not going out of our way to specifically  look for black votes.    [Mashokwe] So you are racist.    [Groenewald] No, please don't say that. It's not a question  of racism. It's a question that we are looking at the self-  determination, first of all, of the Afrikaner people. That's  what it's all about, and this has got nothing to do with racism.  Let's be quite clear about that.    [Mashokwe] Okay, Carl.    [Niehaus] Leslie, at a time when we are in South Africa's  history where the injustices of the past must be put right,  where the people who have been oppressed must be helped to  become part of a full South African nation, Gen. Groenewald is  saying: We are not interested in black votes. We are simply  there to continue to help to promote those who have been  privileged in the past. That is, he said the Achilles heel --  in the past he used that concept -- that is the Achilles heel of  the Volksfront, and unfortunately this whole evening Gen.  Groenewald has been beating around the bush and I must really  thank you for having put your finger on the real issue. Behind  all the nice talk, the Volksfront still has the festering sore  of racism and the Afrikaner cannot afford that. The Afrikaners  cannot allow ourselves to be pulled into that situation. The  Afrikaner can only survive, Leslie, in a united South Africa.  The Afrikaner is strong enough to do so without geographical  areas. We've got a good language. We've got a good culture.    [Mashokwe] General.    [Groenewald] Okay, let me emphasize this once and for all.  South Africa is looking at a constitutional dispensation in  which we will have peace. We have many examples in the world,  examples such as Switzerland, which went through a period of  enormous friction and violence until they resolved a situation  in which you have good neighbors working together as a group.  We are not racist. What we are saying is that let's move power  away from the center and let's realize that in South Africa we  have different ethno-cultural groups who must take hands across  the table, who must take hands across the table and find a way  in which they can live together in such a way they do not  destroy each other.    [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, your concluding statements    [Niehaus] Well, Leslie, racism is evil. It must be rejected.  In whatever form it comes, even in a Afrikaner Volksfront form.  What we need in South Africa is an economic plan. A plan for  justice, a plan to give free education for the first 10 years to  our children, to provide proper health care. That can only be  done in a united, nonracial South Africa. The only organization  that has such a plan is the ANC and that we will promote.    [Mashokwe] Thank you, your last statements.    [Groenewald] Let me say the solution in South Africa is not  imposing a system that has never worked in the Soviet Union or  in other socialist countries. Let us look at a system in which  we have a new and modern approach -- approach where everyone can  have his own dignity and his own place under the sun, and this  is what the Freedom Front proposes.    [Mashokwe] On that note, Gen. Groenewald, Carl Niehaus,  thanks for joining us on Newsline. Goodnight.     "

The court records of the trial of Brigadier Johann Blaauw in  1989 show that De Klerk's statement to parliament contained  three direct lies about South Africa's collaboration with other  countries in the nuclear programme. It also indicates that he  underplayed the extent of the programme when he told of the  existence of no more than six crude atomic bombs. The record  also puts on display the level of corruption in the government  in the 1980s, allowing former minister of mines Fanie Botha, a  perpetual insolvent, to sit in parliament and the cabinet and  even serve as leader of the House. Judge J. Friedman said that  in order to hide his state of affairs Botha was ""prepared to  commit perjury, fraud and deceit; he was prepared to become  involved in political chicanery of the most despicable kind ...  he was prepared to lie to the prosecutor ... he was prepared to  lie deliberately under oath ... no reliance can be placed on his  evidence.""    Botha was later jailed for one year. Transcripts of the  trial confirm South Africa and Israel collaborated on the  development of nuclear weapons -- and prove De Klerk lied on  three counts:     -  He stated South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons  technology or material from another country.    -  He stated that South Africa had never provided material to  another country.    -  He stated that South Africa had never co-operated with  another  country in this regard.       The September 1989 Supreme Court judgment, in the ""in  camera""  case of former South African Air Force [SAAF] Brigadier Blaauw,  reveals startling details of South African-Israeli swaps of  nuclear weapon technology and material and extensive  collaboration between the two. Until now reporting on the  judgment has been banned under the Nuclear Energy Act and the  Criminal Procedure Act. As recently as last week, the  government tried to block the story threatening the SUNDAY TIMES  with an interdict if it printed it.    In October 1987, Blaauw was charged with attempting to  extort  mining concessions from Botha, by threatening to reveal that he  was financially bankrupt. During the trail it emerged that  Blaauw had in fact shored up Botha's finances with the help of  the Israelis and brokered many of the key nuclear deals between  South Africa and Israel. Blaauw was found not guilty on all  charges.    After his retirement from the SAAF in 1975, Blaauw acted as  a  go-between for Israel and South Africa on military matters. In  1976, he was approached by a member of an Israeli council  involved in the clandestine purchase of nuclear materials and  asked to obtain South African ""yellow cake"" for Israel. Yellow  cake is an uranium oxide which, when enriched, can be used for  the production of nuclear weapons.    Blaauw got agreement for the sale of 50 [metric] tons of  yellow cake from the then prime minister B.J. Vorster, and the  former head of the Bureau of State security, Hendrik van den  Bergh, despite resistance from the then minister of mines, Piet  Koornhof. Koornhof was replaced by Botha who was instructed to  ensure the deal went through. Blaauw arranged a tour of Israeli  military installations for Botha and the Israelis quickly struck  up a good relationship with Botha.    Said the judgment: ""Blaauw testified that there was, at that  stage, a high degree of confidence developing between the South  African and Israeli governments which involved the exchange of  military technology, joint aeronautic ventures and the supply of  `knowhow' by Israel to South Africa in regard to the manufacture  of weaponry.""    After the yellow cake deal went through, Blaauw was asked by  Van den Bergh to see if Israel would supply tritium to South  Africa. Tritium boosts the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The  Israelis agreed to supply 30g of tritium to South Africa --  enough for 12 atomic bombs. In exchange, South Africa delivered  two more consignments of yellow cake, of 50 [metric] tons and  500 [metric] tons, to Israel.    Details of the transactions are recorded in CRITICAL MASS, a  recently published book by William Burrows and Robert Windrem,  which investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons among  developing countries. While the deals were going through, Botha  slid into bankruptcy and his political career was threatened by  a R[rand]1.7-million overdraft he owed Volkskas. But help was  at hand.    Said the judgment: ""The Israelis were interested in keeping  Botha in the portfolio of mines because the yellow cake  transactions had not yet fully materialised. There was every  possibility of Botha becoming the minister of defence and they  would have preferred Botha to hold that portfolio.""    The Israelis gave Blaauw $1-million -- then worth R800,000  --  as a ""gift for what I had done for them."" With the money,  Blaauw gave Botha cash transfusions and kept him financially and  politically alive. Blaauw and Botha fell out after Botha failed  to deliver valuable mining concessions promised to Blaauw as a  reward for his services to South Africa's nuclear programme,in  July 1979.    In court, Botha alleged Blaauw attempted to force him to  hand  over the concessions by threatening to reveal details of Botha's  illegal attempts to get evidence of corruption from his rivals  in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party, after  the fall of Vorster in 1979.    In his speech to parliament in March last year, when he  announced he had ordered the dismantling of South Africa's  nuclear arsenal, De Klerk baldly stated: ""I wish to emphasise  that at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear weapons  technology or materials from another country, nor has it  provided any to any other country, or co-operated with another  country in this regard.""    When confronted with the court records by the international  London based magazine, AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, which first broke  the story, the office of the state president replied: ""South  Africa did not acquire nuclear weapons technology from another  country. Although tritium many be used in initiators of nuclear  explosive devices, (although not in the devices produced by  South Africa) it has many other commercial uses. South Africa  has been active in the commercial exploitation of tritium for  some time and has procured this material from various sources in  the past.""    Despite De Klerk's 1993 announcement, details of South  Africa's nuclear programme remain shrouded in secrecy. Said ANC  [African National Congress] science and technology head Roger  Jardine: ""They are prepared to give a tour of the complex but  have never given details of the programme. A senior official  once offered to tell me everything -- but only if I signed the  Official Secrets Act.""     "

He said Pretoria may choose to recognize both Taipei and  Beijing, which would benefit Taipei because other countries  might then be prompted to follow suit. And such a policy on the  part of South Africa would not mean Taiwan has abandoned its  ""one-China"" policy, he asserted.    But he added that Taiwan has ""no right to snoop into South  Africa's external relations,"" saying it was up to Pretoria to  decide with whom to make friends.     "

KCET station manager and programming chief Stephen Kulczycki, who last week  decided to drop the program, said Thursday that he stands by his original  objection that the program was slanted in favor of the African National  Congress but that he will monitor it in coming weeks to see if it becomes more  balanced.    ""We will continue to monitor the series on the satellite feeds and try to get  some sense of whether the concerns we've expressed might show up in the  program,"" Kulczycki said. ""If (the producers) address the concerns we have  talked about, we might reconsider the choices we have made.""    ""South Africa Now"" producer Danny Schechter said that he was pleased Kulczycki  had opened the door to reconsideration but that he will not do anything  differently because he feels the program has always been fair.    ""If he's going to monitor, he'll find that the same program he rejected will  have a balanced presentation of what's going on in South Africa,"" Schechter  said.    For now, however, ""South Africa Now"" remains scheduled to leave KCET after the  last installment of the current 13-week batch runs Sunday at 9 a.m.    KCET's decision not to renew the program has enraged members of the Los Angeles  African-American community and anti-apartheid groups, who have threatened to  picket the station.    Several brought their complaints to the regularly scheduled meeting of KCET's  Community Advisory Board on Wednesday, and the board, whose volunteer members  are appointed to provide community feedback to station management, took up the  cause.    The advisory board issued a statement Thursday demanding that "" 'South Africa  Now' be returned to the air with a discussion panel or other vehicle to broaden  the range of issues covered; and/or (that KCET) immediately provide additional  (regular) programming on South Africa and the entire continent of Africa.""    Unhappiness with KCET's decision increased after a conservative media watchdog  organization claimed credit for having brought the show's alleged bias to  KCET's attention. David Horowitz, chairman of the Committee on Media Integrity,  met with station executives as many as half a dozen times and conducted a  yearlong letter-writing campaign against ""South Africa Now"" and other programs  broadcast on KCET.    KCET has vigorously denied Horowitz's contentions, but relations with community  members did not improve when the station canceled a scheduled meeting with  concerned leaders that was to have been held Wednesday. That evening, the  organizers who had planned to meet with Kulczycki and KCET president William  Kobin appeared instead before the Community Advisory Board.    ""African Americans are appalled,"" said Quincy Beaver, representing the  California Democratic Council. ""We are stunned.""    Michael Zinzun, the executive director of Friends of the African National  Congress and Front Line States, disputed Kulczycki's contention that because  there was no longer a press blackout in South Africa, the program was no longer  necessary.    ""It has just been 24 hours since George Bush vetoed the Civil Rights Act,""  Zinzun said. ""We are not in a position where we can let down our guard about  racism.""    In its statement Thursday, the advisory board said that it wanted to be  consulted about future programming decisions that might affect the community  and requested that the meeting with community leaders be rescheduled.    The board also said it did not believe that Horowitz had in any way influenced  management's decision regarding ""South Africa Now.""    Kobin said Thursday that he could not respond to the board's demands because he  had not yet read the statement.

The move by the local cable systems to pick up ""South Africa Now"" comes at a  time when cable -- through its non-commercial community access channels -- is  taking more of a role in airing alternative programming.

Speaking at a seminar on promotion of economic ties with  Africa, the commerce minister said: The government should  prepare the grounds for the establishment of extensive economic  ties with Africa by providing transport, banking, and insurance  facilities as well as export guarantees and information. He  said: The fact that there are 450 million Muslims living in the  African continent makes it imperative to broaden Iran's ties  with that continent on the basis of mutual interest. He added:  The Iranian airlines and shipping companies are ready to invest  in this field in an effort to promote economic relations between  Iran and the African countries. He told the seminar that in  1992 only 2.09 percent of Iran's total exports were supplied to  Africa and only 0.58 percent of the goods imported to the  country came from that continent.     "

He said the African  National Congress in South Africa has shown interest in the  idea, which was mooted by South African Foreign Minister R.F.  Botha during his visit to India last year.    Mr Khursheed, who was in South Africa from January 12-14,  said South African businessmen have shown interest in investing  in the tourism sector.    This was the second visit by the Minister in the last six  months to South Africa which, after emerging from the apartheid  era, is expected to hold multi-party elections in three months.      "

But he noted that South Africa would not undertake any peace-keeping duties unilaterally.

In Washington yesterday, Mr Trevor Manuel, South African trade and industry minister, said that the US and South African governments are working on various bilateral initiatives, including an investment pact, a double taxation treaty, and a conference in Atlanta to start tomorrow. South Africa plans to hold its largest trade exposition ever, on September 20-23 in New York City's convention centre. This will feature 150 South African businesses from a broad range of industries, including clothing, textile, furniture, domestic appliances, base materials, agricultural and industrial equipment, banking and financial services. Mr Manuel said the new government expects companies doing business in South Africa to adhere voluntarily to affirmative action plans for women and black people. The US commerce department, believing South Africa to be the key to trade in all of southern Africa, has marked the country for special attention by putting it on its list of 10 Emerging Markets, where it expects exports to grow the most. Also, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation is increasing its investment insurance in South Africa to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m). The US Export-Import Bank last year lifted conditions imposed because of apartheid. US exports to South Africa stand at Dollars 2.2bn, with South African exports to the US at nearly Dollars 2bn.

0,FT932-477 ,"FT932-477 _AN-DF2CGABKFT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / South Africa and EC begin reconciliation: The shaping of post-sanctions relations      By PHILIP GAWITH   AS South Africa moves into the post-sanctions era, aid, trade and political relations are being shaped with a crucial partner - the European Community. At a conference under way in Brussels both the European Commission and the South African government are laying out their stalls. Notwithstanding the tortuous progress of constitutional negotiations, Community officials accept that a new South Africa is emerging, and they are determined to be an important player in the post-apartheid process. There is already a substantial base of trade and investment relations to build on. Figures from the department of customs and excise show that in 1992 38.5 per cent, R46bn (Pounds 9.5bn) of a total R119.4bn visible trade, was with Europe. This compares with 34 per cent in 1985, before sanctions were implemented in earnest. European countries also account for most of the foreign investment in South Africa. The most recent available figures from the Reserve Bank (end 1988) show that of the cumulative R70bn foreign investment in the country by individuals and corporations, about 50 per cent came from Europe. The EC is also a significant donor to South Africa. The 1993 EC aid budget to South Africa is Ecu90m (Pounds 70.7m), its largest budget in Africa. Diplomatic links between South Africa and the EC are less developed. There is no formal diplomatic treaty and the EC is not formally present in Pretoria other than to administer its aid programme. Upgrading these links is important to South Africa, however, as the imprimatur of full diplomatic relations will improve the climate for trade and investment. Recent years have seen increasing efforts at diversification, mostly eastwards, of South Africa's trading links. Thus 20 per cent of South Africa's total trade in 1992 was with Asia, compared with 14.7 per cent in 1985. Taiwan has risen from nowhere to be one of South Africa's top 10 trading partners. Among South Africa's priorities in talks with Brussels will be what sort of trade preferences it should seek from the EC, which could affect 20 per cent of exports, most notably those from labour-intensive agriculture. The extent of preferences will depend on what sort of trading status South Africa is granted. Although a per capita annual income of about Dollars 2,300 ranks it as an upper middle-income developing country, other indicators - such as infant mortality, literacy, and reliance on a few commodity exports - are associated more with developing countries. At the conference yesterday Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve (central) Bank, said South Africa should consider seeking developing country status. 'I do not think that will decrease our credibility, but it will help us to develop the country much faster,' he said. His remarks, which were made in a personal capacity, echo the view on this issue held among others by Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president. At recent Gatt discussions in Geneva, however, Japan and the US gave notice that they would not support South Africa being given developing country status. It was advised to seek 'economy in transition' status, such as has been given to various east European countries, which affords similar benefits granted to developing countries, but on a less permanent basis. Given this background, South Africa will probably try to negotiate some specially tailored package of preferences with the EC rather than try to join the Lome Convention, a trade concession deal between a grouping of developing countries and industrialised countries. The latter route would cause all sorts of complications, as Lome's existing 80 members, all of whom are smaller and less developed than South Africa, would understandably oppose granting benefits to South Africa which, to some extent, would come at their expense. Included in this group are all of South Africa's neighbours. The EC has already made clear that its policy towards South Africa will be premised on viewing South Africa as part of the southern Africa region. Although there are growing ties between South Africa and its neighbours, the issue of how to integrate it into regional structures, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) is fraught with excessive expectations of what South Africa can do for the rest of the region and fears that it will dominate the others. South Africa accounts for about 75 per cent of regional gross domestic product. Although the shape of future South Africa/EC relations lies mostly in the hands of Brussels - where the extent of any concessions will be decided - their success will be determined in Pretoria. For South Africa's future will ultimately turn on whether its politicians can create a favourable climate for investment. If they fail in that, the rest will count for little.

Another  state that needs a similar treatment is Kelantan, which is now  under the PAS [Pan Malaysian Islamic Party] administration.  Press reports about Kelantan in 1993 showed a picture of  sadness with its people's standard of living declining steadily  compared to people living in other states.    The PAS often claims that it is fighting for the glory of  Islam, but the party has forgotten the fact that Islam wants its  followers to make progress instead of being stagnant or  impoverished. This state of backwardness was revealed when  Mohamed Rozali Isohak, deputy chief minister of Kelantan,  recently had to admit that the investment climate in the state  is not very promising. Along with a low investment level, the  poverty rate in both the rural and urban areas of the state is  quite high.    In 1993, the poverty rate in Kelantan was 29 percent, while  the overall nationwide poverty rate was 17.1 percent. Besides,  without investment projects, it is hard for any state to create  new jobs. It is worth noting that the unemployment rate in  Kelantan stands at 7.3 percent compared to the nationwide  unemployment rate of 5.4 percent. Within the period of two  years, a total of 23,218 unemployed had registered themselves  with the Kelantan People's Manpower Office, namely 13,869 in  1991 and 9,349 in 1992. During the same period, a total of  6,258 youths migrated to NF-controlled states to seek jobs.  This was disclosed by Kalthom Omar, director of Kelantan State  Manpower Office. In fact, the fruits of development enjoyed by  people throughout the country are not accessible to the majority  of Kelantan people, except those who have migrated to other  states.    Now it is the time for Kelantan people to rise and forget  the  sweet dreams promised by PAS for many years but never delivered  to them. The Kelantan people are entitled to enjoy the same  prosperity and blessings given by almighty god to other states  by changing their backwardness into prosperity and progress.    The majority of Kelantan people, especially the younger  generation, certainly want the NF to rescue them from the  shackles of backwardness, poverty, and unemployment. Rapid  development programs initiated by the NF will certainly provide  a fresh breeze of change for Kelantan. Muslims in that state  will make progress and continue to receive god's blessings if  they are not narrow- minded in their practice of Islam.  Practicing Islam for personal or party interest is considered  narrow-minded because it only brings backwardness to the people  and state. An excerpt from the Al-Haj Chapter, Verse 78 says:  ""And strive in his cause as ye ought to strive (with sincerity  and under discipline). He has chosen you, and has imposed no  difficulties on you.""     "

The government and the defence select committee would not only do well to look hard and long at the imperial nostalgia which often propels Britain's disproportionate defence budget, as you suggest, but also to scrutinise the spending's effectiveness in dealing with the big threats to global security in a post-cold war world. To be well-spent, resources will have to be channelled not towards fire-fighting conflicts after the event, but increasingly towards tackling the root causes of the 'new' threats to global security, such as: the vicious cycles of economic crisis; poverty and conflict which drive millions in desperation from their homes and across the world's borders; or a drugs trade propelled by the desperation of peasant farmers forced to grow coca as traditional crops such as coffee slump to prices which do not pay a living wage; or the poverty and gross inequality upon which totalitarianism and fundamentalism feed.

ACTION:     Public notice.                 SUMMARY:     Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, notice is hereby given that the Department of State will on a case-by-case basis consider licenses and approvals for (1) marketing proposals to sell United States Munitions List items to South Africa and for (2) export of the minimum basic operational and maintenance data necessary to support such proposals. However, exports of defense articles and services subject to the United Nations arms embargo on South Africa will not be approved while the embargo remains in force.            EFFECTIVE DATE:     March 24, 1994.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:      John Clarkson, Political-Military Affairs Officer, Office of Export Control Policy, Defence Trade Policy, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (202) 6474231.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     South Africa is currently under a mandatory arms export embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council, and is a proscribed destination for exports of defense articles and services pursuant to 22 CFR 126.1. However, it is contemplated that the embargo may end once certain events take place. Because of this, the Department of State will now consider, on a case-by-case basis, granting licenses and approvals for proposals to sell defense articles and defense services to South Africa and to export the minimum amount of basic operations and maintenance technical data necessary to support such proposals, so long as assurances are received that this data will be used in support of such proposals and for no other purpose. Approvals for the export of the aforementioned technical data will only be granted if the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, receives reliable assurances from the foreign end-user that it will only use the technical data for evaluation and informational purposes related to the proposed sale, and not for any other purposes. The Department of State will not grant licenses for the actual sale or export of defense articles and defense services (other than for the aforementioned technical data and for exceptions in accordance with current policy as provided for in 126.1(c)) while the U.N. arms embargo against South Africa and U.S. regulations prohibiting the export to South Africa of defense articles and services are in force.           Section 126.1(e) also provides that any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposal to sell or transfer to a country referred to in 126.1, or to any person acting on its behalf, any defense articles, defense services or technical data subject to the ITAR must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Effective immediately, this requirement no longer applies to South Africa. However, the obligation to inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls of actual sales or transfers to South Africa remains in place.     The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include proposals, within the meaning of 22 CFR 126.1(e), to sell or transfer defense articles and services. This policy also covers licenses and approvals to export the minimum basic technical data in the form of operations and maintenance information related to a defense article or service which is necessary to support a sales proposal. For this purpose, a proposal is defined as the communication of information in sufficient detail to permit an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into a manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement.

SUMMARY:     Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, notice is hereby given that the Department of State will on a case-by-case basis consider licenses and approvals for (1) marketing proposals to sell United States Munitions List items to South Africa and for (2) export of the minimum basic operational and maintenance data necessary to support such proposals. However, exports of defense articles and services subject to the United Nations arms embargo on South Africa will not be approved while the embargo remains in force.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     South Africa is currently under a mandatory arms export embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council, and is a proscribed destination for exports of defense articles and services pursuant to 22 CFR 126.1. However, it is contemplated that the embargo may end once certain events take place. Because of this, the Department of State will now consider, on a case-by-case basis, granting licenses and approvals for proposals to sell defense articles and defense services to South Africa and to export the minimum amount of basic operations and maintenance technical data necessary to support such proposals, so long as assurances are received that this data will be used in support of such proposals and for no other purpose. Approvals for the export of the aforementioned technical data will only be granted if the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, receives reliable assurances from the foreign end-user that it will only use the technical data for evaluation and informational purposes related to the proposed sale, and not for any other purposes. The Department of State will not grant licenses for the actual sale or export of defense articles and defense services (other than for the aforementioned technical data and for exceptions in accordance with current policy as provided for in 126.1(c)) while the U.N. arms embargo against South Africa and U.S. regulations prohibiting the export to South Africa of defense articles and services are in force.           Section 126.1(e) also provides that any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposal to sell or transfer to a country referred to in 126.1, or to any person acting on its behalf, any defense articles, defense services or technical data subject to the ITAR must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls.

0,FT943-14310 ,"FT943-14310 _AN-EGODBACCFT 940715   FT  15 JUL 94 / Income figures inflame poverty row      By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent   Controversy over the extent of poverty in the UK was renewed yesterday by government figures showing that the real incomes of the bottom 10 per cent of the population have fallen by 17 per cent since 1979. This maintains a continuing pattern of decline in the income of the bottom group after housing costs. It fell 14 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91, and was 17 per cent lower by 1991-92. Before housing costs are taken into account the real income of the bottom 10 per cent is unchanged since 1979. The figures were published in the government's Households Below Average Incomes statistical analysis. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said that the results 'do not show that the poor have become poorer'. He said spending patterns in the bottom 10 per cent of income distribution suggested that the income figures did not reflect true living standards. The pressure group Church Action on Poverty said poverty had reached scandalous levels. It said: 'Poverty is not an incurable disease. Yet still we have no indication of regret or remorse from the government, nor any signs of a plan to reconnect those who are systematically cut adrift from mainstream society.' The Child Poverty Action Group said that Britain should be 'deeply ashamed' by the problems revealed in the report. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said: 'It is not a fringe that is excluded from increased prosperity, but a great mass of ordinary decent working people.' The government says that the figures reflect factors such as the increase in unemployment during the recession rather than a growth in absolute poverty. However, the report provides further evidence of growing disparity in incomes between the top and bottom groups. The 17 per cent decline in income of the bottom group since 1979 compares with a 36 per cent average increase for the population as a whole, and a 62 per cent rise after housing costs for the wealthiest 10 per cent. Anti-poverty campaigners say this shows the UK is developing into a US-style society with a widening gap between its richest and poorest. In 1979 the proportion of the population receiving less than half average income was 8 per cent before housing costs and 9 per cent after. These proportions rose to 21 per cent and 25 per cent by 1991-92.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9441 Administration of Social and Manpower Programs.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Keith Diepraam was 20 years old in 1964 when he competed in his first Davis Cup  tennis match. Norway was playing host to South Africa. There had been some  trouble with anti-apartheid protesters before the South African team arrived,  but no one had any idea the situation would get so out of hand.    The security around the competition site was massive, but so was the group of  anti-South African protesters. Spectators had to walk through a hail of  leaflets to get into the stadium. It didn't stop inside -- the protesters had  bought tickets, too.    Diepraam was warming up for his match on center court when he heard a whistle.  Suddenly, there was a rush of people around him. In moments, anti-apartheid  activists were sitting all over the tennis court, forming a sea of protesters  through which Diepraam and his Norwegian opponent appeared to be be wading.    Diepraam still has a news photograph taken at the time. In it, he is looking at  all the people and laughing, with a slightly bewildered look.    Twenty-six years later, tennis officials in South Africa are still bewildered,  but they are no longer laughing. Some believe they have been betrayed by their  international federation, abandoned by professional tennis players and  manipulated by sports administrators with an agenda heavy on politics and  personal ambition.    Tennis in South Africa is an interesting study of the before and after of  international sanctions. While other sports, primarily those in the Olympic  Games, faced elaborate bans and boycotts, South African tennis players at one  time were free to travel the world to compete. And although there were some  protests, they were mainly restricted to Davis Cup competition, in which  players represented their countries.    So, in a nation of sports isolation, South African tennis and its professional  players happily globetrotted while other athletes stayed home. In fact, given  South Africa's mild climate, tennis thrived. South Africa has produced such  stars as Frew McMillan, Bob Hewitt, Ray Moore, Kevin Curren, Johan Kriek, Cliff  Drysdale, Ros Fairbank and Christo van Rensburg.    That was the before. The after began last January, when the International  Olympic Committee ruled that any tennis player who played in South Africa would  not be eligible to compete in the Olympics. Tennis became a medal sport in  1988.    The ruling has forced many of the world's tennis players to make a difficult  decision. South African tennis tournaments have not only tradition and  hospitality but also very competitive purses. Also, in the past, the South  African Grand Prix tournaments were important to players because they award  points that go toward determining who will play in the men's year-ending  Masters tournament, in which only the top eight singles players in the world  compete.    American Brad Gilbert came under fire in 1987 for playing in a tournament at  Johannesburg two weeks before the Masters, to earn enough points to qualify for  the latter event. American Tim Mayotte was battling Gilbert for the eighth and  final spot but chose not to play in South Africa. And because of previous  commitments, Mayotte could not play in another tournament the next week, the  last week to earn points, thereby failing to qualify for the Masters.    These very different decisions were subjected to intense scrutiny.    Mayotte chose not to play in South Africa because he had already drawn the ire  of anti-apartheid groups when he played there several years previously. For  that, Mayotte had been placed on a United Nations blacklist, but he was not  alone. Some of tennis' brightest stars have at some point been on it, including  Chris Evert and Boris Becker.    Gilbert argued that his decision to play in South Africa had nothing to do with  politics, but everything to do with his job.    ""I'm a tennis player and not a politician,"" he said in an interview in New York  in 1987. ""I don't think sports and politics should be mixed. I went to  Johannesburg because I needed points to qualify for the Masters. I'd have gone  to the moon to get here. If I hadn't gone to Johannesburg, I'd be sitting on  the sidelines now.""    South African tennis did not have a good year in 1989. First, the revamped  Assn. of Tennis Professionals, the men's pro tour now run by the players,  scheduled two stops in South Africa for the following year. Then the ATP  canceled the tournaments for ""moral and practical reasons,"" according to ATP  President Vijay Amritraj.    The ATP's player council was widely criticized for scheduling the events and in  August held a five-hour discussion on the subject. Leading the group arguing to  remove the tournaments from the 1990 schedule was former Wimbledon champion  Arthur Ashe.    After the decision to pull out, Amritraj said: ""For the last six or eight  months, we had this question asked of us everywhere, all around the world. It  overshadowed everything we had done with the tour. These two events were  canceled for the good of the tour. The Olympics are a major factor, so is the  United Nations boycott, and the fact that South Africa is not a respected  member of the world sports community.""    Meanwhile, satellite events in South Africa, lesser tournaments for which  players receive points in the ATP rankings, continue.    About a month after the ATP decision, the International Tennis Federation  suspended South Africa as an associate member until the country dismantles  apartheid.    When tennis joined the Olympic family, it also got its rules. Ray Moore, a  former touring pro from South Africa and a former chairman of the Men's  International Professional Tennis Council, said the day tennis entered the  Olympics was the day South African tennis was dealt a deadly blow.    ""There are a lot of negative things that have come down on our heads directly  because of tennis getting into the Olympics,"" Moore said. He lives in Palm  Springs and was back in South Africa for a brief meeting with the South African  Tennis Union regarding a junior program he is coordinating.    ""We certainly didn't need it. We were going along quite nicely. Yes, our  players overseas were restricted from playing in some countries. They weren't  happy about it, but they were grateful. They could play in half of Western  Europe. They could compete in 50-60 tournaments a year. They could accept that.    ""We've been lucky in our sport. We've escaped the wrath of SANROC (South  African Non Racial Olympic Committee, a London-based anti-apartheid lobby) and  the other organizations that have tried to stop international sport in this  country. Now, that's changed. Tennis is in the Olympics, and all of a sudden,  professional tennis in this country comes under the microscope of the Olympic  Charter. I have very, very strong views about that. I think it's steeped in  hypocrisy. What the ITF has done is hypocritical in the extreme.""    Moore believes that ITF President Phillipe Chatrier worked with Juan Antonio  Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, to get tennis into  the Games because Samaranch loves tennis. He had promised to help Chatrier  become an IOC representative. So, the personal agenda of these two men changed  tennis forever.    South Africa was a founding member of the ITF in 1913 and has been in Davis Cup  competition since its inception. Yet since apartheid was installed in South  Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis  community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by  default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history.    India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years  later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition.    American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic  of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South  Africa.    McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never  play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who  have U.S. citizenship.    Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the  Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli  players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing  apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa.    A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he  didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge.    The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently.  Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as  targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had  worked out a ""secret strategy"" to do this.    The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a  combination of increased vigilance and louder protests.    The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure.    Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on  center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament  were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South  African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security  guard.    There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have  been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a  policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals.  There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South  African athletes.    ""We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have  competition,"" Moore said. ""If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A  good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer  send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's  participation in international tennis events.    ""They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union).  They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced  nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first  round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their  minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis.  From that time forward, they have produced players.""    South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial.    By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from  playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular  among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game  financially out of reach for most black South Africans.    Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU  has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric  and reality is vast.    Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of  2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts.    The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto.  Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished.    In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away,  and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged  shoulders.    A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a  wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view.    But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims  that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little  evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and  Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair.    ""They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how,"" said  Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand  at a cracked and peeling court. ""Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on  that.""    Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and  coping with sanctions take their toll.    He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure.    ""It's like you have a naughty child,"" he said. ""You have a naughty child and  you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time  when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a  monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and  spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done  everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've  come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?""    Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning  with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis  courts in white areas.    They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until  apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white  areas only further segregates the sport, they say.    All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current  situation.    ""South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that,"" Moore said. ""I'm not  proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which  I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category,  and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human  rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that  are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya  to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of  the sky.    ""Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S.  will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in  those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no  way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?""      Photo, Keith Diepraam (right) and Norway's Fin Dag Jagge watch anti-apartheid  protest at 1964 Davis Cup match at Oslo.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Keith Diepraam was 20 years old in 1964 when he competed in his first Davis Cup  tennis match. Norway was playing host to South Africa. There had been some  trouble with anti-apartheid protesters before the South African team arrived,  but no one had any idea the situation would get so out of hand.    The security around the competition site was massive, but so was the group of  anti-South African protesters. Spectators had to walk through a hail of  leaflets to get into the stadium. It didn't stop inside -- the protesters had  bought tickets, too.    Diepraam was warming up for his match on center court when he heard a whistle.  Suddenly, there was a rush of people around him. In moments, anti-apartheid  activists were sitting all over the tennis court, forming a sea of protesters  through which Diepraam and his Norwegian opponent appeared to be be wading.    Diepraam still has a news photograph taken at the time. In it, he is looking at  all the people and laughing, with a slightly bewildered look.    Twenty-six years later, tennis officials in South Africa are still bewildered,  but they are no longer laughing. Some believe they have been betrayed by their  international federation, abandoned by professional tennis players and  manipulated by sports administrators with an agenda heavy on politics and  personal ambition.    Tennis in South Africa is an interesting study of the before and after of  international sanctions. While other sports, primarily those in the Olympic  Games, faced elaborate bans and boycotts, South African tennis players at one  time were free to travel the world to compete. And although there were some  protests, they were mainly restricted to Davis Cup competition, in which  players represented their countries.    So, in a nation of sports isolation, South African tennis and its professional  players happily globetrotted while other athletes stayed home. In fact, given  South Africa's mild climate, tennis thrived. South Africa has produced such  stars as Frew McMillan, Bob Hewitt, Ray Moore, Kevin Curren, Johan Kriek, Cliff  Drysdale, Ros Fairbank and Christo van Rensburg.    That was the before. The after began last January, when the International  Olympic Committee ruled that any tennis player who played in South Africa would  not be eligible to compete in the Olympics. Tennis became a medal sport in  1988.    The ruling has forced many of the world's tennis players to make a difficult  decision. South African tennis tournaments have not only tradition and  hospitality but also very competitive purses. Also, in the past, the South  African Grand Prix tournaments were important to players because they award  points that go toward determining who will play in the men's year-ending  Masters tournament, in which only the top eight singles players in the world  compete.    American Brad Gilbert came under fire in 1987 for playing in a tournament at  Johannesburg two weeks before the Masters, to earn enough points to qualify for  the latter event. American Tim Mayotte was battling Gilbert for the eighth and  final spot but chose not to play in South Africa. And because of previous  commitments, Mayotte could not play in another tournament the next week, the  last week to earn points, thereby failing to qualify for the Masters.    These very different decisions were subjected to intense scrutiny.    Mayotte chose not to play in South Africa because he had already drawn the ire  of anti-apartheid groups when he played there several years previously. For  that, Mayotte had been placed on a United Nations blacklist, but he was not  alone. Some of tennis' brightest stars have at some point been on it, including  Chris Evert and Boris Becker.    Gilbert argued that his decision to play in South Africa had nothing to do with  politics, but everything to do with his job.    ""I'm a tennis player and not a politician,"" he said in an interview in New York  in 1987. ""I don't think sports and politics should be mixed. I went to  Johannesburg because I needed points to qualify for the Masters. I'd have gone  to the moon to get here. If I hadn't gone to Johannesburg, I'd be sitting on  the sidelines now.""    South African tennis did not have a good year in 1989. First, the revamped  Assn. of Tennis Professionals, the men's pro tour now run by the players,  scheduled two stops in South Africa for the following year. Then the ATP  canceled the tournaments for ""moral and practical reasons,"" according to ATP  President Vijay Amritraj.    The ATP's player council was widely criticized for scheduling the events and in  August held a five-hour discussion on the subject. Leading the group arguing to  remove the tournaments from the 1990 schedule was former Wimbledon champion  Arthur Ashe.    After the decision to pull out, Amritraj said: ""For the last six or eight  months, we had this question asked of us everywhere, all around the world. It  overshadowed everything we had done with the tour. These two events were  canceled for the good of the tour. The Olympics are a major factor, so is the  United Nations boycott, and the fact that South Africa is not a respected  member of the world sports community.""    Meanwhile, satellite events in South Africa, lesser tournaments for which  players receive points in the ATP rankings, continue.    About a month after the ATP decision, the International Tennis Federation  suspended South Africa as an associate member until the country dismantles  apartheid.    When tennis joined the Olympic family, it also got its rules. Ray Moore, a  former touring pro from South Africa and a former chairman of the Men's  International Professional Tennis Council, said the day tennis entered the  Olympics was the day South African tennis was dealt a deadly blow.    ""There are a lot of negative things that have come down on our heads directly  because of tennis getting into the Olympics,"" Moore said. He lives in Palm  Springs and was back in South Africa for a brief meeting with the South African  Tennis Union regarding a junior program he is coordinating.    ""We certainly didn't need it. We were going along quite nicely. Yes, our  players overseas were restricted from playing in some countries. They weren't  happy about it, but they were grateful. They could play in half of Western  Europe. They could compete in 50-60 tournaments a year. They could accept that.    ""We've been lucky in our sport. We've escaped the wrath of SANROC (South  African Non Racial Olympic Committee, a London-based anti-apartheid lobby) and  the other organizations that have tried to stop international sport in this  country. Now, that's changed. Tennis is in the Olympics, and all of a sudden,  professional tennis in this country comes under the microscope of the Olympic  Charter. I have very, very strong views about that. I think it's steeped in  hypocrisy. What the ITF has done is hypocritical in the extreme.""    Moore believes that ITF President Phillipe Chatrier worked with Juan Antonio  Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, to get tennis into  the Games because Samaranch loves tennis. He had promised to help Chatrier  become an IOC representative. So, the personal agenda of these two men changed  tennis forever.    South Africa was a founding member of the ITF in 1913 and has been in Davis Cup  competition since its inception. Yet since apartheid was installed in South  Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis  community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by  default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history.    India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years  later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition.    American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic  of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South  Africa.    McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never  play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who  have U.S. citizenship.    Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the  Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli  players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing  apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa.    A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he  didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge.    The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently.  Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as  targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had  worked out a ""secret strategy"" to do this.    The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a  combination of increased vigilance and louder protests.    The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure.    Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on  center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament  were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South  African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security  guard.    There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have  been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a  policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals.  There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South  African athletes.    ""We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have  competition,"" Moore said. ""If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A  good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer  send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's  participation in international tennis events.    ""They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union).  They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced  nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first  round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their  minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis.  From that time forward, they have produced players.""    South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial.    By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from  playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular  among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game  financially out of reach for most black South Africans.    Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU  has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric  and reality is vast.    Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of  2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts.    The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto.  Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished.    In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away,  and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged  shoulders.    A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a  wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view.    But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims  that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little  evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and  Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair.    ""They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how,"" said  Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand  at a cracked and peeling court. ""Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on  that.""    Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and  coping with sanctions take their toll.    He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure.    ""It's like you have a naughty child,"" he said. ""You have a naughty child and  you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time  when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a  monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and  spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done  everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've  come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?""    Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning  with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis  courts in white areas.    They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until  apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white  areas only further segregates the sport, they say.    All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current  situation.    ""South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that,"" Moore said. ""I'm not  proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which  I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category,  and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human  rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that  are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya  to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of  the sky.    ""Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S.  will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in  those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no  way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?""      Photo, Keith Diepraam (right) and Norway's Fin Dag Jagge watch anti-apartheid  protest at 1964 Davis Cup match at Oslo.

0,FT943-14820 ,"FT943-14820 _AN-EGMDEAA1FT 940713   FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: UK seeks to recoup South Africa ground      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Britain's trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, and 60 businessmen are in South Africa this week to try to recoup lost ground in what was once a leading trade partnership. Partly as a result of the UK Conservative party's resistance to sanctions during the apartheid era, British relations with the new government are weaker than with the old. At the same time the UK finds itself fourth in South Africa's trading league behind the US, Germany and Japan. Mr Heseltine's visit follows ones by US commerce secretary Ron Brown and French president Francois Mitterrand which have been seen as part of a drive to reap possible commercial rewards for those countries' support for sanctions during the anti-apartheid struggle. 'South Africa is now perceived as a country with which to do business,' says Mr John Doble, British consul-general in Johannesburg, who says British companies have made more than 60 investments since 1990. On the investment side, the UK has for more than a century remained unchallenged as South Africa's single biggest foreign investor with about R50bn (Pounds 8.8bn) in stock and assets. South Africans hold about R35bn in Britain. Two-way trade between the UK and South Africa amounted to R10.25bn in 1993 slightly in the UK's favour. Britain's imports are primarily of raw materials and food and vegetable products. It exports mostly pharmaceuticals, machinery and, more recently, telecommunications equipment. The UK Export Credits Guarantee Department already has Pounds 1.3bn in export credits outstanding in South Africa, the agency's fourth-biggest commitment. In the first four months of this year British exports to South Africa grew by 20.2 per cent. Imports from South Africa increased only 2.3 per cent, although some sectors, such as fruit and wine, are expected to grow by about 30 per cent for the year. In the defence sector, South Africa is known to be in the market for up to six navy corvettes worth about Pounds 1bn, and if Britain could secure the contract it might help save the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. At the same time Britain is considering buying South African Rooivalk attack helicopters as part of a total order for 90 helicopters costing about Pounds 2bn and there is speculation that a reciprocal arrangement could be worked out. Mr Heseltine discussed the issue yesterday with Mr Joe Modise, South African defence minister, and an announcement may be made before the end of the week. 'We're cautiously optimistic that something will be achieved,' said a British defence official.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

How would you sum it up?    [Chissano] Well, you know, we started the struggle together.  Actually, I must say that the ANC inspired the struggle for the  liberation of the whole of Africa when it was created in 1912.  We in Mozambique were also inspired by that although our  liberation movement started much later, but not to go far back  in history I would say -- speak to you about the years ... the  '60s. In '61 we started organizing our liberation movements  with the support of all the freedom fighters of the region,  including South Africa. Around '63 we were training together  with South Africans, Mozambicans, Angolans, Ghanaians, in  Algeria, when all these countries came to the conclusion that  the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the  Portuguese colonies didn't want peaceful change towards freedom  and independence, so our contribution for the eradication of  apartheid starts from that cooperation of the liberation  movements.    We got independence before South Africa and we continued to  offer our support, to struggle together. We made analysis on  the forms of the struggle, the tactics to be applied as times  were changing and we came to certain conclusions which led us in  Mozambique to be in contact with the regime, to confront the  regime directly here in South Africa, while the ANC and the  other liberation movements were continuing to press -- put  pressure through the armed struggle and other forms of struggle,  but we continued together in the diplomatic field and political  field, both individually and through the Frontline States, and  in multilateral organizations like OAU and Non-Aligned Movement.  We were very much active. We ... the ANC didn't have to be  present in order to put forward the case of South Africa. We  were always there and we put always, as a first priority, the  liberation of South Africa -- well, I'm speaking after the  independence of Zimbabwe because before it was Zimbabwe,  Namibia, and South Africa.    [Mashokwe] Is there a feeling of achievement? Is there a  feeling in your heart as president of Mozambique that you have  contributed to a worthy cause?    [Chissano] Yes, in my heart, as a person I have no doubt  that  I have given all my best, because when I speak about  coordination during the arms struggle I am one who was lucky to  be together with my Comrade Modise, in the offices of the ANC in  Lusaka, or elsewhere, and to coordinate and to plan, even to see  how could smuggle in weapons and so forth with Modise.    [Mashokwe] These are stories in the old South African terms.    [Chissano] In the old South African terms and Portuguese  terms, but we ... it was a challenging aspect, and also it  happened that I was the first prime minister in Mozambique at  transition period and I had to deal, at that time of transition  with the racist regimes, both in South Africa and in Rhodesia.  Then I became foreign minister. As a foreign minister my task,  primary task, was to support international forums -- the cause  of liberation -- whether its OAU -- in many occasions I had to  forget about the problems of Mozambique, to concentrate on this,  because we did not feel free in Mozambique without the freedom  of South Africa -- or there to offer Zimbabwe, in fact  Mozambique has suffered the most ruthless destabilization and  destruction by direct invasions from the South African forces  and also the Rhodesian forces and later by the utilization of  Mozambican artificially created movements. And we had a lot of  destruction, so it was very much logical that we should be keen  to work for the freedom of our brothers in South Africa and in  Rhodesia.    [Mashokwe] What do you expect, Mr. President, from a free  and  a democratic South Africa? What do you expect that South Africa  to do to small Mozambique, in terms of economic power?    [Chissano] To say the truth we expect the same thing -- that  we join hands and we cooperate the same way. We plan knowing  that the success of one is the success of the other, and we  should wish to bring success to the other. Who can more, should  help, who can less as we have done in the past. [sentence as  heard] So, we hope that South Africa will be a spokesman, not  only for South Africa but also for the other countries in the  region, so that we have, will fulfill our plan of creating a  region which cooperates towards integration, which brings a  harmonious growth of the economies of the countries in benefit  of all in the country.    We will not demand that the countries which are more  advanced  should slow the pace, but we will demand that those who are more  developed help give a hand to the others and help them to grow  until we can reach a certain balance, which is a necessary thing  to create an internal market in the region, so that we, from  that point, we become competitive as a region in the world and  we assume our rightful place in the world -- a rightful place  which is given to us, is there for us, because we have a big  potential of resources.    Our resources pooled together make of our region one of the  richest regions in the world, and therefore, we must know how to  coordinate. This is why we expected that South Africa is going  to join SADC [Southern African Development Community]. Already  we are cooperating with South Africa within SADC -- with this  constructive spirit, without the aim of competition but with the  spirit of complimentarity. [sentence as heard]    [Mashokwe] Would you be surprised if it was the South  African Government, Mr. President, that would have wanted to  kill President Samora Machel then?    [Chissano] I would be surprised if it was the South African  Government, but I would not be surprised if it were anyone in  the armed forces of South Africa. The reason for me to say this  is because when the war came to an end in Zimbabwe, for  instance, we had a talk with Mr. Peter Ells and with Mr. Ken  Flower, and we agreed on certain issues, and one of the issues  was that the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] people who  were serving there should not be allowed to cross the border  into Mozambique, and that they should be handed over to us with  an agreement that we would not ill treat them, and we also would  not smuggle in weapons for ZANU [Zimbabwe African National  Union] into Mozambique. But what Peter Ells did was to bring  these people into South Africa and to reorganize their fight  from here, and together with the South African officers who paid  the Renamo people -- so the Renamo fight was led actually by  officers from the South African defense forces. And there are  some who did not believe in change even after the change of  government here. There are some who continued giving headaches  to De Klerk and his friends, therefore whether it was condemned  by government or not, the possibility of having South African  security forces -- whether they or the intelligence services,  this is a strong possibility.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion, Mr. President, was it worthwhile  to  have signed the Nkomati Accord?    [Chissano] Yes, I think it was worthwhile, because first of  all it has decreased the direct participation of the South  African defense forces in the war in Mozambique. Secondly, it  has created a new atmosphere in the region, including in the  minds of the whites in South Africa themselves. They started  thinking about change in South Africa and thinking about  business with the neighbors. There was a conflict created  within the white community in South Africa because they had to  judge the validity of the Nkomati Accord. That's when they  started thinking about how to deal with the people in prison and  Robben Island, and all this -- the Nkomati Accord was a ferment  for us for many things. There was a big discussion in the  world, and the fact that there was a big discussion about that  in the world, even in the ranks of the ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] and so forth, our friends and so forth, it was good  because it was focussed more and more on the struggle in South  Africa and the measures to be taken both by the Western  countries, the Eastern countries, and it came at a time when the  Eastern countries, who were the backbone of the support to the  struggle for independence and freedom, were becoming weakened,  because they were weakened. And so the tactics of struggle had  to change, and so the Nkomati Accord was a culmination of the  change of tactics of struggle against apartheid.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for talking to us, and  thanks for giving us your time.    [Chissano] Thank you. You are welcome.    [Mashokwe] The bandits in your area, as they are termed,  have wrecked everything. Do you have hope that that will be  corrected and how will that be corrected?    [Chissano] Well, we have started already the work. We have a  program of national reconstruction which is aimed at rebuilding  all what have been destroyed, starting from the social services,  health centers, hospitals, schools, and coming to the commercial  network, shops, and going to roads, in order to facilitate the  life of the citizens, especially in the countryside, in the  rural areas, then we also ... we will pay attention to the  reconstruction of factories, like sugar factories, tea  factories, which were destroyed and the reopening of mines which  were closed during the war, gold mines, marble mines, graphite  mines which are being reopened, and other ... other activities.    We are also reopening the traffic through the railroads  towards the interland countries like South Africa, which is  somehow an interland country in some regions, Zimbabwe, Zambia,  Malawi, and also we are serving a bit of Botswana, and Swaziland  and Lesotho. So we are going to call for investments. We are  calling for investments, for internal investments of nationals,  trying to create conditions so that we create new businessmen,  which is African, black businessmen in Mozambique and other  Mozambicans who are not black, because even those who are not  black -- and not many who were businessmen in Mozambique in the  past, but we are also going to attract as we are doing already,  the foreign investment, and through all this process we are  going to create jobs for the lots of unemployed people.    As you know we have more than 1 million people who were  refugees outside the country and more than 3.5 million people  who were displaced inside the country, therefore, these people  have got no jobs -- about 4-5 million people who are ... have no  real jobs. So we aim at creating conditions for self-employment  in some projects but also through these investments we are going  to create jobs. The process of national reconstruction itself  will create some jobs, but most important thing will be the  training of personnel. The human resources development program  is very important. The integration of the demobilized soldiers  in the civil life is very important and again here it's about  creating jobs or self-employment by helping them to start their  own projects, their own initiatives.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, there is no peace yet -- total  peace in Mozambique. We know of efforts, we know your  government's position, but why should a South African business  person go and invest in an unstable area now?    [Chissano] To say the truth, we have peace. There are some  acts of criminality which are here and there, the same way as  they exist in London or in Chicago or in Washington, or even in  South Africa, Johannesburg, but we cannot speak about war. We  cannot speak about the same amount of instability.    In fact, three weeks ago, I have inaugurated these graphite  mines in which there is a South African company which is  participating, and that graphite mine is placed in area which  was dangerous in the past. We had started work. We had to put  a battalion to protect the area but now that battalion is not  there. We don't have soldiers there. We have taken them all  away and so the mine is operating without need of special  security. It has got the normal security which all mines have  and there is a factory there. The people are living in the  area, the workers and ... it's very active -- we have started  exporting now this graphite, so it means that we have peace  since October 1992.    We have peace so small incidents of criminal nature, of  course, these exist, but we have a program. After we finish  demobilization we will concentrate on the process of collecting  unlawful weapons which are enabling these hooligans to create  some trouble here and there. This is a process which we are  going to undertake in cooperation with South Africa because in  South Africa you have the same problem. You have too much  weapons in the hands of people, but we cannot speak now of war.    I can say there is peace and economic activity has started  and many investors, Americans, and Ireland investors are there  with big projects. Some other British have investments. South  Africans themselves have in tourism and many other aspects, so  investments are already there.    [Mashokwe] Is it the old Lorenco Marques that South Africans  used to know or this the Maputo -- the new Lorenco Marques?    [Chissano] No, Maputo is not the new Lorenco Marques because  Lorenco Marques was a time of apartheid without the name of  apartheid. I may say even that it was worse than apartheid  because the Portuguese used to say that they didn't have  racialism and discrimination and so forth, but in fact it was  worse, because as far as I was informed, apartheid meant  separate development, but in Mozambique blacks didn't have  development. [60-second advertising break]    [Chissano, in progress] ... and our government informed the  other parties that the government was not satisfied and the  government wanted that this question and the other questions  which were not answered that they should be addressed,  therefore, that inquiry would give us just a lead to proceed the  inquiry, and we hope that if there is still possibility that the  inquiry can be made. Not that we want to accuse someone but we  want to be satisfied that the inquiry has been concluded and  that questions have been answered. If we find that was it  someone outside South Africa we will be glad.     "

South Africa      By JOHN AUTHERS   SOUTH AFRICA forces a personal investor to face a unique dilemma. Any decision you make will not just be based on investment merits, for in the past two decades the climate of world opinion about the country has ensured that any such move must involve ethical and political judgments as well. Even those who had no qualms about investing in a nation governed by apartheid still had to assess the stability of the regime. The effect of sanctions imposed on the nation's economy also remains to be weighed. The ideal scenario is for South Africa to transfer peacefully to a regime which the rest of the world can stomach. This would leave the strengths of the nation's economy intact and, by allowing sanctions to be lifted, allow greater economic vigour. Optimism that this could happen has grown since the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, in early 1990. However, it remains only a vague sentiment as far as big UK investors are concerned. Trustees of charity funds have slowly begun to warm towards South Africa - for example, David Edwards, of the charity investment management service at Henderson Crosthwaite, says: 'What has tended to happen over the last year is that trustees have become less averse to the inclusion of South Africa, and that mirrors the sentiment of the average private client.' However, this mood has not translated into active investment. Edwards continues: 'Now that trustees are relaxing their attitude to South Africa, investment fundamentals come back in. And I don't think many fund managers have put money into South Africa because it hasn't looked right, even though the political situation looks better.' Stuart Bell, of Pensions Investment Research Consultants, surveyed UK pension funds in 1990 and found that about half had some restriction on investment in South Africa. Nothing much has happened since then - the only local authority pension fund to change its policy was that of the London borough of Brent, following loss of control by the Labour party. 'Basically, it's still a political football,' says Bell. 'From the commercial outlook, there has been no reason for them to amend their views anyway.' As a legacy of South Africa's pariah status, there are few ways to buy direct exposure to the country in the UK. Unit trusts are authorised by the Securities and Investments Board to invest up to 100 per cent of their funds in the Johannesburg stock exchange, but there are no 'South Africa' unit trusts. Funds in a commodities or gold unit trust, however, must almost inevitably have a considerable stake in the country. MG's Gold  General fund, for example, has a holding of 32.8 per cent. But the commodity and energy sector is not one of the unit trust industry's stars. Over the year to June, the average trust in the sector lost 11.4 per cent, according to Finstat. Over two years this figure was 22.6 per cent, and over five years, 33 per cent. Mary d'Eon, manager of Providence Capitol's Gold unit trust, views the current situation as a long-term negative, but adds: 'Any sort of strife in South Africa may make the gold price rise, which is good for the companies as well. I have a holding of 20 per cent in the major companies, and I will not be selling it.' A less risky route is to gain exposure via companies quoted in the UK. Even 'ethical' investors are now prepared to do this. The Merlin Ecology unit trust polled its unitholders and found a large majority against direct investment in South Africa until a 'one man, one vote' system has been achieved. However, they were prepared to invest in a company which did more than its competitors to introduce good employment practices, and so the fund has invested in Reckitt  Coleman. Reinvestment in South Africa has only just started, which may explain the market's muted reaction to the massacre in Boipatong last weekend. Mandela's subsequent decision to withdraw from talks on democracy with the government seemed to confirm the worst fears of the watching world, but the Johannesburg Stock Exchange index fell a modest 42 points to 3,639, while companies with overseas assets, such as Lonrho and Minorco, actually rose. So, ethical arguments aside, is this the time to buy into South Africa? The answer must be: definitely not. Jonathan Martin Smith, of the South Africa and mining department of stockbrokers Williams De Broe, is positive about the country, but says: 'You have a deep recession in South Africa and the timetable for recovery is put back by this violence. I'm not saying it's not at the bottom. I'm just saying it's wise to wait.' For the longer term he remains confident: 'The will is there on both sides to make this succeed. We are not entering into a civil war situation. Violence will not disappear. But the government and the ANC are powerful enough to control it.' South African exchange controls are another reason for staying put. There is a separate currency for external investors, the financial rand, which is usually at a substantial discount to the main commercial rand. Foreign investors thus have a strong disincentive to sell, particularly in troubled times, when the discount grows - it went up to 27 per cent following the news of Boipatong. So, South Africa needs to be watched. But those who do not already have exposure should keep it that way until the political situation is much clearer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FACTFILE: SOUTH AFRICA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (inc. homelands):                                   38.5m Gross Domestic Product:                             Pounds 190.04 bn Market Capitalisation:                                Pounds 98.7 bn Inflation Rate:                                        15.6 per cent Three-month Treasury Bill Rate:                       13.97 per cent Currency  Exchange Rate:          Pounds 1 = 5.2265 commercial Rand                                     Pounds 1 = 7.1220 financial Rand  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page V  "

0,FT911-1304 ,"FT911-1304 _AN-BEGBDACSFT 910507   FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (2): A long way from the land of milk and honey - The lifting of sanctions is unlikely to lift the economic gloom      By PATTI WALDMEIR   EVERY day in South Africa, 1,000 young people enter the workforce. Of these, 875 find no job, says Mr John Kane-Berman, director of the Institute of Race Relations. That will not change when the last vestiges of apartheid have disappeared, nor will non-racial elections alter it. Even the lifting of sanctions will probably have no dramatic short-term effect. Indeed, it is difficult to be sanguine about the prospects for economic growth and employment in South Africa over the next 4 to 5 years. 'It will take time for the new South Africa to establish credibility,' warns Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank). 'The take-off may not occur until the mid-1990s, when the new government has been in power for a year or two. For the next few years we must be modest about what to expect from the economy.' Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, underlines the consequences of this: 'Unless we can get growth going now, by the mid-1990s it will be virtually impossible for any government to govern this country, because of the number of unemployed.' Some businessmen dismiss this apocalyptic vision as 'politician's talk'. Mr du Plessis makes no secret of the fact that his message is partly political. 'It is a message to opposing political groupings in South Africa: look fellas, if you want to play the sanctions game, you will now be playing it not only at the expense of people who are directly disadvantaged . . . but you are now putting that very government in which you would like to participate, if not take over . . . you are jeopardising (its) chances of governing a governable South Africa.' The scenario he draws is not unrealistic, and represents the worst possible background for negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution. The economy contracted by 1 per cent in real terms last year, and a further decline, or at best zero growth, is expected this year. Meanwhile the black labour force grows by 3 per cent a year, and jobless totals soar. Professor Jan Lombard, formerly deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, estimates that of the 12m-strong workforce, only 8m are in formal employment. 'About 4m are without formal job opportunities and have to eke out a living in one way or another.' He projects this figure will grow to 6m by the year 2000. But the Institute for Futures Research of the University of Stellenbosch draws an even bleaker picture: assuming economic growth of 3.1 per cent for the period 1988 - 2000 (which may well prove unattainable), nearly 8m people, or more than 44 per cent of the population, will be without formal sector jobs by the end of the century. Mr Stals and Mr du Plessis recognise the threat posed by every one of the 875 youths who join jobless queues each day: under-educated and highly politicised, they have no vested interest in the survival of capitalism in South Africa, or even in a peaceful transition to a post-apartheid society. But they refuse to abandon their efforts at structural adjustment, which involve the tightest fiscal and monetary policies pursued for many years. Economists disagree on whether the 1991/92 budget will turn out to be mildly expansionary or just neutral; but certainly, it reflects no serious move to stimulate growth. Mr Stals constantly reiterates his opposition to any politically-motivated relaxation in monetary policy. 'I have no problem defending myself against pressure to use monetary policy to stimulate growth. Even if it succeeded, it would only be temporary,' he says. So far, he has managed a degree of independence which would make a happy man of any Western central banker; it remains to be seen whether that will survive once real constitutional negotiations begin. Without access to the facilities of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), currently blocked under US sanctions legislation, Mr du Plessis believes slow growth would resume by the end of this year or early in 1992, 'but only a very modest growth rate . . . for a short period of time . . . which will be totally inadequate . . .' Even if faster growth were possible, Pretoria could not allow it. The pattern of the past five years would prevail: growth would be restricted to avoid a surge in imports, which in turn would threaten the balance of payments surplus needed to service South Africa's foreign debt. 'We would achieve another 1.5 to 2 per cent in two years from now,' Mr du Plessis says, adding growth would fluctuate near that ceiling rather than at the 4 to 4.5 per cent needed to keep pace with rapid population growth. With access to IMF support - Mr du Plessis hopes normal relations will be re-established by year-end, and estimates Dollars 2bn might be available - 'we would have confidence to let go of the economy, not to hold the reins so tightly,' he says. Still, he remains cautious about growth: 'We would be able to phase out exchange control, so what will happen? How many foreign investors will indeed take their money out, what will be the flow of money back to South Africa?' Already, as sanctions begin to recede, capital flows are being influenced more by what Mr Stals calls 'normal economic factors'. But those do not yet favour long-term investment: recent violence and uncertainty over future economic policy have shaken investor confidence. Foreign trade missions are numerous, but commitments few. 'We've had more visitors in the past year than in the previous five,' says Mr Meyer Kahn, group managing director at South African Breweries. But he adds: 'That's partly political, and partly because we have a superb summer climate: they pack five sets of swimming trunks for every suit.' Mr Stals says investment will come with political progress, including lending at commercial rates from the World Bank: 'By the mid-1990s . . . I think we're going to pull in a lot of foreign capital,' he says. 'We will become a conduit for those who want to invest in the southern African region.' Businessmen point out, however, that Pretoria has always traded with its neighbours, albeit illicitly, and that the removal of sanctions may not provide the hoped-for boost. They note that Africa as a whole represents only 3 per cent of world trade, and South Africa makes up a third of that already. Given black Africa's debt problems, its prospects as a market for Pretoria may turn out to be limited. Nonetheless, Mr Kahn and many other businessmen remain optimistic about post-sanctions prospects: 'We are underborrowed, we've adjusted to sanctions, found new markets, there is a better relationship between labour and management, our businesses are tougher, and we are leaner.' Mr Conrad Strauss, group managing director of Stanbic, one of South Africa's largest banking groups, offers a more sober vision: 'The best we can hope for is that we leave this century in a greater state of socio-economic grace than when we entered it.' The scale of South African poverty is daunting: according to Mr Kane-Berman, 20m people have no access to electricity; 80 per cent of rural dwellers do not have enough clean water; 84 per cent in rural areas live below the so-called 'minimum living level' of R700 a month for a family of five. And by 2010, there will be nearly 60m people in South Africa, twice the 1980 census level. It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be up to the task of housing, feeding, clothing and employing that many people. Black South Africans may find that life after apartheid remains a struggle.  The Financial Times   London Page II Map (Omitted). Chart (Omitted).  "

The decision was announced in a joint  communique which was released on Friday.    The two countries' decision about the resumption of  political  ties, which came following talks between officials of the South  African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting  the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country,  brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties  with South Africa.    Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the  victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that  country's racist policies.    The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and  political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign  policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South  African nation for achieving independence.    The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation  has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old  white domination over that country.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of  return of peace, together with independence and restoration of  the rights of the black majority, considers the recent  developments in South Africa as being to the removal of  obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties  with that country and has announced its willingness for the  resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage  as received]    From a political point of view, the recent developments in  South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races  to have direct and active participation in running the country's  affairs and making political and economic decisions, are  significant in that they can have positive impact and  consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework  for South Africa's future ties with other countries.    In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of  Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the  groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to  Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory  of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of  the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will  continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about  the own fate.    As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid  regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa  now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making  political decisions in this regard.

0,FT934-6162 ,"FT934-6162 _AN-DKZCOABAFT 931126   FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: S Africa mission marks change in US stance      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, arrives in South Africa tomorrow for a visit which signals the opening of a more constructive era in economic relations between the two countries. His trip comes only days after President Bill Clinton signed the South Africa Democratic Transition Support Act, formally bringing to an end the era of federal US sanctions aimed at ending apartheid. Although Mr Brown's visit will probably have limited practical impact in the short term, it conveys a powerful symbolic message. Mr Princeton Lyman, US ambassador in South Africa, comments: 'It signifies a very basic change from a negative to a positive relationship with South Africa. The whole tone shifts.' This shift from isolation to engagement was confirmed on Tuesday by Mr Clinton. He noted that removing sanctions was not enough. 'Americans who have been so active in toppling apartheid must remain committed to building South Africa's non-racial market democracy.' 'The visit confirms a real interest in South Africa's potential as a viable trading partner and bulwark of economic strength and stability in the region and on the continent,' said Mr Brown. Despite the impact of sanctions, there is a substantial base upon which to develop US-South Africa trade relations. South Africa is only the US's 34th largest export market, but it remains the largest in Africa, a continent where, Mr Lyman concedes, 'the US has not done very well'. The US recently surpassed Germany as South Africa's largest trade partner. Mr Lyman estimates bilateral trade now to be in the region of Dollars 5bn. Commerce Department figures show that in 1992 US exports to South Africa totalled Dollars 2.4bn, 14 per cent of South Africa's total import market, with US imports from South Africa of Dollars 1.7bn. The US has fared less well in terms of investment. Figures from the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) show that as of September only 135 US companies had employees or direct investment in South Africa, compared to 267 in May 1986. The stock of US investment in South Africa is put at about Dollars 1bn. Certainly, however, the trend has started to turn. The past two months have seen food manufacturers Pillsbury and CPC International enter the market, following such other companies as Mars, Microsoft and Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM has recently confirmed it will probably be returning, Procter  Gamble is known to be taking a close look and McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch and Hyatt are all expected to establish a presence. A focus of Mr Brown's visit - his 50-member delegation contains representatives of many large US companies - will be an attempt to establish links between US companies and the emerging black business community in South Africa. Another issue sure to be discussed is South Africa's offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay round of trade talks. Aspects of the offer - particularly the high protection, and longer phasing-in period for tariff reductions for the clothing and textiles, motor and electronics industries - did not meet with approval from South Africa's trading partners.

Preliminary election results show that the ANC, led by  Nelson  Mandela, has built an insurmountable lead, which indicates that  South Africa will form a new government of national unity  centered around the ANC.

The birth of a new South Africa where all races are equal  marks a new epoch in the country, he said.    The victory is the result of the hard, long-time struggle of  the South African people, supported by the international  community.

""We appreciate the positive contributions made by the  National Party led by F.W. de Klerk, in moving with the tides  and implementing reforms,"" he said.    The Chinese Government and people sincerely hope that under  the leadership of the government of national unity, all parties  there will strengthen unity and cooperation and make joint  efforts in the building up of a new South Africa enjoying racial  equality, stability, democracy and prosperity, he said.

They also desire to continuously develop friendly bilateral  ties and cooperation together with Eritrea, said Jiang during  talks with visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki here this  afternoon.    Jiang said the time since China and Eritrea established  diplomatic ties has been short, but the relationship has  developed rapidly, adding: ""We are satisfied with the smooth  growth of such ties.""    He expressed the belief that Isayas' current visit to China  will lay a solid foundation for the enhancement of bilateral  friendship and cooperation and the promotion of such ties to a  new level.    Jiang expressed his appreciation of the ""one-China"" policy  that the Eritrean Government has pursued and its principled  stand not to establish official relations with Taiwan.    Isayas said though Eritrea and China are far apart  geographically, their friendly ties bring them closer together.    He thanked the Chinese Government and people for their  recognition of Eritrea's independence and the results of its  referendum.    Isayas said that, in the long struggle for independence, the  Eritrean Government and people have always regarded China as  their reliable partner.    Referring to bilateral economic cooperation, Jiang said  China  and Eritrea established diplomatic ties less than one year ago,  but their mutually beneficial cooperation has gradually grown  and shows great potential.    China is willing to become actively involved in Eritrea's  economic reconstruction, he said.    Jiang noted that China is a developing country whose  governmental assistance extended to Eritrea is limited.  However, he said, the offer of assistance is a demonstration of  friendship.    ""We place greater importance on conducting diverse non-  governmental and economic cooperations with Eritrea on the basis  of equality, mutual benefit and common development,"" he said.    Isayas thanked the Chinese Government for its assistance to  Eritrea, adding that his country experienced sufferings from an  extended war. ""It is badly needed to rebuild our country,"" he  said.    He described China's assistance as sincere and being full of  kindness, saying: ""We regard this kind of assistance as an  important factor for Eritrea's reconstruction.""    Isayas said Eritrea agrees with China's point of view on  actively conducting non-governmental economic cooperation.    Eritrea will concentrate its efforts on cooperation with  Chinese enterprises in every field, he added.    On international issues, Jiang said that the new world  political order should be established on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful co-existence. The core of these  principles is non- interference in other countries' internal  affairs and respecting their peoples' choices of social systems  and the modes for development in accordance with their own  national conditions.    He said that there are no unified political and economic  modes suitable to all countries in the world. One country's  specific political system and means for economic growth can only  be established according to its actual national conditions, he  added.    Jiang stressed that the Chinese experience has shown that  only by taking the development of its economy as its key work  can a newly established country strengthen its political  independence and get rid of its poverty and backwardness.    Isayas said that he agreed with Jiang's view on the  principles of non-interference in other countries' internal  affairs, and that every country's cultural tradition should be  respected.    He said Eritrea attaches great importance to China's  experience and is closely following its tremendous changes,  which he said have inspired the whole continent of Africa,  including Eritrea.    During the talks, the two leaders briefed each other on  their  respective countries' domestic situations.    They agreed that the two sides share identical or similar  views on many major international or regional issues and the  issues on democracy and human rights as well.    After the talks, two agreements between the two governments  were signed. One regards the Chinese Government's providing the  Eritrean Government with loans. The other is a cultural  agreement.    The two presidents attended the signing ceremony.    Prior to the talks, Jiang hosted a solemn ceremony welcoming  Isayas and his party.    This evening, Jiang gave a banquet in honor of Isayas and  his  entourage including Minister of National Defense Mesfin Hagos  and Minister of Trade and Industry Ogbe Abraha.    Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister,  attended the banquet.     "

In a joint  statement released simultaneously in Tehran and Johannesburg  today, the two sides announced their readiness for resumption of  ties after talks between South African Foreign Ministry  officials and the Iranian interests section at the Swiss embassy  in the South African capital.    In Tehran, a foreign ministry spokesman congratulated the  South African nation on the victory of the African National  Congress (ANC) which polled 66.9 percent of the votes counted.    Iran broke ties with South Africa after the triumph of the  Islamic revolution in 1979. Switzerland had been looking after  the interests of the two countries since then. Iran, which was  South Africa's main oil supplier in the time of the defunct  shah, stopped all oil supplies to the racist regime after the  revolution.    Thereafter the Islamic Republic supported the South African  people's struggle against racial discrimination and sided fully  with liberation groups at international forums.     "
0,FT933-5769 ,"FT933-5769 _AN-DIAB3AGBFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (3): At the edge of prosperity - Foreign investment      By TONY HAWKINS   SUB-SAHARAN Africa has missed out on the surge in global foreign direct investment (FDI) during the 1980s. Investment inflows into Africa, relative to GDP, are half the level of those elsewhere. After averaging Dollars 1bn annually during the first half of the 1980s - of which three quarters went to oil exporting countries - FDI accelerated during the 1987-91 period averaging Dollars 1.7bn. Almost half (Dollars 830m) went to Nigeria, and another Dollars 190m to other oil exporters. The region's stock of foreign investment was estimated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at some Dollars 11bn, with South Africa accounting for a further Dollars 11bn. Zimbabwe and Nigeria each account for 19 per cent, with Gabon in third place (13 per cent), followed by Liberia with 12.5 per cent and Cote d'Ivoire with just under 10 per cent. Between them, these five countries accounted for three quarters of the region's foreign-owned capital stock. Not only is the region's foreign-owned capital stock small and highly concentrated, but it has also been falling. Excluding South Africa, the inward stock of foreign capital fell 45 per cent in the 1980s, mainly reflecting currency devaluation. In 1980, the sub-Saharan share of global inward investment was 4.5 per cent, but 10 years later it was 0.7 per cent. Inward investment declined from 7.5 per cent of the third world total during the 1981-86 period to 5.5 per cent, two thirds of which was oil sector investment. One reason is Africa's failure to broaden its investment base. While FDI flows to other continents have diversified into manufacturing and services away from resource-intensive activity, Africa's chief attraction remains its energy and mining potential. Sluggish economic growth, poor returns, a shortage of skills and small markets continue to deter investment. The key to attracting foreign inflows is the availability of relatively cheap skilled, technical and supervisory labour, crucial to meeting quality standards that are increasingly important in global marketing. Africa is also at a serious disadvantage in terms of both location and infrastructure. But the greatest deterrent to FDI inflows has been government hostility towards multinationals. That is changing, but the results - outside the energy sector - have been disappointing. Hardly surprising, for in the late 1980s, the return on capital was lower than anywhere else in the third world, except Latin America. But Africa's politicians now realise multinationals may not bring in substantial foreign capital but will provide the technology, expertise and market access Africa needs.  ---------------------------------- Efficiency of Investment 1988-92  ---------------------------------- All developing countries     18.2% Asia                         22.0% Middle East and Europe       20.0% Africa                       11.5% Latin America                 7.7%  ----------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

It is particularly  significant for us that this summit should take place in South  Africa, and Cape Town in particular, so soon after the  epoch-making changes that have taken place.    That we can meet at this level, at the southern tip of the  continent, is tribute to a mission fulfilled. We once more  express our profound gratitude to your excellencies, the  business leaders and the world at large for the generous  solidarity you extended to us during the dark days of apartheid.    The rebirth that we celebrate in South Africa is indeed a  rebirth of the region and the continent. This is our collective  achievement which has opened up new opportunities for us to  exploit our great potential and, indeed, to boldly cross the  threshold to a new and great era. At last, Africa in general and  southern Africa in particular, can build a new all-inclusive  partnership based on freedom, democracy and social justice.    For us in South Africa, this is a time of great joy. Joy at  the rediscovery, as a united people, of our common humanity, our  common interests and our common destiny.    Ours is a delicate transition. But we are confident that we  have entered it with a new national spirit. The first democratic  elections which we have just conducted and the atmosphere of  peace that has prevailed in this period inspires us with  confidence that we shall succeed in our endeavours.    Lest we forget: the transformation we are living through is  the result of years of intensive and protracted struggle. It is  a result of difficult and sometimes harrowing negotiations. A  process that ultimately resulted in the meeting of minds among  the major political players.    We are heartened by the progress already made by the  government of national unity in reaching consensus on the most  important challenges facing the nation.    Differences do remain. But they manifest themselves within  the context of non-racial democracy. There is a spirit abroad to  ensure that we achieve the common objectives that we have set  ourselves, primarily to build a better life for all our people  and ensure peace, stability and economic growth. The  constitutional assembly will soon sit to draft a new  constitution for the country. And we are confident that the  spirit of consensus-seeking which characterised the multi-party  negotiations will display itself fully in this regard.    Quite certainly, transitions everywhere do breed  uncertainty.  And South Africa is no exception. In particular, we experienced  significant outflows of capital, and we still experience caution  among domestic and foreign investors. But the tide is turning,  occasioned by the manifest display of a national togetherness  that South Africa has hitherto never experienced.    We face a long and hard road to address the havoc wrought by  decades of apartheid. The challenge to ensure social justice and  stability is as urgent as it is crucial.    Put in brief, this means building a people-centred and  caring society. It requires that we use all our resources and  skills to broaden the base of the economy and ensure that it  serves all the people.    It demands that we enlarge the pool of skills and unleash  the  energies of the people, as a whole, to contribute to the twin  processes of nation-building and economic development.    It also entails addressing the disparities in residential  infrastructure, income distribution, provision of health  facilities and educational opportunities.    The government of national unity is of the unanimous view  that all this needs to be done and done urgently. But also that  the reconstruction and development targets that we set ourselves  should not upset macro-economic balances and undermine fiscal  discipline.    All of us recognise that peace and stability are crucial for  economic growth and development. We are determined to ensure  that all South Africans, including those who fear democracy, can  rest assured in the knowledge that change is in their interest  too.    This challenge is as much a South African one as it applies  to the region as a whole. Now that we have redeemed our pledge  with destiny, the people of southern Africa can start in earnest  to build a peaceful and developing sub-continent. We have to  urgently resolve the problems of conflict in parts of the  region, whilst we undo the effects of apartheid destabilisation.    Now we can together address the legacy of colonial under-  development and imbalances within and among countries of the  region. We can together galvanise the human and material  resources that the region commands, to serve the people. We can  together develop the physical infrastructure necessary for  development across all countries.    For these goals to be achieved, we need to start setting out  the integrated strategies required. This also means urgently  addressing the merging patterns that would, in the long run, not  benefit the region.    The lop-sided development bequeathed us by our colonial past  has resulted in the relative under-development of many countries  of the region. Related to this is the danger of unhealthy  migration of capital as well as skilled personnel to areas with  developed infrastructure. It is to the overall advantage of the  region that this trend is arrested and reversed. More  accurately, it needs to be obviated through strategies for  regional economic integration.    In the more distant future, our common objective is the  realisation of the Treaty of Abudja, the creation of an African  common market. In the near future, we are faced with the task of  ensuring that the programmes of both the SADC [Southern African  Development Community] and Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and  Southern Africa] are realised in the new political and social  context. With regional integration will emerge a mutually  beneficial arrangement regarding movement of goods, capital and  labour.    Such regional integration will need to address the broad  task  of reconstruction and development in the entire region.    We will venture to say, that modern economic planning  dictates that inter-national co-operation requires more that  just agreements on macro-economic imperatives and broad  development projects. For, impacting on these factors is the  basic question on how the partners jointly and severally create  an economic environment which attracts investments and benefits  ordinary people.    This means jointly grappling with issues such as:    Delivery of employment, shelter, nutrition, health,  education  and training for some 100-million people on a sustainable basis;  prioritising the areas, within our own countries, most in  need, and doing it in such a way that we stimulate sustainable  growth and development; seeking and finding the balance  between our noble goals and the resource opportunities and  constraints; avoiding economic and financial arrangements,  including the debt-trap, which can only have the effect of  eroding our countries' sovereignty.    We who are only starting to take the first steps out of the  mire of racial subjugation, are well aware that the experience  countries of the region have gathered will stand us in good  stead. We can only benefit from the new relationship that is  emerging.    As we take our rightful place among nations of Africa, South  Africa commits itself to join our neighbours in rising to the  mammoth challenge presented by a growing affliction in many  parts of the world known as ""Afro-pessimism"" -- loss of  confidence in our continent's capacity to overcome  under-development and declining standards.    It is a task which we are called upon to undertake with a  singleness of purpose and with confidence, remembering that the  thriving countries of Asia, the socalled Asian Tigers were only  20 years ago written off as hopeless basket cases. This can only  be achieved if there is purposeful interaction among our  countries.    Democratic South Africa enters this new partnership as one  player amongst many. We harbour no desire to be the dominant  partner, for the region and South Africa itself would lose in  the long run. We entertain no illusion of becoming the regional  benefactor because such capacity we do not possess.    Rather, we seek to join governments of the region in taking  up the cudgels on behalf of all the peoples. We seek to join  them in attracting significant investment flows and in reaching  beneficial trade agreements. Along with countries of the region  we are determined to ensure that the goods mined, harvested and  manufactured in the region become internationally competitive.  We are committed to strengthen regional institutions such as the  SADC and Comesa and at the same time strengthen bilateral  relations with each of our neighbours.    This we resolved to do both as a government and in  partnership with various institutions of civil society such as  business houses, trade unions, as well as educational, health  and other bodies.    We are confident that South Africa will soon achieve the  rates of growth necessary for us to meet our objectives. The  last two quarters have demonstrated that GDP [gross domestic  product] growth is on the upswing. This will be of benefit not  only to South Africa's people but will help the movement towards  greater southern African prosperity.    The path that South Africa has traversed might be unique in  many respects. But, to the extent that we have based ourselves  on the experiences of southern Africa and Africa as a whole, it  is a common achievement and common heritage.    One month into post-colonial Africa, in the true sense of  the  word, we are confident that regional and continental efforts  will ensure that the injunction -- God bless Africa -- finds  full expression in our prosperity.

The deal marks the biggest re-investment in South Africa since the lifting of American sanctions. It follows the return of a number of US companies to South Africa this year, including International Business Machines and Kodak. Pilsbury, a rival US foods group, set up a partnership with local producer FoodCorp last year, and Heinz is understood to be investigating a South African partnership, possibly with the Premier Group. CPC has exercised its option to buy a 50 per cent stake in Tongaat's consumer foods division. The option was part of a licensing and technology agreement signed by the companies in October 1993. The new company - CPC Tongaat Foods - will invest R10m in a new dry foods plant. The deal is complicated by CPC's disinvestment from South Africa in 1987, when it sold the rights to a number of its brands - including Knorr, Hellmann's and Marmite - to Hunt Leuchars  Hepburn, a local foods supplier. CPC Tongaat Foods will be restricted to marketing these brands outside South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. However, it plans to introduce and produce the rest of CPC's product range in South Africa for the local and sub-Saharan export markets. Mr Mohammed Wahby, vice-president of CPC Europe Consumer Foods, admitted South Africa and many neighbouring countries faced severe political troubles. However, he said: 'One should not wait for a solution to all political problems before launching a sound business proposal.' Mr Cedric Savage, managing director of Tongaat, said it was vital for South Africans to establish joint ventures with international companies.   Companies:-  CPC International.

Priority Research Areas         In particular, the following projects will be considered for funding:       A. Economic Circumstances of Aged Widows_ORS94001         A high proportion of the elderly who are economically vulnerable are widowed women. Although as a group they experience one of the highest rates of poverty, approximately three-quarters of widows aged 65 or older are not poor. Data from the SIPP provide an opportunity to understand the economic circumstances of aged widows and to identify those factors that are associated with their late-life poverty.     Proposals are sought for SIPP-based research that conducts two types of analyses of the poverty of aged widows. The first of these tasks is to provide a comprehensive description of the personal, financial, and environmental characteristics of poor elderly widows. These characteristics will include details of income amounts and specific sources, assets, personal and household characteristics (e.g., age, race, education, work history, fertility history, welfare recipiency history, health status, urban vs rural location, age at which widowhood occurred). This descriptive material should compare and contrast the incidence of poverty and its circumstances for aged widows with similar measures for single elderly women who have never married, aged married women, and, where sample size permits, elderly divorced women.     The second task is to simulate the resulting economic scenario for married women aged 65 or older in the event of the death of their husbands. This will involve projecting the time path of income and assets for the widow, given the couple's economic circumstances at time of the SIPP interviews. The hypothetical widow's income should be based on Social Security and Supplemental Security Income program rules, any pension income she has earned in her own right, whether a husband with public or private pension rights has elected a survivor's option, asset income, the couple's life insurance holdings, and so forth. It is expected that, where possible, the economic status of the couple prior to the husband's death will be related to factors such as lifetime work experience of each spouse, current health status and health insurance coverage, etc. In addition, various scenarios for asset decumulation associated with health expenditures brought on by the husband's death might be introduced to account for reduced assets subsequently available to the surviving spouse [See Linda Del Bene and Denton R. Vaughan, ``Income, Assets and Health Insurance: Economic Resources for Meeting Acute Health Care Needs of the Aged,'' Social Security Bulletin, Spring 1992]. We are interested in learning how the economic status of aged widows compares with their circumstances prior to the husband's death, whether particular background factors can be used to predict which married women are particularly at risk of poverty in their old age, and how the incomes and assets of widows change as the duration of widowhood increases.     Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration.     The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds.     It is anticipated that an amount up to $100,000 will be allocated to fund one project under this priority area for the initial 12-month budget period.         B. Selected Economic and Demographic Assumptions Used to Project the Financial Status of the OASDI Trust Funds_ORS94002         The annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal OASDI Trust Funds contain long-range, 75-year projections on the financial status of the trust funds. The assumptions and methodology underlying those projections were reviewed by the Panel of Technical Experts (the Panel) convened by the quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security and recommendations for research were made. (The ``Social Security Technical Panel Report to the 1991 Advisory Council on Social Security'' and its appendices were reprinted in the November and December 1990 issues of the Social Security Bulletin.)

The supplement should be compulsory reading for the western finance ministers attending this month's IMF/World Bank annual meeting in Washington. A potential African recovery hangs by a thread. The meeting has the power to throw Africa either a lifeline or a noose. The last G7 summit in Tokyo failed to act on Africa's crushing debt. Africa cannot afford a similar response from the IMF/World Bank meeting. The issue is simple: if world leaders want to lead, then they have to deal decisively with world problems.

The agreement, which was signed in a ceremony at Pretoria by Sir Leon and Mr Thabo Mbeki, South African deputy president, is primarily concerned with boosting co-operation in trade and development, although it also deals with questions of human rights and democracy. It will also allow the European Investment Bank, which currently has Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) earmarked for South Africa, to begin lending activities in the country as well as setting the legal basis for the expansion of EU-South African economic links. Both the agreement and Sir Leon's visit testify to the growing prominence of the EU in South Africa as an institution separate from its member states. More importantly, they lay the groundwork for the negotiation of a formal trade agreement between the EU and South Africa. The EU is currently South Africa's biggest trading partner and receives more than 40 per cent of South African exports, while providing 33 per cent of the country's total imports. Two-way annual trade amounts to R63bn (Pounds 11.5bn). Although South Africa was admitted to the Generalised System of Preferences in September, there is currently a debate over whether the country should also seek accession to the Lome Agreement, which provides 69 developing countries with preferential access to EU markets, or whether it should instead draw up a separate agreement with the EU. Speaking at the signing, Mr Mbeki said he hoped that the resolution of this question could be reached as 'quickly as possible' but warned that any final deal would first require consultation with other states in the region. Sir Leon echoed these sentiments and said that he hoped that the EU also hoped to contribute to broader regional development. However, he warned that urgent action first needed to be taken by South Africa to dismantle its existing trade barriers if it wished to become an attractive market for European investment. 'Such a protectionist system (as South Africa's) makes no sense today,' he said. 'I have stressed that further liberalisation is essential for both trade and investment.' Earlier on his trip, Sir Leon announced plans to form a joint EU/South Africa Business Council to help promote business ties and trade links. Meanwhile, on the aid front, the EU has long been South Africa's largest single donor of unattached grant assistance for development, having spent R1.2bn since 1986. It plans to spend a further R440m a year on various development programmes, especially in education and health.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his  official residence where they held talks behind closed doors.    In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro  pointed out that the rise to power of the African National  Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between  the two countries. ""Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples,"" Castro said.    After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted  an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting  Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel  where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation  that accompanied him.    Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation,  whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for  independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: ""There  are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South  Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now  there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and  affection for Cuba.""    The statesman confirmed he has been treated very  respectfully  by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit  here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to  harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results  of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the  entire world.    He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural  ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the  Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state  and heads of government from approximately 40 countries.    Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he  also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from  Africa and the Middle East.     "

Druing the meeting, Qian Qichen experssed his  appreciation for Prime Minister Ravony's efforts to develop  friendly relations between China and Madagascar. Qian Qichen  believed that the economic exchanges and cooperation between the  two countries could be even more comprehensive and diversified.  Ravony said that Qian Qichen's concept for bilateral economic  cooperation is very attractive, and the Malagasy government  would promote and support direct cooperation between Malagasy  entrepreneurs and Chinese entrepreneurs.    On the Taiwan question, Ravony said that Madagascar  recognizes one China only; namely, the People's Republic of  China, and Taiwan is a part of China. Qian Qichen expressed his  appreciation for Ravony's statement.    On the situation in Africa, Ravony said: Great changes have  taken place in world situation. Further cooperation between  Africa and China is conducive to world peace and development.    In the afternoon, Qian Qichen held talks with Malagasy  foreign minister Sylla. The two sides exchanged views on the  African situation of common concern, and on how to further  develop friendly relations and cooperation between China and  Madagascar. The two sides reached a common understanding on a  wide range of issues, expressed satisfaction on the development  of Sino-Malagasy friendly and cooperative relations, and hoped  that the bilateral relations would enter a new stage with the  concerted efforts of the governments of the two countries.

0,FT934-7734 ,"FT934-7734 _AN-DKRC7AGUFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (18): Continental launchpad - A look at the industrial potential      By TONY HAWKINS   SOUTH AFRICA'S return to legitimacy coincides with the growing regionalisation of foreign investment decisions. As multinationals rationalise and integrate their foreign operations to secure scale economies and improve co-ordination, so they are looking more carefully at regional, rather than national, markets. Invariably this means consolidating operations at one, or a few, locations to serve a regional market, especially where trade flows are being liberalised. By any yardstick, South Africa is the logical launchpad for penetrating the sub-Saharan market, worth some Dollars 250bn, of which South Africa itself accounts for more than Dollars 100bn or more than 40 per cent. The South African market, although small by global standards, is the only African market large enough to justify a broad range of manufacturing activities. The next largest is Nigeria, worth Dollars 34bn and set to shrink in foreign currency with devaluation next year. While few companies have yet rationalised their operations with the establishment of regional headquarters in South Africa, this is likely to be a pervasive trend, once the violence subsides and business confidence returns. BP is one company that will establish a regional headquarters in South Africa, while a number of manufacturing companies, such as Nissan, are known to be actively considering developing their South African factories as the platform for exporting into the region. The reasons are obvious; South Africa has the best infrastructure on the continent with first-world service industry back-up in banking, insurance, capital markets, hotels and information technology. It has spare capacity in energy and transport, a vast pool of unskilled labour, a rich natural resource base, a better skills endowment that anywhere else in Africa - though way behind Asian levels - and a large enough domestic market to justify most industrial investments. By African standards the environment is investor-friendly and there are few African locations that can match South Africa's quality of life. The disadvantages are essentially socio-political - political and criminal violence, allied with the worry that, even if they are papered over in 1993/4, ethnic tensions will re-surface later in the decade. Labour relations are also a possible reason for steering clear of South Africa given the high cost of labour relative to that elsewhere in the region and far higher levels of unionisation. Against that is the relentless decline in the relative importance of direct labour costs in most business activities, with raw materials, capital and transport costs assuming far greater significance. These costs are likely to be lower in South Africa than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. International business is likely to adopt one of two main strategies for serving the African market in the 1990s: It will export into the region from offshore using agents, licensees or franchisees as a vehicle; or It will use South Africa as the mode of entry, manufacturing or assembling in the country primarily for domestic consumption while exporting residual amounts to the region. Clearly, neither strategy will work if African countries maintain tariffs and other barriers against imports. But with the march of economic reform, regional economies are being liberalised, thereby encouraging foreign firms to sell into the usually-tiny markets from outside rather than setting up shop behind high tariff barriers as was the pattern in the 1950s and 60s. There are two polar views of how trade and investment flows will evolve in Southern Africa. On the one hand, the locomotive theory holds that South Africa will become the region's economic dynamo that helps turn the sub-Saharan economy around. The alternative school holds that South Africa, certainly for the immediate future, has more than enough on its domestic plate to make much of a contribution to the regional turnround. Indeed, there are even those in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe who predict that relocation will, in fact, go the other way, with firms emigrating from South Africa to escape political violence and industrial relations unrest, and exploiting more tranquil labour market conditions - and lower costs - elsewhere. This is an unlikely scenario given the growing tendency for manufacturers to locate as close as possible to their main markets. The more likely scenario is one in which South Africa becomes the platform for exploiting market opportunities in east, central and southern Africa. South African business is well placed, too, to participate in rebuilding the region's physical infrastructure, on which massive amounts - much of it aid money - will be spent. South Africa aside, there is little indigenous capacity in the region to handle major physical infrastructural projects. South African businesses will have the edge, too, in some African privatisation programmes - their investment banks and mining houses are already active in countries such as Mozambique and Zambia where privatisation moves are gathering speed. African leaders will be perturbed less at the prospect of growing South African participation in their economies, than with the potentially one-way traffic that this implies. Few countries in the region have much to sell to Pretoria other than raw materials (oil, copper, coffee, cocoa, tobacco) and tourism. The saving grace - though this will depend on close links with multinationals, often with regional headquarters in South Africa - could be the development of sub-contracting and components manufacture for final assembly in the south. This would turn launchpad South Africa into a positive sum game in which there are winners all round.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

They aim to put European Union [EU] trading nations firmly  in  the front line in the threecornered fight between Europe, the  United States and the Far East over access to the resources-rich  nation.    The EU delegation will be made up of representatives from  several major directorates-general and will be in South Africa  from 27 June to 2 July. Trade, investment and tariffs are to be  discussed in depth as part of a comprehensive package earlier  agreed by the Council of Ministers.    Britain's trade and economics group, which will be at least  60-strong, will be headed by board of trade president Michael  Heseltine and is believed to be one of the largest delegations  to leave the UK this year.    During the visit -- from 10 to 15 July -- the British group  will meet business people and politician; in Johannesburg,  Durban and Cape Town. Britain has already pledged a $150  million loan the largest amount from any European country.    The EU delegation will arrive in Cape Town for talks with  Trevor Manuel, South Africa's minister for trade and industry  and other senior ministers, before going on to Pretoria and  Johannesburg. Apart from wider issues, the talks are crucial  because South Africa's status as a trading partner and as a  suitable investment prospect has to be clarified.    If firm future trade links are to be set up, a bilateral  agreement between Brussels and Pretoria is seen as a matter of  urgency. So far, the EU has left it to member states to enter  into investment protection, double taxation and bilateral trade  agreements with South Africa, but has now accelerated the pace  at which it feels agreement must be reached with South Africa in  the face of American initiatives.    With the total U.S. commitment of $420m in loans towards  economic and social regeneration in South Africa both from  public and private sectors, the pledges of $179m this year from  the EU and member countries apart from the UK may look small in  comparison. However, EU contributions will be grants, without  strings attached.    In April, the EU foreign affairs council finalised its  policy  on a joint trade and aid measures programme and following the  South African elections, this is a priority issue on the  delegation menu.    The visit is seen as the first of a two-phase thrust to  establish future relations. The second phase will begin with a  conference in the EU with delegates from all southern African  countries. Mandela has already agreed in principle to the  creation of a Southern African Economic Community and this will  be actively pursued.    The EU wants to prepare the way for other areas of  cooperation in education and training, industry and commerce,  telecommunications science and technology.     "

With the growing number of ODA recipients, it  has become increasingly difficult for Japan to undertake  assistance alone due to linguistic or technical problems. Japan  will, therefore, aim at more effective aid through joint  international ODA projects. It will discuss new joint projects  in African and Asian countries with Canada, Sweden, South  Africa, Israel, and the EC Commission, while also increasing  existing joint international ODA efforts with the United States,  Britain, and other countries.    Japan's ODA has again surpassed the United States in 1993,  becoming the world's top aid donor for three consecutive years.  While ODA from the Western nations has leveled off, Japan's ODA  has been increasing not only in Asia, but also in Africa and  Latin America, where it used to give minimal assistance. Plans  for ODA in East Europe and the Central Asian states of the  former USSR have also come up for consideration since 1993.    However, there are problems such as the shortage of Japanese  technicians who can speak the local languages. Japan will  attempt to solve these problems by cooperating with other  advanced nations. Furthermore, this will also ensure more  efficient management of ODA, the appropriations for which have  not been increased as expected due to Japan's financial  difficulties.    Japan is considering a joint aid program with South Africa  for the economic reconstruction of Mozambique, Lesotho, and  other neighboring countries of South Africa. Such a joint aid  program with South Africa will also express the Japanese  Government's approval of the democratization efforts in South  Africa, which has succeeded in instituting a general election  with black participation for the first time in history.    Joint ODA efforts in Africa are also being considered with  Sweden and Canada, while joint projects will be implemented in  Africa or Vietnam with Canada. Sweden and Canada are advanced  nations in terms of ODA. Japan also hopes to acquire ODA  knowhow from these countries.    Cooperative efforts in the area of refugee relief in the  Philippines, and agricultural development in Thailand have  already been undertaken with the United States. Japan wants to  cooperate with the United States in a wildlife conservation  program in Indonesia.     "

Speaking in Cairo on the eve of a four-day NAM conference,  Mr  Nzo said international networking was critical for the success  of his government's internal development policy: ""The contact  we have trade-wise and economic-wise with various countries of  the world is bound to assist our process (of restructuring).""    According to Mr Nzo, South Africa is expecting to be  accepted  as an NAM member on Tuesday. He said that joining the  108-member organisation was also a ""natural development"", since  the movement had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and had  given SA ""liberation movements"" observer status.    Mr Nzo is attending the summit in Cairo at a critical moment  in the movement's history. The NAM was created in the 1960's to  help developing nations assert their independence from the  United states and Soviet superpowers. Now that the Cold War is  over it is trying to recast itself as a pressure group fighting  for third world interests.    The future of the movement is one of the items members are  scheduled to discuss this week. They are expected to advocate  focussing on ""more of an economic role"".    South Africa has also just been accepted into the  Organisation of African Unity and Mr Nzo said it hoped to join  the United Nations in the coming months.    The end of isolation means South Africa will be expected to  get involved in efforts to contain regional conflicts, like that  in Rwanda. Mr Nzo said that for now however his government  would stick to humanitarian aid while it got its own military  house in order. ""We are engaged in the process of rebuilding a  new army in our country...and we can't therefore be expected  before that process is completed, to let our soldiers march (in  peacekeeping operations).""    The Cold War superpowers, particularly the US, have  traditionally barred NAM countries from developing nuclear  weapons. Mr Nzo said South Africa would not use its nuclear  capacity to equalise the imbalance in the nuclear equation but  would ""certainly participate in the peaceful uses of nuclear  energy"".     "

But the ""Cape route"" for  shipping and the 3,000 km of South African coastline are still  of prime geostrategic importance and a major economic asset.  Located at the confluence of major commercial routes, the  country has port, road, and rail infrastructure that is both a  gateway to the rest of the African continent and a natural  outlet for southern African countries that have no direct access  to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.    Despite--or perhaps because of--the relative international  isolation forced upon it as a result of its policy of ""separate  development,"" South Africa also has become a true regional  economic power. Sitting on a vast heap of gold (the country has  50 percent of global reserves) and diamonds (25 percent), it  furnishes 52 percent of the electricity, 83 percent of the  steel, and 97 percent of coal products for the whole continent,  and provides half its industrial production.    Now that the country is committed to the path of  democratizing its institutions and opening up to the outside  world, the wealth that was built on a foundation of racial  inequality and discrimination is both seductive and worrisome to  its neighbors, who are frightened at the hegemonic tendencies  that might emerge in the ""new South Africa.""    The international community, deaf to misgivings frequently  articulated by experts on the region--""Southern Africa stands to  South Africa in the same relationship that Europe would stand to  Germany, if Germany were all Europe had""--is trying once again  to evoke that ""Afro-optimism,"" which so often miscarried in the  past as one African country after the next fell into insolvency.  And it dares to hope that this ""politico-socio-economic  laboratory"" with its eyes turned (at least for the moment)  toward Europe, its principal trading partner--a laboratory  situated midway between two high-growth zones, Asia Pacific and  Latin America, whose future seems assured at least for a  generation---will be the engine of economic development that  sub-Saharan Africa so desperately needs. ""Nigeria and South  Africa are the only big economic powers capable of stabilizing  the African continent,"" says one observer familiar with these  countries.    It is an observed fact that South Africa's trade with its  neighbors comprises only a very small part (less than 7 percent)  of its total external commerce--the country's inward looking  orientation was deplored by the African Development Bank in a  recent report prepared at the request of Egypt's Husni Mubarak.  All the more reason to expect, now that South Africa has turned  over a new ideological leaf and the former so-called frontline  states opposed to apartheid have done the same, that trade will  expand among the southern African countries with their combined  population of 115 million inhabitants--who represent 115 million  potential consumers--however slowly the economic capacity of  their respective countries might grow.    Regional Integration    The next phase should be real regional integration, in  stages, by means of economic cooperation instruments whose role  now needs to be reexamined. This is the working hypothesis  advanced by Alan Hirsch, assistant director and economics  instructor at Cape University, one of the architects of South  Africa's future commercial policy, which was drawn up for  Mandela's ANC.    ""Our neighbors have no reason to fear economic domination  from our side. On the contrary, it is in our interest to help  them expand their own economies,"" he says. This white official,  head of Cape's development policy research unit, developed the  theory at the meeting in Gaborone (Botswana) last February, in  collaboration with the ANC's ""external trade relations"" team and  representatives of the southern African countries.    This regional miniconference afforded an opportunity to see  the extremely cautious approach taken by both sides. While the  other countries in the region may favor increased cooperation  with Pretoria, they realize very clearly that in many product  areas, competition is likely to prevail over complementarity.  ""There is such a gulf between South Africa and its neighbors  that there is a risk of killing embryonic industries in Namibia,  Botswana, and Zimbabwe,"" one expert confirmed.    On the South African side, the ""Mandela team,"" and hence the  future government of national union, although describing itself  as intensely interested in relations with its neighbors, does  not intend to be diverted from the top priority of the hour,  amelioration of the country's domestic situation. However,, the  ANC has not ruled out consideration of other partners. ""We do  want access to other markets besides Europe and southern  Africa,"" says Mr. Hirsch, adding that ANC already has made  contacts with the United States to ask for most favored nation  [MFN] status. The big lesson learned from the Gaborone meeting  was that if integration is going to happen, the panoply of  regional accords now in force will have to be revised.    These agreements come in several different forms, from  simple  free trade area to customs union, and even the beginnings of  what might evolve into a regional common market--""our own  version of the European Union,"" as President de Klerk puts it.  Already the region has a Common Monetary Area (CMA); a monetary  union comprising South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland; and a  South African Customs Union (SACU) that includes South Africa,  Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia (since its independence in 1990), and  Swaziland.    In addition to these monetary and customs institutions,  there  are economic cooperation agreements. The most important of these  is the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) that encompasses 18 central  and east African countries but until now has excluded South  Africa. The Southern Africa Development and Coordination  Conference (SADCC) composed of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,  Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe  has set its sights higher. Revamped in 1993 as the South African  Development Community (SADC), it intends to put its political  past behind it.    Immigration Issue    In all likelihood, the future integration of the region,  with  Pretoria as catalyst, will be grafted onto PTA and SADC. But do  not forget: It is not going to happen in the immediate future.  ""Hopes of seeing South Africa play a major role in the region  are probably exaggerated,"" says the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a study on the country's  future that appeared in the house magazine, OBSERVER. ""The  private sector is clearly less committed to investing in the  region than was hoped, if only in terms of the small volume of  investments in South Africa itself,"" add the authors of the  article, underscoring the country's need to resolve its own  internal problems before anything else.    One of these is the increasing volume of immigration from  neighboring countries, which certainly will add new  complications to future commercial or economic negotiations  among the southern African countries. Mandela warned some time  ago that South Africa could not afford to become ""the job market  for the entire region."" More bluntly, his entourage has openly  admitted it will be necessary to ""deport 2 million undesirables""  hailing from such places as Zaire and Mozambique. The future  government of national union may adopt legislation to this end.    Meanwhile, an ANC delegation visited France early this year  for talks with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. No doubt  Pasqua's lieutenants provided the ANC representatives with some  ""tried-and-true"" prescriptions in this domain.     "

He told the House of Commons that Pounds 60m would be in the form of bilateral aid and the remainder through programmes arranged by the Commonwealth Development Corporation and the European Union. Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, and MPs of other parties in congratulating the people of South Africa on the conduct of the election. The foreign secretary said he would be discussing how the aid could be best used when attending the inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president on May 10. The Pounds 100m will be made available by the Overseas Development Administration from its existing budget. Mr Hurd envisaged that priority would be given to helping with policy formulation and projects in education and health. Other aims should include enhancing productive capacity and employment.

Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the UK wanted to work with South Africa and other African countries to 'turn the tide' against violence and war on the continent. Mr Major announced the initiative during an historic address to an informal joint sitting of parliament at the beginning of the first official visit to South Africa by a British prime minister since 1960. Earlier, he met South African President Nelson Mandela for talks on rebuilding the two countries' traditionally close relationship, which was weakened during South Africa's international isolation under the former whites-only government. Officials said the talks were conducted in 'an atmosphere of great warmth', suggesting that the ANC-led government of national unity has forgiven Britain for its less than enthusiastic endorsement of sanctions against the former regime. Mr Major urged South Africa to join the international community in bringing prosperity to the whole of Africa by helping to pre-empt outbreaks of violence, rather than trying to limit trouble after it had started. 'An entirely new effort at preventive diplomacy is long overdue. With our friends in Africa . . . Britain wants to develop new mechanisms to head off conflicts before they become unstoppable,' he said. 'We have in mind, for example, setting up regional peacekeeping cells. We need more people trained to mediate and act as peace brokers. We would not need a cumbersome bureaucracy, but a tight and properly resourced infrastructure in Africa.' The British proposals will be spelled out in more detail to the United Nations next week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has long sought a bigger role for pre-emptive mediation in international peacekeeping efforts. However, officials said the plan was intended to build on a recent resolution by the Organisation of African Unity calling for better conflict resolution procedures on the continent. They said the initiative was not intended to involve large numbers of troops, although the final shape of the peacekeeping force was likely to be determined by the UN and the OAU.

After years of  sworn enmity between Cuba and South Africa, President Castro  arrived on his first visit to South Africa, and what a moment it  was. Pieter Theron asked him about impressions of South Africa.    [Begin recording] [Castro] It is wonderful to be in South  Africa. It grabbed my imagination. It is indeed an  extraordinary country in every respect -- the organization,  nature. I have only been here for a short while, but I have  spoken to many people. I was impressed by their hospitality and  the warmth with which I was received. I felt a sense of harmony  and unity, quite the opposite of what a stranger would have  expected. I followed the news every day and was impressed by  the country's people. They are well brought up. I realized  that what has taken place over the past few days was without  doubt an historic event for South Africa, for Africa, and for  the world. It has been a privilege to witness the events. I  was really impressed by what I saw. It is something I will take  with me when I return to Cuba.    [Theron] How do you see future relations between South  Africa  and Cuba?    [Castro] I would like to believe we are more than friends.  We are like family. A family does not discuss formal  relations. The ties which have grown between the people of Cuba  and South Africa are so deep that we feel at home here. My  visit has also provided the opportunity for even better  relations between the two countries in the future. This could  be of mutual benefit.    [Theron] What has South Africa got to offer Cuba, and what  has Cuba got to offer South Africa?    [Castro] Regarding trade, there is a long list of products  which South Africa could offer to Cuba. We do not want gold, as  we have no use for it. Apart from that, we could use almost  anything you could imagine. South Africa has advanced  technology. In many areas such as agriculture, you produce  everything. There are many areas for cooperation between our  two countries. South Africa will play an important role in  Africa and in the Third World. We have been doing it for many  years now, and I believe our experience could be of great value  for South Africa. South Africa is now involved in a great  experiment, and the whole world would like this experiment to  succeed. It is important to mankind, which is involved in  serious conflicts in many places.    [Theron] Cuba was involved in the conflict in Namibia and  Angola. You were engaged in war against South Africa. Do you  think your involvement contributed towards the changes that took  place in South Africa?    [Castro] Our involvement in Angola led to many sacrifices.  But we took the decision on our own, without the Soviet Union's  knowledge. We did it out of sympathy and historical ties. It  was not without risk. One always runs the risk of being  defeated.    [Theron] President Castro, communism collapsed in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union. Why do you think communism is  still the right system for Cuba?    [Castro] Communism was not imported to Cuba. It was our own  creation, and it developed differently from the way it developed  in other countries. It was the result of our own struggle  against a dictator. No one brought socialism to Cuba. Rather,  it was a case of Cuba finding its own solutions. We achieved a  great deal, but we lost 80 percent of our trade -- many of the  things we imported from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless we  overcame that setback. Not many countries could have achieved  that. But Cuba is a united country, with a spirit all its own.  This is the spirit which emerged in Angola. At one point,  without any assistance, we supported more than 50,000 troops  almost 10,000 kilometers from home. That is proof of a strong  nation driven by certain principles.    [Theron] Will the future system of government still be  communism for Cuba?    [Castro] We see it as socialism. We want to maintain it, but  we have left an economic opening. We lost capital markets and  technology, which we now need in order to develop our country.  So there is room in the economic field. We need investments in  many areas. There is a process of change under way in our  country, to keep us in touch with the present realities of the  world. But we have not given up our principles. [end recording]     "

All of Africa seems  to be spread out below as the plane zigzags its way to Johannesburg on a  curious route. The plane must burrow through endless clouds, for although its  presence in African airspace may be tolerated, the plane may not land unless  invited.    Mt. Kilimanjaro, snow-capped and majestic, juts abruptly from the desert floor,  rising like a kingdom in the clouds. Miles later, the outline of Nairobi's  airport comes into view. Landing there, the jumbo jet spits out streams of  khaki-clad tourists with a clattering of cameras.    After spending a long night on the plane, passengers continuing their journey  are eager to get out and stretch their legs during the two-hour layover. But an  announcement from the captain puts an end to that glad possibility. Those  passengers bound for Johannesburg, South Africa, the captain said, are asked to  remain on board, at the request of the Kenyan authorities.    Viewed from the plane's window, the Tarmac shimmers in the summer heat. The  plane bound for South Africa sits alone on the runway, like an unwelcome  insect.    In a very real way, getting to South Africa is a metaphor for being there.  International sanctions do not make it easy. It can be circuitous. If you are  going to South Africa, for whatever reason, there are places where you no  longer will be welcome. The country's own consulate advises against having a  South African stamp on your passport. It can be infinitely complicated.    Having gotten there, through the tsk-tsking of international opinion, it  doesn't take long to sense the isolation. The world does not want to come here,  and people here aren't free to move about the world. In a sports sense, it is  as if South Africa is a nation of children, possessing a beautiful playground  and wondrous toys, but no friends come to play. And every day they watch and  wait.    But South Africa has grown weary of waiting. Three generations of athletes have  stood by and watched. Now they want to play. After decades of boycotts --  economic, diplomatic, cultural and sporting -- this nation says it deserves the  right to play with the rest of the world.      APARTHEID: ""A Terrible Dream""    The root of South Africa's isolation is apartheid -- the country's legislated  and systematic policy of racial separation that has been the law of the land  since 1948. And, although some reform has occurred in 42 years, the basic  tenets of apartheid are still firmly in place. The world's response to  apartheid has been to punish and shun South Africa through a series of measures  aimed at disrupting the country's status quo.    The longest, and to some the hardest hitting, of all sanctions has been South  Africa's sports isolation. It began, perhaps, in 1956, when the International  Table Tennis Federation expelled the South African Table Tennis Union, and for  the past 30 years, South Africa has been the pariah of sporting nations.    No country has been subject to anything remotely like the sports isolation  South Africa has experienced. South African athletes have not been allowed to  compete in the Olympic Games since 1960. There is an international ban that  forbids any athlete in any Olympic sport from competing in South Africa. There  is an international ""contamination rule"" that forbids competition against a  South African athlete anywhere in the world. South African citizens who wanted  to watch the 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea were told to leave. South  African journalists wanting to cover the Games were denied credentials.    The state-run South African Broadcasting Co. is not permitted to buy the  broadcast rights to many of the world's premier sporting events.    South African society has helped fashion its own noose, however. Three decades  of isolation has come solely because of what has been called ""a terrible dream""  -- apartheid. Apartheid is the mechanism that has kept South Africa's nonwhite  athletes from an opportunity for comparable competition, training, coaching and  facilities within the country. Apartheid classifies South Africa's people into  four strict groups -- African for the black population, Asian for the East  Indian population, colored for the mixed-race, and white.    The open oppression of the majority -- of South Africa's 36 million people, 27  million are black, 5 million white, 3 million colored and 1 million Asian --  has been enough to keep the world away. The international bans forbidding  sporting contact with South Africa have been thorough and steadfast. In fact,  the solidarity that members of the international sporting community display on  this issue makes it unique. Where else can the United States and Soviet Union  line up in complete agreement?    Officially, South Africa's isolation is complete. However, sports officials and  leaders in the private sector occasionally finance so-called rebel tours --  athletes from ""outside"" are brought in at tremendous expense to perform in much  the same way as entertainers such as Frank Sinatra sing in nearby Sun City for  $2 million a night.    There is incentive for the promoters, too. The Income Tax Allowance Bill of  1986 allows a promoter of an international sporting event a maximum deduction  of 180%. The law asks that qualifying events must show a material advantage to  South Africa. The government views this tax break as a small price to pay to  encourage international visitors and ease the sense of isolation.    Companies are lining up to take advantage. In 1988, it was estimated that South  African businesses spent $120 million in sports sponsorships and promotions.  Sports-related advertising accounted for about 15% of the total ad sales in the  country.    So starved are South Africans for contact that money is seemingly no object  when it comes to luring athletes. Money has to be the incentive, because most  athletes who defy the bans and compete here are themselves banned for years  from their sports, thus ironically completing their solidarity with South  Africa.    The system of pay-for-play is an interesting example of market efficiency:  South Africa creates a market for foreign athletes by offering them enough  money to compensate for bans or suspensions. Once banned, the athletes are  bonded to South Africa because there is no other place in the world that will  allow them to compete. So, they return year after year, and the system steams  forward.    South African sports leaders have been creative in providing incentive for  athletes to stay here, because there are methods for South Africans -- using  false passports and names -- to travel and compete abroad.    Money has been an effective motivator. In this, South Africa is no different  from any other nation. For top athletes, especially top white athletes, there  is a lot of money to be made in amateur sports. Aside from prize money, which  is awarded at even the smallest competition, there is a large pool of  endorsement dollars available to the athlete who markets himself with savvy.    Large South African companies are looking for a black athlete to use as a  spokesman, too, but corporate executives say too often a poor education and  difficulty with the language limit the opportunities for black athletes. Others  note the irony here, since it is precisely limited opportunities, especially in  education, that keep blacks from sharing in South Africa's wealth.      SPORTS: South Africa's 'Soft Underbelly'    The various international sports organizations knew what they were doing when  they cut off South Africa. The nation has weathered the economic and cultural  boycotts with some hardship, but with ingenuity and an inward turn. South  Africans aren't allowed to see Woody Allen or Spike Lee films, but the  country's own film industry is thriving.    The problem for sports is more complicated. Whereas South African artists and  writers, for example, have flourished, athletes -- who almost by definition  must compete -- have been retarded in their growth. Athletes become weary of  facing the same competition before the same spectators, able to compare only on  paper their abilities against foreign athletes, and then only in certain  sports. They long to see new faces or even the colors of a different uniform.  There is talent here, but there is also stagnation.    The international sports boycotts have hit at what one official here called  ""South Africa's soft underbelly,"" for sports are the embodiment of South  African pride and culture.    Observed David Tothill, South Africa's ambassador to Australia: ""Denying South  Africans the means of expressing their own feelings of nationalism through the  medium of sport is probably one of the sports boycott's hidden objectives.""    In the rest of the world, where participation in the Olympic Games is taken for  granted, sports surely have their place in society, but a jaded public may fail  to be impressed with Olympic medals in colors other than gold. In South Africa,  sports are held on a higher plane. Perhaps the very act of denying this nation  the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a  heightened regard for the things they cannot have.    What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand.    ""Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you  have never seen before,"" said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African  National Olympic Committee. ""Because of our climate and because of our  inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily  life of a South African.    ""You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the  motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the  outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is  applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the  colored.""    At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate  for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a  multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa  couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last  South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host  to an international multisport competition.      SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship    It is popular to speak of ""the marriage of sports and politics"" in the context  of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had  political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936  and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history  shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's  knee.    ""The people who married sports and politics were South Africans,"" said Jannie  Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former  official in South Africa's track and field federation. ""This country has banned  Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of  government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last  to complain.""    South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it  came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South  African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out  unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they  must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team  as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable.    The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal  sport in an abnormal society.    The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No  participation in any government-sponsored event or program.    Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa,  that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school  sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial.    And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and  provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their  own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to  compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South  Africa.    Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened  with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for  ""collaborators"" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with  gasoline and set afire.    Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile  nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing  for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track  and field.    ""What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative,"" Plaatjes said of the  anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and  his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has  applied for citizenship.    ""They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as  supporting the government,"" Plaatjes said. ""Fine, but they offer no form of  competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a  finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think  that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show  the whites how good we are?""    An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the  drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks  to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another  way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are  boycotted daily by their own government.    Apartheid's grand scheme of ""separateness"" of races has been realized to such a  degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible.    However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the  rule of law.    Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to  sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For  example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to  laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they  wish. That was circumvented by the granting of ""honorary white"" status to  nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay.    A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain  hotels as ""international hotels,"" where whites and nonwhites would be allowed  to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too.    The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended  to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among  spectators, which had been forbidden by law.    Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all  times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them  to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose  course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a  photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest.    Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February,  apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to  some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict  segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and  recreation facilities are common sites for segregation.    Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was  allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The  Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit  blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them.    Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national  government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the  first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous  opposition.    Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the  political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been  the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made  all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at  last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so  delicate.      THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns    Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria. While keeping one  eye on her charges before a meet one night recently, she listed the  difficulties of coaching athletes who can never go anywhere to compete.    ""To keep them going and motivated is really hard,"" she said. ""They never have  any competition. My attitude is to never run them against anyone in practice,  only (against) the watch. That way they can learn to push themselves.    ""I must tell you, whenever I get an athlete who can make it, really make it, I  have two feelings at once. First, I am excited, because this is what a coach  works for. Then, I am sad. I know they will never get the competition, they can  never go to the Olympics. They are not allowed. This is the way we have in  South Africa. It is the hard way.""    The frustration is evident in nearly every athlete and coach. Myrtle Bothma,  ranked No. 1 in the world this season in the 400-meter hurdles, has still not  quietly accepted her plight. Bothma, who is white, echoes the popular sentiment  from athletes -- why hold us responsible for a political system we can do  nothing about?    ""I don't see how hurting me, not allowing me to run against the best 400-meter  hurdlers in the world, is going to help anything,"" she said. ""If they don't  want the white sportsmen to take part, why don't they take the black man? We  would love to see it.    ""You get a feeling, a kind of anger towards people who sit around a table in  their little suits and look at a little bit of paper and say, 'South Africa,  no.' They don't know what it's like to be a sportsman, to struggle, to work.  They can decide my future.    ""One day, I wish I was a fly with a sting. I could sit in that boardroom with  the (International Olympic Committee) in their meeting. When they decide not to  let South Africa compete, I would give them one sting, to make them think what  are they doing. I think they see the issue as something on a piece of paper,  not people.""

Perhaps the very act of denying this nation  the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a  heightened regard for the things they cannot have.    What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand.    ""Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you  have never seen before,"" said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African  National Olympic Committee. ""Because of our climate and because of our  inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily  life of a South African.    ""You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the  motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the  outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is  applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the  colored.""    At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate  for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a  multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa  couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last  South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host  to an international multisport competition.      SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship    It is popular to speak of ""the marriage of sports and politics"" in the context  of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had  political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936  and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history  shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's  knee.    ""The people who married sports and politics were South Africans,"" said Jannie  Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former  official in South Africa's track and field federation. ""This country has banned  Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of  government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last  to complain.""    South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it  came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South  African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out  unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they  must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team  as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable.    The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal  sport in an abnormal society.    The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No  participation in any government-sponsored event or program.    Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa,  that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school  sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial.    And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and  provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their  own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to  compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South  Africa.    Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened  with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for  ""collaborators"" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with  gasoline and set afire.    Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile  nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing  for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track  and field.    ""What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative,"" Plaatjes said of the  anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and  his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has  applied for citizenship.    ""They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as  supporting the government,"" Plaatjes said. ""Fine, but they offer no form of  competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a  finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think  that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show  the whites how good we are?""    An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the  drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks  to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another  way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are  boycotted daily by their own government.    Apartheid's grand scheme of ""separateness"" of races has been realized to such a  degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible.    However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the  rule of law.    Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to  sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For  example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to  laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they  wish. That was circumvented by the granting of ""honorary white"" status to  nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay.    A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain  hotels as ""international hotels,"" where whites and nonwhites would be allowed  to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too.    The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended  to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among  spectators, which had been forbidden by law.    Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all  times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them  to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose  course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a  photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest.    Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February,  apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to  some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict  segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and  recreation facilities are common sites for segregation.    Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was  allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The  Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit  blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them.    Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national  government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the  first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous  opposition.    Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the  political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been  the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made  all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at  last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so  delicate.      THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns    Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria. While keeping one  eye on her charges before a meet one night recently, she listed the  difficulties of coaching athletes who can never go anywhere to compete.    ""To keep them going and motivated is really hard,"" she said. ""They never have  any competition. My attitude is to never run them against anyone in practice,  only (against) the watch. That way they can learn to push themselves.    ""I must tell you, whenever I get an athlete who can make it, really make it, I  have two feelings at once. First, I am excited, because this is what a coach  works for. Then, I am sad. I know they will never get the competition, they can  never go to the Olympics. They are not allowed. This is the way we have in  South Africa. It is the hard way.""    The frustration is evident in nearly every athlete and coach. Myrtle Bothma,  ranked No. 1 in the world this season in the 400-meter hurdles, has still not  quietly accepted her plight. Bothma, who is white, echoes the popular sentiment  from athletes -- why hold us responsible for a political system we can do  nothing about?    ""I don't see how hurting me, not allowing me to run against the best 400-meter  hurdlers in the world, is going to help anything,"" she said. ""If they don't  want the white sportsmen to take part, why don't they take the black man? We  would love to see it.    ""You get a feeling, a kind of anger towards people who sit around a table in  their little suits and look at a little bit of paper and say, 'South Africa,  no.' They don't know what it's like to be a sportsman, to struggle, to work.  They can decide my future.    ""One day, I wish I was a fly with a sting. I could sit in that boardroom with  the (International Olympic Committee) in their meeting. When they decide not to  let South Africa compete, I would give them one sting, to make them think what  are they doing. I think they see the issue as something on a piece of paper,  not people.""

0,FT943-15505 ,"FT943-15505 _AN-EGHDJAFRFT 940708   FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diouf makes a vigorous start to FAO reform - John Madeley talks to the new director-general of the United Nations' food and agriculture agency      By JOHN MADELEY   Mr Jacques Diouf of Senegal, the first African to lead the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, is planning the most radical shake up of the agency since it was formed in 1945. The FAO is both the largest UN agency and largest international organisation dealing with food and agricultural issues. Six months after taking over as its director-general, Mr Diouf called for urgent action to tackle the serious food problems in Africa and for FAO to be re-invigorated, 'making it more effective in a renewed war on hunger and malnutrition'. With a two-year budget of Dollars 673m, the agency has come in for criticism for its bureaucracy and for basing professional staff mostly at its Rome headquarters. But after years of little change, staff are heading out of Rome, meetings are being cut and some Dollars 40m of the budget has been re-allocated to field-orientated programmes for 'food security and preventive measures against pests and diseases', says the new director-general. He wants more of the FAO's money to be used to help increase the availability of food in areas where it is short, with the emphasis on sustainable production. A 'war on hunger' needs to waged, Mr Diouf stresses, especially in 78 low-income, food-deficit countries, 45 of them African. 'Governments of developing countries will have to adopt efficient policies and programmes to foster agricultural production. They need to re-allocate the means to invest in agriculture and rural development,' he says. But production is only part of the problem, Mr Diouf points out, calling for 'a frontal attack on poverty to be be launched to allow the rural poor to have the income needed to buy food'. He has urged international financing institutions to redirect their funds in favour of the agricultural and rural sector in the form of investment for basic infrastructure. As part of the FAO shake up, a special programme to support food security in food-deficit countries has been launched, with a new department of sustainable development being set up, together and a technical co-operation department to 'enable FAO to be more responsive to the needs of its members', says Mr Diouf. A new division has been set up to deal with with the advancement of women 'who,' the director-general points out, 'produce well over 50 per cent of the developing world's food'. In addition a new Agriculture and Economic Development Analysis Division has been established to improve the agency's analysis of macro- and micro-economic issues. Nearly 200 of FAO's 1,500 Rome-based experts are being relocated to Third World national offices, which are also being reinforced with local expertise  -'a new approach to the problem', claims Mr Diouf. He warns that a food crisis is emerging in eastern Africa, with 34m people threatened by famine, and that 'the situation is worsening dramatically in some parts of the sub-continent. 'We should act in such a way as to avoid the regular occurrence of famine, due to drought in particular, and make sure that we deal with the problem of water management,' he says. 'In Africa, we have to ensure that the 5,100bn cubic metres of water from rivers that go to the sea every year are controlled and used for the benefit of the agricultural producer. Without water control, there is no production'. FAO intends to launch projects, Mr Diouf says, that will show that even where there is drought 'we are able to have adequate protection'. 'We will prepare bankable projects for the infrastructure needed, and hope that through this process, and also by convincing governments of water management, adequate resources will be invested'. With global population projected to rise by 50 per cent in next 30 years, Mr Diouf points out that land availability per person is already declining 'and will decline further. There is less land for more people, and a tendency for farmers to move to marginal lands. Some areas will be used more intensively. If there is no technological breakthrough that allows the population to produce more yet preserve the value of the land, there is no solution'. He believes that alongside policies to ensure that population growth rates are lowered through the improvement of the economic conditions, 'we in agriculture have the responsibility to ensure that there are technologies which are more efficient, yet respect the environment. That is the only way'.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.     PEOP  People.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

0,FT932-8981 ,"FT932-8981 _AN-DEPANAE5FT 930515   FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Africa - my own private tryst list - Michael Holman discloses the names of special hotels that he trusts for assignations      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   THE SULTAN'S band no longer plays outside the English Club in Zanzibar. It used to, every Thursday evening, according to my guidebook. But that was published in 1952, when the island was a British protectorate. Some 30 years later I sat on the balcony of the club and watched the dhows drift by at sunset. The band stopped playing at independence in December 1963. The club had become the Africa House Hotel, its past revealed by the battered snooker table and a faded sign pointing to the 'Ladies Powder Room'. As in many of my favourite African hotels, ghosts seemed to walk the club's corridors and prop up the bar. Like the club, the hotels usually have high ceilings and creaky fans, mosquito nets and wide verandas. The bedroom keys have worn wooden tags, the cast-iron baths rest on clawed feet, and the bar has trophies of long-forgotten tournaments. They are on my idiosyncratic African tryst list: scenes of assignations with companions real or imagined. Hotels where, by chance or design, I have met up with a friend; or which were my destination in a search for the past. Most of them are - or were in their heyday - tourist hotels in the conventional sense, either set amid spectacular scenery or near man-made marvels. They still provide hospitality, though many show the strains of the continent's crisis. But my judgment of their appeal is flawed, distorted by that narcotic nostalgia, or by the strange juxtapositions of life as a journalist in Africa. Being a witness to poverty and distress and then retreating to comfort and security; or simply thankful to have survived a long car journey or bumpy flight, accentuates the pleasures of the senses. Never has chablis tasted so good as at the Hotel de la Gare in Lubumbashi, southern Zaire, in the wake of one the abortive uprisings against President Mobutu. Nor has my thirst been slaked so well as by the cold beer served on arrival at the Mweya Safari Lodge, high above Lake Edward in eastern Uganda, at the end of a fraught and dusty journey from Kampala, not long after Idi Amin's downfall. Seldom have I enjoyed my Davidoff cigar more than on the lawn of the hotel at Bahar Dar on the banks of Lake Tana in central Ethiopia. On the horizon was one of the lake's ancient island monasteries, some dating back to the 13th century. The monks still observed age-old rituals of meditation and prayer. Other unsung wonders of Africa are served by the hotels on my list. War made some of them well-nigh inaccessible for most visitors. Peace has since brought them within reach, although they remain hard to get at for all but the determined visitor, who will have to brave pot-holed roads and endure rickety aircraft. The modest hotel in Lalibela, in northern Ethiopia, overlooks a wondrous spectacle - 12 churches hewn out of solid rock over 800 years ago. From the Gohar hotel, high in the hills that surround Gondar in north-eastern Ethiopia, one looks down in the valley with the 17th century castle of Emperor Fasiladas. At the window of a dilapidated hotel I watched dawn break over Mozambique island, where Vasco da Gama's ships cast anchor in 1498. Sunrise revealed a 16th century Portuguese town, transplanted to the east African coast and frozen in time. It was the capital of Mozambique until the end of the last century; now it is a crumbling relic of 400 years of colonial rule. The upper floor view from the hotel on the island of Goree, off Dakar, Senegal, takes in the picturesque harbour as well as a neglected monument to Africa's holocaust - the island's slave house, the last staging post in a terrible journey. The slave trade has been called the greatest forced migration in the history of man. Between 1650 and 1850, the period when the trade flourished, some 12m slaves were landed in the Americas, according to one estimate. It is calculated that 2m perished on the journey and 7m died before embarkation. Their ghosts can be found on Goree. Some of my favourite hotels are long gone, like old Meikles Hotel in Harare, which had high ceilings and wide red-polished verandas. Some are preserved and thriving: the Mount Nelson Hotel, for example, in the shadow of Cape Town's Table Mountain. Union Castle passenger liners used to carry hotel guests across the Atlantic from Southampton, a two-week voyage I did as a child. They now step off a 12-hour flight from London; but the hotel still recalls an era past and residents write postcards home from escritoires in a stately lounge. Some have evocative names, like the Mountain of the Moons Hotel, Fort Portal, in western Uganda, overlooking the Ruwenzori Mountains. Others have powerful associations, like the hotel in Stanleyville, now Kisangani, on the bend in the Congo river made famous by V S Naipaul's classic novel. They were terrible times in the Congo in the 1960s. The Belgian Congo, now Zaire, was in bloody post-independence upheaval. The country symbolised anarchy: a confusing battlefield of communists, nationalists, secessionists, mercenaries and United Nations troops. Belgian refugees streamed across the border with Northern Rhodesia. To the whites of neighbouring Southern Rhodesia, it seemed a harbinger of their own fate. Schoolboy memories of Stanleyville, whose reverberations reached me in my home in Gwelo, Rhodesia, would have been enough in themselves to draw me to the city. But my interest was whetted by the recollections of journalists who covered the Congo, equipped with Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriters, and who filed by cable. Some ended their careers in Salisbury, ancient mariners telling tales of expense claims on a heroic scale. It was not until 1985 that I made my pilgrimage. The hotel had become a pit-stop for trans-Africa safaris, but the ghosts were there. Other hotels on my list I arrived at by chance. Like the Karibu Hotel near Goma, in eastern Zaire, with a wine list that harked back to the days when coffee exports flourished and French fashions and Belgian chocolates were in the town's high street windows. I was stranded at the airport one minute, the next minute rescued by the local coffee baron and drinking champagne on the banks of Lake Kivu. The crisp air and the mountainous scenery were a world away from the steamy heat and seamy intrigue of Kinshasa. Even Fanta orangeade tasted special in the Restaurant Ca Depend, off the main road from the airport to Goma. It was served with engaging informality, the proprietress nonchalantly uncapping the bottle with her teeth, plonking it down on the red-and-white check tablecloth, and chewing the cap reflectively as she moved back behind the counter. Some while ago I added the Pointe Venus Hotel on the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues to my tryst list. A wood-slatted verandah surrounds an elegant but fading colonial residence, one of the first built on the island, and perched above Port Mathurin. But closest to my heart is the Kuchawe Inn, on Malawi's Zomba Plateau. It is a 30-minute drive from Zomba, the sleepy former colonial capital. The rooms are on the very lip of the plateau, each with its own balcony. I recall morning tea while looking down on hawks circling in the valley; fresh strawberries; an idyllic lake; cows as sleek as if they lived in Switzerland; and walking in the plateau's cool forest with the ghosts of old Malawi and a companion by my side.

0,FT923-1945 ,"FT923-1945 _AN-CIUDDAABFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (14): A continent drifts into crisis - Natural and man-made disasters, disease and debt are racking Africa / Poverty and Hunger      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   'THE challenge facing Africa is exceptional . . . the cost of failure would be appalling,' warned the World Bank nearly three years ago. The challenge - to reverse the economic decline of the region - turned out to be overwhelming, and the cost of failure is proving catastrophic. Without a combination of further debt relief, additional resources assisted by better management, and an upturn in the world economy, recovery in the foreseeable future is out of reach. Today sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 500m people, is racked by natural and man-made disasters, disease and the burden of foreign debt exceeding Dollars 175bn. From Somalia to Zaire, from Mozambique to Sudan, economies and social structures are collapsing, symptoms of the continent's seemingly irreversible decline. In its seminal analysis of the continent's plight - Sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth - the bank said that 'overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago'. To register 'a modest improvement in living standards', the report calculated, 'sub-Saharan economies must grow by at least 4 to 5 per cent annually'. Highly ambitious, given the region's past performance, the report's authors acknowledged, 'but we believe it can be achieved'. Nothing like that target has been reached, and nor does the bank's own forecast of growth in the 1990s suggest that it will be attained in the years to come. Aggregate GDP for sub-Saharan Africa rose by 1.3 per cent in 1990, and around 2.4 per cent in 1991: 'Not sufficient, in the context of Africa's high population growth rate (3.2 per cent),' observes the bank's 1992 annual report, 'to prevent per capita income from falling 0.6 per cent.' Earlier this year the bank was expecting growth of 3.4 per cent in 1992  - now being revised downward as the full affects of drought and a weak international economy are taken into account - and projected an average annual growth for the period 1990-2000 of 3.5 per cent. 'By 2,000, per capita gain in real income will be minimal for the region as a whole', warned the bank in its report, Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries, 'and may be negative in some countries.' 'Although relief can be expected from real increases in commodity prices and debt and debt service reduction measures,' the report continued, sub-Saharan Africa's limited stock of capital in equipment, infrastructure, and human resources precludes any sharp improvements in living standards.' Behind this detached analysis lies a tragedy of a dimension only partly revealed by some of the grim statistics carried in the bank's annual report. It calculates the number of poor at 228m - more than half sub-Saharan Africa's population. Per capita income of Dollars 340 in 1990 is 'exceeded by all the world's regions except South Asia'. For many of the poor, their hold on life is tenuous. War and drought have left 21m people at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa. In southern Africa, enduring its worst drought this century, some 19m people need food aid. But what the statistics conceal is the extent to which the infrastructures and institutions have been disintegrating, leaving a generation of Africans without the resources to implement blueprints for recovery. With few exceptions, civil services are inefficient, schools and universities ill-equipped, and management weak. Whether the existing levels of aid can be sustained in the 1990s is open to doubt. Africa's worries that concessional assistance might be diverted to eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, are valid, acknowledges the bank: 'Unless donors' aid budgets are increased,' it warns, 'other developing countries may be affected.' No significant help is likely in the form of external investment. One of the most telling yardsticks of the loss of confidence in sub-Saharan Africa is the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Official figures show that non-oil exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa received on average less than Dollars 0.5bn a year during the second half of the 1980s - 'roughly what Papua New Guinea alone attracted during the same period', a UN report wryly notes, and concludes: 'The low levels of FDI flowing to Africa underline the increasing marginalisation of the region.' Meanwhile, the spectre of Aids hangs over a continent already debilitated by malaria, bilharzia, guinea worm and other parasitic diseases. Estimates of the impact of Aids vary, but a conference last December in the Senegalese capital Dakar was told that even at the most conservative official estimates of the infection rate, at least 25 per cent of Africa's workforce could be affected by 2010. One in every 40 adults in Africa is already infected with the HIV virus that causes Aids. These victims are part of Africa's economic engine - 15 to 49-year-old farmers, mine workers, even the educated elite. Research presented at the conference on Aids in Africa found that the labour-intensive agricultural and mining industries, the two pillars of the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, are already suffering the impacts of Aids. Some economists warn that the Aids pandemic poses a threat of unprecedented economic disruption as the disease takes its toll. Some experts forecast that Aids will kill 5m or more adults in the next eight years. African officials argue that the world has a stake in helping their countries stem a disease that could, they fear, cripple the key economic sectors of the continent. 'Africa must not be abandoned,' says Dr Kekoura Kourouma, head of Guinea's national Aids programme. 'Remember, a sick population will not be able to work, will not be able to pay its debts.' Whether such an appeal to self-interest in the west will have a greater impact than humanitarian appeals remains to be seen. What seems certain is that the worst of Africa's anguish may be yet to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GROWTH OF REAL PER CAPITA INCOME IN HIGH INCOME AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (average annual percentage change of real per capita GDP)                    1960-70   1970-80   1980-90   1990    1991  1990-2000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All developing    countries           3.3       3.0       1.2   -0.2    -0.2       2.9 Sub-Saharan Africa     0.6       0.9      -0.9   -2.0    -1.0       0.3 East Asia              3.6       4.6       6.3    4.6     5.6       5.7 South Asia             1.4       1.1       3.1    2.6     1.5       3.1 Latin America          2.5       3.1      -0.5   -2.4     0.6       2.2 Middle East and     North Africa       6.0       3.1      -2.5   -1.9    -4.6       1.6 Eastern Europe         5.2       5.4       0.9   -8.3   -14.2       1.6 All high income   countries            4.1       2.4       2.4    2.1     0.7       2.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: The former Soviet Union is not included in the totals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank data  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page XIV  "

In reply to a question as to what led Iran to decide to  establish ties with South Africa, Mahdavi says: ""It should noted  that diplomatic ties have not been established with South  Africa. After the elections in April 1994, when the deprived  and suffering people of South Africa have attained their rights  and taken over the management of the country, we will, God  willing, establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. But what  was recently approved in the country and brought to the  attention of the people was the lifting of the restrictions we  had on our economic ties with South Africa.""    Mahdavi then comments on the events leading to the  forthcoming free elections and abrogation of apartheid in South  Africa.    On the reason for Iran's decision, he says: ""What led us to  decide to establish economic ties with South Africa was, first,  the recent events in South Africa and, second, the direct  request of the combative groups in South Africa, who wrote to us  and asked us to lift the restrictions on trade with South  Africa. However, we have deferred the establishment of  diplomatic ties, which will be the main basis of relations  between our country and South Africa, until after the elections,  when every black person has attained his rights there.""    Asked about Western media propaganda about Iran's u-turn in  its policy on Israel and South Africa, Mahdavi says: ""They,  themselves, know that they are not being truthful and that what  they are saying is not correct. We have declared our stance on  these two from the start. About South Africa, we said that when  racism is abolished there and the oppressed and innocent people  of South Africa take over power -- on the basis of one man one  vote -- we would establish diplomatic and economic ties with  that country. And we are moving in that direction now.  However, our stance on the Zionist regime has been clear from  the start. His holiness the imam said that the Zionist regime  must be destroyed. Yes, when the Zionist regime is destroyed  and the people of Palestine take over power, our relations with  the people of Palestine -- which is now occupied, but will then  be free -- will be established.""

Armed conflicts, which  have a destructive effect on international stability, social and  ethnic upheavals, massive famine and pandemic diseases,  terrorism and the narcotics business, are threats on a global  scale and objectively cannot but affect the interests and  security of other regions and states, Russia included.    The contemporary world, and above all the  industrially-developed countries, are faced with the growing  realization that one can hardly isolate oneself from the  problems of the African continent, which are already leading to  an increase in the influx of emigrants from Africa to Europe and  other regions: such as, the growth of Islamic extremism; and the  spread of diseases, including AIDS. It is no coincidence that in  this connection Prime Minister of France Balladour stated, that  the interests of his country ""are suffering greatly from African  crises, whether it is a question of development of trade,  reliable supply of raw materials, the dangers of uncontrolled  emigration, or conflicts which threaten to upset the balance of  power on the entire continent.""[.sup]1[/]    Obviously, for these same reasons, Russia too cannot wall  herself off from Africa behind the palisades of her own  difficulties. The moreso since, while acting judiciously and  with knowledge of affairs; and while structuring relationships  with the African states on a genuine, mutually advantageous  basis, with equal rights, without the previous distortions in  the ideological and military sphere--it is possible that  cooperation with Africa, which is still a rich and independent  region despite its severe crisis, can be put to use in  overcoming our own specific problems.    At the very same time, if we withdraw from Africa, we are  then in essence acknowledging our inability to engage in  positive, constructive cooperation, and we are confirming the  opinion which is still heard from time to time, that our policy  in Africa was founded merely on the negative values of the ""cold  war.""    The warm breeze of change, which is breaking up the ice of  many years of confrontation in the world, is blowing over Africa  as well. Many countries on this continent have set about making  democratic transformations: elections have been held on a  multi-party basis, fundamental rights of citizens have been  proclaimed, and more attention is being devoted to human rights.  The changes taking place in the world, and in African states as  well, along with those transformations which are being carried  out in Russia, force us to look anew at the development of  Russo-African relations as well. A thorough ""inventory"" must be  made of the experience of our over 30 years of ties, singling  out all that is of value and useful, and decisively rejecting  the approaches which were dictated by the market conditions and  ideological considerations of the past.    At the same time one can properly set the priorities in our  relations with Africa, discover the most promising areas for  cooperation, and determine the circle of reliable partners, only  on the basis of precise analysis and forecasting of the economic  and political development of African countries, taking into  consideration those factors which have decisive influence on the  formation of a political and economic climate both for the  African continent as a whole, and for the individual  countries.[passage omitted]    I believe that it is also in the Russian interest,  especially  in the economic plane, not to lose sight of the potential of  Africa as our partner, the more so since we have already  established a firm foundation for cooperation in our relations  with many African countries.    For the most part, future Russo-African relations are seen  precisely in all-round development of mutually-advantageous  economic ties; however, it will hardly be possible to achieve  this until military-political stability is assured on the  African continent, and until the prerequisites are established  for stable socio-economic development. Orienting herself on the  prospects which lie in the plane of economic and trade  relations, Russia, employing political means, will strive to  support the processes of democratization in Africa, and will  take part in settling existing conflicts and forestalling  potential conflict.    Within the framework of the given approach, we should  obviously focus special attention on activating political ties  with this continent. At the same time, it is necessary to pay  attention to its specific nature, when quite often cooperation  in all other sectors depend upon the level of political  relations and with establishing contacts with the leadership of  a country. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the ruling  circles of many African states still take a cautious attitude  toward the political processes and reforms in Russia, lack  confidence in their successful outcome, and doubt that our  country, at the present stage, is capable of playing a  definitive role in the international arena.    African leaders, as practical experience shows, apart from  discussing questions of bilateral relations, are prepared for  dialogue with us on a broad range of problems associated with  strengthening international peace and security, and primarily  among those who are either directly influencing the situation on  their continent, or who are promoting the acceleration of  positive global transformations. From this point of view certain  directions in Russo-African interaction are seen to be  promising, such as certain aspects of disarmament, creation of  nuclear-free zones, formation of regional security systems,  strengthening international mechanisms for forestalling and  settling conflicts, and formation of an international economic  climate that is beneficial for Russia and Africa as well.    The political assistance of Russia to settlement of the  basic  ""hot spots"" of Africa, to include support in the UN Security  Council, is directed toward fulfilling the global mission of  assuring a more secure world. We also consider this assistance  an important part of our political partnership with the African  countries, which strengthens the basis for mutually-advantageous  cooperation with them.    Russia is taking a most active part in the Angolan  settlement, and together with the United States and Portugal is  joining a ""troika"" of observers over the process of carrying out  the Bisesskiy (Lisbon) Agreements (May, 1991). Russian military  and civilian observers have been sent under UN auspices to a  number of other conflict zones in Africa (Mozambique, Liberia,  Somalia and Rwanda).    On the whole it is obvious that in analyses of the prospects  for stabilization of the situation in the ""hot spots"" of Africa  and around them, one should avoid excess optimism. In this  connection, Russian proposals made at the 48th Session of the UN  General Assembly are considered timely ones. The essence of  these proposals is--to establish within a United Nations  framework additional mechanisms which will permit significantly  increasing the success rate for peacemaking operations, to  include the African continent as well.    Experience in operations in support of peace implemented by  the international community on the African continent is  important for us, for application to Russia's own efforts on the  territory of the former USSR.    At the same time, while cooperating with the West on the  African continent, one should proceed from the fact that the  commonality of approaches noted for a number of problems does  not at all signify that they are completely identical. Russia  must operate above all in consideration of her own national  interests, as well as the reality of the multipolar world that  is taking shape.    In spite of a certain slump in the sphere of trade and  economic relations, prospects for developing cooperation with  Africa exist, and above all in the extraction of minerals; in  geology; and in construction, fisheries, woodworking and  agriculture. Constructing and utilizing major new  facilities--such as the bauxite extraction complex in Dian-Dian  (Guinea); expanding the scale of independent activities of state  and commercial structures; setting up joint enterprises;  establishing new zones for trade and economic activities, for  example, in Namibia and the South African Republic--can  genuinely raise the overall qualitative level and scale of  Russia's economic ties with Africa.    The interests of Russia are served not only by maintaining,  but also by expanding existing ties. It is at the same time  necessary to purposefully and consistently place them on a new  basis: to establish multi-level forms of cooperation with the  countries which remain, chiefly for ideological motives, beyond  the sphere of our attention. At the same time we should above  all examine the possibilities for developing relations with  those states which represent a promising market for acquiring  Russian products, or suppliers of the goods and raw materials  which we need.    Intensification of Russo-African interaction will to a large  extent also depend upon transition to new forms and methods of  cooperation--granting of licenses and know-how, rental of  machinery and equipment, collaboration between industrial  sectors, and scientific-production cooperation.    In recent years, while overcoming significant difficulties,  the processes of integration have intensified in Africa. One may  quite confidently assume that in the future, inter-African  economic cooperation, aimed at the creation of an African  economic community and regional economic structures, will become  more significant. Such intentions have already appeared very  vividly in a number of regions on the continent.    Russian foreign economic structures could also take  advantage  of trends for integration in Africa for increasing her own  exports to the corresponding markets, which will apparently be  expanding as a result of the aforementioned trends. Our  participation is possible at the level of enterprises,  investment banks, and in the form of joint ventures.    In resolving African problems of development, for the  continent as a whole, for subregions and countries, Russia is  devoting significant attention to the role of the UN Economic  Commission for Africa [ECA] and, in particular, to the fact that  ECA could stimulate and attribute a truly international  character to its programs in such areas as transportation, power  engineering, development of natural resources, and environmental  protection, as well as support of small and mid-level  entrepreneurship.    Russian organizations are completely capable of  participation  in implementing projects within the framework of the second  decade of industrial development in Africa and the second decade  of transport and communication of the UN's ECA. It would appear  that Russo-African cooperation, taking into consideration the  peculiarities of the continent, could promote the solution of  problems of employment and the development of facilities in the  infrastructure; and could have as its ultimate goal the  involvement to the fullest of African countries in the system of  international division of labor on a fair basis.    An important element of bilateral relations between Russia  and countries of Africa, which requires a weighty and  well-thought-out approach, is the problem of their obligations  for credits issued by the former USSR. In terms of state credits  alone, the volume of indebtedness of sub-Saharan African  countries amounts to nearly $14 billion. The situation is  aggravated by the fact that the domestic political situation in  many of the countries which are the principal debtors is  unstable, and the economy is in a state of crisis. Therefore,  the task consists of finding ways and means of restoring the  debts, without straining political relations, and without  breaking existing mutually-advantageous ties.    It is most important to proceed from the fact that the  search  for solution of this problem must not rest on narrow  departmental considerations. It is necessary to take into  account all aspects of political and commercial-economic  relations with each country, individually. The question of  indebtedness should be examined comprehensively, employing  various strategies: partial payment in freely-convertible  currency and local currency, compensation for debt by deliveries  of goods, or reinvestment; taking things one step at a time,  using part of the debt for covering the expenses of Russian  missions, and so on.    The sphere of military-technical cooperation remains an  important link in Russia's foreign policy and economic ties with  Africa. This form of interaction appears to be quite promising  in the context of increasing its profitability and placing it on  an exclusively commercial basis. A number of African states have  an appropriate degree of interest in this.    One must not fail to consider that a prolonged pause in the  given sphere of relations with Africa can have a negative effect  on Russian interests; since the vacuum formed as a result of  breaking military-technical ties with the Soviet Union, and then  with Russia as well, is being energetically filled by other  countries--including those which produce weapons under Russian  licenses, of greatly inferior quality than that which Russia  herself could offer. It is evident, incidentally, that Russian  arms deliveries should not appear in regions of existing and  potential armed conflicts, nor in countries with openly  dictatorial regimes.    Apart from solving the urgent problems cited above,  developing stable relations with African countries demands  long-term humanitarian and political investment in the future of  our ties. In this context one should, obviously, be thinking  about the possibility of continuing, in modern conditions, the  training of African national cadres in the VUZ's of our country.  Such a practice provides its own positive results. It is another  matter, that this cooperation should be for the most part placed  on a compensatory basis. At the same time it should remain  advantageous and attractive for our African partners as well.    The question of future Russo-African relations continues to  attract the attention of the Russian and world community. Today,  it is true, few people doubt whether or not we need Africa in  general. On this account, it would appear that at last a  more-or-less unified point of view is taking shape--Yes, it is  necessary, since Russia, even with her present difficulties,  cannot allow herself the luxury of turning her back on Africa,  nor to all the other regions of our planet. Russia must assure  herself a fitting role in the world balance of influence, and in  the multilateral processes for regulating the world economy and  international relations.    By preserving all that is rational in bilateral political,  economic and cultural ties with Africa; applying to them content  appropriate to the realities of today; and by developing  cooperation in new directions, to include those countries which  previously lay beyond the bounds of our active policy, Russia  will support her own state interests, and will obtain greater  freedom in the choice of foreign policy alternatives. In this  manner the prerequisites will be laid down for more solid  positions for our country, not only on the African continent,  but in the world arena as a whole.  Footnotes    1.

However, Standard and Poor's, the other big US agency, awarded a lower rating. Mr Chris Liebenberg, South Africa's minister of finance, last night welcomed Moody's Baa3 rating, saying it demonstrated 'confidence in the coherence of the economic policies and political stability brought to the country by the government of national unity'. He noted that Standard and Poor's, which awarded a BB or sub-investment grade rating, had also said it saw a 'positive outlook' for the country. South Africa had been seeking an international credit rating since April's elections brought President Nelson Mandela's government to power. However, its first formal rating, from the European agency IBCA, was a disappointing BB, putting it on a par with countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Officials said they were pleased with Moody's higher rating, which rates South Africa ahead of both Mexico and India. Moody's said the rating was based on the country's low external debt, and on the commitment by the new government to redirect spending to a comprehensive development programme while reducing the public sector deficit. Mr Carlos Cordeiro, a partner with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank which is advising the government, said he was 'delighted' with the rating. It would allow South Africa to 'access a wider range of capital around the world', he said. South Africa has borrowed money in European markets without an official rating, but yesterday's news will permit it to re-enter the US market. In its June budget, the government said it would raise R1.8bn (Dollars 504.8m) from the international capital markets in the current financial year. External debt has been paid down in net terms since 1985, when international banks refused to roll over loans to the republic, in response to political unrest. South Africa's return to the international bond markets could be in the form of a global bond of around Dollars 500m, said Mr Liebenberg, Reuter adds from Madrid. However, Mr Liebenberg, in Madrid for the IMF/World Bank meeting, said that no firm decisions had been made and it was up to the markets to set the parameters for the issue. He said that apart from the global format, South Africa was considering a plain eurobond and even a yankee bond.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     ESZ  Spain, EC.

This  was what Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party  committee, prominently stressed during his investigation and  study activities in Qihe on 23 May.    Jiang Chunyun has regarded Qihe as an area that he keeps in  contact with while dealing with his work. Over the past year,  he has established profound ties with the local people there.    On the morning of 23 May, Jiang Chunyun went to (Dayang)  Village of (Xiaozhou) Township. He successively visited the  homes of Villagers (Yang Ailin) and (Yang Meilin) and the  vegetable growing areas in (Dayang) Village. He asked them  about their vegetable planting and marketing situation as well  as their income. He suggested that they should achieve not only  production but also marketing.    Jiang Chunyun also visited the fine wheat seed cultivating  base in (Dayang) village to understand the wheat and cotton  growing situation.    He said: Cotton is a major advantage of the northern and  western areas of Shandong Province as well as a pillar of the  rural economy. So, we should exert great efforts to grasp cotton  production. After that, he went to the construction site of the  on-going (Huajiao) road; called on the personnel who were  engaging themselves in the construction work, including the  cadres of the provincial agricultural commission, the provincial  personnel affairs department, the provincial radio and  television department, and the provincial (?export) company who  take on jobs in Qihe; and also wielded a shovel to join the  labor.    He earnestly said to these cadres: Promoting a coordinate  development of the eastern and western parts of the province and  seeking common wealth is a major task that the province should  make efforts to fulfill. Helping the people in less developed  areas turn poverty into wealth as soon as possible is an  unshirkable duty of the party cadres and the people's public  servants. So, we should firmly foster the purpose of serving  the people, have a profound feeling to do more concrete deeds  for the people, and make contributions to rejuvenating the  economy in these areas and bringing about happiness to the  people there.    After hearing the reports made by the leaders of Dezhou  Prefecture and Qihe County, Jiang Chunyun urged that Dezhou  Prefecture and Qihe County should take the lead in narrowing the  gaps with the eastern areas and turning poverty into wealth as  soon as possible.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out that to deepen reform, we should  implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee, focus on setting up the socialist  market economic system, promote overall reform, and make a key  breakthrough.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should persist in the principle  of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are  tough and actually ensure to grasp both material and spiritual  civilizations and to make achievements in these two aspects.

0,FT933-858 ,"FT933-858 _AN-DI0BZAC3FT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / Personal View: Private sector key to Africa's future      By LEWIS T PRESTON   The Financial Times's recent supplement on sub-Saharan Africa ('Africa; A continent at stake', September 1) performed a service for everyone concerned with development. At a time when the world's attention is diverted to the dramatic changes taking place in other areas, it is vital that the magnitude of the development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa is not forgotten. Half the region's 600m people live in absolute poverty. It is the only region where the number of poor people would - if current trends are not reversed - increase by the year 2000, where population is doubling every 20 years, and external debt exceeds gross domestic product. Indeed, the future of the continent is 'at stake'. However, Africa is also changing. We are all familiar with the evolving political transformation in South Africa. Not so well known is the fundamental change in economic policies which has been taking place across much of sub-Saharan Africa. This has been a 'quiet revolution', with more than 30 countries undertaking adjustment programmes aimed at increasing productivity and growth. The intensity and success of their reforms have varied, and more time will be required before definitive results emerge. However, there are signs of progress. Benin, Burundi, the Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda are among a group of countries - supported under a special programme of assistance co-ordinated by the World Bank - that has achieved growth rates double the region's average, tripled output in the critical agricultural sector, and reversed the decline in exports. There remains a long way to go. But these results indicate that in Africa - as in East Asia or Latin America - adjustment to economic realities produces economic results. Now is not the time for Africa to slow down its reform efforts. On the contrary, they must be accelerated. Many countries have taken the first macroeconomic steps. Africa now needs to underpin them with a 'second generation' of reforms - to encourage the private sector, and to build its human and institutional capacities. About 350m new jobs will be needed in sub-Saharan Africa within a generation. Only the private sector - free to allocate resources and respond to market signals - can create employment and incomes on this scale. And only the private sector can provide Africa with the access it needs to investment, know-how and technology. The message is clear: the movement toward a 'market-friendly' approach must be broadened and deepened. It is Africa's only hope of competing in the global economy of the 21st century. Educated and healthy people - and competent institutions - are also essential. In this regard providers of aid to Africa have a major responsibility. The international community needs to re-examine the quality of its assistance effort - and its overall development effectiveness. Donors cannot be satisfied that external technical assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has increased over the last decade and now stands at about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) a year. Nor can they be satisfied that an estimated 100,000 expatriate 'advisers' are at work in Africa today, a larger number than at independence. At the same time - and as the FT pointed out - Africa knows that the 'rules of the aid game' have changed in the post-cold war era. The competition for resources has never been greater. Aid budgets are being scrutinised and, in some cases, cut. Countries that cannot show they are using aid effectively - and that means good governance as well as good economic policy - will lose it. The World Bank is one of Africa's strongest supporters in its development efforts. Evidence of this is the wide range of initiatives we have undertaken as well as the volume of our lending. But we don't have all the resources required. And we don't have all the answers. Our partners in the donor community have a crucial role to play. Non-government organisations are vital at the grass roots. And the private sector holds the key to providing the bulk of future investment. However, the principal responsibility for Africa's development rests with Africa and its leaders. They must adopt the right policies, inspire confidence in investors, and motivate their peoples. Many African nations have started to change in the right direction. The international community must support them. The author is president of the World Bank   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

It is a whole new game for a man who spent a good part of  his  ANC career trying to isolate South Africa, and a department  which devoted itself to sanctions-busting and forming ties with  everyone that would have it.    Like all the other ministries under the new government,  South  Africa's foreign policy priorities are dictated by the need to  ensure the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP]  success.    ""Our priority is making sure that the country has a  sustainable, growing economy, otherwise the Reconstruction and  Development Programme will remain an empty theoretical concept,""  Mr Pahad said.    The job of the Foreign Affairs department was to promote and  sell this programme abroad to secure foreign resources as  swiftly as possible.    Mr Pahad firmly ruled out the sale of grand embassies and  art  works as mooted by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The  resources he speaks of are investment, favourable trading terms,  development aid and soft loans.    Given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will  be to increase favourable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union. But, Mr Pahad said, South Africa would also be  looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations  with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India,  the People's Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored was the Middle  East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.    There were also important new friends to consolidate  politically in the context of being the new government. These  would include China, which was sympathetic to the ANC as a  liberation movement, and Russia, whose relationship with the ANC  changed with the collapse of communism at the turn of the  decade. Both these countries are permanent members of the UN  Security Council.    As there were scores of other developing countries on the  lookout for favourable relations with the most important  economic and political blocs -- the EU, NAFTA and the  Association of South East Asian Nations -- SA [South Africa] had  to capitalise on the enormous goodwill that existed since the  successful elections, and keep it going, said Mr Pahad.    South Africa had two aces to play in this regard. The first  was its moral status in the world. The second, its position in  an increasingly marginalised continent.    Despite all gloomy predictions, South Africa became the  example of the ""best miracle of the century"". ""We have captured  the moral high ground in non-racialism, democracy and conflict  resolution to become the world leader in this arena.""    But, more importantly, it had become imperative for the rest  of the world that this success story continued. For if South  Africa were to fail -- and its success depended on consolidating  democracy with economic growth -- there would be serious  consequences for other countries' internal policies on democracy  and racism.    ""They see our success as a godsend to a more healthy  approach  to politics. They want us to succeed."" Another ace was South  Africa's position in the continent of Africa. ""If we don't  sink, they see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the  region doesn't sink they see some hope of a breakthrough in the  development of other parts of Africa.""    This brings him to South Africa's second foreign policy  priority -- its relationship with the southern African region,  which, he says, is fundamental to South Africa's broader  interests.    President Nelson Mandela's reception at the OAU summit this  week as the messiah of the continent highlighted the important  role that South Africa could play in the continent. However,  South Africa will have to be careful to straddle the demands and  expectations of the rest of Africa with pragmatic policies.    Mr Pahad once again has a realistic attitude towards  relations with Africa. ""Unless we can achieve mutually  beneficial development in our region, we will not be able to  tackle effectively our international or regional challenges,"" he  said.    This translates into developing regional co-operation by  joining the SADC [South African Development Community] and  rationalising the many regional institutions like the SA Customs  Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement.    He stops at integration. This was a long-term vision and  would be dictated by the process of co-operation. It would  also be in South Africa's interests to ensure stability in both  the region and the continent. A lot of time would be spent  strengthening OAU mechanisms for conflict resolution.    Mr Pahad sees regional cooperation extending not only to  areas of economic development but to basic issues like  gun-smuggling, drug-peddling, refugees and illegal immigrants.    He distinguished between illegal immigrants and refugees,  the latter which South Africa would deal with according to  internationally accepted conventions. ""But we cannot turn a  blind eye to illegal immigrants. We are going to have to deal  with this in a way that protects the interests of our country.  We must have an effective immigration policy and apply it  justly and humanely.""    It was in this context that regional development became a  priority for SA. ""If you don't have mutually advantageous  regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South  Africa. And, given that our borders are so big, we will not be  able to prevent it"".    On the question of the country's role in the OAU, Mr Pahad  said that with its expertise in many fields South Africa could  help the organisation become a more effective body on the  continent and in the United Nations.    Implicit in this is South Africa's desire to be the first  African country to take a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council.    The government's policy of making new friends and extending  South Africa's profile into uncharted territories would not mean  establishing diplomatic missions everywhere in the world, he  said. This would be dictated by the budget and the national  interest and would entail downscaling some embassies, having one  diplomatic representatives serving several countries, upgrading  priority areas and establishing links with countries with  perceived potential.    One example under debate was the policy towards the People's  Republic of China and Taiwan. He pointed out that, should South  Africa establish diplomatic ties with the PRC, it would have to  forego long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The PRC  was important for South Africa not only because of the enormous  trade potential, but also because it was a permanent member of  the UN Security Council. Taiwan was however, one of South  Africa's largest trading partners.    ""In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our own interests and international precedents.""    Mr Pahad stressed that foreign policy would not be dictated  only by South Africa's interests.    However, establishing friendships and coming to the rescue  of  friends did not necessitate establishing embassies in these  countries. ""There are other forms of interaction and  co-operation.""

Qian told a reception marking the 31st anniversary of  African  Liberation Day hosted by heads of African diplomatic missions in  Beijing that this year's celebration of liberation day has a  special significance, for a new South Africa led by President  Nelson Mandela has just been born. ""It is a victory not only for  the people of South Africa, but also for the peoples in the  whole of Africa,"" he said.    The birth of the new South Africa signifies that the African  people have finally broken the yoke of apartheid and racial  discrimination, and its significance and impact have gone far  beyond the borders of South Africa and the African Continent,  said Qian. ""It is an epoch-making event in the history of human  civilization,"" he added.    Qian expressed his hope that under the leadership of the  South African Government of national unity, the various  political forces in South Africa will strengthen their unity and  cooperation, join hands in building a stable, democratic,  strong, prosperous and racially equal new South Africa, and make  their own contributions to maintaining political independence  and achieving economic revitalization in Africa.    The Chinese foreign minister also extended his  congratulations on the achievements that the African countries  have made in the past 31 years in promoting the process of  economic integration in the continent and in other fields, under  the banner of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).    He praised the OAU for its increasingly important role in  maintaining peace and stability and in settling conflicts and  disputes at regional or national level by good offices of the  OAU.

The drop in the poverty rate - reversing a long trend - comes as the US Congress debates whether Mexico's living standards are rising sufficiently for it to join in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The study, conducted by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Mexican government, found 13.6m Mexicans lived in 'extreme poverty' in 1992, about 16.2 per cent of the population. That is an 8.7 per cent drop from 1989's total of 14.9m people, or 18.9 per cent of the population. The fall came despite a growth in Mexico's population; between 1984 and 1989 the poorest segment of the population grew by 6.3 per cent annually, said Mr Pedro Sainz, director of the study. 'More Mexicans than ever have improved their ability to feed themselves and meet the basic necessities for their well-being,' the study concluded. Mr Carlos M Jarque, head of the Mexican government's National Statistic Institute, said the results were extremely encouraging. President Carlos Salinas has sold off more than 900 state enterprises since taking office in 1988 and mounted a successful assault on inflation. He has vowed to lift Mexico into the ranks of the developed world through Nafta, which would link his country with Canada and the US in a bloc of 362m consumers.   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.

After the first democratic elections in South Africa, it is  not a matter of if, but when and how South Africa will sever  ties with its trading partner Taiwan and establish diplomatic  relations with China, Greg Mills said.    The article said South Africa's ties with Taiwan began in  1977 when Pretoria sought new allies and trading partners in the  wake of the Soweto uprisings and the United Nations arms embargo.    The article said: `In the throes of its own deepening  isolation, Taiwan, on the other hand, saw the opportunity as  providing a further anti-communist ally as well as an expansion  of trade.'    `South Africa's trade with China grew by 170 percent between  1992-93, and it is expected to double again this year.

The article further stated dual recognition was a  non-starter.    `The need to make alternative arrangements with Taiwan  should  not delay a decision on the central political issue. Any  unnecessary delays or crude attempts to devise unique solutions  will only temporarily avoid the inevitable and anger Beijing,'  Greg Mills said.     "

In a move aimed at bringing the country back into the mainstream of the world energy markets, Pretoria solicited bids for licences to explore virtually all the country's coastal areas, divided into 18 blocks. Mr Pik Botha, the former foreign minister, who is now minister of mines and energy, told a launch seminar attended by oil and gas companies in London that his government 'sees this licensing round as a major step forward in exploring our offshore potential. 'We cannot guarantee that you will discover gas or oil or both,' he said. 'But we are setting in motion an intensive - and extensive - process of exploration never undertaken before'. Bids for licences have to be submitted by April next year, and Mr Botha said he hoped to have the allocation process complete by November 1995. Exploration programmes will have to be for a minimum of three years and a maximum of seven. International oil companies were active in South Africa until the early 1970s when most of them withdrew for political reasons. Since then, there has only been a small amount of exploration, mainly by Soekor, the state oil company. South Africa produces a third of its liquid hydrocarbons artificially from coal, and imports certain amounts of oil, mainly from Iran. Mr Botha said yesterday that the tariff protection given to the local oil and gas industry would continue because of its important contribution in saving foreign exchange. But he said South Africa was keen to widen its trade relations with energy-producing nations, and deals were pending with various OPEC countries which he declined to name. So far, 19 companies - 17 of them from abroad - had asked for information packs about the blocks on offer. Mr Botha said he was 'very encouraged' by the attendance at yesterday's seminar, which included many of the world's major oil companies. Asked whether South Africa was more secure than other new energy markets that are opening up, such as Central Asia, Mr Botha said: 'As secure, if not better' because of the well-developed state of South Africa's mining technology and infrastructure. 'I can assure you,' he added, 'that the rules are not only reasonable but will also be stable.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

United States Vice-President Al Gore,  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, Palestinian Liberation  Organisation Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, Tanzanian founding  President Julius Nyerere and more than 80 other leaders arrived  to heap praise on South Africa and its people.    Heading a 65-strong U.S. delegation, the most senior to  visit  South Africa, Mr Gore said the moment was historic not only for  South Africa but for all mankind. The inauguration of African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela marked a transition in  the history of the world, he said. The U.S. civil rights  movement and the struggle for democracy in South Africa were  historically intertwined with both countries sharing the spirit  of the fight for full democracy. ""And so the people of the  United States rejoice with the people of South Africa. We look  forward towards starting a new and more vigorous relationship.  We see the inauguration tomorrow (Tuesday) of Mr Mandela as the  beginning of a partnership between our two countries."" Included  in the us delegation was first lady Hilary Clinton, Mr Gore's  wife Tipper, the Rev Jesse Jackson and U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ron Brown.    On his arrival, Mr Hurd said there has been a huge upsurge  in  British business interest in South Africa. He said he was in  the country to show Britain's support for a new South Africa and  was going directly from the airport to visit British-aided  projects in the East Rand townships.    Croatian Prime Minister Mr Nikica Valentic said South Africa  had shown it was possible to satisfy diverse interests in a  positive way. ""We are a country that has emerged from war. The  message (from South Africa) is political solutions have to be  sought by peaceful means,"" he said.    Former British prime minister Lord James Callaghan said  South  Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he  had a message for this country, Lord Callaghan said: ""South  Africa is going to work out its own destiny.""    Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the struggle  against apartheid had few parallels in modern history. ""We are  confident that under Mr Mandela's sagacious leadership the scars  of the past will soon heal and the goal of peace and development  will be achieved.""    The diminutive Mr Arafat, wearing his traditional black and  white keffiyeh, said he brought greetings from the Palestinian  people ""and best wishes for my brother and friend President  Mandela...and Mr (F W) de Klerk"". He was greeted by ANC  representative Stanley Mabisela who held the PLO leader's hand  as the large delegation strode into the airport building.    Mr Nyerere, once a crusader against colonialism and a  long-time enemy of Pretoria, said he had always wanted to come  to a free South Africa. ""I never believed it would come. But  here it is.""    Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman, who was asked if  his country would be investing in South Africa, said Bangladesh  had no money to invest ""but we will share our knowledge"".    On his arrival, Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen praised  the demise of apartheid as ""a victory for humanity"" and pledged  R375 million [rand] in aid for South Africa's transition. He  said he hoped the two countries would exchange ""experiences"",  expecially in the labour market, and he extended a formal  invitation to Mr Mandela to visit Denmark. The Danish national  soccer team, European champions in 1992, were scheduled to visit  South Africa in 1995, Mr Rasmussen announced. ""This is a most  happy moment in Danish international politics. (It) is the fall  of the Berlin Wall...in human terms...a victory for humanity.""    From Syria to the Bahamas, Italy, Slovakia, Georgia, Malta,  Iran, Malaysia, the Philippines and Romania they continued to  pour into Jan Smuts from dawn and into the night. Other  notables included the Irish President Mary Robinson, Greek King  Constantine and Mr Abdul Rahman Taib who is the Industry  Minister of Brunei, the richest country per capita in the world.  Also among them were European Union Chairman T Pangalos,  Portuguese president Dr Mario Soares, French first lady  Danniella Mitterand, Spanish heir apparent Prince Asturias and  Finland President Mr Martii Ahtisaari [name and title as  received] who is credited with brokering Namibian independence.  The presidents of Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, as  well as Lesotho King Letsie III, were due to arrive later in the  night.    The prize for the biggest present went to the Philippines --  a four-foot square box in colourful wrapping paper and ribbon  reportedly containing shoes for Mr Mandela.    By 6PM there was still no news of the expected appearance of  Libyan Chief Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

Qhobela,  foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, here this afternoon.    During the talks, Qian and Qhobela exchanged views on  bilateral relations and on the international situation.    Qian congratulated the Basutoland Congress Party on its  success in last year's general election and the consequent  establishment of the new government of Lesotho, and wished the  new government well in making new achievements in maintaining  domestic peace and in the construction of the country.    Qian said that the resumption of diplomatic relations  between  China and Lesotho laid a foundation for the development of  bilateral relations, adding that he was confident that the  current visit to China by Qhobela would further promote  bilateral relations and cooperation.    Touching on the situation in the Southern African region,  Qian noted that the first general election without racial  discrimination is to be held in South Africa on April 27, and  that a new South Africa of racial equality is to be set up.    This was the result of the long-term struggles of the South  African nations and peoples, said Qian, and China supports the  peace process in South Africa.    The Chinese vice-premier noted that China is willing to  develop cooperative relations with the new South Africa in  various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Qhobela said that the restoration of diplomatic relations  between Lesotho and China will inject new strength into the  promotion of bilateral relations.    Qhobela invited Qian to visit Lesotho again at his  convenience.    Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as Qian's  guests.     "

Poverty has ""retreated markedly in Tunisia."" This is what  Mr.  Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of Social  Affairs, stated at the national seminar on food and nutrition  policy planning recently organized in Tunis by the Ministry of  Agriculture, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Health  and the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization].    Presenting a study on the present status and the future of  the National Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN), Mr. Ben  Kilani indicated that, based on the threshold calculated by the  National Statistics Institute (INS), ""the underprivileged  percentage dropped from 33 percent in 1967 to 22.2 percent in  1975, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 7.7 percent in 1985, and to  6.7 percent in 1990, representing 82,000 families at present, or  about 544,000 individuals.""    The official commented on the phenomenon, ascribing it to  the  country's economic growth as well as to ""a genuine political  will to fight poverty, which resulted in many programs"" being  implemented.    The officials classified these programs according to their  goals: prevention, integration, or assistance.    For instance, ""some programs specifically geared to the poor  provide direct aid or subsidies and support the creation of  income sources. Others, universal in scope, play a decisive part  in fighting poverty, either by preserving the purchasing power  or by improving living conditions. Others, finally, aim rather  to prevent poverty,"" the official explained.    As a result, during the Seventh Plan (1987-1991), State  expenditures in this respect totaled 18 percent of the GDP, or  D12,140,000. This is a very high figure, the official noted.    Yet, he pointed out, ""the State's efforts to eradicate  poverty go beyond mere operational programs and also take the  form of legislative measures.""    Among these, Mr. Ben Kilani mentioned ""tax exemptions  granted  to lowest income categories and specific benefits with respect  to credit, which result in a considerable loss of revenues for  the State.""    The official also mentioned ""policies with an obvious social  dimension, such as education, vocational training, or family  planning, which have an immediate or deferred impact on the  disadvantaged.""    Direct efforts to assist needy families through regular or  occasional aid are easier to quantify.    As an example of occasional aid for the year 1992, the  official quoted the following figures:     -  D3.606 million were distributed to 40,000 needy families  on the occasion of religious holidays;    -  D15.5 million were distributed at the beginning of the school  year, on behalf of 305,000 students from needy families.    This, of course, was in addition to aid in kind, such as  meals provided by the IFTAR [expansion not given].    As for regular aid, it includes essentially food provided to  poor young students in the most disadvantaged areas. This is  subsidized in part by the World Food Program [WFP], with the  State paying for the rest.    Thus, the official mentioned that 1,350 school cafeterias  currently provide meals for 223,480 primary school students,  i.e.,16.3 percent of all primary school students.    As far as cash is concerned, regular aid is mostly provided  by the PNAFN. It is intended for ""families that are totally  destitute and without resources, large families with limited  resources, and the old or handicapped with no one to support  them.""    In his speech, Mr. Ben Kilani analyzed the PNAFN components,  adding a few recommendations on how to improve its services. The  program, he indicated, covered 101,000 families in 1992. Each  family received on the average D250, i.e., a 178-percent  increase compared with 1987.    [Box, p 3]    A Profile of the Disadvantaged    What are actually the characteristics of Tunisian  disadvantaged populations?    Referring to the 1990 INS survey, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani,  director at the Ministry of Social Affairs, made the following  observations:     -  ""The disadvantaged represent a very variable percentage of  the population, depending on the social class and job category  of the household head: 19 percent among the unemployed active  population, and 2 percent among craftsmen and independent  workers. Actually, in addition to these two categories, poverty  affects nonfarm workers (249,000), farm workers (98,000),  retired and other nonactive individuals (51,000), and farmers  (32,000).""    -  ""Since the last decade, poverty has assumed new  forms; in fact, it has become more urban than rural (67 percent  currently compared with 33 percent during the first two  decades).""    -  ""It affects not only those who cannot work, but also  women and workers in the informal sector.""    -  ""The poverty rate  exceeds 10 percent in the west while remaining below 5 percent  in coastal areas.""

0,FT944-13875 ,"FT944-13875 _AN-EJZDWAA9FT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, NICHOLAS SHAXTON and PETER STANLEY   If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this week. The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades, secure peace. Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400 years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are taking place. It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack, for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and the end of superpower rivalries. In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and external aggression. In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general. Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the 1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of the regional settlement falls into place. And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by newly democratic South Africa. Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves. But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go wrong before the edifice is finally complete. In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat at the polls. Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'. The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms, unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies. The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries. 'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not an opposition in ideological terms.' Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls. Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers. Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of colonialism and 30 years of war. Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the people in Luanda. 'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by October 31. Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991 accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new hatreds. The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups hunted down and killed Unita supporters. The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under the new peace plan, a difficult exercise. The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful, however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale and provide the manpower required. Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds. Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main diamond producing areas. Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for peace. Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent. Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment  -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether. For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to harness the power of South Africa. If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy, the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as the start of a new and more prosperous era.  --------------------------------------------------------       THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including       Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began       in early 1960s.  Portuguese flee, and civil wars       break out.  South African troops invade Angola;       Cuba begins troop build-up.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1976  Mozambique closes border with Rhodesia, where white       minority had unilaterally declared independence       from Britain in 1965.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1976  Guerrilla war in Rhodesia escalates as forces led       by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo infiltrate from       bases in Mozambique and Zambia.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1979  Lancaster House settlement on Rhodesia paves way       for the independent state of Zimbabwe; elections       in 1980 won by Mugabe's Zanu party.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1988  US-brokered deal secures independence for Namibia       from South Africa in return for Cuban troop       withdrawal from neighbouring Angola.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1989  Sam Nujoma, leader of South West Africa People's       Organisation, wins Namibia's independence election.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1990  South Africa releases long-imprisoned black       nationalist leader Nelson Mandela  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991  Ceasefire in Angola civil war.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1992  Angolan elections confirm President Eduardo dos       Santos' MPLA in power, but opposition Unita leader       Jonas Savimbi refuses to accept outcome.  Civil       war resumes.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1992  Ceasefire in Mozambique civil war.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1994  Mandela's African National Congress wins first       all-race elections in South Africa.  --------------------------------------------------------                          ANGOLA  -------------------------------------------------------- The 1974 military takeover in Portugal brought Angolan independence the following year but not peace.  Civil war continuedm exacerbated by South African invasions and the arrival of Cuban troops.  A ceasefire resulted in elections in 1992, with the ruling MPLA defeating the opposing Unita movement.  Unita refused to accept the outcome; war resumed.  Now, peace talks may be close to success.  --------------------------------------------------------                         NAMIBIA  -------------------------------------------------------- A 1988, US-brokered settlement saw the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in return for South African acceptance of multi-party elections in Namibia.  These took place in the following year and were won by the South West Africa People's Organisation, which is still in power.  --------------------------------------------------------                        ZIMBABWE  -------------------------------------------------------- Once the fiefdom of the British South Africa Company, the territory (then Rhodesia) became a British colony at the turn of this century.  The settlers won self government in 1923, unilaterally declared independence in 1965, but bowed to sanctions and guerrilla war in 1979. In 1980 elections, the Zanu party came to power, where it stays today in partnership with the Zapu party.  --------------------------------------------------------                       MOZAMBIQUE  -------------------------------------------------------- As in Angola, independence in 1975 was traumatic, marked by the exodus of more than 200,000 settlers of Portuguese origin and a civil war encouraged first by white Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and then by white South Africa. A 1992 peace pact brought the war to an end.  This Thursday and Friday, 6.5m voters go to the polls in the country's first multi-party elections.  --------------------------------------------------------                     SOUTH AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- More than 350 years after Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck founded a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, white rule and its apartheid racial policies finally gave way in the face of sanctions and domestic opposition with the release from prison in 1990 of Nelson Mandela.  He was elected president of South Africa this year in the country's first all-race elections.  --------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  AOZ  Angola, Africa.

The estimated $20 billion project will be completed in  15 years. Guo Xuyan, president of the Three Gorges project, will  arrive in Brazil next month to visit Itaipu and hold talks with  construction companies and capital goods suppliers (turbines and  electricity generators).    The Brazilian trade offensive is being prepared by the  Itamaraty Trade Promotion Department in reply to the Asian  countries' interest in increasing trade with Brazil. At least  two official Chinese trade missions have visited Brazil in the  past six months, contacting government officials and business  leaders. Currently a mission of 30 Brazilian businessmen is  touring Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia looking for business  deals and partnerships. In May, a business delegation will  accompany President Itamar Franco to the PRC, and in September  another business mission will travel to China, South Korea, and  Indonesia.    Priority    Southeast Asia is one of Itamaraty's priorities. ""It is the  fastest growing region in the world, and China is the largest  country in the region,"" a diplomat said. In the past few years,  trade with China has been increasing at 20 percent annually, and  trade between the two countries surpassed $1 billion in 1993.    Brazil's main interest is to participate in hydroelectric,  mining, and telecommunication projects, as well as in  pharmaceutical industry, software [preceding word in English],  and satellite launching and manufacturing technology deals. Some  deals already are well under way. A Brazilian company will  supply the Chinese Government with digital centrals for rural  telephone systems -- a contract whose negotiations started in  November 1993.    A Sao Paulo enterprise will sell banking automation  equipment  to the PRC. The CBPO, Mendes Junior, Andrade Gutierrez, and Vale  do Rio Doce construction and mining companies already have set  up offices in Beijing. This year Brazil and the PRC will  commemorate 20 years since the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations between the two countries. ""Businesses tend to  increase given the large size of the two countries in the  international context,"" an Itamaraty source said.    South Africa    Another market in which Brazil is interested is South  Africa,  which intends to invest nearly $5 billion in a reconstruction  and development project. A Brazilian business delegation visited  South Africa and returned very optimistic about future business  opportunities. South Africa is a rich country with considerably  developed technology, which is concentrated mainly on the white  minority.    Elections will be held there on 27 April, and African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is expected to win and  introduce a deep transformation in the country.    A Brazilian company closed a deal to export tow trucks, and  other Brazilian companies will participate in the duplication of  telephone circuits, thus expanding telecommunications routes  between the two countries.    According to a diplomatic source, the South African  Government is particularly interested in obtaining intermediary  technology in the fields of steel mills, mining, electricity,  petrochemical, and agribusiness.    Some Brazilian construction companies will be able to  participate in a project to build 1 million low-income houses.  ""In the mid-term, 20 million people, mainly blacks, must become  consumers,"" a diplomat said. In 1993, trade between Brazil and  South Africa was $280 million.     "

All over southern Africa, hundreds of thousands of children die every year from  malaria, yellow fever, influenza, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases.  In Tanzania alone, 250,000 children die every year of sicknesses that in the  Western world have been effectively abolished. Hunger and starvation are  rampant in these countries.

According to testimony during a congressional hearing last year, the United  States sends the bandits of UNITA an estimated $80 million a year in covert aid  to wage their unpopular and futile war of death and destruction.

0,FT943-5342 ,"FT943-5342 _AN-EIECYABNFT 940905   FT  05 SEP 94 / Poverty survey finds gap widening      By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor   Poverty in Britain's cities has become increasingly concentrated in small pockets of deprivation, two reports published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation say. The social research organisation says that the gap between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in cities widened between 1981 and 1991. Most cities have areas where low incomes, unemployment and low levels of car and home ownership are becoming the norm. These are often close to more prosperous areas where people own their own homes and many households have two incomes and two cars. The areas of intense poverty are mostly in the northern cities and inner London, according to an analysis of data in the 1991 census. But less localised poverty is spread over most old industrial areas such as the south Wales valleys, northern England and central Scotland. Ethnic minorities are especially likely to live in high-poverty neighbourhoods. Pockets of wealth are found throughout Britain, with the greatest concentration of prosperous neighbourhoods in the south-east. A second report, comparing Oxford and Oldham, says that even prosperous cities like Oxford have council estates with marked levels of poverty. A quarter of the population of both towns receive means-tested benefits to top up their income. The number of low-income families grew rapidly between 1991 and 1993.

The decision eliminates all economic sanctions against South  Africa with the exception of a blanket ban on the export of  weapons to all countries.    The decision, effective from January 28, will release for  export a range of previously restricted products including  computers and four-wheel-drive vehicles for use by the South  African military and police forces.

""Individual governments have to increase their input and  intensify community involvement in the vaccination programmes,""  said Kebba Jobe, a Gambian participant, said. Speaking before  the start of the seminar Jobe, who manages his country's  expanded programme on immunization, said the Gambia had attained  69 percent immunisation for children aged below one year. He  said donors must continue supporting Gambia to reduce the cost  of vaccines and thereby increase the percentage of immunisation.    A Mauritanian delegate, Dr. Pradbodh Munbodh, said managers  of immunisation programmes in Africa should adopt private sector  working methods to reduce bureaucracy. He told delegates from  South Africa that by 1992, Mauritania had attained vaccination  of between 75 and 80 percent of all pregnant women, 85 percent  of children against measles and 90 percent against diphteria,  whooping cough and tetanus. ""Since you face an enourmous  vaccination task in your country, the best thing is to motivate  the paramedical personnel directly involved in the field,"" he  told Ray Mabope, the African National Congress' (ANC) national  chair on vaccination and immunisation and Bonginkosi Mhlanga of  the Pan-Africanist Congress' (PAC) health directorate. Mabope  said that with its three vaccine manufacturing institutions,  South Africa should be able to vaccinate all its children within  the next few years and become a vaccine supplier to countries in  the southern African development community.    This, he said, would entail rationalising the activities of  the South African Institute for Medical Research, the State  Vaccine Institute and the National Institute of Virology ""to cut  down wastage.""    Mhlanga said that although the South African Government  claimed it had achieved 80 percent immunisation of its children,  ""we have to unify the country first before analysing the  situation in South Africa, especially in the homelands, where  the situation is not clear."" South Africa is due to form its  first democratic government after the country's first non-racial  elections on 26-28 April.    The four-day seminar, which has attracted vaccination  experts  from Africa, Europe and the United States, is to be opened later  today by Cote d'Ivoire's health minister, Maurice Guikahue. The  theme is: ""To build a durable partnership for immunisations for  Africa."" It is the fourth of its kind, after those of Bamako in  1974, Dakar in 1981 and Niamey in 1987.    South Africa, which is taking part for the first time, is  represented by an eight-person multiracial delegation, including  representatives of government and the former liberation  movements -- ANC and PAC.

But his lofty assertion that the newly formed Freedom Alliance's leaders (Inkatha, Conservative party, Afrikaner Volksfront, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei) have poor credentials as demo-crats cannot pass without comment. I will not attempt to claim that Africa produces state-of-the-art, western-style democrats. But as many well-informed South Africa correspondents, human rights campaigners (including Helen Suzman) and political commentators have observed, the two most blatantly undemocratic organisations in South Africa are the ANC-South African Communist party alliance and the ruling National party. It is difficult to determine which of them has the more shameful human rights record or which, in the past, had the firmer resolve to squash free speech or criticism. Many now feel the ANC-SACP alliance is the greater offender, since left-wing 'censorship' is now so virulent. Either way, one wonders what on earth Joe Rogaly is trying to say. He cannot be implying that Nelson Mandela's or President F W de Klerk's democratic credentials are impressive, can he? They are both good public relations men, not democrats.

Next year the country will get 30  million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last  year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization  process, education, ""marginalized"" youth and employment.    This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday  by  Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister  Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The  Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when  a new government has been formed on the basis of the  parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April.    The ministers' document covers political relations, economic  relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with  South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form  would depend above all on developments in the near future. They  have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up  with the country because the Netherlands ""has historical and  cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good  contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight  against apartheid.""    The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship  with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private  organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary  before the end of the year to consult the new South African  Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a  country in transition, and consequently will receive no  large-scale or long-term aid.    Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the  ""South African economy, which in principle is very promising.""  Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment  delegations and -- ""when the time is ripe"" -- more flexible  policies on export credit insurance.     "

He expressed doubts about the need to make war on President Saddam Hussein in Iraq last year, agencies report from New York. 'The world cries out for peaceful resolution of conflict,' the former president told the Democratic party convention in New York, 'but our country is seen as more warlike than peace-loving. Our country should seek greatness in peace, not war.' He portrayed the US government, since his tenure in 1977-81, as driven by expediency and impatience with negotiation, as well as being indifferent to poverty and callous toward the environment. 'This has got to change,' Mr Carter said. He did not mention ex-President Ronald Reagan or President George Bush by name, but his targets were clear. Earlier, in an interview, the Democratic senior statesman said he believed Mr Ross Perot, the independent billionaire preparing a tilt at the presidency this year, would be a big factor in the election and could ensure the election of Governor Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, or throw the race to a decision by the House of Representatives. Mr Carter said the Democratic party this year was 'coming back to a more moderate position', similar to the one he had advocated. He said he would have a 'limited role' in the campaign.

[Kendall] How important for Cuba are ties with the new South  Africa?    [Rodriques] I think this is very important for Cuba. There  have been long historical relations between Cuba and the  patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this  victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great  importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy  towards President Mandela and his post.    [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa  following the inauguration of President Mandela?    [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our  government to keep very close ties with the new Government of  South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field,  and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from  the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view,  and many other fields.

0,FT941-1165 ,"FT941-1165 _AN-EC0AVABRFT 940326   FT  26 MAR 94 / Rural poverty 'hidden by cloak of prosperity'      By ALISON MAITLAND   An influx of wealthy people has cast a 'cloak of prosperity' over the English countryside which hides the poverty, inequality and isolation faced by at least a fifth of rural households, says a study to be published next week. The report by the Rural Development Commission, a government agency, also finds evidence of a significant 'black economy' in rural areas. At least 20 per cent of households were living on or below the poverty line in nine of the 12 counties surveyed, the report says. Even in well-heeled West Sussex, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of wage-earners in households had gross salaries below Pounds 8,000. 'The juxtaposition of wealth and poverty merely heightens the relative impact of low-income lifestyles in these areas,' says the report by Bristol University researchers. During the 1980s, many well-off, mobile people moved into villages to retire or commute to jobs in towns and cities, creating an image of affluence, it says. 'The increasingly common assumption of countryside people as two-car-owning merito-cracies can only serve to hide the plight of the non-mobile minority in gaining access to basic and necessary lifestyle opportunities.' The report was funded jointly by the Rural Development Commission, the Department of the Environment and the Economic and Social Research Council, a government agency. It was based on questionnaires from more than 3,000 households in 12 areas in England in 1990. It argues for more government action to create jobs, fill the 'vacuum of affordable property for rent' and improve public transport and other services. Migration to the countryside is not confined to the better-off, the study says. 'The incidence of low-income households appeared to be being reproduced in most areas through the 'in-migration' of a significant number of lower-income households.' This runs counter to suggestions that rural deprivation will disappear as disadvantaged groups 'move out or die off', it says. More than 60 per cent of respondents in most counties surveyed - 90 per cent in North Yorkshire - believed local people, especially young married couples, faced difficulty gaining access to accommodation. Between 54 per cent and 74 per cent considered that there were 'significant employment disadvantages'. But there was also evidence of a vigorous black economy in many areas. 'Second jobs (done by) 'foreigners' or 'moonlighting'  -or casual work done by those who would otherwise be unemployed - appeared to be significant if hidden aspects of economic life.' More than 90 per cent of people in six counties and more than 80 per cent in two others believed public transport had declined while 16 per cent of households had no car and 23 per cent of women had no access to a car. For many country-dwellers, there is the compensation of a close-knit community, proximity to nature, and being happy and healthy, says the report. 'However, our surveys also emphasised that the experiences of these characteristics can be highly differentiated. One person's splendid isolation was another's loneliness; the close-knit community for many can be prying, gossiping intrusion for others.' Lifestyles in Rural England.

These remarks were made by Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas during a telephone interview with FIDES NEWS AGENCY's  central offices at Government House. The vice president is  heading a national delegation in Cape Town. The mission  participated in Nelson Mandela's inauguration together with 150  other missions and nearly 5,000 world rulers and personalities.    ""What we are doing in Bolivia, (the reforms), through much  pain and sacrifice, is very important for the future. The  entire world, not just Bolivia, is working to build  multicultural democracies where different ethnic groups,  cultures, and customs form part of the fabric of democracy,""  Cardenas said.    During his two-day visit to South Africa, Cardenas held  short  meetings with representatives of various countries. He met with  U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Hilary Clinton. He also met  with Cuban President Fidel Castro Ruz, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat,  and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize  winner.    ""The central issue of all dialogues with these important  world leaders was the outcome of South African democracy and  improving relations with that nation,"" the vice president  explained.    ""Bolivians must think very seriously about normalizing  relations with South Africa and opening a Bolivian special  mission in this country,"" Cardenas said, stressing the  importance for Bolivia of the changes that are being experienced  by one of the African continent's more powerful nations.    At 2000 (Bolivian time) on 18 May, Victor Hugo Cardenas will  have ""an exclusive meeting"" with President Nelson Mandela to  discuss issues relative to the democratic process and the ethnic  factor in both nations.    Cardenas said there is full awareness that the change  process  in South Africa was very painful and full of sacrifice, ""but  there is also the fact that Bolivia can participate in the  construction of a multiethnical and multicultural democracy,  that this is no longer a dream.""    Cardenas said some South African countries ""are interested  in  details of the recent reforms introduced by Bolivia through laws  on popular participation, capitalization, and education reform.  They are very interested in the Bolivian case, a country where  people from many ethnical backgrounds have integrated.""    The vice president said that during his short meeting with  Cuba's President Fidel Castro, the two leaders recalled the  outstanding moments of the Cuban participation in Sanchez de  Lozada's inauguration last August. ""Castro again thanked the  Bolivian people for their affection and warmth during his  historic visit.""    Cardenas said that during his meeting with Vice President Al  Gore, the U.S. official said he felt gratitude and happiness  over his visit to Bolivia last March. ""The wife of the U.S.  president, Hilary Clinton, told us that Mr. and Mrs. Gore are  really happy, particularly after visiting Lake Titicaca and the  adjacent settlements.""    The vice president said: ""Bolivia is remembered by these  distinguished friends. They asked about the capitalization  project, education reform, and people's participation.""    ""South Africa is building a multiethnic, multicultural, and  multilingual democracy, just as Bolivia. These are common  aspects from which Bolivians can learn a lot. We must be  grateful because the process of change has not left as many  victims in Bolivia as in South Africa where the wounds are still  fresh,"" the vice president said.     "

He said it was  necessary to accelerate the export of labor so that Dingxi could  steadily resolve the problem of acquiring sufficient food and  clothing in the next few years, with some of its populace  achieving the goal of becoming comparatively well-off, while  getting rid of poverty in a comprehensive way.    In addition, Yan Haiwan required doing a good job of  tackling  key projects in supporting the impoverished by focusing efforts  on resolving a number of key projects by fully relying on the  masses. Key projects such as water conservancy work, road  building, and energy resources should be determined accurately  and grasped firmly. As soon as projects are determined, efforts  should be exerted to have them completed in a down-to-earth way.  In tackling key projects in supporting the impoverished,  attention should be paid to education in science and technology,  bringing up rural qualified people in doing practical work,  spreading rural applied science and technical know-how in a big  way, and developing rural education.

Meanwhile, Vice President  Nguyen Thi Binh has been in South Africa to attend the  swearing-in ceremony of the new South African president, Nelson  Mandela. These diplomatic activities show relations between  Vietnam and countries in Africa and the Middle East are  developing positively. Here is our comments on these events:    Due to geographic difficulties, relations between Vietnam  and  countries in Africa and the Middle East have not developed,  though the peoples in that region offered support towards the  national liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people in the  past as well as in national construction at present. Those  geographical obstacles are now less difficult. Many countries  in that region have invited Vietnamese leaders to pay working  visits. In response to their warm sentiments, in March Vice  President Nguyen Thi Binh led a Vietnamese delegation to visit  Algeria, Guinea, and Mali. Vietnam signed with those three  countries agreements on economic, cultural, scientific and  technological, and trade cooperation. At the end of last week,  Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh left for South Africa to attend  the swearing-in ceremony of President Nelson Mandela. There,  she met leaders of African countries and affirmed Vietnam's  determination to strengthen cooperative ties with them,  particularly with the new South Africa.    In the Middle East, with the current visit by Vice Premier  Nguyen Khanh to Syria and Egypt, new prospects in cooperation  have been opened up. Trade agreements have been signed between  Vietnam and Syria and Egypt. Vietnam now has expanded its  relations with all regions in the world. It has genuinely  integrated into the international community. Vietnam's foreign  policy to befriend all countries in the world and its  achievement in the current economic renovation are keys to  Vietnam's successes.     "

Nedcor Bank, a subsidiary of Nedcor, has entered into a strategic alliance with Societe Financiere pour les Pays d'Outre-Mer (SFOM), to combine forces in Africa. SFOM, a Swiss-based holding company, has major shareholdings in banks in 14 countries in Africa with a strong presence in West and Central Africa. It is owned by Banque Nationale de Paris, Dresdner Bank and Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Nedcor Bank and SFOM have also agreed, with effect from October 1 1993, to combine forces in Namibia by merging Namibian Banking Corporation and Commercial Bank of Namibia. The merged bank will be jointly managed by the two partners, which hold an 88 per cent stake, and will be known as The Commercial Bank of Namibia. It will be the third largest bank in Namibia with total assets of R725m (Dollars 166m). Nedcor Bank has also agreed to acquire an effective 16 per cent strategic stake in the Merchant Bank of Central Africa, one of Zimbabwe's premier banks, in partnership with other major shareholders including SFOM, NM Rothschild and Hill Samuel. Nedcor Bank said that, given South Africa's inexperience in the rest of the continent, it had been decided to forge relationships with other banks that had greater experience in the region. The group saw its business in Africa as the provision of bankings services and support to its corporate and commercial customers doing business in Africa.   Companies:-  Nedcor.     Nedcor Bank.

This is the gist of the speech made by Chen  Huanyou, provincial party committee secretary and governor, at  the provincial summing-up and commendation meeting on  antipoverty work. On 29 January, the provincial party committee  and government held this meeting to give a warm welcome to the  honorable return of the provincial party committee's second  antipoverty work team, sum up the province's antipoverty work in  recent years, and commend 198 advanced workers and 75 advanced  units in antipoverty work. Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of  the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting.    Cao Keming, Xu Zhonglin, Gao Dezheng, Jiang Yongrong, Zhang  Huaixi, Duan Xushen, and other provincial leaders attended the  meeting. The Yancheng City party Committee and Government, the  provincial planning and economic commission, the provincial  antipoverty work team stationed in Shuyang, and other units as  well as representatives of antipoverty team members gave reports  on their experience in this regard.    Chen Huanyou delivered an important speech on antipoverty  work. He said: Antipoverty work is a very important and  significant issue. Helping people in economically weak areas to  break away from poverty and become prosperous as soon as  possible has been an important issue to which the provincial  party committee and government have paid a good deal of  attention. According to the strategy of ""stressing reform and  opening up of more economically developed areas, mainly along  the Chang Jiang, and accelerating economic development on the  one hand; stressing the reform in economically weak areas with  localities north of Huai He as the center and stepping up the  pace of breaking away from poverty and becoming prosperous on  the other hand,"" the provincial party committee and government  have further supported economically weak areas in developing the  economy in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials  during the past couple of years. The provincial authorities  concentrated efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction  in northern Jiangsu and as organized the linkup of units  directly under the provincial authorities with poor townships  and towns by dispatching work groups to help develop the economy  and by promoting an exchange of cadres between northern and  southern Jiangsu to carry out cooperative activities. Through  the joint efforts of all sectors around the province,  particularly the hard work of cadres and people in economically  weak areas, gratifying achievements have been made in  antipoverty work. In view of the conditions in areas north of  Huai He, a road of development for braking away from poverty and  becoming prosperous as soon as possible has been found and  preliminary achievements have been scored in the course of  practice. The agricultural production rose steadily, structural  readjustment was remarkably accelerated, and the development of  a diversified economy has become the main source of the increase  in peasants' income. New vitality was added to industrial  production and some townships and towns formerly weak in  industry are starting their own backbone projects.  Infrastructure construction continued to be stressed; the  construction of markets saw a good beginning and more and more  peasants are participating in the circulation services.  Individual and private economies became active by the day;  labor export grew rapidly; peasants had higher income and  collective accumulation increased. Another 400,000 people in  Jiangsu shook off poverty in 1993. The per capita income of  most of the 58 poor townships and towns, which were emphatically  supported by the provincial authorities, has exceeded 600 yuan;  of which, the per capita income of 30 townships and towns in  Shuyang County exceeded 700 yuan, the village revenue increased  by 20.3 percent over the previous year, and the income of  village-level collective economies reached 20,000 yuan on  average. If economically weak areas develop along such a  course, they will surely bring about an even greater change by  the end of this century.    Chen Huanyou stressed in his speech that we should further  implement various antipoverty measures and strive to beef up the  capability of economically weak areas in self-development with a  strong sense of urgency and a high sense of political  responsibility, so as to step up the pace of breaking away from  poverty, becoming prosperous, and moving toward a relatively  comfortable life. On this year's antipoverty work, Chen Huanyou  noted that the provincial authorities should stress the  following issues: 1) Supporting the work with policies -- it is  necessary to continue to implement and improve the policies of  supporting the economic development in poor areas and to provide  the support in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials.  We should do our best to add more key projects in northern  Jiangsu. 2) Organization and coordination -- in line with the  principle of taking measures suitable to local conditions,  rational division of labor, supplementing each other's  advantages, and joint development and having consolidated the  linkup of the north and south, we should further expand economic  alliance and cooperation between economically developed cities  and counties and their less developed counterparts through  various forms and levels. The provincial authorities should  take measures to help launch projects with participation of both  the north and south. 3) Intensifying infrastructure  construction, particularly the construction of power supplies  and transport networks, with a view to making an end of  no-electricity villages and basically establishing highway  networks among cities, counties, and townships within three  years or so.    Chen Huanyou announced at the meeting: The provincial party  committee has decided to keep dispatching antipoverty work teams  to poor areas this year, appropriately readjust and expand  supporting areas, and make greater efforts in antipoverty work.  Some units originally stationed in Shuyang this year will be  transferred to Guanyu and Suining. He hoped that units  concerned would take the overall conditions into consideration,  happily accept the mission assigned to them by the provincial  party committee, overcome difficulties through all possible  means, and do a good job in their work. In addition to doing  their best to give personnel, capital, and material support,  leading comrades of various rear units should go deep into  townships and towns involved to give more concrete guidelines  and solve actual problems there. He called on antipoverty work  teams to conduct their work with creativity. The major tasks of  the teams are assisting localities in reform, opening up,  developing the economy, handling well the relations between  reform and development and stability, and promoting a  comprehensive social progress. All work teams should go deep  into the realities of life, intensify investigations and  studies, forge close ties and unite with local cadres and  people, and do more actual and helpful work for the localities  wholeheartedly. He demanded that party committees and  governments of localities, where the work teams are stationed,  actively strengthen their ties with work teams, keep in touch,  respect, and support each other at work and unite together to  advance forward.    Chen Huanyou also demanded that all cities and counties link  up with economically weak townships and villages level by level  and help them promote coordinated regional economic development.     "
0,FT944-12720 ,"FT944-12720 _AN-EJ4DUAEWFT 941031   FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Africa's stock markets aim high - The Emerging Investor      By MARK SUZMAN   As with so much else on the continent, Africa's stock exchanges tend to be bypassed by international investors who are convinced that anything preceded by the word African must be a hopeless economic basket case. Indeed, even among emerging markets specialists, few are aware of the existence of any African stock markets outside of South Africa - and even in that country genuine international interest is a relatively recent occurrence. Last week, however, at the annual general meeting of the African Stock Exchanges Association (ASEA) in Johannesburg, representatives from bourses across the region served notice that Africa is determined to put itself back on the international investment map. In particular, now that a politically rehabilitated South Africa is rapidly becoming integrated with the rest of the continent and is poised to act as its economic leader, hopes are running high that the continent's various exchanges are about to embark on an unprecedented growth path. 'The situation is looking better now for Africa than at any time in the past 30 years, and there's real potential for growth,' observes one analyst who recently started assessing African stocks. While such glib predictions litter Africa's modern economic history, ASEA officials are adamant that this is no longer a pipe-dream, pointing out that there are currently no fewer than 14 operative African stock markets, with a combined market capitalisation of Dollars 256bn (Pounds 162bn). Of these, South Africa is by far the most important player, accounting for Dollars 240bn compared with Dollars 7bn in North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco); Dollars 8bn in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Swaziland and Uganda) and a further Dollars 1bn coming from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. Even more striking is the fact that many exchanges already offer impressive returns. As a group the African markets rose by an average 30 per cent last year and only two exchanges, Botswana and Nigeria, fell. Zimbabwe, meanwhile, had the fourth best performing market in the world, rising by an astonishing 123 per cent in dollar terms (albeit off a low base) and the Mauritian index rose 51 per cent. Taking note of these figures, some of the bigger investment banks and securities houses have started to investigate African markets more seriously. Morgan Stanley, for example, has included several non-South African stocks in its Africa Fund and is distinctly upbeat on the continent's prospects. 'In spite of past problems, Africa's potential is unmistakeable. The world's second largest continent, with 11m square miles, is three times the size of the US and has twice the population, 600m strong, and is rich in natural resources and agriculture,' its assessment concludes. Similarly, in another recent report, Barings predicts that African exchanges should be able to expand from their current 2.2 per cent share of world market capitalisation to 3 per cent by 2010 on the back of anticipated cross-border equity flows of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.6bn. The sub-Saharan markets on their own, the report predicts, could expand by a factor of five or six times. Nevertheless, if the continent is to achieve this, analysts agree that further structural reforms are desperately needed. In particular, the markets need to boost liquidity substantially: South Africa, with annual turnover amounting to only 7.4 per cent of market capitalisation, is currently the most liquid of all sub-Saharan markets and even in the north, only Morocco's 21.7 per cent exceeds it. In large part, this is due to currency controls, which are still in place in nearly all African countries and need to be removed to allow the free movement of capital. At the same time, however, the markets need to launch some international stock offerings to help raise the continent's profile. These points are largely accepted by the markets, which have started actively lobbying their respective governments for action on both fronts. 'Only by removing the major stumbling block of exchange controls and by providing new shares through privatisation issues can we attract the foreign capital we so dearly need to develop our countries,' observes Mr Jimnah Mbaru, ASEA chairman. The first leg of this process has already begun. Several countries have implemented currency reforms as part of IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes. South Africa is also likely to jettison its own confusing financial rand system for foreign investors some time early next year, which should provide further impetus for the deregulation process. At the same time, moreover, many states are considering privatising companies in sectors such as mining, telecommunications and transport. As Ghana's highly successful recent Dollars 450m flotation of its Ashanti gold mine, of which 87 per cent was sold internationally, indicates, given the proper conditions global investors are more than willing to take a chance on Africa. In the meantime, the continent's stockbroking fraternity is continuing to grow: two more markets, in Tanzania and Malawi, are expected to open over the coming year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Friday  Week on week change Stock                             Country  28/10/94   Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bagfas                             Turkey   0.2106    0.0422     25.07 Shinhan Bank                     S.

Mesfin said the relations between the two countries are very  good, adding that Ethiopia has had a lot of support from and  cooperation with China in achieving national unity and economic  development.    He hailed the economic development in China as a great  success, which he said will be a great encouragement to Ethiopia.    Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said China  treasures the friendship between the two countries and is  willing to strengthen the cooperation on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence.    Qian said, the realization of peace in Ethiopia after 30  years of civil war shows what can be achieved by Ethiopia can  also be attained by other similar African countries, so long  clue efforts are made [as received].    The Chinese vice-premier said Ethiopian national economy  grows very fast, with a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 1992-93  fiscal year.    Qian Qichen said at a time when Africa is facing many  challenges and new difficulties, there have been varied  approaches to the continent, some think human rights is the most  important for Africa and others think it is the democratization.  In the light of the practice of China, we hold that the most  important tasks for Africa at present are: firstly to keep  political and social stability which is the primary condition  for the development of economy, secondly to develop economy  which is the central task and fundamental goal of all work.  Thirdly reform, only by which can all construction make  progress. Stability is the condition, reform is the motive  force, while development is the central task.    The Ethiopian foreign minister agreed with the analysis of  the Chinese vice-premier, believing that stability and  development is inseparable.    Qian Qichen also praised highly Ethiopia's policy of good  neighborliness and regional peace.    He said Somali question is the most important one in Africa.  China is paying great attention to the development in Somalia  and sympathizing with the sufferings of the Somali people.    He said, the Somali issue can only be solved by the Somali  people themselves, adding that the key to the peaceful solution  of the Somali problem is to achieve a broad national  reconciliation in Somalia.    However, Qian noted that the international community should  help the Somali people to resolve the Somali issue, but should  not do everything in their stead.    He also expressed the hope that all Somali factions could  iron out the differences through discussions and dialogues and  the Organization of African Unity and countries in the horn of  Africa can play an important role in seeking a solution to the  Somali issue.

It pleases me on this happy occasion--the opening of the  30th  African summit--to express warmest gratitude and appreciation to  the fraternal people of Tunisia and their leader President Zine  El Abidine Ben Ali for the hospitality they have accorded us and  for their obvious eagerness to provide all the necessary  requirements for the success of this conference. I am also  pleased to express my complete confidence that the ability and  wisdom of President Ben Ali will lead the OAU, at its 30th  summit, in extensive work and great achievements.    Brothers and sisters: It is one of the greatest moments in  the history of Africa and its organization to see the new South  Africa, under dear brother President Nelson Mandela, join the  independent and free countries that are working to advance the  united African march. The people of South Africa were not  absent from us and from the OAU. They have always been with us  in their heroic and glorious struggle, through which they  recorded a bright page in the history of humanity and  strengthened man's confidence that truth, virtue, and justice  must triumph over the forces of evil, darkness, and coercion.    Allow me to salute brother President Nelson Mandela once  again and to congratulate him on the high confidence he won from  the sons of his country, both the majority and the minority, and  on the establishment of the first nonracist government,  reflecting the united will of the entire nation, without  discrimination. While we wish this historic experience in  democratic transformation all success and prosperity, we hope it  will become a model to be emulated, not only in Africa but  throughout the other continents, where there is a pressing need  for coexistence, dialogue, the renunciation of violence, and  elimination of hatred and the spirit of contradiction and enmity.    Reconstruction is, and will always be, harder and more  difficult than revolution and change. The task of  reconstruction requires security and stability as well as the  cooperation of everyone in the pursuit of the national goals of  social and economic development.    The African nations, who have stood firmly behind the South  African people during their struggle, are determined to maintain  their solidarity with the South Africans in the reconstruction  phase. The Africans will give their support to the brotherly  South African people and help them assume their responsibility  in this strategic part of our glorious continent.    Brothers and sisters, a year has passed since we last met in  Cairo last June, a year that brought with it glimmers of hope  for a better future. The past year saw continued efforts by the  OAU leaders and peoples to confront the numerous problems facing  our nations, which are and exhausting a large portion of our  resources and potentials.    It is a regrettable and painful fact that many of these  problems were caused by the Africans themselves. Therefore, the  way to rid ourselves of the evils of war and destruction is  something that we, not others, have to find. Making and  preserving peace is our responsibility, not that of other  international organizations and outside powers.    The OAU has taken a large and remarkable stride toward  adopting preventive diplomacy as a way to avoid perils, foresee  crises, and settle disputes. Among our accomplishments in the  past year was the agreement by African leaders in Cairo OAU  summit last June to set up a central mechanism of preventing,  managing, and settling conflicts. This was followed by a meeting  in Cairo last September at the level of heads of state. This  meeting succeeded in formulating the principles and determining  the framework for the mechanism's operation through its central  body.    The OAU took this great achievement to a higher plateau with  its decision to set up a peace fund to finance the mechanism's  activities and enable it to deal effectively with a number of  African problems. This will give the entire OAU the credibility  it needs. There is a mounting international tendency to try to  resolve disputes through regional organizations before resorting  to external powers, the aim being to prevent these disputes from  assuming an international dimension that might lead to further  complications.    In order to preempt crises and curb fledgling disputes, an  African minisummit was held in Harare in March, and it was a  success. It involved in-depth discussions of the situation in  South Africa on the eve of the elections that led to the birth  of a new government.    Within this context, on the basis of experience and events,  as I hand over the chairmanship of the OAU, I call for great  attention to be paid in the coming period to preventive  diplomacy and to establishing an early-warning system that  anticipates disputes before they turn into military showdowns.  The OAU Secretariat General must provide a data base for the  current and expected disputes on the continent.    As we view this historic achievement, we must not forget  that  the wisdom of the leaders, the vigilance of the African people,  and response of all forces to the call to discard violence and  maintain the unity of South Africa resulted in the call I made  in the name of the OAU to a number of heads of state and  government in major Western capitals. This undoubtedly enabled  the OAU to spare the people of South Africa further violence and  confrontation and to maintain that country's unity and the  integration of its components.    Brothers and sisters: Our African continent has adopted  these two big steps, which are considered the most prominent  indications of wisdom and political pragmatism, whether in  achieving national detente through the democratic choice in  South Africa or in maintaining unanimity in establishing a  watertight system and a mechanism to settle its disputes by  peaceful means. An our organization has taken a third daring  step by its correct realization and understanding of the new  economic facts of the modern world.    The organization discovered that the phenomenon of blocs,  groupings, and mutual reliance is the hallmark of economic  relations among the countries of the North, whether in Europe,  North America, or the Asian Far East. Our organization felt the  long-term effects of its relations with the states of the North  and the sum total of international economic relations. From  this premise, brothers and sisters, and realizing the need for  integration between the North and South, right after our  previous summit and in the name of all you, I addressed the  leaders of the major industrial powers on the occasion of last  July's Tokyo summit [of the G-7]. I explained the nature of the  economic problems in Africa and submitted our just and realistic  demands, especially the easing of the heavy burdens of our  countries' debts within the framework of a relationship based on  constructive dialogue and mutual understanding among the states  of the North and South. Within the same framework, the brother  leaders in Africa responded brilliantly--not only to the needs  dictated by the international economic situation but also out of  a real desire by the continent's states and peoples--when they  each approved the African Economic Group agreement. Thus, the  necessary approvals have been received for this important  agreement to legally take effect.    With that, Africa will enter a new phase of integration  involving its various economies. We hope that this integration  will reflect positively on its relations and dialogue with the  states of the North. We also hope that this integration will  positively affect the development of its energies and wealth and  will achieve higher growth rates and greater prosperity for the  African nations.    I have no doubt that this accomplishment and the successful  efforts of the African continent to forge ahead along this road  will guarantee a good position for Africa on the world's  economic map. They will also enable the African states to  benefit from the various privileges of economic integration,  such as lessening the cost of production, increasing the number  of markets, and ensuring better transportation and communication  facilities. Economic integration will also enable the continent  to have negotiating power vis-a-vis the other world blocs.    Brothers and sisters, this step was very important for us in  Africa after the introduction of the new GATT Agreement and the  impending establishment of the World Trade Organization. These  developments could bring positive and negative results that  might affect the developing countries in general and the African  states, which produce raw materials, in particular. Such  developments could also dictate the lifting of restrictions and  barriers hindering international trade, especially the exports  of the advanced industrial countries.    Accordingly, the African Economic Group Agreement will  provide a protective umbrella for our interests and a strong  guarantee against any effects that could harm our economic  conditions if we are not well prepared for it. What  consolidates the role of this Economic Group and gives it  impetus is that the Group's states agreed last year to establish  the first African import-export bank. They also agreed on Cairo  as site of the bank's headquarters.    We are also confident that this vital economic establishment  will open up broad horizons for inter-African trade and will  achieve the desired integration. It will also create new fields  for balanced trade relations with the rest of the world.    We recorded undeniably positive aspects in the economic  field  thanks to a sound awareness of the economic facts and changes.  We must never forget that advancing the wheel of economic  development in Africa can only be achieved by effectively and  wisely confronting Africa's chronic and persistent  problems--drought and desertification and the accompanying  famine and refugees. We witnessed one of its painful chapters  in the Horn of Africa 10 years ago.    We must also not forget that pushing forward the wheel of  economic development in Africa requires that we always maintain  the delicate balance between population and resources or between  land and people. No matter how great the resources, they are  liable to be depleted due to the constant increase in  population. This poses a social and economic challenge to the  continent's people, who must face it with wisdom and reason.    Finally, we must not forget that economic growth cannot be  achieved without a comprehensive and balanced infrastructure and  without human development that raises the standard of the  individual, maintains his dignity, and releases his potential  and energy. I will continue to call for a climate of political  and social security and stability as a necessary and vital need  for the economic development process. Security is the main  pillar of stability, and stability is the guarantee for the  success of development. Africa urgently needs these three  components together.    Brothers and sisters, Africa has emerged cohesive and strong  from the era of colonialism and foreign domination. Its groups  and tribes have coexisted as brothers and neighbors across  borders and within the same homeland. Loyalty to the homeland  has remained above any other loyalty. Our affiliation to the  African continent and to its civilization and interests has  superseded all other affiliations. Africa has respected its  borders, enshrined its territorial unity and integrity, and  safeguarded its states' sovereignty, independence, and freedom  in accordance with its charter, which was adopted by its  founding leaders 30 years ago. Therefore, the recent aspects of  struggle that have divided the sons of the same homeland and  threatened security and stability in some parts of the continent  do not conform with the genuine African spirit. They must not  be interpreted as representing an African phenomenon or a  permanent fixture in Africa with which we have to coexist and  accept as part of the new continental reality. On the contrary,  it must be viewed as a passing and temporary phenomenon that  does not conform with firm African traditions and does not agree  with our long history and rich heritage.    An example of this deteriorating situation, on which we must  not remain silent, is the situation in fraternal Somalia.  Despite the honest and sincere efforts undertaken by  neighboring countries, the OAU, the United Nations, and several  friendly states, the Somali people continue to pay a heavy price  for the power struggles and rivalries at the expense of the  country's unity and its social fabric and at the expense of its  stability and the security of its citizens.    I have taken it upon myself to do my utmost to put an end to  this destructive crisis by virtue of my responsibility as OAU  chairman and by virtue of my capacity as president of Egypt,  which has strong historical and cultural relations with Somalia.    The efforts, which we coordinated with the brothers and  presidents, who played a special role in this regard, focussed  on closing ranks and calling on all factions without exception  to agree to a national reconciliation formula. The efforts  resulted in the issuance of the Cairo Declaration, which  constituted a solid base and a common ground for all factions to  get out of the current crisis. We are renewing our call to all  sides to place Somalia above ambitions, and to restore unity to  the country and security and reassurance to the people. We urge  them to start a sincere and determined march toward unity and  national reconciliation so that this fraternal country can  continue its development and message.    If we are to learn a lesson from this tragedy, it is that  Africa is most capable of solving its problems by itself.  Assistance from friendly countries and international  organizations, no matter how necessary, cannot replace the  African role but only support it. The responsibility lies  primarily with the people of Africa, because they know best the  problems of their countries and societies.    In central Africa, that strategically important region  thanks  to its unique location where the great Nile starts and many  friendly countries share borders, heavy blood was shed on the  soil of two friendly countries, Rwanda and Burundi. The vicious  fighting pained our hearts because it bordered on genocide,  where hundreds of thousands of people were killed, resources  that we urgently need were wasted, and hundreds of thousands of  people were turned into refugees burdening the neighboring  countries and depleting their resources, let alone the war's  negative reflections on Africa's image and culture.    These tragic situations, brothers and sisters, place on the  shoulders of our organization, the world community, and the  United Nations a common humanitarian duty and a moral obligation  to move to stop this bleeding so that its aftermath and  consequences do not extend to the heart of the continent and to  this spot, which is vital to its own peoples and to the  neighboring peoples.    In Burundi, the OAU's swift moves to control the situation  prevented further deterioration. These moves constituted one of  the first successful trials of the conflict resolution mechanism  which the OAU has established. The OAU envoy contacted all  forces in the government and the opposition, and this set the  appropriate stage for containing the situation and easing  tension.    Another lesson to be learned from our experience in this  central African region is that the presence of peace-keeping  forces, although undeniably important, is not an alternative to  a genuine peace among the sons of the nation, whether in the  government or the opposition, within the framework of  legitimacy, law, respect for man's dignity, and the use of the  language of dialogue and reconciliation.    Perhaps the real dilemma facing African countries in  certain areas is that of maintaining internal stability and  national cohesion. Unity should be preserved through pluralism.  The time is right for the OAU, with all its agencies, to turn  its utmost attention to this issue, among others.    Against this background, the OAU continued its efforts to  restore stability, consolidate national cohesion, and unify  national forces in Angola, Liberia, and Mozambique. I had  urgent exchanges with the influential forces in these countries  with a view to probing the problems there and resolving them.    In the same context, the OAU is in touch with the brothers  in  Cameroon and Nigeria in an effort to resolve their dispute. We  hope that our efforts there will succeed in defusing tensions  and finding an acceptable solution. Both sides have exhibited a  desire to reach an understanding and begin a dialogue.    Brothers and sisters, solidarity among African and Arab  nations both inside and outside Africa has been instrumental in  many great achievements concerning African liberation, the  liquidation of imperialism, and the achievement of  self-determination.    The firm backing by African nations of just Arab causes in  various international forums has been remarkable. African  support of the Palestinian issue and the rights of the  Palestinian people has always been courageous and impressive.    Brothers and sisters, I am pleased to tell you that,  following daunting negotiations, our efforts have been crowned  with great success in the signing of the self-rule agreement in  Gaza and Jericho. Israel and the Palestinians signed the  agreement on 4 May 1994. The self-rule agreement is merely a  first step toward fulfilling the rights and aspirations of the  Palestinian people for self-determination. We hope that it will  be followed by similar steps on other tracks of the Arab-Israeli  peace talks and that a just and comprehensive peace will be  achieved by all the nations of the Middle East.    Brothers and sisters, seen from a political and strategic  overview, African and Middle East security are linked. This is  why we made an initiative, which we are trying to promote in  various forums. This initiative calls for turning the Middle  East and Africa into zones that are free from nuclear weapons  and weapons of mass destruction.    Today, Africa and the Middle East face new horizons as the  21st century approaches. Our nations need to preserve their  resources and potentials, elevate their standards of living, and  achieve development and prosperity. The only way to attain  these noble objectives is by maintaining security and stability  throughout Africa and the Middle East. The threat of mass  destruction should disappear from Africa, the birthplace of the  oldest civilizations, and the Middle East, the birthplace of  major religions and the ancient cultures of the East. Our  nations look with hope and confidence to reaping together the  fruits of the great seeds sown by our founding fathers 30 years  ago in the black African soil.    Brothers and sisters, during the past year you gave me the  honor of being OAU chairman for the second time in five years.  You laid on me the responsibility of representing it and  speaking with the leaders of the outside world on your behalf.  I hope that my efforts in this connection were adequate to the  task.    On this occasion, I feel it is necessary for me to offer my  thanks to all the brother presidents for the sincere fraternal  cooperation they have shown me. This helped me to accomplish  the chairman's tasks. Throughout my period of responsibility I  did not feel I was alone but was always surrounded by your  sincere support. None of you hesitated to carry out what I asked  them to do for the good of our mutual interests and united  destiny. This gave me additional pride in your comradeship and  fraternity and in belonging with you to the greater African  entity and its splendid civilization. Furthermore, your  objective attitude, frankness, truthfulness to yourselves, and  putting the general interest above other considerations have  given me fresh confidence in this young continent's future and  the ability of its future generations to confront new problems  and challenges with total fortitude. In this task they will  rely on their unshakeable faith in the principles of African  unity and their firm commitment to strengthening solidarity and  cooperation among the continent's nations until their noble  objectives are attained.    Brothers and sisters, I must not forget to offer my thanks  to  OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim for his sincere  cooperation and perseverance which decisively helped us to carry  out the achievements of the past year.    Long live our African continent in security and stability.  Long live its nations, united and strong. Long live the  African nations' struggle for economic development and progress.  Long live the memory of Africa's devout martyrs.    Let the torches of liberty burn everywhere in Africa. Let  the light of learning and civilization spread in the corners of  this glorious continent.    Long live the OAU. Long live the memory of its pioneers and  founding leaders. May God give us all success. Peace and the  mercy of God be with you. [applause]     "

""The people of Namibia have waited long years for this day, and it is the eve  of an era: an era of all of the people of Namibia,"" Martti Ahtisaari, the  U.N.'s special representative to Namibia, said Friday as he arrived to monitor  the transition from African colony to nationhood.    ""Namibia has truly been a wound in the side of Africa,"" Ahtisaari told a news  conference at Windhoek's airport. ""But it also has a special place in the  hearts and minds of the whole world.""    Thousands of cheering Namibians came by train, bus and even on horseback across  the scrubby desert to line the airport road and welcome the U.N. official, who  arrived on a South African Airways flight from Frankfurt, West Germany.    The throng, bedecked in traditional African dress and the bright colors of some  of the territory's 40 political parties, carried signs reading: ""No Government  Based on Ethnicity,"" ""No to a One-Party System"" and ""Welcome Martti."" Women in  braided hair ululated and danced while political organizers with bullhorns  called out slogans to their faithful.      'We Want an Election'    ""We're here to show these U.N. people how much we want an election,"" said  Katjimuini Veii, who was wearing a T-shirt expressing his support for the  Namibian Patriotic Front, a coalition of political parties.    Ahtisaari's arrival was eagerly awaited here because it signaled the start of  an 11-year-old U.N. plan to free Namibia, a rugged land of only 1.5 million  people on the southwestern coast of Africa.    South Africa, itself then a self-governing British possession, captured the  colony from Germany in World War I. After the war, the League of Nations gave  South Africa the mandate to govern the territory. South Africa became fully  independent of Britain in 1934 and after World War II, the league's successor  organization, the United Nations, refused to allow it to annex the territory.  In 1966, the U.N. General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate in  Namibia.    Pretoria has defiantly occupied Namibia for more than 20 years. Since the  mid-1970s, it had cited the presence of Cuban troops in Angola, Namibia's  northern neighbor. But in December, it agreed to bring its troops out, in  return for a promise that Cuba would pull its troops out of Angola.      Test of Commitment    The independence process is considered an important test of South Africa's  commitment to peace in southern Africa. South Africa also hopes a smooth  transition for Namibia will improve Pretoria's image abroad and help reduce its  international economic and political isolation.    ""We are leaving Namibia with a feeling that we have fulfilled our commitments  here with dignity,"" Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister,  said Friday at a news conference in Windhoek. Describing South Africa's  contributions to Namibia's infrastructure over the years, Botha added, ""I  cannot imagine a country that has a better hope of making a success of  independence than this one.""    The U.N.'s Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), which will cost $416 million,  includes a multinational force of 4,650 troops and, at its height, 2,500  additional monitors, administrators and local staff. About 1,000 troops already  have arrived and are stationed throughout the territory to monitor the election  campaign and voting.    Under the U.N. transition, Namibia will be governed until independence by South  Africa's administrator general ""to the satisfaction of"" the U.N.'s Ahtisaari,  according to the U.N. resolution.    Ahtisaari, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's personal envoy in  Namibia, said the joint U.N.-South Africa effort marked ""a unique and  pioneering vision."" If successful, he added, ""the prospect for a peaceful  settlement of even the (world's) most intractable problems will have taken a  giant stride forward.""    ""We'd like to see these elections be really free and fair, free of the scourge  of violence and intimidation,"" the South African administrator, Louis Pienaar,  said in pledging his country's impartiality. ""We would like to prove that  democratic elections can be held in this part of the world.""      Cease-Fire in Effect    A formal U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between South Africa and the South-West  Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has waged a 23-year guerrilla war  for independence, went into effect at dawn today although the two sides had  informally observed a cease-fire since December.    Also beginning today, South Africa's troops are confined to two bases in the  country, and SWAPO's soldiers must remain in their bases in Angola and Zambia.    About 24,000 black Namibians who have fought with the South African army  against SWAPO are being disbanded and ordered to surrender their weapons and  uniforms.    Namibia's independence is guided by a strict timetable. By mid-May, all  discriminatory laws must be repealed, and by early June all political prisoners  and detainees held by both sides must be released. South Africa has until July  to reduce its troop strength in Namibia to 1,500, from a high last year of  about 30,000.    Namibians who fled the country to escape the war and SWAPO members who went  into exile are expected to begin returning in the coming weeks. The United  Nations estimates that about 58,000 Namibians are living in exile, most of them  in southern Angola.    Namibia's election campaign begins in July and, in early November, the  territory will elect an assembly to draw up a new constitution. The whole  process is expected to be concluded by this time next year.    SWAPO, with its strong base of support in the north, Namibia's most populous  region, is regarded by many political analysts as the likely winner in an  election. But few believe it will gain the two-thirds majority needed to design  the constitution by itself.    Namibia, a mostly desert land with mines producing diamonds and uranium, is one  of the world's least-populous regions. In fact, the territory will have one  U.N. soldier for every 200 Namibians. But because of the large distances to be  covered, the world body considers its mission in Namibia ""the most complicated  mission we have ever put on,"" according to Cedric Thornberry, the  second-ranking U.N. official here.    Most of Namibia's inhabitants are black and 60% of them live in the north,  where SWAPO draws most of its support. Only 80,000 Namibians, about 6% of the  total population, are white. But they control many of the businesses.    Most of Namibia's whites, including those who strongly oppose the U.N. presence  here, have decided to remain at least until the November elections. Many more  moderate whites have decided to actively contest the election in the hope of  preventing a sweeping SWAPO victory.    Before today, Namibia had been governed by a multiracial transitional  government, but South Africa's administrator retained veto power over  legislation. Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago,  segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools  and hospitals racially separate.    But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South  Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating  to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of  the United Nations.      NAMIBIA NEARS INDEPENDENCE (Southland Edition)    Today marks the beginning of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by South Africa (which has administered the huge,  sparsely populated territory since World War I), Angola and Cuba. Provisions of  the plan:    April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of the 7,000-member  U.N. Transition Assistance Group who will oversee the transition. South African  troops in Namibia and guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), based in neighboring Angola, are confined to their bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is disbanded; South Africa reduces its  forces to 12,000 troops. South African administrator Louis Pienaar publishes  election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners freed; Namibian exiles return.    July 1 -- Pretoria's forces cut to 1,500; election campaigning begins.    Oct. 31 -- 25,000 Cuban troops have left Angola, rest withdraw north of 13th  Parallel.

Test of Commitment    The independence process is considered an important test of South Africa's  commitment to peace in southern Africa. South Africa also hopes a smooth  transition for Namibia will improve Pretoria's image abroad and help reduce its  international economic and political isolation.    ""We are leaving Namibia with a feeling that we have fulfilled our commitments  here with dignity,"" Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister,  said Friday at a news conference in Windhoek. Describing South Africa's  contributions to Namibia's infrastructure over the years, Botha added, ""I  cannot imagine a country that has a better hope of making a success of  independence than this one.""    The U.N.'s Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), which will cost $416 million,  includes a multinational force of 4,650 troops and, at its height, 2,500  additional monitors, administrators and local staff. About 1,000 troops already  have arrived and are stationed throughout the territory to monitor the election  campaign and voting.    Under the U.N. transition, Namibia will be governed until independence by South  Africa's administrator general ""to the satisfaction of"" the U.N.'s Ahtisaari,  according to the U.N. resolution.    Ahtisaari, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's personal envoy in  Namibia, said the joint U.N.-South Africa effort marked ""a unique and  pioneering vision."" If successful, he added, ""the prospect for a peaceful  settlement of even the (world's) most intractable problems will have taken a  giant stride forward.""    ""We'd like to see these elections be really free and fair, free of the scourge  of violence and intimidation,"" the South African administrator, Louis Pienaar,  said in pledging his country's impartiality. ""We would like to prove that  democratic elections can be held in this part of the world.""      Cease-Fire in Effect    A formal U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between South Africa and the South-West  Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has waged a 23-year guerrilla war  for independence, went into effect at dawn today although the two sides had  informally observed a cease-fire since December.    Also beginning today, South Africa's troops are confined to two bases in the  country, and SWAPO's soldiers must remain in their bases in Angola and Zambia.    About 24,000 black Namibians who have fought with the South African army  against SWAPO are being disbanded and ordered to surrender their weapons and  uniforms.    Namibia's independence is guided by a strict timetable. By mid-May, all  discriminatory laws must be repealed, and by early June all political prisoners  and detainees held by both sides must be released. South Africa has until July  to reduce its troop strength in Namibia to 1,500, from a high last year of  about 30,000.    Namibians who fled the country to escape the war and SWAPO members who went  into exile are expected to begin returning in the coming weeks. The United  Nations estimates that about 58,000 Namibians are living in exile, most of them  in southern Angola.    Namibia's election campaign begins in July and, in early November, the  territory will elect an assembly to draw up a new constitution. The whole  process is expected to be concluded by this time next year.    SWAPO, with its strong base of support in the north, Namibia's most populous  region, is regarded by many political analysts as the likely winner in an  election. But few believe it will gain the two-thirds majority needed to design  the constitution by itself.    Namibia, a mostly desert land with mines producing diamonds and uranium, is one  of the world's least-populous regions. In fact, the territory will have one  U.N. soldier for every 200 Namibians. But because of the large distances to be  covered, the world body considers its mission in Namibia ""the most complicated  mission we have ever put on,"" according to Cedric Thornberry, the  second-ranking U.N. official here.    Most of Namibia's inhabitants are black and 60% of them live in the north,  where SWAPO draws most of its support. Only 80,000 Namibians, about 6% of the  total population, are white. But they control many of the businesses.    Most of Namibia's whites, including those who strongly oppose the U.N. presence  here, have decided to remain at least until the November elections. Many more  moderate whites have decided to actively contest the election in the hope of  preventing a sweeping SWAPO victory.    Before today, Namibia had been governed by a multiracial transitional  government, but South Africa's administrator retained veto power over  legislation. Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago,  segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools  and hospitals racially separate.    But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South  Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating  to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of  the United Nations.      NAMIBIA NEARS INDEPENDENCE (Southland Edition)    Today marks the beginning of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by South Africa (which has administered the huge,  sparsely populated territory since World War I), Angola and Cuba. Provisions of  the plan:    April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of the 7,000-member  U.N. Transition Assistance Group who will oversee the transition. South African  troops in Namibia and guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), based in neighboring Angola, are confined to their bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is disbanded; South Africa reduces its  forces to 12,000 troops. South African administrator Louis Pienaar publishes  election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners freed; Namibian exiles return.    July 1 -- Pretoria's forces cut to 1,500; election campaigning begins.    Oct. 31 -- 25,000 Cuban troops have left Angola, rest withdraw north of 13th  Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered to  approve constitution for independent Namibia, the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate in Namibia ends; Cubans have  removed 33,000 troops from Angola.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans withdraw last of 50,000 troops from Angola.

""We are against any form  of dual recognition,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would  not seek to cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria  switches diplomatic recognition to Beijing.    The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked  the first time Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to  tolerate dual recognition with China. However, the Chinese  spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be unacceptable  to Beijing. ""We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two  Chinas, or one China one Taiwan,"" he said.    China refuses to permit countries with which it has  diplomatic relations to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded  as a renegade province ever since Nationalist forces fled to the  island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the  mainland. Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any  country which switches formal recognition to Beijing.    Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity  are widely expected to establish diplomatic relations later this  year. China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's  struggle for political rights in South Africa, had previously  refused to establish ties with the white government in Pretoria  until the country's apartheid system had been completely  dismantled. ""We believe that relations between China and the  new South Africa will enjoy all-round development in the  future,"" the spokesman said.    In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links  with South Africa which were suspended in 1960.    Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29  countries, including South Africa, but has in recent years  launched a diplomatic offensive -- especially in Southeast Asia  -- to cement ties with other governments.

In a talk with visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of  Angola Venacio da Silva Moura, Qian said that the peoples of  China and Angola have enjoyed traditional friendship, adding  that China is willing to further enhance cooperative relations  with Angola.    Qian said that China has been paying close attention to  Angola's peace process and sincerely hopes that the talks in  Angola will reach final agreement at an early date and realize  domestic peace and stability.    He noted that China has never interfered in the internal  affairs of African countries and has dedicated itself to  contributing to the development of Africa as much as possible.  China hopes that African countries enjoy peace and stability  and develop good-neighborly ties of friendship, Qian said.    Qian pointed out that big countries, instead of interfering  in the internal affairs of African countries, should let African  nations build their countries according to their own situations.    If big powers really care about Africa, they should not  write  out a prescription and force Africa to accept it, Qian said.  They should offer aid to Africa to promote the development of  African economies.    Moura briefed Qian on the current situation in Angola. He  expressed thanks for China's long-term political and economic  support of his country.    He noted that in Angola's struggle for national  independence,  the peoples of Angola and China stood on one side. After  drastic changes in the international situation, the two peoples  still stood together.    The Angolan foreign minister reaffirmed that his country  firmly insists on a ""one-China"" policy and will not develop any  official ties with Taiwan.    He expressed the belief that economic and trade relations  between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola  realizes internal peace.     "

The problem has grown at the same  time as there has been an explosive increase in the number of  asylum-seekers from the African continent.    African drug gangs are wreaking havoc on the Danish drug  market, where their smoking heroin is creating thousands of new  drug addicts. They follow a very definite pattern when they come  here--often exploiting our asylum regulations--and the hard  drugs are concealed in their bodies.    This development is causing growing concern among both the  Danish police and Interpol.    In recent years Africans from Ghana, Gambia, and Nigeria in  particular have dominated the picture of a growing African drug  market in this country. At the same time the number of  asylum-seekers from several African countries has risen sharply.  If refugees from the former Yugoslavia are excluded, almost one  out of every two asylum-seekers in 1993 was from Africa. In 1992  Africans represented just under 30 percent, while in 1990 their  share was as low as 15 percent. This should be seen in relation  to the fact that by and large only refugees from the devastating  civil war in Somalia are granted asylum.    ""New people come here all the time, and they do not come out  of a clear blue sky. Someone organizes their trip here,""  Detective Superintendent Mogens Lundh, head of the National  Police Commissioner's drug information division, told BERLINGSKE  TIDENDE.    The pattern is that the future asylum-seeker gets a ticket  and receives money from his ""brothers"" in Denmark and then --  after registering at an asylum center -- he partially moves in  with his friends/contacts.    By seeking asylum, foreigners acquire a better status in  comparison with ordinary tourists if they are arrested in  connection with criminal activities. In contrast to tourists,  asylum-seekers can demand to stay in Denmark while their cases  are being processed. And Africans' asylum cases are especially  likely to take a long time. It is difficult to establish an  individual's identity because he often has passports from  several countries. In this way he can change his nationality if  the first one does not entitle him to asylum. And then the case  begins all over again.    According to Lundh, a corresponding procedure is used in  attempts to enter Denmark so that a person expelled on drug  charges simply returns with a new nationality.    Swallow Drug-Filled Condoms    Eleven Africans were arrested in Denmark in connection with  drug smuggling in 1993, according to Interpol. But as no  statistics are kept on the status of arrested foreigners it is  impossible for the police to say how many of the Africans  charged with drug offenses came here as asylum-seekers.    According to Lundh they typically come with 50-200 grams of  pure heroin concealed in their bodies. The drug is swallowed in  a package -- condoms, for example -- that protects it on its  passage through the intestinal system. Later it is cut so that 1  gram represents a value of around 4,000 kroner on the street.    The method used to smuggle the drugs in is the reason why  there are large quantities of heroin in circulation in Denmark  in spite of the efforts at the borders. Detecting drugs in a  suspect's stomach is difficult and requires detaining him until  nature brings the substance out in the open.    The African heroin is sold all over the country -- with a  preponderance in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen where it  is sold quite openly.    ""The Africans have developed a special technique that  enables  them to remove the evidence at any time. They simply swallow it.  And when we are out of the way they stick a finger down their  throat and get the goods back intact,"" said a vice squad  spokesman.    The police are now trying to stop this practice by simply  taking suspects along to Vestre Prison's infirmary where they  are left to sit on the can until the drugs show up. This has  already paid off on several occasions in January. In one case  two Gambians swallowed 26 small packets containing a total of  3.62 grams of very high quality heroin. It had a street value of  almost 15,000 kroner.    One was deported while the other, who has a Danish spouse,  was imprisoned.    High Price for Danish Brides    The police cannot disclose the status of the marriage. But  in  their experience it is common for passionate love between an  African and a Dane to spring up when all avenues of appeal in an  asylum case are on the point of being exhausted.    Among Africans the price of a marriage is said to be  15-20,000 kroner. Some bride prices have reportedly been around  50,000 kroner.    Marriage to a Dane automatically ensures foreigners of a  residence permit and this occurs ""fairly often,"" as Jorgen  Cemnitz, the leader of the Danish Red Cross asylum division,  said. If such a marriage occurs they automatically drop out of  the asylum system.    ""Formerly Africans acted as couriers, especially for  Pakistani drug dealers. But that time is past. Today we have two  independent drug gangs that cover all aspects after the drugs  are produced in Thailand and Pakistan. This means purchasing,  distribution, and sales,"" said Lundh.    The gangs are based in West and East Africa respectively.  The  eastern gang members come from Uganda, Somalia, and Tanzania and  the western ones from Ghana, Gambia, and Nigeria. And while the  western organization is strongest in Denmark, the other Nordic  countries notice the eastern gang more. It also operates in this  country -- but on a smaller scale than the western one.    The money earned from the drug trade is spent partly on  lavish consumption in Denmark and partly on non-drug-related  investments in their homelands.    ""In contrast to drug dealers from Turkey and Pakistan, for  example, the Africans are well educated. Many have a heavy  academic ballast,"" said Mogens Lundh, who thinks the connection  between Denmark and Africa has its roots in earlier charter  trips.    Interpol estimates that a total of around 10 percent of all  the world's money comes from drugs -- through production, sales,  or consumption. This tells almost the whole story about the  battle the police and customs agents are up against.    It is estimated that illegal cocaine sales alone amount to  2.5 trillion kroner worldwide.    Nordic Lands of Special Interest    Heroin and cocaine are regarded as the means of payment of  the downtrodden. Drug money can be used to buy arms for the  struggle for liberation and independence. The hunger and  widespread poverty in Africa also cause an increase in the  supply of hard drugs. Therefore countries like Denmark are  flooded with the deadly narcotics. We have the opposite  commodities -- peace, money, and the coveted standard of living.    The Nordic region is also interesting because of the many  daily connections with places like Russia, Poland, and the  Baltic states.    ""This provides many opportunities to get the desired goods  inside the EU [European Union] community,"" they say at  Interpol's European headquarters in Lyon, France.    As a countermeasure, the Nordic countries have set up  several  working groups that try to obtain as much information from the  individual cultures as possible about such things as behavior,  bases, smuggling techniques, and networks.    ""This makes it a little easier for us to know what special  things we should look for when they come through customs,"" said  Lundh.    In the last two years 50 Africans carrying large quantities  of heroin have been arrested at various Nordic borders.    ""And that is a large number,"" Lundh added. In numerical  terms  Africans involved in heroin cases make up over half of all those  arrested. When it comes to the quantity of drugs, Turks,  Iranians, and Pakistanis are still in the lead because, unlike  the Africans, they dispatch whole truckloads.    On the other hand it, can be harder to unmask the Africans  if  the market share rises in proportion to the number of couriers.  Five years ago there were practically no Africans among those  arrested in the Nordic countries in connection with drugs.    In Denmark around 20 different nationalities that operate on  the drug market have been recorded, but there are no statistics  on the percentage of asylum-seekers.    However several asylum centers confirm that the behavior of  many of the Africans is strikingly different from that of other  asylum-seekers. They do not live at the centers, but come in  only when they have to pick up pocket money -- or they are  reported missing and drop out of the system. And their  consumption of luxury items--including the use of taxis -- is  extremely high.    Deputy director Henrik Dahl Sorensen of the Directorate of  Alien Affairs confirmed that there is a widespread tendency --  also among Africans -- to ""take advantage of the system,"" as he  put it.    However very few Africans are granted asylum. Broadly  speaking it is granted only to people who come here from  Somalia, a country ravaged by civil war. In the two other big  groups -- from Gambia and Togo -- only a few (from Togo) have  been granted asylum to date.    But Sorensen also acknowledged that ""there are very big  problems in establishing the correct identity.""    There were around 2,000 African asylum-seekers in 1993, half  of whom came from Somalia and around 300 from Gambia, while over  150 came from Togo and around 120 from Uganda.    The introduction of compulsory visas from several African  countries has apparently not moderated the interest in Denmark.     "

PITTSBURGH      Many blacks in this country, the argument goes, can't get good jobs because  they drop out of high school. Those who go to college, receive an education and  take advantage of affirmative-action policies, continues the argument, have a  better than even chance of hitting the upper-income brackets.    This view is still true, but to a much lesser extent than it was a decade ago.  A new study, conducted for the Ford Foundation and the Rural Economic Policy  Program of the Aspen Institute by me and Lucy Gorham, shows that since the late  1970s there has been a dramatic deterioration in the earnings of working  African-Americans -- even for those with college decrees.    The Reagan legacy amounts to nothing less than the economic polarization of  America. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And the hard-working middle  class became more insecure than at any time since before World War II.    But people of color suffered most of all.    In 1979, one of three black workers in the United States earned poverty-level  wages. By 1987, four of 10 were making that (inflation adjusted) wage --  roughly $12,000 for a family of four. During the same period, the share of  African-American workers with earnings three times the poverty line fell, from  7.2% to 5.6%. Thus, the frequently mentioned increase in middle-class black  employees who no longer need equal-opportunity protection is a myth.    The lot of African-American college graduates has deteriorated as well. The  number of well-educated black men receiving below-the-poverty-line wages grew  faster than those earning more than $36,000, the study's high-earnings  benchmark. On balance, the share of African-American male college graduates  with wages higher than $36,000 has fallensince 1979, from nearly 1 in 4 to  fewer than 1 in 5.    For college-educated black women, the 1980s were worse. Between 1979 and 1987,  the number earning more than three times the poverty line declined by 10,000.  This despite a net addition to the American labor pool of 407,000 black women  with at least four years of college.    Not surprisingly, the situation for young black men was disastrous. Consider  that of 25- to 34-year-olds, who might be expected to have settled down and  begun a career. During the interval studied, the number of such men working but  earning less than poverty wages increased by 161%. Put another way, the size of  this group doubled during the 1980s, while the fraction earning more than three  times the poverty line fell by half. And these statistics don't include those  who dropped out of the active labor force.    The reasons are abundant. The devastation of many of the nation's basic  manufacturing sectors -- steel, auto, etc. -- during the early 1980s hit black  men especially hard. These industries produced jobs that offered a good living  without the need for fancy educational credentials. The military had been  another sure path to higher wages for people of color. But the new high-tech  armed forces drastically increased entrance requirements, resulting in an  immediate decline in the number and percentage of black recruits.    The cutbacks in the creation of good government jobs have also fallen  especially hard on Americans of color. Since World War II, civilian government  employment had consistently been a promoter of upward income mobility for  blacks (and for white women). In the 1980s, the public sector either reduced  hiring altogether, or shifted from hiring permanent employees (with  civil-service protection) to recruiting people into part-time or temporary  schedules.    Finally, a series of administrative and U.S. Supreme Court decisions during the  decade has made it increasingly difficult for the victims of racial and gender  discrimination to seek -- let alone achieve -- justice effectively.    Affirmative action, ironically, is more important than ever when the number of  ""good jobs at good wages"" being created in the American economy declines, while  the low-wage work accompanying deindustrialization and corporate restructuring  grows.    Legislative efforts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1990, would make it easier  for workers of color who are discriminated against in hiring, promotions and  wages to win lawsuits aimed at getting the incomes they have fairly earned.  Both houses of Congress passed the bill early last month, and the President  ought to sign it immediately.    As African-American and other minority groups work harder to educate themselves  and to enter the labor force, competition for the good jobs can only intensify.  The anemic rates of national economic growth that most experts predict for the  foreseeable future (and that are actually favored by an inflation-conscious  Federal Reserve Bank and Wall Street) guarantee that the pressure is unlikely  to be relieved any time soon.    The deterioration in the earnings opportunities for black Americans who do work  for a living is an unconscionable legacy of the politics and economics of the  1980s. It needs to be better understood. But most of all, it needs to be  stopped.

These industries produced jobs that offered a good living  without the need for fancy educational credentials. The military had been  another sure path to higher wages for people of color. But the new high-tech  armed forces drastically increased entrance requirements, resulting in an  immediate decline in the number and percentage of black recruits.    The cutbacks in the creation of good government jobs have also fallen  especially hard on Americans of color. Since World War II, civilian government  employment had consistently been a promoter of upward income mobility for  blacks (and for white women). In the 1980s, the public sector either reduced  hiring altogether, or shifted from hiring permanent employees (with  civil-service protection) to recruiting people into part-time or temporary  schedules.    Finally, a series of administrative and U.S. Supreme Court decisions during the  decade has made it increasingly difficult for the victims of racial and gender  discrimination to seek -- let alone achieve -- justice effectively.    Affirmative action, ironically, is more important than ever when the number of  ""good jobs at good wages"" being created in the American economy declines, while  the low-wage work accompanying deindustrialization and corporate restructuring  grows.    Legislative efforts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1990, would make it easier  for workers of color who are discriminated against in hiring, promotions and  wages to win lawsuits aimed at getting the incomes they have fairly earned.  Both houses of Congress passed the bill early last month, and the President  ought to sign it immediately.    As African-American and other minority groups work harder to educate themselves  and to enter the labor force, competition for the good jobs can only intensify.  The anemic rates of national economic growth that most experts predict for the  foreseeable future (and that are actually favored by an inflation-conscious  Federal Reserve Bank and Wall Street) guarantee that the pressure is unlikely  to be relieved any time soon.    The deterioration in the earnings opportunities for black Americans who do work  for a living is an unconscionable legacy of the politics and economics of the  1980s. It needs to be better understood. But most of all, it needs to be  stopped.

African  Election Process""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 22 (XINHUA) -- With the  announcement of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) participation in  next week's non-racial election in South Africa, it is expected  the poll will proceed in an atmosphere of goodwill and  reconciliation.    The April 26-28 election is historically important to South  Africa as it is the result of the 300-year struggle of the South  African people, the blacks in particular.    Since the Dutch invaded the South African continent in 1652,  the black people have gradually become the slaves of the white  settlers.    Before the implementation of the 1993 interim constitution,  South Africa was the only country in the world which had  legalized the apartheid system.    The current election in South Africa symbolizes the end of  the inhuman apartheid system in the human history.    On April 19, or one week before the election, the Inkatha  Freedom Party -- the second biggest black party in South Africa  -- announced its participation in the election.    The South African press described the IFP's participation in  the election as ""a miracle.""    In reality, this is a natural result for the IFP after an  international mediation failed in the previous week.    If the IFP does not want to be a guerilla movement in a new  South Africa after the election, it has no other choice but to  participate in the election.    The IFP stands for a federal or confederate state in a  future  South Africa. It asked the international mediation over the  constitutional dispute between the IFP and its rival, the  African National Congress (ANC), so that the 1993 interim  constitution is amended and the election postponed.    The IFP can only become an opposition party if it does not  participate in the election after the failure of the  itnernational mediation.    IFP's decision to participate in the election has greatly  changed the political situation in South Africa.    The three major political players in South Africa, namely  the  ruling National Party, the ANC and the IFP, will all participate  in the election. They are expected to obtain 85 percent votes  of all the voters in the country.    On April 19, South African President F.W. de Klerk, ANC  president Nelson Mandela and IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi  signed an agreement and a joint statement in Pretoria.    The agreement said the three parties reject violence and are  committed to realize reconciliation and peace in South Africa.    The joint statement appealed to the South African people to  end violence, exercise maximum restraint and pursue their  objectives by peaceful means.    The agreement and the joint statement will create  circumstances conducive to the holding of a free, fair and  peaceful election in South Africa.    Buthelezi said his party will accept the election result so  long as the international community regards it free and fair.    After the IFP decision was declared, many Zulu people  expressed their ardent wish to participate in the election.    Buthelezi was given a hero's welcome and support when he  returned to Ulundi, capital of the Kwazulu homeland, on April 19  after the signing of the agreement and the joint statement.    Definitely, violence will greatly be reduced as the root  cause of the political conflicts between the IFP and the ANC  have been removed.    An amendment on the 1993 interim constitution was tabled in  the parliament on April 21.    The bill will be debated and approved at a special session  of  the parliament on April 25.    The bill makes provisions for the institution, role,  authority and status of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill  Zwelithini.    This is the result of a reconciliation among the ruling  national party, the ANC and the IFP.    Where will the seven million Zulu people go? it is important  to the result of the April 26-28 election.     "

At talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Manuel Marin, EC development commissioner, Mr Mandela is understood to have expressed a preference for accession to the Lome accord, rather than other options for EC-South African relations. The ANC president won EC pledges to help build a new civil service, army and police force, and Community support to prepare voters for multiracial elections next April. Mr Mandela said that while South African membership of Lome was under discussion, the republic's mixture of pockets of wealth surrounded by backwardness meant it should be regarded as an economy in transition, rather like the central European economies. The EC has progressive market access and substantial aid agreements with east and central Europe. But current thinking in Brussels favours a relationship with South Africa as part of a more integrated bloc of nations in southern Africa. This is based on the premise that Pretoria would join the Southern Africa Development Community, which South Africa already dominates economically by the strength of its trade and industrial links. EC officials are uncomfortable with the idea that South Africa, with comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture, a developed financial system, industrial capacity, and advanced transport and communications infrastructure, should be slotted into a format such as Lome designed to aid much less developed former colonies. Meanwhile in New York, the UN General Assembly yesterday agreed to end most economic sanctions against South Africa, two weeks after Mr Mandela, in an address to the world body, proposed lifting the restrictions However, the oil embargo will remain in place until the Transitional Executive Council agreed last month becomes operational, probably around the end of the year. In South Africa the government was yesterday criticised by the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress for an early morning raid on a home in Umtata, Transkei in which five people died. The PAC denied that the house was used by its military wing. Meanwhile, conservatives have formed the Freedom Alliance, grouping former members of the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) - Bophutatswana, Ciskei, Inkatha, the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront. At the same time, Bophutatswana and Ciskei withdrew from the negotiating council - the forum for multi-party talks - and ended all meetings with the government and ANC. The Alliance's short-term aim is to present a single, united negotiating team which will seek concessions on federalism from the ANC. In the longer term, it seeks to displace the National Party as the country's second largest political group behind the ANC.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT943-6379 ,"FT943-6379 _AN-EH3EIAA1FT 940830   FT  30 AUG 94 / Southern Africa harnesses SADC as engine for growth      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday handed over the country's new flag to Southern Africa Development Conference chairman Sir Ketumile Masire in Gaberone, Botswana, in a gesture that marked the start of a new era for the entire region. The formal accession of South Africa to the now 11-member SADC means that the organisation, originally devoted to reducing its members' links to their southern neighbour, is now regarded as the vehicle with the best chance of driving the region towards growth. The shift follows years during which SADC has been politically opposed to, but dependent on, South Africa. This spirit of co-operation between South Africa and SADC was by no means guaranteed. While most of the world rejoiced at the success of South Africa's elections earlier this year, the broader southern African community viewed the transition to democracy with mixed feelings. Although justifiably proud at their contribution to the overthrow of apartheid, many in the region feared that the African National Congress, once in power, might forget its debts, while South Africa's re-emergence on the global stage would divert much-needed aid and investment from its poorer neighbours. But, despite such concerns, the new South African government has placed regional co-operation at the forefront of its emerging foreign policy. In parliament two weeks ago, Mr Alfred Nzo, foreign minister, made clear that promoting good relations with other southern African states would be a priority. 'South Africa will actively encourage the movement to create a new form of political and economic interaction in southern Africa,' he said, while stressing his support for a new regional security mechanism that would complement SADC's economic activities. The new approach is a marked contrast to South Africa's previous policies. As the unquestioned regional superpower under former President PW Botha, the South African regime unabashedly used its economic and military might to prevent its black-run neighbours from successfully uniting in opposition to South Africa or helping to provide aid to the liberation movement. By helping to foment civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and showing little hesitation in launching cross-border military strikes to try to destroy ANC bases in other countries, South Africa garnered a well-deserved reputation as regional bully. It was in response to such activities that South Africa's neighbours formed SADC's precursor, the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), in 1980. Despite its admirable aims, however, SADCC proved unable to meet its objective of reducing its members' trade with South Africa. Not only did nearly all its members actually expand their economic relationship with South Africa over the past decade; few of the organisation's initiatives to improve regional infrastructure yielded any fruit. Now, however, the situation has changed drastically. Recognising the wider impact of political change in South Africa, the body renamed itself SADC in 1992, changing its primary focus from opposition to South Africa to economic development. And, with South Africa now a fully integrated member, the organisation is optimistic that it will finally be able to succeed in its goals. Yesterday's SADC summit was preceded by a two-day meeting of regional trade ministers and it is through trade that the main thrust of economic development is planned. Recognising the need to establish competitive, export-oriented industries, SADC intends to devote itself to the establishment of a regional trade treaty which will ultimately allow the free movement of goods, services and capital across all member states. However, most of the region's economies maintain complex trade and tariff regulations which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the relative size of South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a regional GDP of around Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries nervous of being flooded with cheaper South African goods should all restrictions be removed. Thus many observers feel that any short-term benefits flowing from a restructured SADC are likely to be political rather than economic. 'I can't see SADC successfully turning itself into a free trade area in the immediate future, but there is significant potential for the grouping, under South African leadership, to play the role of regional peacemaker,' says Mr Chris Landsberg, a foreign policy specialist at Johannesburg's Centre for Policy Studies. Acknowledging this possibility, the Frontline States organisation (a political grouping comprising all SADC members except Malawi, Lesotho and Swaziland and also originally designed to thwart South Africa) has decided to restructure itself into the political and security wing of SADC. It to play the role of mediator in regional conflicts. The scope for such activities has been demonstrated over the past week as SADC members have taken a stand to try to restore democracy to Lesotho after its king illegally dismissed the elected government. South African President Nelson Mandela has also played a role in helping to resolve remaining disagreements ahead of the planned Mozambican elections. Whether any of these initiatives, political or economic, prove successful remains to be seen. However the fact remains that, for the first time since most of SADC's members achieved independence, there is hope that, with South Africa at the forefront, the region might at last be able to reverse its economic decline.

AFRICA SKIRTS THE SANCTIONS;    WHEN IS A STEEL GIRDER NOT STEEL? WHEN IT COMES FROM SOUTH AFRICA. SOME IN  CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES.      By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HOUSTON      To some, the case of the South African steel seems to defy logic.    At the Houston Ship Channel, a $91-million bridge -- the largest ever financed  by the state -- is being built with steel girders produced in South Africa.    Never mind that there has been a ban on the importation of South African steel  since the United States imposed economic sanctions to protest apartheid in  1986. The bridge project is perfectly legal -- at least in the eyes of the Bush  Administration.    As the law is being interpreted, South African steel is, indeed, banned. But  girders are allowed in because they are a fabricated product one step removed  from the steel mill. In the language of government, a ""substantial  transformation"" had taken place.    ""The plain and simple answer is that it is not covered by the (anti-apartheid)  act,"" explained one Treasury Department official who requested anonymity.    While the distinction may be clear to Administration officials, it is not to  others. Critics accuse federal officials of splitting hairs in order to skirt  the sanctions, which Congress passed over President Ronald Reagan's veto.    The sanctions, which were not intended to be comprehensive, prohibit  importation of several South African goods, including iron, steel and  agricultural products and anything produced by companies in which the South  African government has a stake. The law also placed restrictions on what may be  exported to South Africa, as well as financial transactions.    Several members of Congress charge that the importing of South African steel  products illustrates how the Reagan and now Bush Administrations are  undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.    Millions of dollars of banned South African goods, from lobsters to textiles,  are coming into the United States despite the sanctions. And, according to  trade experts, American goods banned for export to South Africa are getting  there anyway.    A common theme of critics is that many goods are allowed to enter the United  States because of the U.S. Treasury Department's narrow interpretation of the  law and the failure of the State Department to identify products made by  so-called parastatals -- companies the South African government either controls  or partly owns.    At the same time, South African businessmen are said to use a number of  methods, including ""laundering"" shipments through other countries, as a way of  moving products into the United States and other countries that have imposed  trade embargoes.    The House Trade and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations  subcommittee has begun an inquiry into the steel imports. Rep. John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), the chairman, in a letter to then acting U.S. Customs Commissioner  Michael Lane, complained that the government ""appears still to be accepting the  most outrageous legal arguments of steel importers rather than trying to assess  the clear intent of Congress. . . .""    The legislation states that ""no iron or steel produced, or iron ore extracted,  in South Africa may be imported into the United States.""    The task of enforcing the law fell to the Office of Foreign Assets Control at  the Treasury Department, which identifies only 15 items as iron or steel  products.    A Treasury official argued that the list did indeed satisfy the intent of the  law and, in fact, may have gone beyond it by including items such as wire  products. Others, however, disagree with that interpretation.    ""The law absolutely bans all iron and steel from South Africa after Dec. 31,  1986,"" said Rep. John Bryant, (D-Tex.), who has become one of the major  proponents of broadening the sanctions.    Taking the 'Low Road'    Another who considers the interpretation to be too narrow is Gay McDougall,  director of the South Africa Project of the Washington-based Lawyers' Committee  for Civil Rights Under Law.    ""The (Reagan) Administration was on the record as being against these  sanctions,"" she said. ""Clearly, they took the low road in terms of enforcement  and implementation. They have taken the narrowest interpretation of the embargo  possible, and they haven't taken all the steps to fully implement it.""    Import figures show that the sanctions have had some effect, but by no means  have closed off trade with South Africa. In 1986, the year before the embargo,  the United States imported $301-million worth of iron and steel from South  Africa and, overall, imported goods worth more than $2.3 billion from that  country. In the following two years, more than $353.6-million worth of iron and  steel have been imported from South Africa, according to the U.S. Department of  Commerce.    Billions in Imports    The Bureau of the Census reported that since the beginning of 1987, more than  11,000 tons of goods categorized as ""other steel products"" have been imported  from South Africa.    In 1988, iron and steel ranked as the fourth-largest category of imports from  South Africa to the United States, according to Commerce Department statistics.  During that year, the last for which the Commerce Department had figures, the  United States imported more than $1.5-billion worth of goods from South Africa.    The figures are assumed to be conservative, since they do not count goods  transshipped through other nations.    Last April, for instance, Timothy Zwane, principal secretary for commerce,  industry and tourism in Swaziland, complained that South African firms were  using false documents to export goods as Swazi products. He cited as an example  a shipment of 50 tons of cut flowers, said to have originated in Swaziland,  that were exported to Europe, where sanctions against South Africa are also in  force. The only problem was that Swaziland produces nowhere near that amount of  flowers. He also pointed out that Swaziland does not grow apples, pears or  grapes.    ""Yet we constantly find, when we travel around (that) people talk about  Swaziland apples, pears and grapes,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Of course, we  are surprised.""    In another case, a U.S. Customs official described how an ostrich egg laid in  South Africa was transferred to another country, where it was hatched, and the  chick eventually was shipped to the United States. It was considered a legal  import because the chick was not hatched in South Africa. The same official  described how South African rock lobsters are allowed into the United States  because they are processed and shipped on vessels registered to another  country.    Last March, a former South African bank manager told a House subcommittee that  a number of European banks were using their New York offices to disguise South  African transactions, including some prohibited by the sanctions. Terry  Crawford-Browne, now an adviser to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he could not  document his allegations, but that his past banking experience led him to  believe this was occurring.    The United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations said in a report in  July that South Africa had responded to the sanctions by developing what is  widely known as ""unconventional trade.""    The report described a raft of methods used to get around the sanctions, from  simple mislabeling to transshipment through several countries. One example: A  chain of private trading companies passes formal title to the goods among  themselves until the real owner and destination are impossible to detect.    ""This is intended to confuse or deter monitoring through sheer complexity,"" the  report said. ""Invariably, the actual movement of the goods is much more direct.  In monitoring oil shipments to South Africa it has been observed that, whereas  the tanker sails directly from the port of loading to South Africa, title to  the cargo may change hands 10 to 15 times among traders and brokers in a number  of different countries.""    'Dutch Blend' Coal    The report also explained how South Africa ships coal to places where it is not  banned. It mentioned Rotterdam and Antwerp. The South African coal is then  mixed with shipments from other locales to obscure the coal's origin. In the  parlance of trade, the Rotterdam product is known as ""Dutch blend.""    Given the lax U.S. enforcement, many South African products need not take such  circuitous routes to reach America, McDougall of the South Africa Project said.  In the project's 135-page report last year, for example, McDougall was highly  critical of the Treasury Department's definition of uranium products covered by  the sanctions. While uranium and uranium oxide are banned, uranium hexafluoride  is not. Thus, she said, only uranium in its beginning and finished forms are  banned, while the products of interim processing may be imported and then  easily transformed.    ""The Treasury Department's interpretation permits easy circumvention of the  sanction,"" the report said.    Last August, a report of the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm  of the Congress -- said that sanctions against South Africa had been enforced  only partially because the State Department never gave Customs a detailed list  of parastatal products. It had only identified the parastatal companies.    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) one of the most ardent foes of South Africa's  white minority government, described the GAO's findings as showing a ""shocking  lapse by top Reagan Administration officials, who failed to apply elementary  enforcement procedures in carrying out the anti-apartheid laws.""    The whole question of sanctions is a tricky and controversial one that is  further complicated by the fact that the 1986 provisions were the first in  modern times enacted by the Congress rather than the President.    The Reagan Administration deemed sanctions to be counterproductive in any  effort to get the South African government to end its minority rule. But when  Congress overrode Reagan's veto, it did so in very selective fashion, with the  announced intent of hurting just the South African government's tax base, not  the citizenry.    As a result, the imports section specified only textiles, agricultural  products, iron and steel, coal and uranium and any article grown or produced,  manufactured or exported by a parastatal. It was not until 1987 that gold,  which accounts for about 45% of South Africa's export revenues, came under the  sanctions. At that time gold was defined as a parastatal product, the  government entity being the South African Reserve Bank.    Recently, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was  quoted as saying that the sanctions have been ""effective in bringing about new  thinking in Pretoria.""    McDougall and others say that the sanctions would be far more effective if they  were of the blanket variety imposed in the past against Libya, North Vietnam,  North Korea and other nations.    Others, including South African officials and many white South Africans who  oppose apartheid, follow the Reagan line of thinking. They say the U.S.  sanctions are hitting labor-intensive industries such as farming and coal  mining, and thus hurting the black South African labor force.    From that standpoint, ""the sanctions have been a complete failure,"" said  Michael Johns, a South African specialist at the conservative, Washington-based  Heritage Foundation.    The GAO, in a report released last month, addressed the question of whether  further restrictions on gold might be feasible. The conclusions were mixed, but  the report did point out that while gold is banned, much of it comes into the  United States anyway, as Italian jewelry.    The reason is that South Africa markets most of its gold through Britain and  Switzerland, and those countries then redistribute it. Almost all of the gold  that goes to Italy, the world's leading consumer, is made into jewelry, which  is then marketed around the world. The GAO said that 91% of all gold entering  Italy comes from South Africa.    Meanwhile, a member of the House oversight subcommittee said that hearings on  the importation of South African steel and steel products should begin in the  next several weeks, and that Treasury and Customs officials will be called to  explain their rationale on the importation of girders for the Texas bridge.    Rep. Bryant has sent the Treasury Department a letter requesting details of all  transactions in which iron and steel have been allowed into the United States  since the embargoes were imposed in 1986.    An aide to Sen. Kennedy said that an effort to tighten the sanctions will be  made during this session of Congress. (The House last year passed a bill to  widen the sanctions, but it did not make it to the Senate floor before the end  of that session.)

AFRICA SKIRTS THE SANCTIONS;    WHEN IS A STEEL GIRDER NOT STEEL? WHEN IT COMES FROM SOUTH AFRICA. SOME IN  CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES.      By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HOUSTON      To some, the case of the South African steel seems to defy logic.    At the Houston Ship Channel, a $91-million bridge -- the largest ever financed  by the state -- is being built with steel girders produced in South Africa.    Never mind that there has been a ban on the importation of South African steel  since the United States imposed economic sanctions to protest apartheid in  1986. The bridge project is perfectly legal -- at least in the eyes of the Bush  Administration.    As the law is being interpreted, South African steel is, indeed, banned. But  girders are allowed in because they are a fabricated product one step removed  from the steel mill. In the language of government, a ""substantial  transformation"" had taken place.    ""The plain and simple answer is that it is not covered by the (anti-apartheid)  act,"" explained one Treasury Department official who requested anonymity.    While the distinction may be clear to Administration officials, it is not to  others. Critics accuse federal officials of splitting hairs in order to skirt  the sanctions, which Congress passed over President Ronald Reagan's veto.    The sanctions, which were not intended to be comprehensive, prohibit  importation of several South African goods, including iron, steel and  agricultural products and anything produced by companies in which the South  African government has a stake. The law also placed restrictions on what may be  exported to South Africa, as well as financial transactions.    Several members of Congress charge that the importing of South African steel  products illustrates how the Reagan and now Bush Administrations are  undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.    Millions of dollars of banned South African goods, from lobsters to textiles,  are coming into the United States despite the sanctions. And, according to  trade experts, American goods banned for export to South Africa are getting  there anyway.    A common theme of critics is that many goods are allowed to enter the United  States because of the U.S. Treasury Department's narrow interpretation of the  law and the failure of the State Department to identify products made by  so-called parastatals -- companies the South African government either controls  or partly owns.    At the same time, South African businessmen are said to use a number of  methods, including ""laundering"" shipments through other countries, as a way of  moving products into the United States and other countries that have imposed  trade embargoes.    The House Trade and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations  subcommittee has begun an inquiry into the steel imports. Rep. John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), the chairman, in a letter to then acting U.S. Customs Commissioner  Michael Lane, complained that the government ""appears still to be accepting the  most outrageous legal arguments of steel importers rather than trying to assess  the clear intent of Congress. . . .""    The legislation states that ""no iron or steel produced, or iron ore extracted,  in South Africa may be imported into the United States.""    The task of enforcing the law fell to the Office of Foreign Assets Control at  the Treasury Department, which identifies only 15 items as iron or steel  products.    A Treasury official argued that the list did indeed satisfy the intent of the  law and, in fact, may have gone beyond it by including items such as wire  products. Others, however, disagree with that interpretation.    ""The law absolutely bans all iron and steel from South Africa after Dec. 31,  1986,"" said Rep. John Bryant, (D-Tex.), who has become one of the major  proponents of broadening the sanctions.    Taking the 'Low Road'    Another who considers the interpretation to be too narrow is Gay McDougall,  director of the South Africa Project of the Washington-based Lawyers' Committee  for Civil Rights Under Law.    ""The (Reagan) Administration was on the record as being against these  sanctions,"" she said. ""Clearly, they took the low road in terms of enforcement  and implementation. They have taken the narrowest interpretation of the embargo  possible, and they haven't taken all the steps to fully implement it.""    Import figures show that the sanctions have had some effect, but by no means  have closed off trade with South Africa. In 1986, the year before the embargo,  the United States imported $301-million worth of iron and steel from South  Africa and, overall, imported goods worth more than $2.3 billion from that  country. In the following two years, more than $353.6-million worth of iron and  steel have been imported from South Africa, according to the U.S. Department of  Commerce.    Billions in Imports    The Bureau of the Census reported that since the beginning of 1987, more than  11,000 tons of goods categorized as ""other steel products"" have been imported  from South Africa.    In 1988, iron and steel ranked as the fourth-largest category of imports from  South Africa to the United States, according to Commerce Department statistics.  During that year, the last for which the Commerce Department had figures, the  United States imported more than $1.5-billion worth of goods from South Africa.    The figures are assumed to be conservative, since they do not count goods  transshipped through other nations.    Last April, for instance, Timothy Zwane, principal secretary for commerce,  industry and tourism in Swaziland, complained that South African firms were  using false documents to export goods as Swazi products. He cited as an example  a shipment of 50 tons of cut flowers, said to have originated in Swaziland,  that were exported to Europe, where sanctions against South Africa are also in  force. The only problem was that Swaziland produces nowhere near that amount of  flowers. He also pointed out that Swaziland does not grow apples, pears or  grapes.    ""Yet we constantly find, when we travel around (that) people talk about  Swaziland apples, pears and grapes,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Of course, we  are surprised.""    In another case, a U.S. Customs official described how an ostrich egg laid in  South Africa was transferred to another country, where it was hatched, and the  chick eventually was shipped to the United States. It was considered a legal  import because the chick was not hatched in South Africa. The same official  described how South African rock lobsters are allowed into the United States  because they are processed and shipped on vessels registered to another  country.    Last March, a former South African bank manager told a House subcommittee that  a number of European banks were using their New York offices to disguise South  African transactions, including some prohibited by the sanctions. Terry  Crawford-Browne, now an adviser to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he could not  document his allegations, but that his past banking experience led him to  believe this was occurring.    The United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations said in a report in  July that South Africa had responded to the sanctions by developing what is  widely known as ""unconventional trade.""    The report described a raft of methods used to get around the sanctions, from  simple mislabeling to transshipment through several countries. One example: A  chain of private trading companies passes formal title to the goods among  themselves until the real owner and destination are impossible to detect.    ""This is intended to confuse or deter monitoring through sheer complexity,"" the  report said. ""Invariably, the actual movement of the goods is much more direct.  In monitoring oil shipments to South Africa it has been observed that, whereas  the tanker sails directly from the port of loading to South Africa, title to  the cargo may change hands 10 to 15 times among traders and brokers in a number  of different countries.""    'Dutch Blend' Coal    The report also explained how South Africa ships coal to places where it is not  banned. It mentioned Rotterdam and Antwerp. The South African coal is then  mixed with shipments from other locales to obscure the coal's origin. In the  parlance of trade, the Rotterdam product is known as ""Dutch blend.""    Given the lax U.S. enforcement, many South African products need not take such  circuitous routes to reach America, McDougall of the South Africa Project said.  In the project's 135-page report last year, for example, McDougall was highly  critical of the Treasury Department's definition of uranium products covered by  the sanctions. While uranium and uranium oxide are banned, uranium hexafluoride  is not. Thus, she said, only uranium in its beginning and finished forms are  banned, while the products of interim processing may be imported and then  easily transformed.    ""The Treasury Department's interpretation permits easy circumvention of the  sanction,"" the report said.    Last August, a report of the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm  of the Congress -- said that sanctions against South Africa had been enforced  only partially because the State Department never gave Customs a detailed list  of parastatal products. It had only identified the parastatal companies.    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) one of the most ardent foes of South Africa's  white minority government, described the GAO's findings as showing a ""shocking  lapse by top Reagan Administration officials, who failed to apply elementary  enforcement procedures in carrying out the anti-apartheid laws.""    The whole question of sanctions is a tricky and controversial one that is  further complicated by the fact that the 1986 provisions were the first in  modern times enacted by the Congress rather than the President.    The Reagan Administration deemed sanctions to be counterproductive in any  effort to get the South African government to end its minority rule. But when  Congress overrode Reagan's veto, it did so in very selective fashion, with the  announced intent of hurting just the South African government's tax base, not  the citizenry.    As a result, the imports section specified only textiles, agricultural  products, iron and steel, coal and uranium and any article grown or produced,  manufactured or exported by a parastatal. It was not until 1987 that gold,  which accounts for about 45% of South Africa's export revenues, came under the  sanctions. At that time gold was defined as a parastatal product, the  government entity being the South African Reserve Bank.    Recently, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was  quoted as saying that the sanctions have been ""effective in bringing about new  thinking in Pretoria.""    McDougall and others say that the sanctions would be far more effective if they  were of the blanket variety imposed in the past against Libya, North Vietnam,  North Korea and other nations.    Others, including South African officials and many white South Africans who  oppose apartheid, follow the Reagan line of thinking. They say the U.S.  sanctions are hitting labor-intensive industries such as farming and coal  mining, and thus hurting the black South African labor force.    From that standpoint, ""the sanctions have been a complete failure,"" said  Michael Johns, a South African specialist at the conservative, Washington-based  Heritage Foundation.

African Situation""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April  26-28 elections in South Africa.    The decision was announced by South African President  Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among  himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson  Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in  the poll is of great importance to the current situation in  South Africa.    The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest  political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the  three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in  the elections.    The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of  Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in  South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu  Homeland.    The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or  con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed  the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party  negttiations and adopted by the parliament.    The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later  asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to  submit its candidates for the elections.    Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other  foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt  to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and  IFP, but failed.    Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since  1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The  violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year.  More than 300 people died of violence monthly.    De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of  agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks  in Pretoria.    The memorandum said the three parties ""reject violence and  will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and  fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa.""    In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their  followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise  maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful  means.    The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will  greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa.    The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the  total South African people, are taking part in the elections.  This means a great change in the elections in South Africa.    Buthelezi said at a press conference today ""South Africans  may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of  unimaginable proportions.""    Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is ""a leap forward""  for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process.""    ""IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all  leaders and of all those who love South Africa,"" Mandela stated.     "

PTA, whose full name is Eastern and Southern Africa Trade and Development Bank, was set up in 1985 and has 14 shareholders including the African Development Bank, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mauritius and Burundi, where the bank is located. Today's issuance will be drawn from its Dollars 500m CP programme which is fully backed by a cash collateral account held in Bermuda. The programme is designed to protect CP holders from African risk, said Mr Francis Daniels, a senior adviser at Aidoo Group, a New York-based financial advisory group specialising in representing African governments and companies. Although PTA Bank is unrated, the structure of the programme has enabled it to secure a CP rating of A-1 plus from Standard  Poor's and F-1 plus from Fitch. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are the dealers for the programme. The proceeds will be used to support the bank's trade loans. The move towards democracy in South Africa has turned international investor attention to Africa but the depth of interest is far from clear. Earlier this year, a structured bond issue for the Republic of the Congo intended to raise Dollars 600m from international investors, had to be re-vamped and relaunched due to lack of demand for the original deal.

It will attend the  inauguration ceremony of Nelson Mandela, the new president of  South Africa, which will take place on 10 May.    At Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg, Shumeyko made the  following statement:    ""A solemn and joyful event in the life of South Africa --  the  inauguration of the first democratically elected president of  the country -- has brought this Russian delegation to South  Africa.    ""As is known, Russia has made a weighty contribution to the  cause of dismantling apartheid and ensuring a political  settlement in the RSA. In the fight against the system of  apartheid and in the process of establishing a negotiating  process, we developed close friendly relations with the  constructive forces in South Africa, which are now widely  represented in the leadership of South Africa. We intend to  maintain and strengthen these relations.    ""The RSA and Russia are experiencing a similar period of  renewal, a period of seeking the ways of future development  while overcoming the old mentality and difficulties of adapting  to the new realities. Who, therefore, is better qualified than  we are to better understand each other's problems and mutually  make use of the accumulated positive experience of social  reformation.""    The similarity of approach to many aspects of world politics  paves the way to partnership in international relations. Russia  maintains that the new South Africa must enter the world  community and its international bodies as an equal participant,  and that all remaining sanctions against it should be lifted  without delay. We are prepared to help South Africa in this  matter.    The delegation also brought a personal message from  President  Boris Yeltsin to President Nelson Mandela, congratulating him  and stating that the Russian leadership and all Russia's  citizens are ready to further promote bilateral cooperation with  the RSA in all areas, which would benefit both democratic Russia  and South Africa in the name of peace and prosperity.""    In an ITAR-TASS interview, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that  the RSA used to be associated mainly with apartheid. Now when  the democratic processes have begun in that country, just as  they have been in Russia, the whole world wishes it success on  this path.    Speaking of bilateral relations, the head of the Russian  Federation delegation said they are not beginning from scratch.  Since the sanctions against the RSA were lifted, many  cooperation opportunities in various fields have opened up  between the two countries that are building democracy.  Interparliamentary relations are of considerable importance.  Our countries have similar legislature in the economic sphere,  and this makes our contacts much easier. We hope that from the  outset we will start moving toward legislation that will take  into account the interests of each partner.     "

ACTION:     Public Notice.                 SUMMARY:     Notice is hereby given that it is no longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in South Africa. The Department of State will, on a case-by-case basis, consider all requests for licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise transfer defense articles or defense services to South Africa.            EFFECTIVE DATE:     June 8, 1994.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:        Dean A. Rogers, Office of Export Control Policy, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (2026474231).            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     It is the policy of the U.S. Government to review, on a case-by-case basis, all requests for licenses and approvals authorizing the export or other transfer to South Africa of items on the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121).          This notice implements U.N. Security Council Resolution 919 which terminated the mandatory U.N. Security Council arms embargo on South Africa which was imposed by Resolution 418 of November 4, 1977. The Council's actions follow the first all-race multiparty election and the establishment of a democratic South African Government inaugurated on May 10, 1994.    The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include manufacturing licenses, technical assistance agreements, technical data, and commercial military exports of any kind involving South Africa under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act.

The full text of the message follows:    To the OAU summit:    On the occasion of triumphant convocation of the 30th OAU  summit, I hereby extend to it my warm congratulations on behalf  of the Chinese Government and people.    The birth of new South Africa with Nelson Mandela as its  president, and its attendance at the current summit as the 53d  OAU member signify the inspiring great victory accomplished by  the OAU and all African people in the political field, showing  the further strengthening of unity and solidarity on the African  continent. The admission of new South Africa to the OAU has  added a new vitality to the African people in their efforts to  seek a better future under the banner of the OAU, and has also  ushered in a new epoch in the history of the OAU. We  wholeheartedly wish the African people constant, new successes  in their struggle to defend national independence and  sovereignty, safeguard Africa's solidarity and unity, and  improve living conditions.    We are glad to learn that the African Economic Community  Treaty has officially become effective. The acceleration of  Africa's economic integration is of great significance to  African people's revitalization of the African economy through a  collective self-reliance. It shows the firm will and  determination of African countries and people to become united  and make themselves stronger in an unfavorable international  environment. The Chinese Government and people greatly admire  their will and determination and wholeheartedly hope that the  African people's collective efforts in the economic field will  succeed.    With the changing international situation, it has become  more  and more important to maintain political stability in African  countries so as to facilitate their economic development.  Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in  particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the  economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the  international community. We firmly support the OAU in its  efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain  political and social stability in African countries.    A profound friendship has been forged between China and  African nations during long, common struggles. Under the  present complex international situation, we should even more  sympathize with and support each other, and make joint efforts  to strengthen Sino-African solidarity and cooperation. The  Chinese Government and people treasure very much the  Sino-African friendship. To strengthen friendship and  cooperation with Africa has always been an important part of the  foreign policy of the Chinese Government no matter how  international situation changes.    I am convinced that the current summit will certainly  achieve  its desired results and triumphantly accomplish the lofty  missions assigned by African nations and people.    I wish the summit a complete success!    [Signed] Li Peng, premier of the State Council of the  People's Republic of China    [Dated] 11 June 1994, Beijing.     "

President Zafy warmly welcomed Qian Qichen. He said: The  current visit will surely further enhance the development of  friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries.    Qian Qichen said: Sino-Malagasy relations have a sound  foundation. The Chinese and Malagasy Governments will make  joint efforts to continuously consolidate and develop the  friendship between the peoples of the two countries and push  forward the development of bilateral economic and technological  cooperation.    Qian Qichen conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards  and good wishes to President Zafy. He said: President Jiang  looks forward to President Zafy's visit to China this year.    President Zafy pointed out: Madagascar and China have many  points in common. The Malagasy Government highly treasures our  friendly ties with China.    Touching on the situation in Africa, Qian Qichen said: The  process of decolonization in Africa has taken nearly half a  century. Currently, the African nations are still in a stage of  exploring how to develop their own economies. He stressed: The  practice of China's construction has proven that one cannot gain  success by indiscriminately copying and imitating the  experiences of other countries. The important thing is to  proceed from the realities of your own country, combine them  with and draw from the experiences of other countries, while  seeking your own path of development.    President Zafy endorsed Qian Qichen's views. He said: The  African people are increasingly aware of the importance of  acting independently and having the initiative in their own  hands, and of relying on themselves to develop their countries.  Notwithstanding that presently Africa has encountered  difficulties, it has its own superiorities.    Earlier on, Malagasy speaker Andriamahazo met with Qian  Qichen, and both sides exchanged views on how to further  strengthen contacts between the national assemblies of the two  countries.

Presenting his last annual report before he retires, Sir Peter said: 'The notion that there is a link between crime and social deprivation is a compelling one . . . there is a need to offer hope to those most disadvantaged if we are to see any reduction in crime levels.' Sir Peter said that crime in London had increased 11 per cent last year, largely because the capital was seen as the natural mecca for criminals and most of the country's wealth was concentrated there. His report paints a stark picture of crime in the capital that last year included 75 per cent of the country's drugs market and 75 per cent of frauds. In addition, London, with a seventh of the country's population, last year suffered more than 50 per cent of all armed robberies, and 20 per cent of all murders and rapes. Sir Peter's report discloses that a total of 945,000 crimes were committed, a rise of 11 per cent, and 113,000 people were arrested, 3 per cent down on the previous year. The 41,000 casualties on London's roads left 369 dead, 7,000 seriously injured and 34,000 slightly hurt. In addition, 184,000 people and vehicles were searched resulting in 25,000 arrests.

0,FT943-10995 ,"FT943-10995 _AN-EHBDUAC7FT 940802   FT  02 AUG 94 / Personal View: Misleading portrait of the poor      By MARY CAMPBELL   'Income of poorest families down 17 per cent since 1979 as richest gain 62 per cent' was the shocking headline which followed the recent publication of a UK Department of Social Security report on low-income families*. A third of British children were declared to be living in poverty and the Child Poverty Action Group said 'we should be deeply ashamed'. It is true that the gap between the incomes of rich and poor has widened a lot under the Tories. But the headline statistics are creating a false - and in some cases dangerous - impression. Many of those who appear to be trapped in poverty are not as badly off as appears at first sight. On the other hand, the official statistics overlook the particular needs of some vulnerable groups who need additional support - notably pensioners and lone parents. There are three main ways in which the headline figures are misleading. First, poverty is often defined as being below half of average income. When this definition is used, people can fall into 'poverty' even when their income rises - if average incomes rise faster. A third of children may now be living below the poverty line, but it is the 1991-92 poverty line and this is much higher in real terms than that for 1979, the base year for many comparisons. Second, there is evidence that the very poor are richer in absolute terms than the poor of 1979, despite their 17 per cent fall in reported income. The same government report on low-income families showed that the average expenditure of the poorest 10 per cent ('decile') is actually higher than that of the next decile up. And some people in the bottom decile spend as much as those in the top decile. Some of these are the self-employed, who notoriously show up in statistics as spending more than their reported incomes. But the spending habits of the bottom decile indicate that only about a third are actually as poor as their reported income suggests. People on low incomes may be living off capital or borrowing; they may not report black market income; and some people are counted as low-income because they happened to earn little or nothing during the short data-collection period. More than half the bottom decile have cars, and their ownership of other consumer durables is much closer to average than in 1979. About half the bottom decile own their homes, well up on 1979, though fewer own them without a mortgage. As for the 17 per cent fall in real income, that is 'after housing costs'. Before allowing for housing costs, the reported income of the poorest decile has not fallen below 1979 levels, even at the peak of unemployment in 1991-92. Today's higher housing costs at least partly represent improved housing quality. As the reports says: 'There are indications that the bottom deciles experienced improvements in housing conditions, both absolutely and relative to the rest of the population.' Finally, and more controversially, the report fails to identify as poor some of those most in need of extra help. The statistics omit all those living in cardboard boxes or bed and breakfast accommodation, some of the poorest in society. They also do not allow for the extra needs of the old and people bringing up children alone, a high proportion of those on low incomes. Groups such as these get extra means-tested social security benefits. In practice, these help with the additional costs they face to maintain the same standard of living as fit young adults. Pensioners, for example, need more heat. Their failing teeth and eyes require hundreds of pounds of extra spending each year. They must pay for help with tasks that fit young adults can do themselves. Holidays can no longer take the form of humping rucksacks and sleeping rough. On the income side, earning opportunities are fewer. But the extra these groups get in social security benefits has the effect of making them appear better off in the statistics than they are in reality. If the social security department published an extra set of statistics which reflected those additional needs, the composition of the poorest sections of society would be more accurately determined. The rates used for the main means-tested benefit, income support, provide an easy basis for compiling such figures. In their present form, the statistics suggest that the elderly are no longer poor. The danger is that they could be used to argue for cuts in benefits for pensioners. An additional set of figures would avert this danger. Two other quick-and-easy policy changes would also help in narrowing the gap between the richest and poorest. One would be to restrict all tax allowances to the standard rate - including pension contributions and lump-sum pay-outs. The other would be to increase child benefit and make it taxable as part of the caring parent's income. These measures would bring down the income of top-rate taxpayers without increasing tax rates. They would help parents pay for the kind of childcare which best suits them, including the often neglected option of daytime care by parents themselves. And they would push families with children up the income scale even when temporarily unemployed. The other top priority shown up by the statistics should be to sort out the housing subsidy system - but that is another and even more complicated story.

They will be implemented once a non-racial transitional government is in place, Mr Edward Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, said yesterday. Mr Jaycox, who was on a brief stopover in London en route to the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, said the projects aimed to improve health, housing and education for South Africa's poor blacks. The World Bank stopped lending to South Africa when international sanctions were imposed against Pretoria's apartheid regime. But after two years of talks with both the government and the African National Congress, Mr Jaycox said prospects for renewing relations with South Africa were 'excellent'. Mr Jaycox stressed that World Bank loans to South Africa would not be on concessional terms, because of the country's relative wealth. The Bank's pledge follows similar promises of economic support for a democratic South Africa by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. The World Bank official was also keen to dispel the widespread image of the continent as a region of 'victims and losers'. For the first time in a generation, many countries were enjoying growth rates higher than the expansion of their populations. He was confident that tough structural adjustment programmes were beginning to bear fruit, despite an adverse international economic climate and the lukewarm commitment of many African governments to reform.

For the first time since 1945, he said, more than 10m people were living at or below the income support level. It would be surprising if child benefit survived the end of a fourth Tory term in government, he continued. For the government, Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, pledged that the value of child benefit, retirement pensions and disability benefits would be protected against inflation. He forced an admission from Mr Meacher that a few individuals earning less than Pounds 21,000 a year might pay more in national insurance contributions under Labour. That might arise in cases where there were marked fluctuations in weekly income levels, Labour admitted. However, Mr Newton found it difficult to cite the social security select committee to support his claim that people at all levels of income distribution had become better off under the Tories. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, emphasised that the smallest gains under the Conservatives had gone to the poorest individuals.

In this afternoon's meeting with the team of reporters who  accompanied him to the Mandela ceremonies, the Cuban president  described the South African president's election as an enormous  victory for the people of South Africa and for the world's  progressive forces.    It is a rebirth and proof that great victories can be  achieved in the wake of international disasters which have  occurred in the unipolar world in which we now live, Fidel  Castro said.    Asked by PRENSA LATINA about possibilities for cooperation  with the new South African Government, Cuba's top leader said:  ""There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we  share with South Africa.""    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    Regarding his first visit to this country, which a few years  ago was Cuba's battlefield enemy, Castro said: ""We were treated  very respectfully by all sectors of society, not only from the  ANC [African National Congress], but also from the Indian,  white, and mestizo sectors, taking into account that this is a  multiracial country in which millions of people feel the need to  cooperate with one another.""    There are two South Africas, the Cuban president said. At  various occasions in South African history, there were times of  violent clashes, but now there is a new South Africa in which  there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.    Castro believes the ANC government has a very difficult task  ahead of it, because ""even though it is a relatively developed  country, there is a huge population that has lived for a long  time under apartheid, and it has the needs and yearnings of a  majority which has been discriminated against.""    When referring to his first visit to this southern African  nation, Fidel Castro said, ""with few countries do we have such  heart-felt and fraternal ties as those we have cultivated over  so many years with South Africa and the ANC. [no closing  quotation marks as received]    Every time one speaks to a South African, one first notices  the great spiritual possibilities that exist, Castro said.    In discussing diplomatic relations, Castro said, ""We should  consider them when it is right for them, at an opportune  moment."" Cuba will be very honored to develop its relations  with South Africa, he said.    I see evolving events in this country as something  marvelous,  and my greatest wish is that this country achieves peace and  harmony, something we all must contribute to enable the efforts  and sacrifices made by this a country to serve as a model for  the entire world, the Cuban leader underscored.    Regarding today's swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed  by more than 5,000 South Africans at the Union Building  amphitheater, Castro said: ""The coming together of all South  Africans and all ethnic groups was beautiful. We hope that the  process continues to progress in this direction.""    Today in South Africa, we helped bury apartheid and assisted  in the birth of liberty, Fidel Castro said.    This is the first time that a high-ranking official Cuban  delegation has stepped onto South African soil.    Both countries faced each other on the battlefield between  1976-91, when Cuban troops went to assist Angola at their  request, to safeguard its independence and territory, which had  been threatened by military forces backed by the racist Pretoria  regime.

Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South  Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey  and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the  problem and ""go into action"" soon.    But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress,  blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out  sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month  in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban  townships.    ""Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it)  to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible,"" Mandela,  flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news  conference. He added that the trouble ""indicates the rejection by the masses of  the people"" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called  independent homelands for blacks.    Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe,  Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has  been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days  of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted  during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa  in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South  African constitution.    Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi  drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three  people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that  armed black attackers were poised to invade.    Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in  Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking  the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and  meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R.

The escalating unrest has complicated those talks by giving the government a  reason to retain its powers to quell violence under the state of emergency.

Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South  Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey  and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the  problem and ""go into action"" soon.    But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress,  blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out  sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month  in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban  townships.    ""Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it)  to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible,"" Mandela,  flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news  conference. He added that the trouble ""indicates the rejection by the masses of  the people"" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called  independent homelands for blacks.    Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe,  Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has  been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days  of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted  during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa  in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South  African constitution.    Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi  drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three  people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that  armed black attackers were poised to invade.    Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in  Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking  the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and  meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R. Tambo. He was escorted from his  airport news conference here to a daylong concert by South African artists held  in his honor.    This week, Mandela is scheduled to attend independence celebrations in Namibia,  which formally ends 75 years of South African colonial rule Wednesday.    During the week, Secretary of State James A.

0,FT922-14359 ,"FT922-14359 _AN-CDGBIADFFT 920407   FT  07 APR 92 / EC lifts embargo on oil exports to South Africa      By DAVID BUCHAN, PHILIP GAWITH and DEBORAH HARGREAVES      LUXEMBOURG, JOHANNESBURG   THE European Community yesterday lifted its ban on oil sales to South Africa, and paved the way for renewed sporting, cultural and scientific links. The moves brought an instant welcome from Dr Bhadra Ranchod, South Africa's ambassador to the EC, who said his country had had to compensate for the embargo by spending more on synthetic fuels, on stockpiling oil imported from other sources, and on prospecting for oil within South Africa and its waters. EC oil companies established in South Africa, such as Shell and BP, would be far freer to operate there, Dr Ranchod said. The decision paves the way for countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium to re-negotiate the cultural accords they broke off in 1985 when United Nations and EC sanctions were stepped up. South African academics and students will also have easier access to European universities, Dr Ranchod said. The only remaining EC sanctions on South Africa are those mandated by the UN Security Council banning the sale of arms to, and the exchange of military attaches with, South Africa. Oil industry operators in South Africa welcomed the unexpected announcement, but noted that the Community's decision will have limited financial impact. For the past few years South Africa has been buying its crude at world prices, paying little if any premium. The diminished impact of the embargo was already evident last year when the government announced it would sell part of its strategic reserve to finance social upliftment. It will, however, allow South Africa to diversify its sources of supply. The country will also be able to trade crude oil products openly. What remains unclear is the extent to which yesterday's announcement will undermine the United Nations embargo which remains. Locally, it will provide added impetus for the decentralisation of oil procurement, which has been controlled by the Central Energy Fund. Shipping Research Bureau, an Amsterdam based monitoring group, estimated that South Africa's oil imports cost Dollars 1.6bn in 1989. Demand is about 30 per cent below that of the mid-1970s due mainly to progress made by South Africa in achieving a level of self-sufficiency through developing a synthetic fuel industry which converts coal to oil and gas. Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil traders do not believe the EC move will have much impact on world prices. 'We could see some temporary distortions in the trade flows of certain oil products,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, 'but there will be no huge spate of demand opened up.'

Several  personalities, in particular Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba,  the speaker of the National Assembly, members of the government  and the presidential staff went to welcome him at Bangui  airport. [passage omitted]    Soon after his arrival at the Palais de la Renaissance, the  president reviewed the Ndjamena summit. He recalled the signing  of the treaty and agreements establishing the Economic and  Monetary Community of Central African States [CEMAC], the  Monetary Union of Central Africa, and the Economic Union of  Central Africa. The quality of discussions held by the UDEAC  heads of state was very much appreciated. In fact, they did not  merely content themselves with approving the reports drawn up by  experts and ministers. On the contrary, they carried out a  detailed examination of the documents submitted to them. The  issues discussed at the summit consisted of economic and  regional integration, the situation of the Bank of Central  African States, and a report on the opening up of the region,  presented by the Central African Republic.    President Ange Felix Patasse also appealed for  reconciliation  between the Chadian Government and Moise Kette's movement  operating in southern Chad, the National Awakening Committee for  Peace and Democracy. Alain-George Ngatoua has given us a full  report on President Patasse's Ndjamena trip:    [Begin Patasse recording] I would like to tell you how happy  I feel to be among you this 17 March, for, within days, we will  be marking the anniversary of the tragic death of President  Barthelemy Boganda. In Ndjamena, we contributed much to the  success of the UDEAC summit. We have remained faithful to its  spirit and I am happy to announce that at long last Central  Africa is coming out of its deep slumber. We have understood  that our destinies are linked together. Central Africa is  lagging far behind the others because of national chauvinism.  At the same time that we held our summit in Ndjamena, West  Africa was also holding its summit. While all the West African  heads of state were present at their summit, some leaders in our  subregion were absent. You will understand the anguish we felt  some time ago. So if we left Bangui for Ndjamena, it was not  simply to accept the UDEAC secretary general's report, but  because we wanted to breathe new life into this institution by  taking a decisive step.    It was a choice between continuing to tread the same  well-trodden paths or to carry out a radical restructuring. We  opted for the latter solution. Yes, Central Africa is coming  out of its long sleep and those who want to remain within this  general dymamic awakening movement will do so, but those who do  not want to do so -- and it is a question of state sovereignty  -- are free not to go along with the others.    As far as we are concerned, we have stated that the treaty  establishing the economic and monetary community in Central  Africa must be signed at all costs. We have also said that it  was not obligatory to sign the treaty on the same day and at the  same place. Each country can do so within the framework of its  peculiar institutions. On this score, the host country  submitted the draft treaty for signature. Chad, Congo, and the  Central African Republic have signed the treaty. The president  of Equatorial Guinea could not be present at Ndjamena and  delegated this responsiblity to his deputy prime minister, so  Equatorial Guinea has also signed. Cameroon sent only the  president of its Economic and Social Council, who did not even  have a mandate to initial the document. However, since the  current chairmanship of the UDEAC has fallen to Cameroon, the  ball is in that country's court. We have decided to walk hand  in hand, and that is the determining factor. The community has  been born. [passage omitted] [end recording]     "

The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South  Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days  here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with  the EU.    ""We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing  to do business with us,"" committee member Stella Sigcau said.    Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South  Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the  community following its first all-race elections next month.    The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political,  trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections,  to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades.    The South African authorities, including the African  National  Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for  a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the  post-apartheid economy.    But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South  Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring  African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can  be more widely spread.    A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin  said  it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to  join regional groupings.    These include the Southern African Development Community,  originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid  South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP)  group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention.    ""But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will  still be important to stimulate regional development,"" he said.    South African Manpower Minister Leon Wessels, a member of  the  delegation, said: ""There has been a greater convergence of  ideas. We feel ourselves closer to the heartbeat of southern  African.""    South African Ambassador to the EU Neil van Heerden spoke of  an ""emerging consensus"" about EU-South African relations, and  said he was confident that agreement could be reached ""on a fast  track"" after next month's elections.

Descendants of that woman, whom scientist have dubbed ""Eve,"" started migrating  north out of Africa 75,000 years ago and had fully settled in southern Europe  35,000 years ago, displacing the indigenous Neanderthal population, said  molecular biologist Allan C. Wilson. The Neanderthals were dispossessed because  they were genetically incompatible with the humans of African origin, Wilson  said at an international genetics conference.    The new evidence also indicates that early males may have roamed rather freely  throughout Africa nearly 100,000 years ago while females stayed firmly rooted,  suggesting that sharp changes in cultural interaction of men and women occurred  over a period of about 30,000 years.      Basis of Conclusions    Wilson reached his conclusions by studying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the  genetic blueprint of humans) found not in the nucleus of cells, where most  genes are stored, but in mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell that are  the source of the cell's energy. Mitochondria have only 37 genes, compared to  the estimated 100,000 found in the cell's nucleus, making them much easier to  study.    Unlike genes in the nucleus, which are inherited from both parents, genes in  mitochondria are passed down only from mothers. Because of this, researchers  can trace maternal lineages unaffected by contributions from males.    Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are believed to occur at a constant rate over  long periods of time. By studying the differences between mitochondrial DNA  from two women, for example, researchers can determine how long ago they shared  a common female ancestor. When many women are used, the technique also reveals  where that ancestor lived.    Using mitochondrial DNA from placentas, Wilson and his colleagues reported in  1987 that all modern humans are descended from a woman who lived in southern  Africa about 200,000 years ago, a woman who has subsequently become known as  Eve or ""the mother of us all."" That finding does not mean that only one woman  was alive then. Rather, it means that the lineages that descended from all  other women eventually died out -- a phenomenon that is common in biology.    By comparing every possible pairing among the 147 people tested in the study,  the researchers concluded that Eve could only have lived in Africa.    Although other researchers generally accept Wilson's methodology, they  criticized two aspects of his studies: the fact that he used black Americans in  his study as a surrogate for Africans, and the speed of his so-called  ""molecular clock."" The molecular clock is a measure of the rate at which  mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, and critics charged that Wilson's was too  fast, placing Eve too near us in time.    In his current study, Wilson used newly developed biochemical techniques that  allowed him to study the mitochondrial DNA contained in a sample as small as a  single hair. Because he could use hairs, he was able to obtain specimens from  two hunter-gatherer tribes in central Africa and from the !Kung bushmen of  southern Africa, who would not have donated placentas for such a study. (The  spelling of !Kung denotes a clicking sound in the pronunciation of the K.)    He was also able to perform similar studies on chimpanzees, which helped him  achieve a finer calibration of his molecular clock.    ""We have been able to refute both criticisms,"" Wilson told a meeting of  geneticists.    Based on the new data, he said, Eve lived in southern Africa 142,000 years ago.  ""We are all a derivative of one of the !Kung lineages,"" he said.    The data further show that humans -- men and women together -- began migrating  out of Africa into the Middle East about 75,000 years ago. By 35,000 years ago,  they were firmly established in southern Europe, displacing the Neanderthals  who had lived there.    That agrees with archeological data, thereby confirming the accuracy of his  molecular clock. The fact that Neanderthal women made no contribution to the  gene pool indicates, he said, that a fundamental genetic incompatibility  existed between the two groups.    Although men and women began migrating out of Africa 75,000 years ago, men must  have begun moving around and exploring the continent much earlier, he said.  Evidence for this was provided by the genes of the three groups of African  women.    In those stages men did all the exploring and left women to tend to the home,  whereas later the family group was clearly more important and migrated as a  unit.    Wilson found virtually no overlap in the mitochondrial DNA from the three  groups, indicating that the females had stayed put for periods long enough for  gene differences to develop -- many tens of thousands of years. To his  surprise, however, Wilson found an almost complete overlap in key nuclear  genes, which are inherited from both parents.

0,FT931-6606 ,"FT931-6606 _AN-DCACUAA8FT 930301   FT  01 MAR 93 / China boosts trade drive in S Africa      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   CHINA will extend its trade drive to South Africa next month when it opens its first trade fair there, a move that suggests that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Pretoria may not be far off. About 80 Chinese companies will participate in the Trade Expo organised by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and to be held in Johannesburg from April 19 to 25. The CCPIT-organised fair in South Africa is one of 22 planned internationally and coincides with a rapid increase in China's exports, expected to reach Dollars 100bn (Pounds 70.4bn) this year. China's efforts further to accelerate its trade growth - it is expected to leap into the top 10 of the world's trading nations this year - comes as Beijing intensifies its attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China and the US formally resume Gatt talks in Beijing this week after a three-year break following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. China and South Africa last year established visa-issuing representative offices known as 'research centres' in each other's capitals as preparation for full normalisation. China, which has been discreetly trading with South Africa for many years, has said that formal relations would follow further constitutional reforms, including agreement on a national unity government pending elections. The foreign ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. South Africa's Mr Pik Botha visited Beijing in 1991 and China's Mr Qian Qichen went to Pretoria last year. Gold-hungry Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of Dollars 4.3bn on gold jewellery last year, according to China's official Business Weekly. Quoting a report of the Geneva-based World Gold Council, the newspaper said that, based on 'conservative estimates', jewellery sales in China exceeded 250 tons. This was equivalent to one quarter of all the gold sales in Asia - a region that is traditionally a big gold consumer. Taiwanese buy about 10 grams of gold on average a year, Hong Kong residents 6 grams and China 1.8 grams. The huge Chinese demand for gold jewellery has been partly spurred by concerns about the depreciating value of the local currency - the renminbi - and also by growing affluence in a country where economic growth last year topped 12 per cent. The World Gold Council, an association of producers, said that it would devote more resources to developing the gold market in China. It planned to target women consumers. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has purchased large quantities of gold in the past year, but the Chinese have not disclosed details. China has not divulged the extent of its gold reserves for more than 10 years.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana  Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr.  Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V.  Obeng; the chairman of the Council of State, Alhaji Mumuni  Bawumiah; Captain Kojo Tsikata, a member of the Council State;  and service commanders.    Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief  director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho,  said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the  rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over  wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of  division. He said the most important lesson that came out of  the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black  majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so  that they can move into the new democratic era in unity.    Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings  seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They  included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore  of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife  of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of  Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the  situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade.    On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President  Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to  commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President  Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to  improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho  said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in  South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their  efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on  the continent.

0,FT933-8301 ,"FT933-8301 _AN-DHQCUABQFT 930817   FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: South Africa chafes at customs link      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   THE Southern African Customs Union meets today in Swaziland to discuss its future amid increasing indications that South Africa, the senior partner, wishes to revise the terms of its participation. Sacu - consisting of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho  -has existed in various guises for more than 100 years, and has been the most successful of the regional economic structures in southern Africa. Domestic fiscal pressures, however, have led over the past year to vocal protests in South African government circles that the system cannot continue in its current form. The root of the complaint is that while South Africa contributes 90 per cent of all revenue to the customs pool, its share of receipts has declined to 44 per cent from 73 per cent a decade ago. In the case of countries like Lesotho and Swaziland, these payments amount to more than a third of national income. In the 1991/2 fiscal year, South Africa paid more than R4.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) to other Sacu members, with about 40 per cent going to the nominally independent homelands in South Africa. According to Mr Gerhard Croeser, director general of the Department of Finance, today's meeting is 'just to have an exchange of views, not to make demands'. South Africa is too close to implementing new transitional government arrangements for any big policy shifts. Although the discussions will be technical in nature, they do have important ramifications, particularly for the future of regional economic co-operation. As Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said earlier this month, the issue is not whether South Africa should be making the payments. 'All I am saying is that you cannot justify the size of these payments in terms of the Customs Union. If we were to include other potential members into this arrangement, our system would run downhill at a rate which would be truly alarming.' If the Sacu formula is amended so as to make it possible for other countries to join - and some have expressed interest - this would cast serious doubts over the future of the Southern African Development Community as the premier regional vehicle for economic integration. The other main item up for discussion will be the terms of South Africa's revised tariff offer to Gatt in the Uruguay Round. Due to be tabled by the end of the month, it is likely to involve a cut in the number of tariff lines from 12,000-plus to about 1,000, and a substantial cut in the average level of protection. The issue will be how to reconcile South Africa's tariff policy with the needs of other Sacu members, all of whose economies are much less developed.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The president was  addressing a crowd which gathered at the parliamentary buildings  in Kampala today to celebrate the end of apartheid in South  Africa. Mr. Museveni said that it is a great achievement to see  that this sad chapter in human history has come to an end. He  also congratulated Mr. de Klerk for changing his mind from his  original stand and join the people of South Africa in the move  toward this new chapter.    Mr. Museveni paid tribute to the people of South Africa who  sacrificed a great deal in the struggle for freedom. He singled  out Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, (Subukwe) among others as  people who refused to surrender their right to freedom despite  the terrible hardships they went through. He also paid tribute  to African leaders who made significant contributions to the  freedom struggle, whom he enumerated as Julius Nyerere, Kenneth  Kaunda, Samora Machel, Kwame Nkrumah, 'Abd-al-Nasir, Ben Bella,  Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, Sekou Toure, and Robert Mugabe. Mr.  Museveni said that with this new chapter in South Africa, Africa  is now free from the Cape to Cairo. He cautioned, however, that  Africa is only free in the broad-based sense, because there are  still many problems to solve, such as the present conflicts in  Rwanda, Burundi, the Sudan, and Angola. He also pointed out  that the combined gross domestic product of South Africa, East  Africa, and Nigeria is still smaller than the gross domestic  product of a small country like Belgium.    The president, who acknowledged the presence of ANC soldiers  at the celebrations, said that since the National Resistance  Movement came to government in 1986, it has given assistance to  the ANC in line with the OAU policy. This assistance culminated  in the receiving of ANC soldiers in Uganda after they were  forced to leave Angola in order to pave the way for the  independence of Namibia. [passage omitted]     "

Guo Zhanyuan, director of the Regional Committee for  Agricultural Development, said that since 1982, a massive  farmland improvement campaign has increased the area's irrigated  farmland by more than 30,000 ha and ordinary farmland by 120,000  ha.    Compared with ten years ago, the farmland per person in the  area has risen from less than 0.06 ha to 0.12 ha in 1993, and  the grain output for each person went up from 92 kg to 275 kg.    In the same period, the average income for each farm  increased from 126 yuan to 375 yuan a year.    With a population of 2.1 million in an area of 39,000 square  km, Xihaigu was once one of the poorest areas in China, due to  poor farming conditions caused by dry climate, infertile soil  and severe water loss and soil erosion.    Seeing that improving the farming conditions was critical to  the fight against poverty, the local government launched a  massive campaign to create more irrigated farmland and to  transform broken hillsides into larger pieces of terraced land.    The larger and flatter pieces of land are not only easier to  cultivate, they also retain more water and reduce erosion of  soil and fertilizers, and can therefore increase grain output by  one half.    Encouraged by the initial success, the farmland improvement  campaign is proceeding on a larger scale and with better  planning. More and more bulldozers are being used.    Guo Zhanyuan said the area plans to create 200,000 ha of new  farmland in ten years, so that the area of farmland per person  will rise to 0.2 ha.    If that goal is achieved, the area's population will be able  to get rid of poverty completely, Guo said.     "

But he was at fault in re-cycling so much misinformation in the context of his review. For example, he says 'the argument about poverty is straightforward'. Would that it were] The land conversion factors comparing the productivity of cereals, legumes, leafy vegetables and cattle assume the same high quality land, whereas most grazing land is too cool, too wet, too dry, too high, too steep or too rough to be used for crops. And so, worldwide, 80-85 per cent of the nutrients fed to cattle are not edible by humans. World hunger experts know the real causes of hunger are poverty and distribution - not cows. This is just one example of the incorrect information in Mr Rifkin's book. There are many others. It is sad that Mr Prowse has chosen to reiterate Mr Rifkin's book rather than offer a critical review.

Long  awaited by current South African leaders, this visit should  render official the ""normalization"" of relations between the two  countries after a decade of open hostility.    With just four months to go to the first multiracial,  general  elections, Edouard Balladur's government is seeking to give  greater emphasis to ""French support for the current process of  transition,"" a communique from Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry]  indicated. The visit by the foreign minister therefore marks  his ""confidence in the South Africa of tomorrow and in its will  to give new impetus to bilateral relations,"" the communique  added.    Edouard Balladur showed his interest in the development of  democracy in South Africa with a private visit a few months  before last year's legislative elections. For the future prime  minister of a government of the right, it was primarily a  question of renewing contact with the ANC [African National  Congress], which had previously maintained ""exclusive"" relations  with the Socialist government. Spearheading a Western crusade  against the apartheid regime, in 1985 Laurent Fabius  unilaterally imposed economic sanctions against South Africa, a  decision that ranked France clearly alongside the ANC while  concurrently benefiting its principal competitors -- Great  Britain and Germany, which did not follow its lead.    Following in the footsteps of Edouard Balladur, Alain Juppe  -- who will meet President Frederik de Klerk; ANC President  Nelson Mandela; and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu  Inkatha Party -- must complete this rebalancing, which is  essential to new French policy in Africa. In fact, France has  been trying for several months now to secure ""fruitful  partnership relations"" with South Africa, the most advanced  country in Africa and the continent's future center of  development. There is a need to find additional outlets for  French companies which, despite some spectacular deals (such as  selling seven A-320 Airbuses and doubling investments (3  billion francs) in three years), have little chance of making up  for lost ground on the South African market.

In a report - expected to be legislated by the new government later this year - the authorities declared their commitment to overall restructuring of operations, with emphasis on increasing market participation by both foreigners and black investors. The exchange will run a series of investor workshops and encourage the listing of small black companies, while also permitting limited corporate membership and some foreign ownership of local brokerages for the first time. After years of sanctions and isolation, during which many overseas buyers, particularly Americans, stopped even considering South African stocks, interest has resurfaced over the past six months. The recent boom, which has seen the major indices hit a series of new highs, has been largely foreign driven. Several specialist Africa funds have been formed, most notably Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m Africa Fund and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern Africa fund, both of which are overwhelmingly concentrated on the South African market. More are expected. As South Africa is increasingly added to global market indices, such the IFC data base on emerging markets, a greater proportion of international investment capital will almost certainly make its way to the country. With a current market capitalisation in the region of Dollars 160bn, the exchange is the 11th largest globally, and much more mature and sophisticated than most comparable markets in the developing world. With foreigners expected to be allowed to participate shortly, it is already widely rumoured that major London firms have expressed interest in partnership with local brokerages, a move that will likely generate further foreign business down the line.

It has identified itself as the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan  [Kurdistan Islamci Hareketi, IMK]...    The IMK militants attacked the supporters of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan, which is headed by Jalal Talabani. The  attacks took place last Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. The  militants also clashed with the supporters of Mas'ud Barzani,  leader of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The incidents were  in Raniyah, Kifri, and Kujah...    The Hizballah in Iraq has established itself in Kuldazah and  Raniyah, which are close to Iran's border. That organization is  not represented in the Federal Assembly of Kurdistan, which is  based in Irbil, because it only secured 5.1 percent of the votes  in the elections in 1992. Seven percent of the vote was needed  for representatin.    Iran's Support    The Hizballah organization in Iraq is mainly supported by  Tehran... It has received aid from Iran in the form of cash,  arms, and provisions, particularly since 1991. That is common  knowledge. According to Ahmad Bamarni, who is a close associate  of Jalal Talabani, the Hizballah organization is also supported  by Saudi Arabia and even by Afghanistan... That organization's  ideology is based on Imam Khomeyni's teachings. Naturally, that  provides for Tehran's support... Nevertheless, the Hizballah  members have not renounced their religious sect. They are the  followers of the Sunni sect. Of course, that accounts for Saudi  Arabia's support.    The recent weakening of the economy in northern Iraq has had  a significant bearing on the strengthening of the Hizballah  organization. The gradual worsening of poverty has disappointed  the people in the region. Consequently, that state of affairs  has nourished Islamic radicalism, as has been the case among the  Palestinian people and in Algeria. Obviously, Islamic  radicalism has strengthened as a result of poverty and the  central administration's failures.    Beards and Islamic Dress    We met Ahmad Bamarni a few days ago. Referring to the  Hizballah organization, he said: ""We have a university in  Irbil. It provides education for 5,000 students. We have  colleges for agricultural and medical studies in Dahuk. We also  have an institute for veterinary studies and a medical college  in al-Sulaymaniyah... Students from many families do not attend  them because they are poor. However, the IMK gives them an  opportunity to study, provided that the male students wear a  beard and female students wear Islamic dress. In fact, the  number of young people who join this organization is gradually  increasing.""    Yes, the Hizballah organization employs several tactics to  strengthen itself. Meanwhile, it also helps many people to have  their own shops or establish their own businesses. I have  observed the poverty in northern Iraq. In view of that, I am  aware of what can be achieved even through small amounts of  material aid.    What Does Tehran Fear?    What does Tehran, which supports the Hizballah organization,  wish to achieve in northern Iraq? Bamerni replied as follows:    The Hizballah organization is playing Iran's game. Tehran  wishes to create instability in northern Iraq. Iran's military  aircraft repeatedly bombed the northern Iraq border area some  time ago. That country closed its border about three weeks ago.  It closed down the border gates that give access to  al-Sulaymaniyah, Hajj 'Umran, and Irbil... What worries Tehran  is this: A democratic, pluralistic, and secular system is being  established in northern Iraq for the first time. Political  parties exists in Irbil and other large cities. There are  newspapers, magazines, and radio networks. The people are  expressing their opinion. The people also appear on television.  The modernization process has made Tehran feel very uneasy.  Iran's officials fear that the Kurds in Iran and the rest of  Iraq may decide to adopt a similar model. They believe that  that would be an unfavorable example for their country.

December 31 marked more than the end of just another year.  It also marked the end of an era, he said.    Next year South Africa would, for the first time, have a  multiparty government that would be truly representative of all  its people. ""For the first time we will have a system where the  constitution and the bill of rights -- and not politicians in  Parliament -- will have the final say,"" Mr de Klerk said.    For the first time South Africa would have a constitutional  system containing effective checks and balances against the  misuse of power.    Important among these would be independent courts, including  an independent constitutional court with wide-ranging powers.    Equally important would be the establishment of strong and  autonomous provinces, with important powers and functions  effectively entrenched.    Mr de Klerk said South Africa faced three challenges in the  new year, the first being to let democracy succeed. ""The second  challenge...will be to make our economy work to the benefit of  all our people. Success in the economic field will be as  important as success in the constitutional field.""    Democracy and elections would not by themselves bring all  the  things that people needed, said the president. ""We will not be  able to create jobs and build all of the houses, schools and  clinics that we need, unless there is money to pay for them.  And the only way that we can get this money is to ensure that  our economy grows as quickly and as strongly as possible.""    This would require hard work, new investments and expanding  exports. ""To achieve this, the new government of national unity  will have to follow the right policies -- policies that have  succeeded throughout the world.""    ""The third great challenge that we will face will be to  build  a new South African nation; to break out of the conflicts of the  past; to break through to reconciliation,"" said Mr de Klerk.     "

[Figueres] Good evening, Don Jacobo. It is nice to say hello  to you.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much. Congratulations on your  victory. What do you hope to accomplish in Costa Rica?    [Figueres] Thank you. I greatly appreciate your kind words.  Ahead of me I have the clear responsibility to fight poverty --  the main problem we face as a country -- in two areas. One is  the impoverishment process suffered by our middle class, the  backbone of our democratic system and our national production.  The other area in which we need to fight poverty is the poverty  and extreme poverty some sectors of our population are living in.    [Figueres] Jose Maria, you are the son of someone who was a  great friend of mine -- the three times Costa Rican President  Don Jose Figueres, whom I remember very fondly. He also tried  to end poverty in Costa Rica and was unsuccessful. What are  your plans to accomplish this?    [Figueres] Don Jacobo, I believe this is an endless  struggle,  and there are always new wars to wage. The important thing is  to persevere. The important thing is to have the social  awareness, to admit that Costa Rica has been successful in many  fields because we have always been a country united in  solidarity. Costa Rica should not lose our fatherland's  solidarity in the face of modernizing and integrating into the  world economy. We have indeed advanced toward globalization  since 1982, during the administration of Don Luis Alberto Monge,  but we want to be able to participate in the world economy in a  much more intelligent way -- a way in which we can offer the  benefits of this integration to all sectors of our society and  not only to a select few.    [Zabludovsky] Do you intend to seek admittance into NAFTA?    [Figueres] We are very pleased that NAFTA has been ratified.  We believe this is a great step forward in the integration of  our economies by the signatory countries. To us, it also  represents a challenge, because the truth of the matter is that  we have the impression that NAFTA places us at a relative  disadvantage in attracting the foreign investment our country  needs, as well as in the competitiveness of our products,  especially within the U.S. market.    We believe the countries that have signed NAFTA are not very  willing to increase the number of participants until they first  see the effect the treaty has on their own economies. I believe  that in Central America and in the Caribbean we have the  responsibility of seeking the understanding of Mexico, the  United States, and Canada to enable the Caribbean Basin  Initiative, which has benefited our economies, to offer us the  same options and opportunities available to members of NAFTA.  This would allow us to continue strengthening our economies and  to give greater support to the very positive political changes  we have seen in this area these past few years.    [Zabludovsky] Mr. Figueres, Central America and the  Caribbean are now somewhat quiet but not completely quiet. Some  40 years ago your father abolished the Army in Costa Rica and  gave your country a distinct image in the area. Do you not fear  Costa Rica might be contaminated by nearby unrest?    [Figueres] No sir, not at all. We abolished the Army 45  years ago. This has allowed our country to invest in health,  education, infrastructure, and telecommunications by way of a  series of programs that have brought much well-being to Costa  Rica. Costa Rica respects the domestic decisions of every  country. We will also always be at the head of human rights  causes and will be prepared to contribute as much as possible to  a greater peace and calm in the Central American region. This  can lead to a reduction of military budgets and to the  apportionment of those resources to social programs.    [Zabludovsky] As president-elect you now have a different  function and you must prepare your programs in ways different  from the way you prepared them when you were a candidate. You  will be sworn in on 8 May. What will you be doing from now  until then, basically?    [Figueres] We outlined a very clear platform during our  campaign. Our government commitment is to fulfill what we  promised during the campaign. We are returning to a policy that  gives prominence to domestic matters.    Economic and social concerns are two sides of the same coin.  This requires looking not only at macroeconomic projects, which  are important for the country's development, attracting foreign  investments, and encouraging domestic investment, but also at  microeconomic policies to encourage production among the  national sectors that have lagged behind in recent years.    In the social field, this means investing more on health  care, an area in which we have good services but still need to  improve the quality of the services. There is a need for more  investments in health care. There is much to be done to improve  the quality of education, at both the primary school and  higher-education, or university, levels.    I am saying this because our country wants to return to the  path of sustained mid- and long-term development. We are going  to make the government aware of the fact that our responsibility  is not only to adopt day-to-day decisions, which of course are  important and are a function of the government, but we also have  the responsibility of directing our country and our society  toward mid- and long-term objectives. This type of development  must be sustained not only to preserve our natural resources and  environment, which are new aspects that we must consider while  engaging in national production and day-to-day life, but also to  preserve and improve human life, which is after all, the  objective of all of our policies.    Costa Rica wants to join the international economy and to  compete on the basis of technology, quality, productivity, and  efficiency, not on the basis of workers being paid low salaries.  This kind of integration requires more investments in education.    [Zabludovsky] One last comment, perhaps the last question,  Jose Maria: I met your father for the first time in 1956, which  was also the first time I interviewed him. How old were you  then?    [Figueres] I was two.    [Zabludovsky] Fine. At that time he was a unique person in  Latin American politics, especially in Caribbean policies,  because he was a civilian who enjoyed much prestige in an area  where people like Fulgencio Batista and Anastasio Somoza were  presidents. In that respect, your father was an odd-ball. He  had no bodyguards and no fear, and he abolished the Army while  others in other places were upgrading and strengthening their  armies. My question is this: What did you inherit, personally  and politically, from Pepe Figueres?    [Figueres] I am proud of my father and of my name. From him  I learned to love the fatherland. I have that in my heart. I  also learned how to value people for what they are and not for  how much they have. I learned that work, regardless of how  humble it might be, brings honor. With regard to public life, I  learned that if one is going to engage in public life, one must  do it to serve others, not to serve oneself.    With these principles and ideals in mind, I have  participated  in politics and will participate in our forthcoming  administration.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you, Jose Maria. I wish you success in  governing that grand country of yours: Costa Rica.    [Figueres] Thank you, Jacobo. Good night.    [Zabludovsky] Good night.     "

They sent it to the Organisation of African Unity, the  United  Nations Security Council and its secretary general, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    But in acknowledging the crimes being predominantly  committed  by Rwandan government soldiers and ruling party militiamen,  Mandela fails to acknowledge South Africa's role in arming them.  At least 3,000 of Rwanda's soldiers and some militiamen carry  South African R4 automatic rifles. Rwanda bought them in 1992,  along with 10,000 hand-grenades, 20,000 rifle grenades, 10,000  launching grenades, and more than one million rounds of  ammunition.    Rwanda's purchase of arms from South Africa was in violation  of a 1984 voluntary UN Security Council resolution. By 1977 it  had already imposed a binding resolution against any arms sales  to South Africa.    But the UN is expected to lift its arms embargo against  South  Africa soon. This would give Mandela the chance to demonstrate  that the new South Africa would not sell arms to countries like  Rwanda. Instead, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa]  executive Andre Buys told Defense News: ""We expect that by  1996 exports will at least    When Vaclav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia in  1989,  he promised to end armed exports. But last year, after the  country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, both renewed  exports. Unfortunately, Mandela and the African National  Congress seem likely to take the same road.    ""Once the new government is up and running, we will welcome  a  complete lifting of all remaining sanctions and embargoes  against South Africa,"" ANC spokesman Madala Mthembu told DEFENSE  NEWS. ""We also wish to state the new government will be in full  compliance with international standards governing exports of  technologies and materials that would threaten world security.""    Such standards would preclude arms sales, for example, to  states like Libya, which is also currently subject to a UN  embargo. But states like Rwanda before its present crisis would  still be able legally to buy arms.    No one expects Mandela to turn his back on what promises to  become one of the new South Africa's best earners of foreign  exchange. But few would expect, either, a man who has devoted  his life to his country's struggle for justice, equality and  human rights to turn his back on future victims of other abusive  regimes now.    He wouldn't necessarily need to. Because of the existing US  embargo, precise figures on South Africa's military exports are  unknown. But Denel, the state-owned manufacturing consortium  created out of part of Armscor and its subsidiaries in 1992, has  assets of $2.9-billion and has made about $175-million in arms  exports annually so far. Denel accounts for only about 60  percent of the country's total defence sales.    However lethal to its own citizens, Rwanda's purchase of  $5.9- million worth of grenades, mortars and ammunition from  Armscor made only a tiny addition to South Africa's balance  sheet. A leader in almost every weapons grouping, it expects to  make most of its profit from the sale of expensive, hi-tech  systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic  warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and  battlefield mobility systems.    South Africa also has a technological edge in landmine  detection and sweeping equipment that countries like Cambodia,  especially, need. While South Africa has already begun to  market this equipment, it announced in March that it would not  sell landmines at the same time, and stopped exports.    Although motivated by appearance before principle, this is a  welcome sign.    But the ANC's present policy isn't good enough. While  exporting mine-sweeping equipment and hi-tech weapons to earn  foreign exchange rightfully, the new South Africa should  re-examine its small-arms export policy. International  prohibitions against arms sales to abusive regimes are at  present non-existent or low.    Rwanda, long documented for its grisly record, is a case in  point. Rather than sink to this standard, Mandela should lead  the world in raising it up.     "

Brazil, as an emerging power,  wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking  countries that had recently become independent from Portugal.  Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian  businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed  by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But  the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of  projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of  doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month  before the first South African elections in which the black  population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen  headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion  Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to  that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large  companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes  Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company],  Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: ""The  time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed  confidence in the South African electoral process.""    The South African elections, which will put an end to 46  years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and  28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last  few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is  considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of  Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible  missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According  to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of  Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation,  Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade  with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of  consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's  representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an  eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting  government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party  program.    The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic  departments  and with representatives of five different sectors (including  the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which  includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures  and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian  deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development  project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira  commented that ""the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost  houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is  lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas."" Mandela's  supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy  implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to  minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed,  includes nuclear bombs.    The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the  establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay  -- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and  Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South  Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the  African markets. He added: ""They know how to negotiate with the  region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen.""    Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any  nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether  or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil  field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with  the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians'  visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only.  At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed:  The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material  from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene.  Minister Vieira exclaimed: ""We have discovered South Africa.""  What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election  will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country.  After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking  African countries failed because they all were drowned by  endless civil wars.     "

It has identified itself as the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan  [Kurdistan Islamci Hareketi, IMK]...    The IMK militants attacked the supporters of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan, which is headed by Jalal Talabani. The  attacks took place last Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. The  militants also clashed with the supporters of Mas'ud Barzani,  leader of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The incidents were  in Raniyah, Kifri, and Kujah...    The Hizballah in Iraq has established itself in Kuldazah and  Raniyah, which are close to Iran's border. That organization is  not represented in the Federal Assembly of Kurdistan, which is  based in Irbil, because it only secured 5.1 percent of the votes  in the elections in 1992. Seven percent of the vote was needed  for representation.    Iran's Support    The Hizballah organization in Iraq is mainly supported by  Tehran... It has received aid from Iran in the form of cash,  arms, and provisions, particularly since 1991. That is common  knowledge. According to Ahmad Bamarni, who is a close associate  of Jalal Talabani, the Hizballah organization is also supported  by Saudi Arabia and even by Afghanistan. That organization's  ideology is based on Imam Khomeyni's teachings. Naturally, that  provides for Tehran's support. Nevertheless, the Hizballah  members have not renounced their religious sect. They are the  followers of the Sunni sect. Of course, that accounts for Saudi  Arabia's support.    The recent weakening of the economy in northern Iraq has had  a significant bearing on the strengthening of the Hizballah  organization. The gradual worsening of poverty has disappointed  the people in the region. Consequently, that state of affairs  has nourished Islamic radicalism, as has been the case among the  Palestinian people and in Algeria. Obviously, Islamic  radicalism has strengthened as a result of poverty and the  central administration's failures.    Beards and Islamic Dress    We met Ahmad Bamarni a few days ago. Referring to the  Hizballah organization, he said: ""We have a university in  Irbil. It provides education for 5,000 students. We have  colleges for agricultural and medical studies in Dahuk. We also  have an institute for veterinary studies and a medical college  in al-Sulaymaniyah. Students from many families do not attend  them because they are poor. However, the IMK gives them an  opportunity to study, provided that the male students wear a  beard and female students wear Islamic dress. In fact, the  number of young people who join this organization is gradually  increasing.""    Yes, the Hizballah organization employs several tactics to  strengthen itself. Meanwhile, it also helps many people to have  their own shops or establish their own businesses. I have  observed the poverty in northern Iraq. In view of that, I am  aware of what can be achieved even through small amounts of  material aid.    What Does Tehran Fear?    What does Tehran, which supports the Hizballah organization,  wish to achieve in northern Iraq? Bamerni replied as follows:    The Hizballah organization is playing Iran's game. Tehran  wishes to create instability in northern Iraq. Iran's military  aircraft repeatedly bombed the northern Iraq border area some  time ago. That country closed its border about three weeks ago.  It closed down the border gates that give access to  al-Sulaymaniyah, Hajj 'Umran, and Irbil. What worries Tehran is  this: A democratic, pluralistic, and secular system is being  established in northern Iraq for the first time. Political  parties exist in Irbil and other large cities. There are  newspapers, magazines, and radio networks. The people are  expressing their opinion. The people also appear on television.  The modernization process has made Tehran feel very uneasy.  Iran's officials fear that the Kurds in Iran and the rest of  Iraq may decide to adopt a similar model. They believe that  that would be an unfavorable example for their country.

0,FT923-6912 ,"FT923-6912 _AN-CHYAUAA3FT 920821   FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: 'Neighbour' nations defy South Africa      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   THIS week's announcement from the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) that it plans to turn itself into the more ambitious Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a sign it had failed to deliver the goods. While few dispute the need for a change, it is unclear that this initiative, which aims to replace a loose arrangement of sectoral co-operation between nine nations with a formal treaty seeking greater economic integration, is for the better. With the premise of SADC seeming to provide a bulwark against South Africa's economic dominance in the region, it seems set to fail. As Johannesburg's Business Day argues, it seems an 'exercise in futility' to try to deny economic links with South Africa just when most foreign interest in the region wants to use it as a springboard, not a main player. SADCC's change was forced on it by the South Africa reform process undermining a basic tenet of its existence: the need to achieve economic independence from a hostile neighbour (South Africa itself). Formed in 1980 with nine member states (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), since joined by post-independence Namibia, SADCC sought to reduce external economic dependence, especially on South Africa, and promote economic development. This week's changeover to the new SADC raises questions on two fronts: the relationship between SADC and South Africa; and the need for greater economic integration. South Africa elicits contradictory reactions among SADC members. It can be seen as the saviour - the region's economic locomotive and, with foreign aid flows not as free as in the past, a potential paymaster - or feared, as an economy able to swamp its neighbours. The dilemma is real, but this week's decision suggests SADC prefers to delay confronting it. Sound political reasons exist for not having any truck with South Africa until it has achieved full democracy, but it seems clear the only hope for achieving a useful regional economic grouping is with South Africa at its core. Re-organising before addressing the South Africa issue seems futile. Setting aside South Africa, analysts are sceptical about the route of deeper economic integration chosen by SADC. Dr Eric Leistner of the Africa Institute notes: 'The aims of SADC are more ambitious, so they will fail more spectacularly (than SADCC).' Three major problems are involved in this route: the first concerns the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA). Eight of SADC's members belong to the PTA, and SADC overlaps considerably with the PTA, yet SADC will not merge with PTA - an illogical stance. Second, PTA has had limited success in its aims, such as tariff reduction, due to lack of economic resources and political will on the part of its members. Why should things be different for SADC? Also, the limited success enjoyed in achieving the far less demanding aims of SADCC casts serious doubt on whether SADC can hope to progress in the difficult task of economic integration. Finally, the enormous economic disparities between the member countries of SADC, in terms of such factors as inflation and access to foreign currency, make integration problematical. Given these problems, and an unwillingness to cede sovereignty to regional bodies, a more promising route would for the SADC countries to focus on aims such as co-operation in sectors such as energy, transport and movement of goods.

The Old Mutual South Africa Trust is hoping to raise about Pounds 50m to invest in a range of South African companies, with a bias towards smaller and medium-sized companies and the financial and industrial sectors. The fund will be managed with a bottom-up, stock-picking style. The fund's managers say that South Africa combines much of the growth potential of an emerging market with the developed infrastructure of an advanced industrialised economy and a stock market more than 100 years old. The ending of sanctions and improved political stability provide encouraging opportunities for growth. The fund's bias towards smaller companies is intended to avoid duplicating investment in areas which are easily accessible to foreign institutional investors, focusing instead on areas of the market for which research is not widely available overseas. South Africa is due to be included in the IFC emerging markets index, where it will have a weighting of about 13 per cent. This is expected to lead to heavy inflows of overseas money into South Africa, and the Old Mutual trust hopes to appeal to institutions looking for a quick way to increase South African exposure in line with the index. The fund is mainly targeted at institutional investors, but there will also be a public offer to allow private investors a chance to participate. Lord Tombs, former chairman of Rolls-Royce, will chair the trust, with other board members drawn from Old Mutual and the UK investment trust sector. Shares will be issued at 100p with one warrant attached to every five shares. The public offer opens on June 23, and closes on July 1.   Companies:-  Old Mutual Unit Trust Management.

Yet women's  economic progress, the study says, is contributing to the breakup of the  traditional family and the ""feminization"" of poverty.    The report by economists James P. Smith and Michael Ward -- who raised a furor  4 1/2 years ago with an earlier study they conducted on women's pay -- projects  that by the year 2000, women on average will be paid at least 80% of what men  earn, up from 65% currently.    At the same time, they warn policy-makers to recognize that rising wages draw  women into the work force and discourage child bearing -- trends, they say,  that destabilize the traditional family, contributing to rising divorce rates  and the growing number of families headed by women.    And since it is among those female-headed families that poverty increasingly is  concentrated, they say, leaders need to consider whether policies that  encourage women to work are having unintended negative consequences.      Previous Controversy    ""One price of the very labor market success women have enjoyed may well be a  less stable American family,"" says the study, which appears in the current  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.    Smith and Ward triggered controversy with their previous study challenging the  widely held view that women had made few gains in closing the ""wage gap"" during  most of the 20th Century. In fact, they said, women's wages had risen more  quickly than men's from 1920 through 1980 and promised to continue narrowing  the difference through the end of the century.    Critics disputed their conclusion that discrimination was not a major factor in  the lowering of women's wages and that government efforts to eliminate  discrimination had done little to improve most women's standing. The initial  indication is that the new study, though it takes pains to acknowledge the  importance of government attention to correcting the inequities women face in  the economy, will incur feminists' wrath as well.    Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Tuesday that  the narrowing of wage differences between men and women is more the result of a  decline in men's earnings, rather than any gains by women.    ""Guys who used to be in the steel mill earning $11, $15, $20 bucks an hour are  now down to $5 bucks an hour, so of course women in comparison to them are  doing better than they used to,"" she said.    Claudia Wayne, executive director of the National Committee on Pay Equity, said  even the smaller wage gaps projected by the Rand economists were  unconscionable.    ""Even if it were true that the wage gap was going to be 80% in the year 2000,  there's still 20% missing that needs to be addressed,"" said Wayne, who heads  the Washington-based coalition of women's, labor and civil rights groups.    Smith and Ward's argument that women's participation in the work force  correlates with the increasingly feminine cast of poverty drew especially  indignant responses.    Susan M. Christopherson, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell  University in Ithaca, N.Y., said the women entering the work force in the  largest numbers are mothers of young children -- a group that is working not  out of choice, but rather to combat poverty or sustain family living standards.    ""To suggest that women entering the labor force is related to the  disintegration of families is very unfair to those women who are entering the  work force in order to maintain sufficient family income,"" she said.    Smith and Ward write that other studies have understated women's earning gains  by failing to take into account the fact that, in the past, many women entering  the labor force had few skills and less-than-average education. Such women  workers got low wages, pulling down the overall average of women's earnings.    Their analysis, by contrast, finds that women have steadily been gaining more  skills and education over time -- gaining faster, in fact, than men -- as the  U.S. economy has paid less for men's skills in such areas as manufacturing.      Leadership Gains    The constant narrowing of the differences between the capabilities women and  men bring to the job has had a dramatic effect in the 1980s, the study says.

The gains, they predict, will continue. Not only will women's earnings continue  to rise more quickly than men's, but women will take their place in leadership  positions in the economy.    ""The new women professionals of the last 10 years are now gaining partnerships  in law firms, staff postions in major hospitals and middle management jobs in  business,"" the study says. ""The sheer numbers in the pipeline guarantee that 20  years from now, some of these women will be senior partners, chiefs of staff,  CEOs.""

Yet women's  economic progress, the study says, is contributing to the breakup of the  traditional family and the ""feminization"" of poverty.    The report by economists James P. Smith and Michael Ward -- who raised a furor  4 1/2 years ago with an earlier study they conducted on women's pay -- projects  that by the year 2000, women on average will be paid at least 80% of what men  earn, up from 65% currently.    At the same time, they warn policy-makers to recognize that rising wages draw  women into the work force and discourage child bearing -- trends, they say,  that destabilize the traditional family, contributing to rising divorce rates  and the growing number of families headed by women.    And since it is among those female-headed families that poverty increasingly is  concentrated, they say, leaders need to consider whether policies that  encourage women to work are having unintended negative consequences.      Previous Controversy    ""One price of the very labor market success women have enjoyed may well be a  less stable American family,"" says the study, which appears in the current  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.    Smith and Ward triggered controversy with their previous study challenging the  widely held view that women had made few gains in closing the ""wage gap"" during  most of the 20th Century. In fact, they said, women's wages had risen more  quickly than men's from 1920 through 1980 and promised to continue narrowing  the difference through the end of the century.    Critics disputed their conclusion that discrimination was not a major factor in  the lowering of women's wages and that government efforts to eliminate  discrimination had done little to improve most women's standing. The initial  indication is that the new study, though it takes pains to acknowledge the  importance of government attention to correcting the inequities women face in  the economy, will incur feminists' wrath as well.    Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Tuesday that  the narrowing of wage differences between men and women is more the result of a  decline in men's earnings, rather than any gains by women.    ""Guys who used to be in the steel mill earning $11, $15, $20 bucks an hour are  now down to $5 bucks an hour, so of course women in comparison to them are  doing better than they used to,"" she said.    Claudia Wayne, executive director of the National Committee on Pay Equity, said  even the smaller wage gaps projected by the Rand economists were  unconscionable.    ""Even if it were true that the wage gap was going to be 80% in the year 2000,  there's still 20% missing that needs to be addressed,"" said Wayne, who heads  the Washington-based coalition of women's, labor and civil rights groups.    Smith and Ward's argument that women's participation in the work force  correlates with the increasingly feminine cast of poverty drew especially  indignant responses.    Susan M. Christopherson, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell  University in Ithaca, N.Y., said the women entering the work force in the  largest numbers are mothers of young children -- a group that is working not  out of choice, but rather to combat poverty or sustain family living standards.    ""To suggest that women entering the labor force is related to the  disintegration of families is very unfair to those women who are entering the  work force in order to maintain sufficient family income,"" she said.    Smith and Ward write that other studies have understated women's earning gains  by failing to take into account the fact that, in the past, many women entering  the labor force had few skills and less-than-average education.

What specifically can you do if  some governments are not representing the interests of all their  ethnic groups?    [Salim] The African states are largely the product of the  arbitrary drawing of borders by the colonial powers.  Nevertheless, we have decided to retain the territorial  integrity of our states. Regarding the representative nature of  the governments, there are a few peculiarities. There has been  democratization, which is certainly worth being recognized -- in  Benin, Zambia, the Congo, to name just a few. In Africa,  democratization means two things: first, that power emanates  from the people, and second, that we have good, reliable  governments. I do not know which system is most suitable for  that.    Regarding the problem of tribalism, it has turned out that  Europe is not free from it either -- the term ""ethnic cleansing""  was invented in Europe. I say this without polemics. It is  little consolidation if one looks at poverty, misery, and  violence as they are now in Rwanda -- conditions that shock and  sicken me -- and then says: You in Europe are not perfect  either. But no one in the world can claim a monopoly on  everything good and pleasant.    As an international community, we must learn to learn from  each other -- from the tragedies in Bosnia just as from the  tragedies in Africa. In particular, we must also solve the  ethnic and religious conflicts, because otherwise they develop  such an explosive power that they become nightmares for our  society.    [Bloch] You have repeatedly stressed how important economic  cooperation among the African states is -- the creation of a  united economic area. How is this supposed to work among  countries that are all struggling for survival, since even the  attempt at cooperation among highly developed industrial states  in Europe is difficult?    [Salim] Quite right, but I would look at it precisely the  other way round: If the need for cooperation among the  prosperous former colonial powers is undisputed, how much more  urgent is this need than for Africa! Precisely because of the  brittleness of our society and the widespread power, we must  cooperate all the more closely and effectively. In April, the  35th member country ratified the agreement on an African  economic community. It is part of our postcolonial syndrome of  dependence that we talk much about economic cooperation but have  done little for it. We have always looked toward the north. We  need experts -- we look toward the north; we want to buy things  -- we look toward the north. Even today it is sometimes easier  to fly from one African country to another via Europe. Or one  makes telephone calls via Europe -- all these are things that  must change.    [Bloch] How?    [Salim] The African countries must finally be able to  improve  their foreign trade balance. We have always been told: You  must simply work harder and produce more. But today everyone  knows that this does not work. The Africans -- in particular in  the rural areas -- can work two, three, or four times harder and  would still get less for it than 10 years ago. The unjust  imbalance of the international market must make the West think.    No one denies that Africa has enormous resources --  minerals,  raw materials, the gigantic hydroelectric volume of our waters.  People always talk about Africa as the continent of the future.  I am more interested in Africa as the continent of the present.  The point is to use our resources in a sensible way.    [Bloch] In the German media, Africa is never portrayed as  the  continent of the future, not even as the continent of the  present....    [Salim, interrupting] ...Because there is an English  proverb:  ""You give a dog a bad name and you hang it."" As long as Africa  is portrayed only as a confused, miserable, vegetating  continent, whose rulers are entangled in bloody wars with each  other and cut each other's throats after military coups,  naturally no one will care for our concerns. However, if one  explained the efforts of the normal Africans for economic  improvements and political reforms to the Germans, they would be  more understanding.    [Bloch] What are you relations like with those ruling in  Europe? Do you not often appear as a suppliant?    [Salim] When I go to Europe or the United States or to the  Gulf states, I never turn up holding out my hand in  supplication. Rather, I am making propaganda for actively  understanding our problems. The best support develops if the  people understand what is going on on our continent beyond all  cliches.    [Bloch] And does such understanding exist?    [Salim] There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy.  Today some people talk about ""Afro-pessimism"" and reproach  Africa for precisely those things for which they are partly to  blame themselves and which they have partly brought about. Some  people speak of corrupt, dictatorial regimes -- governments with  which they have cooperated for decades and with whose help they  are acquiring advantages. In addition, the Europeans must  understand that Africa can never be understood as a homogeneous  mass. This would be as if one were to declare Bosnia a  typically European phenomenon.     "

At stake is the fate of a continent battling for economic recovery against mounting odds. Over the past handful of years, the old order has collapsed, or is on its last legs. Apartheid has crumbled. Dictators have been overthrown, democracy sought, and state-controlled economies have succumbed to the market. As the world itself changed, African presidents lost the patronage of Moscow and Washington, and donors demanded 'good governance' from previously tolerated corrupt or mismanaged regimes. From Lagos to Lusaka, the mood of the continent has altered dramatically as Africa has entered a new era. Africans have fewer inhibitions about criticising their governments, and they speak out more confidently for human rights and against corruption. Above all, they debate what is critical to their future: structural adjustment - as powerful in its impact as any ideology the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have adopted. Drawn up by the World Bank, endorsed by other official donors and the IMF, criticised by many non-government organisations, and often bitterly attacked within the region itself, it shapes the lives of more than 600m Africans. Yet some 10 years after its inception, the results are modest. As articles elsewhere in this survey suggest, the business environment in Africa has changed for the better. But in its crucial forthcoming review of adjustment in Africa, provisionally entitled Progress, Payoffs and Challenges, the Bank is expected to warn that progress falls short of expectations. Implementation by governments has been weak, the obstacles formidable, the time required longer than expected, the results modest, and elements of the programme flawed. The report is guarded in its conclusions. But the insights it provides, together with the experiences of FT writers on the ground, point to a sombre conclusion: structural adjustment, while essential to Africa's recovery, is not sufficient. The African crisis is outpacing efforts to resolve it. For millions in the region, the new era is associated with pain. Factories have been closed, food subsidies eliminated, social services cut, as governments seek to live within their means. The poor are the first to suffer. 'Structural maladjustment is even more painful than adjustment,' observes Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's long-serving finance minister. He is sympathetic to their plight, but that is scant comfort. Even in the most successful of the 30 or so countries in various stages of structural adjustment, relief is modest and the road ahead long and arduous. At present growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. The less successful have longer to wait: 'With today's poor policies it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid 70s', says a Bank official. In the meantime, Africa is being left far behind by countries which have made better use of their resources and compete more vigorously for capital. In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Equally striking is Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. 'Can Africa's decline be reversed?' asked the Bank in its last important study of the continent's plight: 'The simple answer is yes. It can be and it must be. The alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.' Four years later, the region remains racked by disease, disaster and debt: the question becomes more compelling, the alternative creeps closer. The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Today, more people in Africa are poorer, and more children are dying. Other signs of stress are apparent, beginning with the distressing list of countries that have effectively ceased to function as modern nation states: Zaire, Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, Angola. Hopes raised by the end of the war in Ethiopia, the peace agreement in Mozambique, and a fragile peace pact in Liberia, are offset by renewed civil war in Angola and Nigeria's steady decline, and strife in Sierra Leone and Rwanda. Former 'success' stories and 'role models' in the 1970s have since become cautionary tales. Kenya struggles to implement economic reforms which erode the patronage on which the ruling Kanu party has been so dependent. Cote d'Ivoire moves deeper into difficulties that cannot be addressed until the CFA franc is devalued, an obstacle that holds up effective economic reform in the 13-member CFA bloc. The collapse of the settlement in Angola and continuing violence in South Africa raise doubts about whether, in the short term at least, southern Africa can be the engine-room for regional growth. Most disturbing of all, perhaps, is the concern that Africa no longer has the adequate institutional capacity to help itself. The technological gap between Africa and the world has widened, and the continent's management is weak. Many schools and universities are without teaching materials. Civil services have been neglected or politicised. The integrity of the judiciary has been eroded. Meanwhile, Aids takes its terrible toll. More than half of the world's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans. An estimated 14m will be infected by 2000; many are from the skilled urban class on which the implementation of reform greatly depends. Hopes that the emergence of multi-party politics would prove a simple stepping stone to good governance have proved premature. Opposition parties have turned out to be weak, fractious and susceptible to patronage, owing more to ethnicity than policy for their support. For the industrialised world, the will to help may emerge only when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat to self-interest, in the form of immigration to southern Europe, or a rise in Moslem extremism, growth in drug-trafficking or health risks posed by a continent that cannot be ring-fenced; or when it is stimulated by the loss of flora and fauna with medicinal value, or environmental concerns. Self-interest or humanitarian imperative, Unicef's poignant warning is timely: 'The abandonment of hopes for the continent would mean the writing off of the talents, aspirations and potential of one eighth of mankind, both now and far into the next century.' From Africa must come a new generation of leaders, committed to reform, and tapping the same spirit that brought freedom 30 years ago. Angered by the failures of corrupt and autocratic leaders, frustrated by economic policies that did not deliver, impatient to recover their lost civil rights, and worn out by wars, Africa's people are striving for a fresh start.

0,FT941-3961 ,"FT941-3961 _AN-ECNC2AB0FT 940314   FT  14 MAR 94 / Labour urged to shift on pensions      By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor   Labour's commitment to increase the basic pension for everybody should be replaced by greater targeting of the state pension scheme, says the Commission on Social Justice. In a paper published today, the commission, which the party set up to advise on policies for the welfare state, recommends options to focus pensions and benefits on those with little or no income from occupational pensions. The options include integrating benefits with the income tax system for pensioners, a guaranteed minimum pension and higher benefits for older pensioners who are less likely to have occupational pensions. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, indicated at a recent seminar on pensions organised by the Fabian Society that he was thinking along similar lines. The paper, by Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that the basic pension is falling as a percentage of average earnings. It has fallen to 15 per cent of male average earnings from 20 per cent in 1978. By 2040 it will amount to just 6 per cent if it continues to be increased in line with prices rather than earnings. Yet raising the basic state pension enough to lift all pensioners out of poverty would be expensive - increasing it to the level of income support would cost Pounds 4.5bn a year. This increase would fail to help the poorest pensioners, with the benefit going only to those above the poverty line. However, it rejects a simple switch from the basic pension to means-tested income support. This would create disincentives to save, the paper says. There are also problems of take-up with means-tested benefits, which many pensioners see as stigmatising them. The Pensions Dilemma.

Doukoure Amadou reports:    [Begin recording] [Amadou] It was the former executive  secretary of the Economic Community of West African States  [ECOWAS] and presently foreign minister of his country, Sierra  Leone, who was the last foreign personality to bid farewell to  President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday at 2100. After the  audience, Abbas Bundu stated that he had been sent by Captain  Valentine Strasser to attend late President Houphouet-Boigny's  funeral and then congratulate President Henri Konan Bedie on his  assumption of office of president.    [Bundu, in English fading into French translation] First and  foremost, I was asked by my head of state, Capt. Valentine  Strasser, to bring greetings to His Excellency President Bedie,  to renew the felicitations conveyed to him on his assumption of  the office of president of this great country. My president  also asked me to convey to the government and people of Cote  d'Ivoire, the condolences of the government and people of Sierra  Leone on the death of Houphouet-Boigny. The Sierra Leonean  people join the Ivorian people in sharing the pain inflicted by  the death of the late president. I was also charged with  informing the president concerning what is happening in the  subregion. Last November, the war had almost ended in Sierra  Leone, so the government decided to decree a unilateral  cease-fire and grant amnesty to the rebels.    Thus, a cease fire came into effect on 1 December, which was  to last 30 days. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the  war effort, the war intensified. The rebels took the  opportunity to replenish and strengthen their positions by  receiving arms from Charles Taylor of Liberia.    [Amadou] A few hours earlier, President Henri Konan Bedie  had granted another audience, this one with the secretary  general of the OAU. President Bedie discussed the upcoming OAU  summit, which will take place in Tunis in June, with Salim Ahmed  Salim.    [Salim, in English fading into French translation] The  president and myself discussed the heritage left by President  Houphouet-Boigny, not only to Cote d'Ivoire, but also to Africa  as a whole and the possibility of continuing this struggle which  President Houphouet began -- the struggle to improve the  continent's economic situation, the fight to resolve conflicts  in Africa, and the fight to maintain the dignity of our people.    [Amadou] Is there already an idea of the major issues to be  discussed at the Tunis summit?    [Salim] By the time of the summit, the elections scheduled  for South Africa will have already taken place. So there willl  be a new government in South Africa and it is most likely that  South Africa will become a member of the continental  organization at this summit. So the issue of decolonization and  apartheid in Africa will be over.    We shall then have to focus attention on issues of economic  development, economic integration, and issues relating to the  African Economic Community. We shall discuss what should be  done concerning inter-African cooperation, subregional  cooperation, and also we shall discuss the issues of stability  and security -- since we cannot speak of economic development  within an environment of chaos and anarchy.    [Amadou] Both audiences took place in the presence of the  Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. [end recording]     "

African countries' GDP growth last year (excluding South Africa) was 1.4 per cent, according to the 1994 World Bank annual report - better than 1992, but still well below the region's population growth rate. Whatever the outcome, no one under-estimates South Africa's dominant role in the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, strikingly illustrated by one yardstick: export credit guarantees extended to Pretoria, since Nelson Mandela's inauguration, exceed the total cover available to other countries in the region. Whether trade opportunities are indeed going to pick up north of the Limpopo depends on which analysts you believe; and the analysts assessment may well be influenced by what they wish to sell. For brokers extolling the merits of the dozen or so investment funds which have identified Africa as an emerging market whose time has come, prospects seem almost rosy. 'Out of the starting blocks' reads the caption on the cover of a bullish analysis of sub-Saharan stock markets published last month.* Vast commodity reserves and low cost production, privatisation getting under way, and the easing or lifting of foreign exchange controls are features noted elsewhere in the report. But before the exporter to Africa sends out a sales team, a distinctly more cautious comment should be taken into account. 'Small markets with low growth rates, poor infrastructure, high indebtedness, slow progress in introducing market and private sector orientated economic reforms, and low levels of technological capabilities, all reduce the attractiveness of many African countries to foreign investors,' says the recent 1994 World Investment Report.** Neither the stock market nor foreign investment level are in themselves adequate guide to the state of the African market: as much as half of the region's imports may be aid financed, and aid flows have been rising. But the comments of the Investment Report may serve as a useful indicator, for higher levels of foreign investment are essential to Africa's economic recovery. Despite the reforms that got under way in many African countries during the 1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows did not increase between the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, notes the report. Averaging around Dollars 3bn a year, FDI flows to the entire region were considerably less than those received by Malaysia in the early 1990s, it points out. Inflows are concentrated in oil exporting countries, notably Egypt, Angola and Nigeria. Although the total value of FDI flows into Africa nearly doubled from an annual average of Dollars 1.7bn during 1981-85, to an average of almost Dollars 3bn during 1986-90, says the study, those investments were concentrated in few countries, and modest when compared to FDI flows to other regions of the developing world. Average annual FDI flows into Africa as a proportion of all inflows in developing countries declined between these two periods from 13 per cent to 11 per cent. Worse was to come. Flows stagnated in the early 1990s to many African countries, while flows to other developing countries continued to increase. 'As a result, Africa's share decined further to 6 per cent by 1992, thus underlining the marginalisation of that continent in relation to FDI, apart from its marginalisation in relation to international trade.' Africa's reforms may have got it out of the starting blocks, but it has several laps to go, it seems, before it breasts the finishing tape. *Sub Saharan Stock Markets, Baring Securities; tel (44)-71-522-6707. **World Investment Report, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, (Unctad).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FLOWS INTO AFRICA              1981-1992, (billions of dollars and percentage)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Region/country                                1981-1985    1986-1990     1991   1992                                    Annual average  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa                            1.7          2.8         2.7    3.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa's share in: (%) All countries                     3.4          1.8         1.7    1.9 Developing countries             12.9         11.4         7.0    5.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil-exporting countries*          1.4          2.1         1.8    2.2 Egypt                             0.7          1.1         0.3    0.5 Nigeria                           0.4          0.7         0.7    0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other countries                   0.3         0.82         0.9    0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nigeria and Tunisia; 2 Figure is inflated by unusually high investment in Liberia in 1988-1990 (Dollars 290m, Dollars 656m and Dollars 225m, respectively), most likely in flags-of-convenience facilities.

A ban on trade, services and investments, implemented in 1986 and 1987, would be lifted from March 15 but an embargo on sales of oil and weapons would be upheld. Norway's exports to South Africa, comprising mainly iron ore, fish, fish products and mechanical equipment, fell to NKr56.2m (Pounds 5.6m) in 1987, after sanctions were implemented, from NKr348.3m in 1986. Norway said the time had come to introduce new political instruments to promote democracy in South Africa; it had formulated a five-point programme to provide assistance during the transition. Meanwhile the Swedish government said yesterday it hoped to lift sanctions against South Africa within a few weeks, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said: 'It is a matter of weeks', but he stressed removal of sanctions would be conditional on continuing democratic reforms in South Africa. Sweden banned investments in South Africa in 1979 and imposed a ban on trade in 1987.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

""As an African country with a rich international  heritage, we should promote Africa's interests, not only its  immediate economic and social needs, but also the continent's  long-term wellbeing in all spheres.""

South Africa would seek to promote unity among  all the peoples of Africa.    South Africa's first step in realising the ideal of African  unity was its acceptance as the 53rd member of the Organisation  of African Unity. ""Africa has taken us to her bosom with  overwhelming warmth and friendship. We are now part of Africa.""    A regional security mechanism was important to deal with  regional conflicts.     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South Africa threatened Saturday to expel a large U.N. peacekeeping force on  its first day of work in Namibia after charging that guerrillas entering from  Angola had clashed with Namibian police as a formal cease-fire went into  effect, leaving 38 insurgents and two police officers dead.    Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, called the clash a  ""flagrant violation"" of international agreements. He said that if the U.N.  secretary general did not issue a clear statement on the matter, South Africa  would ask U.N. peacekeepers to leave until the South-West Africa People's  Organization (SWAPO), which has fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South  African control, ""can be brought to its senses.""    Despite Botha's threat, it was considered unlikely that South Africa would  expel the U.N. team that is here to oversee Namibia's transition to  independence because that would wreck the entire process and allow Cuba to  renege on its agreement to withdraw its troops from neighboring Angola.    SWAPO officials declined to comment Saturday, saying they needed more  information about the incidents before answering South Africa's charges.    The U.N. special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he would  send a four-member team to the area of the clashes, about 400 miles north of  Windhoek, today. Ahtisaari considered them ""a very serious development,""  according to a U.N. spokesman.    ""We need to go up there and find out for ourselves"" what happened, said  Frederic Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Eckhard  added that ""it's safe to say"" that U.N. peacekeeping forces were not involved.    Statements issued by Botha and Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator  in charge of Namibia, cited three separate incidents along 120 miles of the  Namibia-Angola border, beginning before the cease-fire went into effect at 6  a.m. local time Saturday. They said a group of 40 to 50 armed men entered  Namibia near Ruacana, a second group of about 50 entered near Oshikango and a  third group was encountered halfway between the two cities.      Accused of Atrocities    Security police sources in northern Namibia told The Times that the incursions  were repelled by units of Koevoet, a counterinsurgency unit of 3,000 black  Namibians under the command of white South Africans. The unit, which has been  accused of widespread atrocities, was recently returned to normal police work  and incorporated into Namibia's police force.    The sources could not confirm the number killed in the attacks but said two  alleged SWAPO guerrillas had been captured and others were being sought late  Saturday night. Botha said 14 police officers were injured.    Botha did not specify what weapons were used by either side, but under the U.N.  peace plan Namibia's police were to begin carrying only pistols ""in the normal  performance of their duties.""      December Agreement    The incidents apparently marked the first serious clashes between SWAPO and  South African-backed Namibian authorities since South Africa, Cuba and Angola  signed an agreement in December that paved the way for Namibia's independence  and the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern  neighbor.    Under a U.N. plan intended to lead to free and fair elections here in November,  both SWAPO and the South African Defense Force were restricted to their bases  beginning on Saturday. Most of SWAPO's bases are in southern Angola.    South Africa is conducting the transition to Namibian independence, but its  actions are subject to the approval of the United Nations, which, at peak  periods, will have a team of about 7,000 soldiers, police and administrators to  monitor the process. SWAPO, with strong support among residents of the most  populous northern region, is favored to win the elections.    In Windhoek's black township of Katutura on Saturday, tens of thousands of  Namibians donned the bright colors of their political parties to try out their  new freedom and begin campaigning to govern Africa's last colony.    Police stopped several thousand trade unionists as they began a march from the  township to Windhoek to protest a move to sell Namibian enterprises to private  investors. The group dispersed without incident.      Jubilant Crowds    Namibia's two major political parties -- the Marxist-oriented, predominantly  black SWAPO and the capitalist, multiracial Democratic Turnhalle Alliance --  drew jubilant, singing crowds of about 5,000 each to rallies less than two  miles apart. The country's first unfettered political campaigning, conducted  under a hot sun, was generally peaceful.    Namibia is a mostly desert territory twice the size of California on the  southwest coast of Africa. Its population of 1.5 million is overwhelmingly  black, and more than half live in the northern Ovambo province, the seat of  SWAPO support.    Tens of thousands of SWAPO guerrillas have been killed since 1965, when the  group launched its war with South Africa, which has controlled this territory  for 74 years -- the last 20 years in defiance of the United Nations.    Until recently, South Africa had questioned the United Nations' impartiality in  Namibia because the international body had once declared SWAPO the ""sole and  authentic"" representative of the people of Namibia.    The United Nations currently has only about 1,000 peacekeeping troops in the  country, and U.N. officials say the full force of 4,650 troops will not arrive  until May 1.    The troop deployment was delayed by haggling at the United Nations earlier this  year over the cost of the mission. To cut the cost, now set at $461 million,  the United States and the Soviet Union reduced -- to 4,650 from the originally  planned 6,000 -- the number of troops for Namibia's transition to independence  and black majority rule.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on a one-day visit to Namibia, said  Saturday the border incidents were ""a most serious challenge"" to the Namibian  peace process and she called for a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council  to discuss the matter.      NEW ERA FOR NAMIBIA     Saturday marked the start of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, which has  administered the huge, sparsely populated territory since World War I. Hours  before the transition began, South Africa reported major clashes with  guerrillas in northern Namibia near Ruacana and Oshikango. Provisions of the  plan:     April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of 7,000-member U.N.  Transition Assistance Group that will oversee transition. South African troops  in Namibia and guerrillas of South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO),  based in neighboring Angola, are confined to bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is to be disbanded; South Africa is to  reduce its troops to 12,000. South African administrator Louis Pienaar is to  publish election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners to be freed; Namibian exiles to return.    July 1 -- South Africa's forces to be cut to 1,500; election campaigning to  begin.    Oct. 31 -- Half of Cuba's 50,000 troops are to have left Angola; rest are to  withdraw north of 13th Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections are to be held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered  to approve constitution for independent Namibia -- the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops are to leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate is to end.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans are to withdraw last troops.

AFRICA THREAT TO U.N.      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South Africa threatened Saturday to expel a large U.N. peacekeeping force on  its first day of work in Namibia after charging that guerrillas entering from  Angola had clashed with Namibian police as a formal cease-fire went into  effect, leaving 38 insurgents and two police officers dead.    Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, called the clash a  ""flagrant violation"" of international agreements. He said that if the U.N.  secretary general did not issue a clear statement on the matter, South Africa  would ask U.N. peacekeepers to leave until the South-West Africa People's  Organization (SWAPO), which has fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South  African control, ""can be brought to its senses.""    Despite Botha's threat, it was considered unlikely that South Africa would  expel the U.N. team that is here to oversee Namibia's transition to  independence because that would wreck the entire process and allow Cuba to  renege on its agreement to withdraw its troops from neighboring Angola.    SWAPO officials declined to comment Saturday, saying they needed more  information about the incidents before answering South Africa's charges.    The U.N. special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he would  send a four-member team to the area of the clashes, about 400 miles north of  Windhoek, today. Ahtisaari considered them ""a very serious development,""  according to a U.N. spokesman.    ""We need to go up there and find out for ourselves"" what happened, said  Frederic Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Eckhard  added that ""it's safe to say"" that U.N. peacekeeping forces were not involved.    Statements issued by Botha and Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator  in charge of Namibia, cited three separate incidents along 120 miles of the  Namibia-Angola border, beginning before the cease-fire went into effect at 6  a.m. local time Saturday. They said a group of 40 to 50 armed men entered  Namibia near Ruacana, a second group of about 50 entered near Oshikango and a  third group was encountered halfway between the two cities.      Accused of Atrocities    Security police sources in northern Namibia told The Times that the incursions  were repelled by units of Koevoet, a counterinsurgency unit of 3,000 black  Namibians under the command of white South Africans. The unit, which has been  accused of widespread atrocities, was recently returned to normal police work  and incorporated into Namibia's police force.    The sources could not confirm the number killed in the attacks but said two  alleged SWAPO guerrillas had been captured and others were being sought late  Saturday night. Botha said 14 police officers were injured.    Botha did not specify what weapons were used by either side, but under the U.N.  peace plan Namibia's police were to begin carrying only pistols ""in the normal  performance of their duties.""      December Agreement    The incidents apparently marked the first serious clashes between SWAPO and  South African-backed Namibian authorities since South Africa, Cuba and Angola  signed an agreement in December that paved the way for Namibia's independence  and the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern  neighbor.    Under a U.N. plan intended to lead to free and fair elections here in November,  both SWAPO and the South African Defense Force were restricted to their bases  beginning on Saturday.

The goodwill visit will also help boost Britain's chances of  selling military hardware as naval equipment is high on the  South Africans' shopping-list.    HMS Norfolk, the first of the Navy's most up-to-date Type 23  frigates, and its support vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Grey  Rover will visit Cape Town and Simonstown from January 27 to 31.    The visit follows an invitation by the chief of the South  African Navy, Vice-Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson.    A United Nations ban on military contacts with South Africa  was lifted last October, reflecting the government's commitment  to end white rule.    And it is expected that sanctions preventing the sale of  military equipment to South Africa will be lifted following  elections in April.    UK Defence ministers and officials have been holding  discussions with the South African government and the ANC  [African National Congress] in preparation for the lifting of  the embargo.    The British government and defence industry can see  significant opportunities for sales of military equipment.    There is keen interest in buying naval equipment including  offshore patrol craft, maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters  because of concern about piracy around the South African coast.     "

0,FT944-17977 ,"FT944-17977 _AN-EJED5AG5FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (14): New initiatives in South Africa - Regional focus / A rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia      By MARK SUZMAN   As a glance through Johannesburg's leading business newspaper, Business Day, demonstrates, South Africa's days as a trade pariah are well and truly over. The pages are filled with news of new trade conferences, expos from all manner of countries, and a steady stream of high level ministerial visits - including two trips by America's Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown; visits from both British prime minister John Major; and the president of the British Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine - to try and boost international trade links. Reflecting the country's return to favour as a trading partner, there has been a substantial rise in the number of international institutions willing to provide trade finance for South African transactions and of governments giving export credit guarantees. Britain has been at the forefront of these new initiatives, and Mr Major announced a trade guarantee package of over R1bn during his recent visit, a move which makes South Africa one of the biggest markets for the UK's export credit guarantee programme. However, other countries have also been involved, with both Japan and the US announcing new packages and the European Union agreeing to grant South Africa GSP status from next January (although some key goods such as processed fruit and paper products will not be covered under the agreement following French pressure). And given South Africa's excellent payments record, the risks are relatively small. Another particularly interesting development is the rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia. Trade delegations have been arriving from places as diverse as Nigeria, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. As a result, trade with these countries has been growing very rapidly over the past 12 months, albeit off a very low base, and businessmen on both sides are confident that these links will continue to expand. The new interest has been clearly signalled in South Africa's trade figures for the year, and its import bill has been soaring. In the first six months of the year, merchandise imports rose 21 per cent from 1993's levels and in August alone, they rocketed up by 20.8 per cent to a high of R8.07bn for the month. Also contributing to the surge is the desperate need by South African companies to modernise plant and equipment. After having let fixed investment decline to dangerously low levels during the crippling four-year recession that ended last year, many companies are now embarking on long-delayed capital spending, and machinery has accounted for nearly half of all imports. Given that South Africa has a notoriously high propensity to import during times of economic growth, this move may soon send the trade account into deficit. Indeed, the IBCA, the European ratings agency that recently gave South Africa a sub-investment grade rating of BB, cited this is one of the problems with the South African economy. Such an event is made even more likely by the government's declared commitment to start lowering import tariffs in line with the Gatt agreement, a process that began in July with the announcement that duties on motor cars would be reduced. However, despite this, South Africa continues to run a trade surplus, expected to be around R10bn on the year, and although import growth has far outstripped the rise in exports, the country's businessmen are confident that the tide will soon start to turn. South Africa's remains overwhelmingly dependent on mineral exports, particularly gold, but given the fact that the commodity cycle appears to have bottomed out and in light of the continued depreciation of the Rand, the mining industry is expecting a good year in 1995. The government's decision to start restructuring GEIS, South Africa's controversial R2bn a year export incentive scheme, which subsidises companies involved in manufacturing exports, may cause a short-term drop as companies are forced to cope with reduced government aid.

0,FT934-15493 ,"FT934-15493 _AN-DJLB5AA9FT 931012   FT  12 OCT 93 / S Africa open for business: A successful transition depends on the economy      By PHILIP GAWITH   MR Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, and the ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, are taking a joint message to the world: South Africa is back on the international stage, and it is united. Beneath this banner, the two men will be seeking foreign investment at a Confederation of British Industry conference in London today, in an effort to complete a reversal in economic fortunes which has gained momentum with the African National Congress's call for an end to economic sanctions and a new convergence between the ANC and the government on economic policy. The next step is the wooing of foreign investors, with the country needing foreign investment 'more than ever before', according to Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank. The urgency has come with a realisation that a successful political transition is going to depend on improving the dismal growth performance of recent years. The key issue is jobs. In its annual report the Reserve Bank estimates that the portion of the workforce unemployed, or involved in the informal sector of the economy, rose to 46 per cent in 1992, from 39 per cent in 1988. While some argue that this figure is overstated, none disputes that unemployment is a serious contributor to the high levels of violence in the country. Although a better agricultural season, a weaker rand and the mid-year flurry in the gold price should help the economy reverse three years of decline in 1993, there is widespread agreement that only restructuring will produce sustainable high growth. This will involve investing more and spending less, restoring investment as a percentage of GDP to something closer to 25 per cent than the low of 15.9 per cent reached in 1992. It will also require a substantially improved export performance. In the first flush of the post-sanctions era, the air has been positively thick with good will, especially abroad. Back at home, though, the going has been rougher, with the government embroiled in disputes about the issue of cellular telephone licences and a rise in the petrol price. Although the petrol dispute may yet drive the unions to mass action, economic policy is not the war zone it once was. These latest difficulties are much more a reflection of the transitional phase in which South Africa finds itself - in both cases the core objection of the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu is that they were not adequately consulted - than of serious policy differences. Indeed, the ANC has now turned to soliciting the foreign investor with fervour. In a series of appearances in the US last month, both Mr Mandela and Mr Trevor Manuel, the ANC's economics spokesman, went out of their way to persuade investors that not only would they be 'very, very welcome' (Manuel) in South Africa, but they would not have to fear 'radical policies' (Mandela). As Mr Keys told a Washington investor conference, the 'best move' South Africa's policymakers can make is to equip a government of national unity, which South Africa will have after next April's elections, with a 'credible and attractive' economic policy. He believes South Africa's chances of achieving this are 'very good' and cites four recent events as constituting important steps towards this goal. They are the renegotiation of foreign debt repayments; the revised tariff reduction offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks; the negotiation of an Dollars 850m (Pounds 563m) loan from the IMF; and agreement on how South Africa will work with the World Bank. Certainly, finalising the debt agreement, and renewing ties with the IMF - South Africa last accessed IMF facilities in 1982 - immeasurably improve the country's creditworthiness. The Gatt offer is also crucial to South Africa's hopes of improving economic growth. All of this is music in the ears of foreign investors hoping for a business-friendly future under a new government. But the past is not far below the surface. It is a source of wry comfort to businessmen that the ANC has now taken to justifying what it describes as anti-trust policy in terms of the 'efficiency of markets' rather than the whites simply having too much.  ------------------------------------------------------     SOUTH AFRICA: AN ECONOMY THAT IS FOCUSING MINDS  ------------------------------------------------------                                 1990    1991    1992  ------------------------------------------------------ GDP growth                      -0.5    -0.4    -2.1 Inflation                       14.4    15.3    13.9 Budget deficit as % of GDP*      0.6     2.5     4.2  ------------------------------------------------------ *For fiscal year ending March 31 Source: Department of Finance  ------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Speaking at an ANC fundraising  dinner in East London, he also said neither he nor ANC President  Nelson Mandela had accepted an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland].    He said the ANC had been looking forward to the meeting  which  was to have been held with the Zulu king this week but was  cancelled. ""As of now we have never received any proposal from  the Zulu king as to what he wants so we don't know what he wants  apart from what was reported in the newspapers. We would like  to engage the king to hear what he wants and to see in what  manner whatever concerns he expresses can be addressed.""    Clearly, in legal, political and constitutional terms, and  in  ordinary reality there was no such thing as an independent  kwaZulu/Natal. The question of the secession of any part of  South Africa could not be decided on except through democratic  processes. ""Any matter that has to do with dismemberment of  South Africa in any way is a matter that would have to be  decided by the people of South Africa as a whole.""    He said the ANC had not agreed to a volkstaat. What it had  agreed was to continue discussions with what was now called the  Freedom Front on the idea of a volkstaat. ""To continue the  discussions and possibly conclude them before the elections,  we've agreed to that.""    A document agreed to by the ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Union] in September last year stipulated  that any solution to the volkstaat question would have to be  consistent with the principles of democracy and non-racialism.  The two sides had agreed that any further discussion on the  issue should be guided by these principles. ""So the proponents  of a volkstaat have an obligation to make proposals about a  (territory) that would be democratic, non-racial,  anti-apartheid, resulting in peace, absence of conflict and so  on. If a volkstaat consistent with these principles can be  proposed, I don't think the ANC will have a problem with it.""  However no such proposal had been made. ""So there is no  volkstaat to be accepted by Nelson Mandela or myself.""     "

Only hours after Mr Mandela's call at the United Nations in New York, the US Senate approved legislation lifting US sanctions. Canada, Australia and the Commonwealth leadership said they would follow suit. Mr Mandela, urging that all economic sanctions against South Africa be lifted in an attempt to end the country's isolation, said victory against apartheid was in sight. Addressing a specially convened meeting of the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions drive over the past three decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all necessary measures to end the economic sanctions you imposed'. His plea came a day after South Africa's parliament approved the creation of a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council giving blacks a say in government for the first time. Mr Mandela called on the international investment community to 'help regenerate the South African economy'. He said steps should be taken to prevent South Africa becoming another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had brought it to the point 'where the transition to democracy has now been enshrined in the law of our country'. The passage of the South African legislation has been welcomed by President Bill Clinton as an 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives to help restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting South African access to the IMF and World Bank. Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period in which senior officials of the government and the ANC will be seeking to convince investors and donors that they should invest in South Africa. Mr Clinton later announced that the commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is to lead a trade and investment mission to South Africa to explore business opportunities, particularly with the black private sector.

The  minister admitted the possibility of a social explosion ""in  Bolivia and any other part of the world"" if extreme poverty  conditions persist.    Various indigenous and labor groups expressed support for  the  Mexican natives and charged that the IMF and World Bank were  responsible for the misery afflicting most Latin American  peoples.    The leaders of these associations criticized the declaration  made by Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, who ruled out the  possibility that Bolivia might be affected by a situation  similar to the Mexican rebellion.    The social development minister said: ""Neglect has provoked  this reaction (the Indian rebellion in Mexico) that, in my  opinion, is a voice of alarm for all rulers who spend their time  making rhetorical speeches and promises.""    Romero, the official responsible for seeking solutions to  the  dramatic poverty afflicting a large percentage of the Bolivian  population, said: ""If we do not find effective and quick  solutions, we might expect this type of social explosion in  Bolivia and any other part of the world.""    The Tupac Katari-1 Indian Movement (Mitka) of Kollasuyo  (Bolivia) expressed its decision to give ""moral and material""  support to the Mexican Indians and asked the United Nations to  intervene in order to prevent the further shedding of the blood  of their ""Zapatist brothers.""    Another Mitka faction expressed ""the duty to salute and wish  all the necessary success"" to the actions leading to a victory  in the Chiapas' struggle and the expulsion of the ""invaders"" who  usurped native peoples's rights.    Hilarion Mamani, a leader of the El Alto Labor Federation,  said the exploitation suffered by Bolivian peasants could  provoke something similar to what happened in Mexico.    What happened in Chiapas is the result of poverty, Mamani  said, accusing the World Bank and the IMF of provoking the  misery afflicting a large part of Latin American populations.  ""It is a warning for them to change their policies against the  impoverished nations of this continent,"" Mamani said.     "

The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign  minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth  Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy.    Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for  South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential,  but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council.    He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic  ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established  diplomatic ties with Taiwan.    However, he stated, Taiwan is one of South Africa's largest  trading partners.    ""In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our interests and international precedents.""    Pahad said given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the  focus will be to increase favorable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union.    But, he said his country will also be looking beyond  traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among  others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's  Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored is the Middle East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.     "

AFRICA SALES      From Reuters      ORLANDO, Fla.      Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some  stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has  not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation.    While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an  official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions  that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales  of its petroleum products there.    ""If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break,"" said  Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office  of the comptroller.    Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to  General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the  largest U.S. employer in South Africa.      Tax Bite, Loss Cited    Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging  investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.    Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.    ""We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in  their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites,"" he said.    Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by  the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares  were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South  Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's  government.    Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by  Gencorp for as long as five years.    The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local  workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers  will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has  promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year.      Personnel Arrangements    Mobil has a staff of about 2,800 in South Africa, all but two of whom will  remain there after the sale is completed in June.    ""An honest exchange of disagreement,"" Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who  repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's  indirect ties with South Africa.    The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier  announcement was so significant.

On Nov. 27, Michael Johns, the policy analyst for Third World and African  affairs for the Heritage Foundation, testified before the U.N. Committee on  Apartheid. He did not meet with a critical reception because Johns has for many  years been a voluble critic of apartheid, so that it was not thought necessary  to pass much time on the disavowalist rituals. What Johns pleaded for, and  flatly predicted, was that the West would remove its sanctions against South  Africa ""as early as in February or March.""    This would have sounded very rash, except that from inside South Africa we hear  now from Nelson Mandela, widely accepted as the patron saint of economic  sanctions. What Mandela is saying is that perhaps the time has come to  ""reconsider"" their appropriateness. For him to say even that much dilutes the  moral absolutism of the call to sanctions, the kind of thing that Bishop Trevor  Huddleston of Britain has made his militant cause for many years.    Johns recited statistics that were not effectively challenged by the U.N.  committee. He said that ""combined unemployment and underemployment figures for  South Africa's black majority now stand at 47%, largely because South Africa --  an export-driven economy -- has been denied access to many foreign markets."" He  then went on to cite the latest Gallup poll addressed to South Africa's black  majority: Do you oppose sanctions as a means for ending apartheid? Opposed:  82%.    In South Africa today, most political forces are harnessed to move toward a  general election. The exact shape of the new constitution is not yet  established, but President Frederik W. de Klerk has said that it will include  ""a universal franchise: No domination (of one race by another); equality before  an independent judiciary, (and) the protection of minorities as well as of  individual rights.""    It remains to be seen whether the Boer voters of South Africa, who are the  backbone of what is left of apartheid, will feel that the new constitution will  secure their lives, liberty and property. There will be heavy debate within the  white community when the time comes.    This much we know, but we have not reflected on the debate that is bound to  engage the black community. And that community's two principal leaders are  Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu  Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha movement. And obviously Mandela is asking  himself whether he wishes to engage in a voting contest against a black leader  who opposes sanctions at a time when almost one-half of the black population is  unemployed or underemployed.    The events of the past year or two in South Africa have been almost as dramatic  as those in Eastern Europe, and they are by no means unrelated to those events.  As long as the ANC was thought by the white population and the white government  to be the arm of a Soviet state systematically engaged in oppression, violence  and subversion, the congress was rightly suppressed. The decision to free  Mandela coincided with the conviction that the steam had run out of the  communist revolution and that the ANC's continuing link to international  communism was something on the order of sentimental historical formality,  unrelated to any potential to do revolutionary damage. It could be said that  when the wall went down in Berlin, so it did in South Africa, between the  government and the primary black party of dissent.    What we have to fear is the bitter-enders who would really prefer a  non-peaceful end to the South African story. Three years ago in London, Bishop  Huddleston, the honorary chairman of the anti-apartheid movement, said, ""I  would never suggest civil war is welcome; I say it is inevitable."" The hatred  of apartheid and of its sponsors has not been entirely appeased by the collapse  of apartheid. There is sentiment among such as Bishop Huddleston for vengeance.  One way in which that vengeance could be satisfied is by a constitution that  has the effect of jeopardizing the security of white-owned property.

ONE RESEARCHER SUSPECTS REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS ARE PASSED BETWEEN  GENERATIONS.      By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER      BIRMINGHAM, Ala.      Objectivity is paramount, the scientist was saying. At least, that's what she  had been taught. Speak to the moral implications of your work and you risk  leaving the impression that you are no longer neutral.    But then there is the notion of a Good German, she went on. They knew what was  happening but kept silent -- either out of fear of the consequences of speaking  out, or out of misguided patriotism.    ""I just didn't want to be a Good German,"" the scientist concluded simply. ""So  either you turn your back on the research and you work in something else, or  you have to at some point say, 'This is wrong.' ""    Christiane Hale is in many ways an outsider -- a Northerner repotted in the  soil of the Deep South, an erstwhile expatriate, part epidemiologist, part  historian, part social psychologist, an academic researcher with an undisguised  point of view.    That geography, physical and psychic, defines her professional perspective. She  has observed the U.S. public health system from abroad, and tracked patterns of  disease and death among blacks and whites through the prism of American social  history.    All of which has brought Hale to a chilling and controversial hypothesis in the  attempt to unravel one of the more troubling puzzles in public health -- why it  is that black babies born in the United States are twice as likely as whites to  die by age 1.    The racial gap, Hale and some others believe, cannot entirely be traced to  racial differences in income and social class. Even middle-class black women,  it seems, are twice as likely as whites to give birth to dangerously  underweight babies.    Instead, they have begun to suspect that long-term poverty may have exacted a  deep, physical toll -- subtle but significant damage to the reproductive health  of black women, which they believe can be passed from one generation to the  next.    Precisely how that might occur is unclear. But Hale and others suspect that  women whose growth was stunted in childhood or in the womb as a result of  poverty may suffer internal organ damage that years later can place their own  babies at risk.    That theory, still unproven, is one of several that have surfaced recently as  researchers have explored the racial difference in infant death, a key reason  why the overall U.S. infant death rate is among the worst in the industrialized  world.    If proven, Hale believes the idea of an intergenerational health effect of  poverty could serve as a powerful indictment of the treatment of blacks in the  United States -- evidence that the effects of racism extend beyond  psychological scars to long-term physiological damage.    Other scientists are cautious about the theory.    Some believe the racial gap in infant death can be traced entirely to social  and economic factors. If some of the difference appears unaccounted for, they  say it is because they have not yet identified certain subtle, social  variables.    Just because a white woman and a black woman have college degrees does not mean  they have the same socioeconomic status, researchers note. A middle-class black  woman may have grown up poor and may get worse health care than her white  counterparts.    ""The racial disparity seems to imply biological variation,"" said Dr. Woodie  Kessel of the National Institutes of Health. ""But it's not clear to me that it  really isn't a reflection of other things that are more difficult to measure.""    Other researchers fear the notion of biological factors in infant death could  be taken as a racist one. Even if those biological differences came from social  rather than genetic roots, they fear the idea might seem to imply inferiority.    Similarly, some worry that the concept could be willfully misconstrued to  justify neglecting health and social welfare programs. If the racial gap in  infant death is biological, people might argue, why invest tax revenue in  trying to remedy social causes?    Finally, biological factors may be relatively insignificant.    ""It's quite possible (that such factors exist),"" said Dr. Paul Wise, an  assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. ""The question to  me is not so much do they exist but their relevance. How important are they?""    Hale, for one, intends to find out.    On a recent morning on the campus of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a  chill wind sent bundled-up students scudding along the sidewalks. Inside the  overheated building that houses the School of Public Health, secretaries  battled static cling.    Hale bustled into her office in a bomber jacket and long skirt. She wore  running shoes to cushion her heel bones, broken two months earlier when the  48-year-old, tenured professor of epidemiology fell off her garage roof while  trying to break into her locked house.    A small, bumblebee of a woman with reddish-brown hair and a laugh that bubbles  upward in arpeggios, Hale speaks in the kind of mellifluous, modulated voice  that might be heard doing commentary on National Public Radio.    To understand black infant death, she was saying that one must understand two  aspects of the black experience: First, the peculiar intensity of poverty among  black Americans; second, the region where blacks traditionally lived.    No group of poor whites, except perhaps in Appalachia, experienced comparable  poverty and social isolation, Hale contended. And until the middle of this  century, most blacks lived in a handful of Southern states with little or no  commitment to the poor.    ""One of the reasons we haven't done much about (infant mortality), I believe,  is that it is seen as a problem of the poor,"" she said. ""As a society, we have  never been able to decide whether the poor are also deserving. . . .    ""I see it as very consistent in a country that includes among its founding  fathers the Puritans. One of their fundamental beliefs was that if God loves  you, you aren't poor; and if you're poor, you have done something wrong in the  eyes of God.""    The theory that Hale and others are exploring is just one of several being  offered to help explain the racial disparity in infant death.    Much of the racial gap is clearly traceable to income and class. Black mothers  have less money and less schooling than whites. Income and education influence  diet, behavior and access to health care -- which, in turn, can determine one's  risk of having a baby die.    But some researchers like Hale believe something else may be at work. For even  when they take income and class into account, they still find differences in  the average birth weights of black and white infants, and in the rates at which  they die.    For that reason, they are looking for other possible factors.    In Atlanta, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and at several  black colleges are investigating whether subtle differences in the experiences  of middle-class blacks and whites might help account for differences in birth  weight and infant death.    One factor being considered is psychological stress. Stress has been linked,  directly or indirectly, to problems in childbearing. Some researchers suspect  that black women experience more stress than whites -- from financial and  domestic pressures, perhaps from racism.    They are also looking at degrees of social support among the middle-class  blacks and whites they are studying, and at differences in income and financial  stability between black and white women ostensibly of the same social class.    Finally, they are examining how blacks and whites use the health care system.  Some of the researchers suspect that middle-class blacks may turn to a doctor  less readily than do whites, who have grown up with good access to affordable  health care.    ""It's not just money,"" said Bruce Wade, a Spelman College sociologist working  on the study. ""It's the way social class impacts people's attitudes -- how  likely you are to go to a doctor, how you treat a person once a pregnancy  occurs.    ""The effects of social class are sometimes very devastating, and it's sometimes  things that we're not readily aware of. The idea that once a group is educated  and brought into higher socioeconomic status, all the problems will be resolved  -- that may not be the case.""    In other words, black and white women of seemingly similar income and education  may in fact experience life quite differently, since social class reflects not  only money and schooling but family history, attitudes and expectations.    The new hypotheses are disturbing not only for what they suggest about  long-term harm done by discrimination. They also call into question  conventional wisdom about what it might take to eliminate the racial gap in  infant death.    While most researchers stress unequivocally the importance of prenatal care,  they say even universal access to care cannot alone close the gap. It will take  much more -- for example, a concerted attack on poverty -- to erase the effects  of decades of deprivation, they say.    ""The gap between ethnic groups is going to be reduced or eliminated by  addressing the issues of poverty and how poverty affects child health,"" said  Dr. Irvin Emanuel, a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the University  of Washington.    ""If we want healthy babies, we have to have healthy children who grow up to be  healthy adults who will have healthy babies. . . . We have to take care of our  people. And in my view, it will take more than just one generation.""    The racial gap in infant mortality in the United States is not new. It has  existed as long as statistics have been kept. While the black and white rates  declined steadily over much of this century, the gap between them persisted and  even gradually widened.    As a result, a black baby born in 1987, the latest year for which national  statistics exist, had less chance of surviving to age 1 than a white baby born  in 1970 -- well before the spread of new technology made it possible to keep  many premature babies alive.    Now some experts fear the black-white gap will grow even wider in the 1990s.  They cite the spread of illegal drug use among inner-city black women and the  disproportionately high rate at which black babies are born infected with the  AIDS virus.    As Hale tells it, she became interested in infant death in the mid-1960s while  working in the health care system of Labrador, Canada. It was there that she  recognized the infant mortality rate for what it was -- a telling measure of a  society's well-being.    Returning to the United States in 1967, she moved to Montgomery, Ala., and  began accumulating degrees in history, epidemiology, social psychology and  demography. During the next 10 years, she waded into statistics, an  epidemiologist's stock in trade.    Assigned to calculate so-called standard mortality ratios for an introductory  epidemiology course, Hale chose to compare white and black rates of infant  death. What she found, she recalls, were two radically different sets of  numbers.    The white numbers were low, the black numbers were high. Yet Hale found it was  common practice in epidemiology to blur the difference between the races by  reporting one overall average rate of infant death.    ""It's two different rates and it's bad science to pool them,"" Hale said  recently. ""So let's just own up to the fact that the infant mortality rate in  this country among blacks is slightly better than that of Central and South  American countries.""    In the early 1980s, some researchers began to suspect that income and class  might not explain the entire racial gap, a discovery that Hale believes was  made possible in part by the evolution of the epidemiologist's tools.    For one thing, the federal government began linking birth and death  certificates in cases of infant death. Infant death researchers could now  estimate parents' socioeconomic status using information, such as education  level, recorded on birth certificates.    At the same time, statisticians developed a method of analyzing data that made  it possible to control for socioeconomic factors. Controlling for education and  income, researchers still found that black babies were still more likely than  whites to die.    In the mid-1980s, federal researchers studying babies born in 1980 found that  blacks at every education level were more likely to have underweight babies.  Even among college-educated black women, the rate was twice as high as that of  comparable whites.    When researchers then looked for factors that might explain that difference --  the mother's marital status, medical care, age, place of residence -- they  could not fully explain the difference in the size of black and white college  women's babies.    Finally, they compared the pregnancies of college-educated blacks to those of  high-school educated whites. According to Carol J.R. Hogue, of the CDC's  division of reproductive health, the black women were 60% more likely than the  whites to have an infant die.    In Seattle, meanwhile, Emanuel, who is considered an expert on birth defects,  was approaching the issue from a different angle. He had been exploring the  relationship between a woman's stature and her ability to bear a healthy child.    Emanuel found that smaller women are more likely to have underweight babies.  From studies throughout the world, it seemed women born underweight were more  likely to give birth to an underweight child.    Emanuel came to suspect that women whose own growth was stunted in the womb or  in childhood -- perhaps by poor nutrition, bad maternal health or inadequate  care -- suffered long-term damage to their reproductive health that could echo  into the next generation.    "" . . . If the overall size of a baby is compromised,"" Emanuel said, ""then it's  not hard to imagine that growth and development of internal organs become  compromised.""    Hale and Emanuel began running into each other at scientific meetings in the  early 1980s. Emanuel explained his findings to Hale, she recalls. She describes  the discovery as ""just like a big light coming on. . . . It just made so much  sense to me.""    In 1989, they published a paper on the subject, fusing Hale's historical and  Emanuel's biological perspectives. The question they posed was: What in the  lives of American black women ""is apparently so hazardous to fetal and infant  health?""    The answer lies in the mother's childhood and in the environment in which her  pregnancies occur, they suggested. They cited numerous studies linking an  infant's birth weight to its mother's birth weight and stature, and to her  parents' social class.    ""A reasonable interpretation . . . is that a mother's own childhood family  conditions affect her reproductive outcomes and the effect is greatest among  families in which few economic resources have to be shared by many people,""  they wrote.    That theory and others like it have been received with interest and caution.    Dr. Arthur Kohrman, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago and  director of La Rabida Children's Hospital, believes there is clearly a  biological factor in the racial differences in birth weight and infant death.    Perhaps in some women the uterus is unusually sensitive to the early onset of  labor, he speculated. Perhaps for some biological reason, hormonal or  neurological, they advance to full-blown labor more easily than other women.    But scientists have been cautious about discussing biological factors, Kohrman  contended.    ""I don't want some guy saying, 'Well, if it's all biological, why are we  putting all this money into these (social and health) programs?' "" he said.  ""And in the current political climate, that's not such a far-fetched thing.""    More important, said Wise of Harvard, is the question of significance.    While biological factors are possible, their role would probably pale by  comparison to social and economic factors, he said. It seems more likely that  certain social factors -- like poverty, education and family dislocation -- are  echoing from one generation into the next.    ""I can't tell you what proportion (of the racial gap) is due to poverty, what  proportion is due to medical care, what proportion to smoking, or to  generational effects,"" said Dr. Woodie Kessel of the National Institute of  Child Health and Human Development.    ""They're sort of mixed in together,"" he said. ""The issue is not to explain the  difference but to do something about the difference.""    In May, 1989, Hale and Emanuel were married. She took a sabbatical and moved to  Seattle to be with him. There, she worked as a visiting professor and as a  consultant to the county health department.    Back in Birmingham this fall, Hale mused about what comes next.    To test the intergenerational hypothesis, Hale would like to help set up a  study tracking the birth weights of black families over generations, to see  whether those families that have been in the middle class the longest indeed  have the better birth weights.    It would also be useful to study births and infant death among Appalachian  whites, she said. There, too, one might find additional evidence for an  intergenerational effect of poverty on reproductive health, if it exists.    At the same time, Hale and Emanuel have called for research into the biological  mechanisms by which poverty translates into poor health -- specifically, how  experiences in the womb and in childhood in one generation ""are linked to  health hazards in the next.""    ""If you are as conscious as we are of the statistics on childhood poverty, one  has the impression of a time bomb waiting to go off,"" she said. ""Poverty has  become a female experience, a child experience. One in four kids live in  poverty.    ""What are we going to do? This is the labor force,"" she wondered, half sad,  half angry. Then she continued -- unconstrained by academic etiquette: ""We have  screwed up our future labor supply. It's the dumbest thing a country could do.""

ONE RESEARCHER SUSPECTS REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS ARE PASSED BETWEEN  GENERATIONS.      By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER      BIRMINGHAM, Ala.      Objectivity is paramount, the scientist was saying. At least, that's what she  had been taught. Speak to the moral implications of your work and you risk  leaving the impression that you are no longer neutral.    But then there is the notion of a Good German, she went on. They knew what was  happening but kept silent -- either out of fear of the consequences of speaking  out, or out of misguided patriotism.    ""I just didn't want to be a Good German,"" the scientist concluded simply. ""So  either you turn your back on the research and you work in something else, or  you have to at some point say, 'This is wrong.' ""    Christiane Hale is in many ways an outsider -- a Northerner repotted in the  soil of the Deep South, an erstwhile expatriate, part epidemiologist, part  historian, part social psychologist, an academic researcher with an undisguised  point of view.    That geography, physical and psychic, defines her professional perspective. She  has observed the U.S. public health system from abroad, and tracked patterns of  disease and death among blacks and whites through the prism of American social  history.    All of which has brought Hale to a chilling and controversial hypothesis in the  attempt to unravel one of the more troubling puzzles in public health -- why it  is that black babies born in the United States are twice as likely as whites to  die by age 1.    The racial gap, Hale and some others believe, cannot entirely be traced to  racial differences in income and social class. Even middle-class black women,  it seems, are twice as likely as whites to give birth to dangerously  underweight babies.    Instead, they have begun to suspect that long-term poverty may have exacted a  deep, physical toll -- subtle but significant damage to the reproductive health  of black women, which they believe can be passed from one generation to the  next.    Precisely how that might occur is unclear. But Hale and others suspect that  women whose growth was stunted in childhood or in the womb as a result of  poverty may suffer internal organ damage that years later can place their own  babies at risk.

He had been exploring the  relationship between a woman's stature and her ability to bear a healthy child.    Emanuel found that smaller women are more likely to have underweight babies.  From studies throughout the world, it seemed women born underweight were more  likely to give birth to an underweight child.    Emanuel came to suspect that women whose own growth was stunted in the womb or  in childhood -- perhaps by poor nutrition, bad maternal health or inadequate  care -- suffered long-term damage to their reproductive health that could echo  into the next generation.    "" . . . If the overall size of a baby is compromised,"" Emanuel said, ""then it's  not hard to imagine that growth and development of internal organs become  compromised.""    Hale and Emanuel began running into each other at scientific meetings in the  early 1980s. Emanuel explained his findings to Hale, she recalls. She describes  the discovery as ""just like a big light coming on. . . . It just made so much  sense to me.""    In 1989, they published a paper on the subject, fusing Hale's historical and  Emanuel's biological perspectives. The question they posed was: What in the  lives of American black women ""is apparently so hazardous to fetal and infant  health?""    The answer lies in the mother's childhood and in the environment in which her  pregnancies occur, they suggested. They cited numerous studies linking an  infant's birth weight to its mother's birth weight and stature, and to her  parents' social class.    ""A reasonable interpretation . . . is that a mother's own childhood family  conditions affect her reproductive outcomes and the effect is greatest among  families in which few economic resources have to be shared by many people,""  they wrote.    That theory and others like it have been received with interest and caution.    Dr. Arthur Kohrman, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago and  director of La Rabida Children's Hospital, believes there is clearly a  biological factor in the racial differences in birth weight and infant death.    Perhaps in some women the uterus is unusually sensitive to the early onset of  labor, he speculated. Perhaps for some biological reason, hormonal or  neurological, they advance to full-blown labor more easily than other women.    But scientists have been cautious about discussing biological factors, Kohrman  contended.    ""I don't want some guy saying, 'Well, if it's all biological, why are we  putting all this money into these (social and health) programs?' "" he said.  ""And in the current political climate, that's not such a far-fetched thing.""    More important, said Wise of Harvard, is the question of significance.    While biological factors are possible, their role would probably pale by  comparison to social and economic factors, he said. It seems more likely that  certain social factors -- like poverty, education and family dislocation -- are  echoing from one generation into the next.    ""I can't tell you what proportion (of the racial gap) is due to poverty, what  proportion is due to medical care, what proportion to smoking, or to  generational effects,"" said Dr. Woodie Kessel of the National Institute of  Child Health and Human Development.    ""They're sort of mixed in together,"" he said. ""The issue is not to explain the  difference but to do something about the difference.""    In May, 1989, Hale and Emanuel were married. She took a sabbatical and moved to  Seattle to be with him. There, she worked as a visiting professor and as a  consultant to the county health department.    Back in Birmingham this fall, Hale mused about what comes next.    To test the intergenerational hypothesis, Hale would like to help set up a  study tracking the birth weights of black families over generations, to see  whether those families that have been in the middle class the longest indeed  have the better birth weights.    It would also be useful to study births and infant death among Appalachian  whites, she said. There, too, one might find additional evidence for an  intergenerational effect of poverty on reproductive health, if it exists.    At the same time, Hale and Emanuel have called for research into the biological  mechanisms by which poverty translates into poor health -- specifically, how  experiences in the womb and in childhood in one generation ""are linked to  health hazards in the next.""    ""If you are as conscious as we are of the statistics on childhood poverty, one  has the impression of a time bomb waiting to go off,"" she said. ""Poverty has  become a female experience, a child experience. One in four kids live in  poverty.    ""What are we going to do? This is the labor force,"" she wondered, half sad,  half angry. Then she continued -- unconstrained by academic etiquette: ""We have  screwed up our future labor supply. It's the dumbest thing a country could do.""

The announcement is disappointing for the government, which had been hoping for a BBB investment grade rating, but still puts it in the same category as countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Mr John Major, the first British Prime Minister to visit South Africa since 1960, nevertheless struck an upbeat note at the end of his three day visit, saying that he had been deeply impressed by the ability and determination of the coalition government, which took power after elections in April. 'The South African government is well aware of the need to create the right climate for the private sector and private enterprise. 'They see no ideological barriers to creating that,' he said. South Africa has been seeking an international credit rating since its April elections and has appointed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to represent it to the major agencies. The price of South African government bonds fell on disappointment among domestic investors that the country had been assigned a sub-investment grade rating. As prices fell, yields rose by 28 basis points to 16.49 per cent. 'There is little surprise outside of South Africa about the decision, but the feeling within the country was that it would get an investment grade rating,' said Mr Graham Bell, of Baring Securities in London. He added: 'However, this reaction is likely to be short-lived. Ibca is not as widely recognised as Moody's and Standard  Poor's, the two major American agencies. 'Their ratings, expected next month, will provide more of a benchmark.' Although the country has borrowed money in the European markets without an official rating, the government is known be particularly keen to get access to the US market. If Moody's and SP give the same rating, this would preclude some major funds from buying South African bonds and force the country to pay a premium on any international issues it might make. In its June budget the government announced its intention to raise R1.8bn (Pounds 320m) from international capital markets in the current financial year. In its report the Ibca acknowledged South Africa benefited from good physical infrastructure, an advanced financial system, good managerial talent and relatively low foreign debt. However it warned that the economy's propensity to import remained high and said that exports remain overly dependent on primary commodities. Mr Christopher Huhne, Ibca Managing Director, said that although the rating may have been lower than government officials hoped, 'the overall tone of the report is optimistic. If the government can establish a credible fiscal track record over the next couple of years, the rating could well improve.' Mr Major, speaking in Johannesburg, said overseas investment was vital if South Africa was to generate the jobs needed to achieve economic prosperity and avoid social disruption. He urged British companies to add to the UK's Pounds 10bn investment in South Africa, which accounts for nearly half of all foreign investment. Economic liberalisation has been a key theme of Mr Major's three-day visit, during which he had talks with President Mandela, Deputy Presidents Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, and cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, and Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party. Mr Major said the South African government would face 'many difficult problems' and forecast 'setbacks as well as advances'. The key to confidence would be clear indications that the government was moving in the right direction. 'I think that if that is the case the South African government, although there will be difficulties, will have every chance of carrying its programme through,' he said.

0,FT943-13711 ,"FT943-13711 _AN-EGRD8AFSFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (33): Missions abroad have doubled - Foreign policy      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   If South African newspaper headlines are taken at face value, President Nelson Mandela is the diplomatic equivalent of Superman. Barely a week has gone by since the new government took office without what is presented as yet another presidential foreign policy initiative, exciting unrealistic expectations. Mr Mandela is, it seems, single-handedly reforming the Organisation of African Unity, in which newly-admitted South Africa is 'destined to play a leading role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution', according to local reports. He is much in demand. Over the past few weeks Mr Mandela has been described as 'brokering' peace efforts in Rwanda and Angola, and contemplating imposing democracy on troubled Lesotho. Thanks to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation, he will attend the next gathering of Francophone states, while the French leader's championing of South Africa placed the country 'firmly on the agenda' at last week's Group of Seven leading industrial nations' meeting in Naples. Meanwhile South Africa has rejoined the Commonwealth and looks forward to playing an active role in the Non-Aligned Movement. New ties have also been forged with Japan. Tokyo's aid package, said to be worth R4bn, will, says Mr Mandela, help to 'kick-start' the country's reconstruction and development plan. But closer examination of the package suggests it may be worth less than the initial estimates suggest. If all this is not enough, President Mandela appeared on video at President Bill Clinton's White House conference on Africa last month to lend his weight to calls for a Marshall Plan for the continent, the name given to the US-led programme to rebuild Europe after the second world war. Included in Mr Mandela's speech was an appeal for radical measures to ease Africa's external debt burden. While these initiatives - real, imagined or exaggerated - take place, one arm of foreign policy seems to be operating with its past efficiency: the state-owned arms manufacturer, Armscor. With sanctions lifted, and its activities given the endorsement of Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, officials are now lifting at least a corner of the veil of secrecy. The defence industry provides 70,000 jobs and foreign exchange, say government officials, who add defensively: 'If we didn't sell weapons, someone else would.' To be fair to Mr Mandela, he and his senior advisers have tried to play down expectations. On the one hand, Mr Mandela's integrity and moral authority makes him the acceptable voice of Africa on behalf of its many causes. At the same time, he makes clear that that he has no easy answers to offer. Advisers also point out that an effective diplomatic role is not made easier by the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the throes of reorganisation. South African missions abroad have doubled since the transition to respectability began, while new entrants to the diplomatic service have to be trained, and suitable ambassadors found to replace many of the pre-election incumbents. Meanwhile the overstretched service is still getting to grips with issues in which it has had little or no experience. These range from getting to know the OAU to the implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal, or reconciling relations with countries with whom ties were initially forged by the African National Congress, or the former government. Thus, the new South Africa has to weigh its relationship with Taiwan, one of its biggest trading partners, against recently-established official links with the People's Republic of China. The latter's trading potential is bigger, and its position as permanent member of the UN Security Council will have to be taken into account by Pretoria should South Africa have aspirations for a council seat as Africa's representative. Nominally in charge of this demanding portfolio is Mr Alfred Nzo, the foreign minister. His surprising appointment is put down to years of loyal service to the ANC. It may also be explained by the fact that policy will be shaped by Mr Mandela himself, and his senior deputy president, Mr Thabo Mbeki. As the initial euphoria and excitement dies down, South Africa's foreign policy is likely to become more cautious. Mr Aziz Pahad, the deputy foreign minister, acknowledges the dangers of taking on too much. But expectations are nevertheless high. In an interview with the Financial Times he echoes the explanation he gave to the Johannesburg Sunday Times: 'We have captured the moral high ground in nonracialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader in this area.' First of all, however, South Africa has to consolidate its success and build a stable, flourishing, democracy: 'If we don't sink, they (Africa's donors and creditors) see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region doesn't sink, they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of other parts of Africa.' Mr Pahad hopes that foreign investors do not ignore South Africa's neighbours: 'If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South Africa and, given that our borders are so big, we will not be able to prevent it.'

0,FT921-13556 ,"FT921-13556 _AN-CAUBNACXFT 920121   FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: South Africa in Ecu250m landmark offering      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICA's return to world capital markets yesterday received considerable impetus with the announcement that the government was raising Ecu250m (R890m). The issue is the first by South Africa in the Ecu market since 1984, and follows the country's re-entry last September into world capital markets with a DM400m issue, after an absence of six years. The issue, which was mostly pre-placed, is 'new money', unlike the D-Mark issue, half of which was used to refinance a maturing issue. The issue underlines the change in attitudes towards South Africa since the dark days of mid-1985, when the refusal of foreign banks to roll over the country's loans forced South Africa to declare a standstill on debt repayment. Since then, Pretoria has maintained what Mr Gerhard Croeser, director-general of the department of finance, yesterday called a 'meticulous' record in meeting debt commitments and complying with the conditions of the three Interim Debt Arrangements, to which South Africa's foreign debt has been subjected since the 1985 standstill. The South African authorities believe the launch also showed that international investors felt the country's political and economic prospects had been enhanced by the formation in December of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for the country's constitutional negotiations. The funds, Mr Croeser said, would contribute towards the financing of the national budget, play an important role in strengthening the country's reserves, and promote economic stability and the further normalisation of South Africa's relations with its foreign creditors. Strengthening the country's foreign reserves is particularly important as it will allow the Reserve Bank (central bank) to pursue a less restrictive monetary policy, and enhance economic growth. In recent years, South Africa's ability to finance economic growth has been constrained by the need to export savings to finance debt repayments. The country exported about R30bn of capital in this way between 1986 and 1990. In international terms, South Africa is an under-borrowed country. Total external debt at December 1990 totalled USDollars 19.3bn, equivalent to 70.2 per cent of annual export earnings. The interest service ratio is 7.1 per cent. South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 23.7bn at the end of August 1985, when the standstill on international borrowing was declared. The Ecu issue, for maturity in 1997, has a coupon of 10.375 per cent. The Department of Finance said this was a premium of about 1.77 basis points over the average for three benchmark Ecu issues, of similar maturity, by Spain, Norway and Belgium. The premium is partly a function of political risk, the debt standstill, and the fact that having been out of the market for so long, South Africa lacks liquid issues, and it is liquidity which brings marketability and a lower price. Last week Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the country would push for a final debt arrangement to deal with the outstanding Dollars 5bn when the third interim arrangement ended in 1993. He said a further arrangement was necessary because South Africa could not afford to repay the whole amount in 1993. The removal of the debt standstill, and South Africa's readmission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are the biggest remaining obstacles to the normalisation of South Africa's relations with the international financial community.

The report helps to explain the UK's strong resistance to the European working time directive, passed earlier this year, which places strict controls on working more than 48 hours per week. Between 1983 and 1992, average hours usually worked per week declined by just under 4 per cent. The largest reduction was in the Netherlands, where average hours fell by 13 per cent. By contrast, in Italy and the UK the fall was only 1 per cent or less. But the UK is the only EU country which has non-wage labour costs which bear less heavily on low-paid workers. The report also implicitly backs the UK government's arguments against a minimum wage by stating that 'low pay is a relatively minor source of poverty levels of income'. Overall, poverty is associated with low pay, but in Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK, being out of work is the main cause of poverty. The report also found that: More people in the EU are now employed in construction than in agriculture. And almost as many people are employed in business services - the biggest growth sector between 1985 and 1992 - as in agriculture. In Germany and Spain, 90 per cent of the unemployed find jobs through public employment services. In the UK and Portugal, it is less than 30 per cent and in Greece, less than 10 per cent. In Belgium, 63 per cent of any increase in labour costs goes to the state. In other words, the total cost of raising an employee's pay is nearly three times the addition to their net pay. In general, exchange rate movements rather than differentials in productivity or wage rises have been the most important determinant of the cost competitiveness of European producers.

But with investment at its lowest level for more than 30 years (15.9 per cent of GDP), and with capital pouring out of the country at the rate of 2.8 per cent of GDP between 1985 and 1992 the resumption of foreign investment is crucial to sustained recovery. Little is likely to materialise in the near term, though in both business and government there are high hopes of resumed access to IMF and the World Bank funding once agreement is reached at the constitutional negotiations. Welcome though this will be, what South Africa desperately needs is substantial direct investment inflows, bringing with them skills, technology and market access. The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) estimates that between 1984 and 1991, 214 US firms or about two thirds of those with investments in South Africa disinvested. As a result, the stock of US direct investment fell to Dollars 700m at the end of the 1980s from Dollars 2.6bn at the start. Another 190 non-US firms have left during the same period, the majority British-owned. Many foreign firms retained non-equity links with South Africa, which could limit the number of returnees. There have been some moves since the sanctions thaw began three years ago with Mr Mandela's release. The IRRC says 16 US companies have quietly opened offices or established subsidiaries in the past two years, including four of the 168 US corporations that disinvested between 1985 and 1990. Six of the new entrants were in the software and computer businesses. There are now 119 US corporations with direct investments or employees in South Africa, with many more likely to set up shop once second-tier sanctions, operated by more than 60 city, county and state organisations penalising US firms doing business in South Africa, are lifted. Britain is by far the biggest player with the UK-South Africa Trade Association estimating British investment, direct and portfolio, at more than Dollars 16bn. The London School of Economics Centre for the Study of the South African Economy and International Finance, has identified 51 new investments in the country since late 1989. While stressing that its database is incomplete the centre estimates the inflow of new direct investment over the past three years at around Dollars 1.5bn or 1.5 per cent of GNP. The LSE Centre found that the bulk of the resumed foreign investment has focused on a narrow range of activities - those that are highly vertically integrated, knowledge and communications intensive and quality dependent. More than 85 per cent of the investments identified since 1989 were in five sectors - beverages, hotels and leisure, electronics, chemicals and oils and engineering. According to the IRRC, a feature of renewed US investment is the switch from equity to non-equity links, with the number of US companies with non-equity links increasing from 184 to 299. South African Reserve Bank figures show a similar trend. The Bank's census of foreign transactions for 1989, just released, makes a distinction between direct and non-direct investments, noting that the share of the latter has risen from 46 per cent of the total in 1973 to more than 76 per cent in 1989. Since South Africa fell off the foreign investment agenda of most global firms in the mid-1980s, the rules of the game have changed. Today's global business is unenthusiastic about natural resource investments in mining and less likely than 20 years ago to be attracted by plentiful labour, even when it is low-cost. The key attractions today are markets and skills and because South Africa is a long way from the Triad markets of North America, the EC and the Far East and has little to offer on the skills front, new foreign investors - as distinct from those already there - may well be thin on the ground. The more so if the new government insists on codes of conduct, social programmes, affirmative action, and expatriate and local value-added quotas. The fact is that global competition for inward investment is intense and there are already enough disincentives to investment in South Africa without throwing up new obstacles that do not apply elsewhere in the third world. Pessimism can be overdone. A peaceful, stable South Africa must become the logical headquarters for African operations and the platform for developing exports and markets in the sub-Saharan region.

""We are meeting at a time to celebrate the  victory of South Africa but also to stop the agony of the  conflict in Rwanda and Africa as a whole,"" he told the  correspondent of the PAN AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) in Tunis.  The situation in Rwanda, he said, would remain one of concern  as long the parties to the conflict failed to agree on a  ceasefire. ""We are actively involved in getting Africans to  contribute troops for peacekeeping and are quite satisfied with  the response,"" [word indistinct] Salim. Apart from Ghana,  Ethiopia and Senegal, he said, Congo and Nigeria had given firm  commitments to contribute forces. He said some African  countries which were unable to contribute troops had offered  other help in resolving the crisis. Namibia, Salim said, had  pledged 500,000 US dollars to assist UNAMIR [UN Assistant  Mission in Rwanda] in the peacekeeping mission. ""The African  commitment and African readiness to do something is there,"" he  said. The current ministerial session, he said, would focus on  how to strengthen the organisation's capacity to manage and  prevent conflicts but would also create conditions for what he  called the ""second liberation of the continent.""    Speaking earlier at a press conference Salim said the  peaceful elections in South Africa was a miracle, commending the  spirit of reconciliation in which the elections were held and an  all-race government installed. ""South Africa has demonstrated  something more: It has shown that notwithstanding the  complexity of a situation, given national dialogue, leadership  and foresight, it is possible to resolve the most intractable  problem including that of Rwanda,"" he said.    Rwanda is represented at the current session by the foreign  minister of the interim government, Jerome Bicamumpaka. The  Rwanda Patriotic Front is represented by Bizimungu Pasteur,  member of the front's executive committee and minister designate  for internal affairs of the broadbased government put in place  after the Arusha August 1993 accord. Rwanda's warring parties  ended ceasefire talks last week without making progress towards  a truce and with the front vowing to fight on. The OAU is  supporting international efforts to bring to account the  individual leaders responsible for the killings in the country.  The carnage has claimed 500,000 lives in eight weeks.     "
0,FT944-58 ,"FT944-58 _AN-FAAACADJFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: How to remain safe in Africa - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots)      By JDF JONES   I was once staying in a game lodge in Uganda when a Belgian tourist met a painful death because he tried to feed a sugar lump to an elephant. No doubt his friends back home concluded that Africa was a dangerous place and resolved never to visit the savage continent. They would not have understood that this had been a most rare and unlikely accident. Many potential visitors to South Africa, who do not already know the country, probably have similar, and excessive, fears about what might happen to them. After all, an awful lot of people get killed there - you see it on television all the time, and this is no longer political violence but criminal (ie anyone can be a victim). South Africa is a world leader in the incidence of violent crime (just one statistic: 60 of every 100,000 South Africans are likely to be murdered next year, compared with 10 in the US and two in Britain). The overall crime rate continues to rise, with heavy increases in rape and assault this year. Is this not bound to enter the mind of the first-time visitor? Is it safe (or rather, because South Africa palpably is not as 'safe' as Bournemouth or Biarritz) - is it safe enough? The answer, as foreigners begin to pour into South Africa to visit this most beautiful of countries, is that the new South Africa is adequately 'safe' so long as you are sensible, which is to try to understand the roots and the manifestations of a security situation which obviously cannot be compared with the Cotswolds: The present situation in certain districts of the big cities is undeniably tricky, by which I mean that it demands caution and commonsense on the part of the visitor. Downtown Johannesburg is the best example: you would not dream of walking the streets after dusk and you would exercise some care during daylight. More generally, the visitor should learn the habit of locking car doors on the inside, concealing handbags and parcels, driving through red lights if there are suspicious youths at the junction, not flaunting jewellery, not carrying too much cash. Outside the towns, the open countryside is much safer on the nerves. But the sensible rules still apply: do not drive through certain areas (eg the Transkei) at night - not so much because of any danger of brigands as of cattle on the unfenced roads; do not drive yourself into a township unless you have a guide or know where you are going; do not pick up people at the roadside without looking carefully; and do not go walking in remote areas without taking advice (best to stick to the national parks, where security is good). Bear in mind that South Africa has an appalling record for simple road accidents. Drive very carefully. There is no point in denying that South Africa today is an even more violent society than it used to be, which is saying something. But that does not begin to make it a no-go area. Let us keep a sense of proportion. How much of the above would also apply to New York City or Florida, Rio or Zimbabwe? I am writing this from a delightful hotel on the Indian Ocean coast of the Transkei. We are protected by an electrified fence. At least, that is what it says: I have not tested whether the current is turned on. PS: I am actually filing this piece from another, equally delightful hotel on the edge of Zululand. We are only a few miles from an area where horrifying tribal bloodletting has featured in the international press this year, yet they do not bother to lock the doors. But they do have a dozy Alsatian, a puppy, in the garden.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P7999 Amusement and Recreation, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Li Shengrong, the top official in charge of the code-named  4071 Project, said the project will involve the building of  reservoirs, pump stations and wells, which will expand irrigated  farmlands by 3,700 ha.    The project will also sponsor the building of 10,000 ha of  terraced farms, 77 km of roads and water supply works to quench  the wide thirst felt both by humans and stock, Li said.    Li said the project will teach 31,900 to read and write,  reducing the local adult illiteracy rate from 36 percent to 18  percent. About 64,000 farmers, 28,000 of them women, will be  trained in various farming skills.    The project will be aimed at setting up a network of  extension stations for the promotion of new stock and crop  breeds and better farming skills and machines.    Massive afforestation efforts under the project will improve  the local environment and alleviate the shortage of animal feeds  and fuels, Li said.    The three counties involved in the project, namely Guyuan,  Pengyang and Longde, account for 59 percent of the autonomous  region's area, where poor resources, infertile farms and  frequent natural disasters have made the area one of the poorest  places in China.    According to the authority, the three counties now have  639,000 people living under the official poverty line.    Project 4071 will cost 150 million yuan, of which half will  be funded by 80,500 tons of grain donated by the United Nations  World Food Program, Li said. The first batch of 14,500 tons of  grain are expected to arrive by September.    In five years when the project is completed, the authority  hopes that the local grain production will be double its current  figure, and the average income of local farmers will rise above  the poverty line.    To ensure the work quality of the project, Li said the  project authority has invited experts and senior management  staff to provide technological supervision and consultancy  services.     "

The row, which threatened to overshadow a three-day official visit to South Africa by Mr Major, erupted after Lady Thatcher during a trip to India dismissed South Africa's hopes of attracting international investment. She told businessmen at an official British gathering in Bombay that investors were afraid of violence and social unrest in South Africa, in spite of the formation of a government of national unity after the country's first all-race elections in April. 'What you are getting is people who look at the rest of Africa. They say 'Look at Rwanda, look at Somalia'. Are we going to have the same thing happening in South Africa?' she said. Lady Thatcher, who also described Nigeria as 'a terrible mess', pointed to tensions between Zulu leaders as evidence of continuing friction in South Africa. 'There will be a certain amount of trouble there. This is why people are holding back,' she said. However, after a vigorous rejection of her views by Mr Major and British business leaders, Lady Thatcher issued a statement saying that she 'fully supports the new democratic government of South Africa and feels that the country will attract the inward investment it so much needs'. In a clear attempt to repair the diplomatic damage in South Africa, the statement said that Lady Thatcher 'further hopes that the prime minister's present mission to that country will be highly successful'. Her views contrasted with the tone of Mr Major's visit, during which he has expressed confidence in the South African government's ability to achieve economic prosperity. British officials are also aware that Lady Thatcher is a controversial figure among black leaders, many of whom were angered by her reluctance to endorse sanctions against the former all-white government. Without responding directly, Mr Major went as far as he could to rebuke Lady Thatcher without naming her, suggesting that she was out of touch with events in South Africa. 'I do not think there is a shred of doubt about the confident future South Africa can look forward to,' he said. 'You don't have to sit back in your armchair abroad and wonder what is happening. People should come here. It would be good for South Africa and good for them too.' Mr Major told businessmen that optimism about South Africa's future was well founded.

And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African  heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan  wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday  both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to  meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict.  He said Mandela would meet the two parties.    Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis  yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan  war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President  Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit  in Tunis.    He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total  Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi  to help resolve the Angolan dispute.    On possible reparations by South Africa to African  countries,  he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had  helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not  for reward but from a sense of duty.    Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to  requests for reparations in the light of indications that the  Angolan government might seek such payments.    ""We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving  past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a  demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider  that matter seriously"".    He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring  country about damage done by the previous government ""we cannot  take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we  are not responsible for its crimes.    ""But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully.    ""We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and  as  people not affiliated to any particular organisation.    ""Now that we are free we are not going to give any material  resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than  to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have  a secure future.    ""It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped  us.""    Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to  attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him  and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times  had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.

[Derycke] During the parliamentary debate, it was only the  Flemish Bloc which shocked me, arguing for the abandoning of an  Africa which they see as on the road to ruin. If that is the  position of Belgian society, as the Flemish Bloc claims, then I  am almost ashamed to be Belgian. Europe has a tradition which  will not allow it to act in this way. I have also been  surprised by the extent to which certain deputies, and no doubt  public opinion, are ill-informed on the subject of Rwanda,  unaware that we have redirected 80 percent of our aid for this  country to basic activities, far removed from political  intrigues.    [Stroobants] Specifically?    [Derycke] In the field of education, health care, and  agriculture we have given the minimum necessary for these people  who, without us, would have nothing. In the future, we will  have to discuss cooperation within the government, with the  Parliament, and with the people. Like everyone else, I too am  pained by the death of our paratroopers and civilians. They  were all in Rwanda to help with the country's democratization.  But we must not forget that the drama experienced by the vast  majority of Rwandans is, at the very least, as awful as our own.    [Stroobants] Could democracy really be envisaged in Rwanda?    [Derycke] We created an elite which was ready for democracy,  in accordance with the policy defined by the European Union.  Africa is not entirely a disaster, even if seven or eight  countries are still lagging behind on the question of freedoms.  The other donor countries must understand this, together with  the IMF and the World Bank. The socio-economic problems, the  poverty, are also factors which partly explain what is happening.    [Stroobants] Belgian cooperation will continue?    [Derycke] We are already providing humanitarian aid, as of  today. For the rest, it is clear that we must now consider the  situation and it is not going to start up again overnight. But  I cannot stand those who say ""It's all over, let them get on  with it."" Africa can be our principal partner. Improving the  life of the people of Africa can also bring benefits for us. I  myself am proud that Belgium is maintaining a policy of  cooperation. In 80 percent of the countries we aid, the policy  is a genuine success. [passage omitted]     "

This was the message which Organisation of African  Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim conveyed in his  discussions this week to a wide range of political leaders and  roleplayers.    Speaking at a Johannesburg press conference on Friday [25  February] night, Dr. Salim said more efforts should be made and  political leaders should get together to find an all-inclusive  political settlement. It was in the interest of South Africa  and Africa that dialogue continued, no matter how difficult the  process. ""No stone should be left unturned to see even at this  11th hour if a solution can be found.""    He welcomed the announced meeting next Tuesday between  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and  African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. ""This is a  challenge coming at a critical moment and I hope it will be  successful,"" he said.    Dr. Salim said his two-hour meeting with Mr Buthelezi in  Ulundi earlier on Friday had been ""very interesting and candid"".  The IFP president had explained his concerns and reservations  to participating in the election, while Dr. Salim had spelt out  to him Africa's expectations of a peaceful election in which all  parties took part.    Dr. Salim said he had pointed out to Mr Buthelezi that in  any  negotiations, participants had to be prepared to make  compromises. The government and the ANC had made some  ""significant"" concessions, he said.    Asked whether he believed the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [National Front -- AVF] demands for a volkstaat [homeland] were  reasonable, he said this was a matter for South Africans to  decide.    The OAU would like to see a united South Africa in which  Afrikaners played an important and constructive role in the  democratic process, like respecting and understanding the  country's cultural diversity, he said.    Dr. Salim said he remained optimistic about South Africa's  future for as long as leaders were prepared to talk to each  other. What gave him hope was that all roleplayers had  indicated that they still wanted to be part of the democratic  process, he said.    During his fact-finding mission Dr. Salim also had in-depth  talks with among others Mr Mandela, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik  Botha, Gen Constand Viljoen of the AVF, Pan Africanist Congress  Deputy President Johnson Mlambo, Independent Electoral  Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and Mr Justice  Richard Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission. He is to meet  state President FW de Klerk before his departure on Saturday.     "

It was only a few days ago that he toured this huge black township, looking in  on a migrant workers' hostel reeking of human waste, a primary school and a new  shopping center where he stopped to buy a pack of Camel Lights.    When he appeared at the door of a neat yellow stucco home, he surprised  Henrietta Mafokosho by asking if she'd give him and his wife a house tour.    ""I was shivering,"" Mafokosho, 21, recalled. ""I couldn't believe such a great  man was here in my house, shaking my hand. He's a nice guy.""    There haven't been many white South African leaders in this troubled country's  history whom Sowetans would call great men -- or even, for that matter, nice  guys. But De Klerk is like none before him.    Since he was sworn into office a year ago last week, the 54-year-old head of  state has shaken up South Africa and the world with his stunning reform  program.    Upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Sunday, he  quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and declared that his nation  is on ""a great journey"" toward full democracy.    A smiling De Klerk, recalling the words of King, said: ""Peace and freedom are  the goals of all men. South Africa has embarked on a great journey. It is a  journey for full democracy at home, and abroad full participation in the family  of nations.""    He added that ""the new South Africa is at hand"" and promised that the ""walls of  apartheid are coming down.""    De Klerk, who meets President Bush today, has said his mission is to persuade  Americans that he is serious about reform.    ""Many people (in America) are still looking at South Africa through glasses  they should have discarded by now,"" De Klerk said before embarking on his trip.  He added that it would be ""a great challenge to change the image burned into  their minds by years and years"" of violent scenes from South Africa on their  television screens.    But the trip comes as De Klerk's program to dismantle apartheid and begin  negotiations, warmly welcomed both here and abroad, runs into its most serious  difficulties since the government opened talks with the African National  Congress in May.    A month of factional violence in Johannesburg-area townships has left more than  760 dead and put new obstacles on the road to peace. De Klerk has sent extra  police into the townships in Operation Iron Fist, which seemed to halt the  trouble, at least temporarily.    The president also ordered razor wire put up around flash points of trouble,  prepared to impose curfews beginning Tuesday and declared a 10-day amnesty for  the surrender of dangerous weapons.    The ANC has criticized the crackdown, saying it amounts to a reimposition of  the state of emergency and is designed to repress legitimate political  activity. The ANC blames the current violence on right-wing white agitators who  are stoking black fighting to undermine the peace process.    De Klerk says the fighting stems primarily from ethnic and political  differences among blacks, although he says it is possible other, unknown,  forces are behind some of the attacks.    Incidents of unrest have increased sharply since De Klerk normalized black  political activity by legalizing the ANC and other black organizations in a  landmark speech Feb. 2.    The rising expectations of blacks living in ghettos has touched off hundreds of  demonstrations. Some have been peaceful but others have been broken up with  police tear gas and bullets.    A recent judicial inquiry recommended that charges be brought against three  dozen black and white police officers who killed five demonstrators without  provocation in Sebokeng during a March protest.    The scenes of unrest have been replayed nightly for nervous whites on state-run  television, driving many into the lap of the government's right-wing political  opponents.    Adding to De Klerk's woes is the almost daily criticism from militant white  groups who complain that whites suspected in right-wing attacks and bombings  have been detained without cause and tortured while in custody. Police  officials express private fears for De Klerk's life.    The growing power of the right wing has put pressure on the president to prove  that his reforms will be good for the country's whites in the long run.    ""De Klerk tries to project an image of sweet reasonableness, and he's done it  successfully,"" said Sampie Terreblanche, a political analyst at Stellenbosch  University. ""But in the next six months, he'll have to deliver some of that  sweetness.""    Most analysts agree that the lifting of economic and other sanctions against  South Africa would go a long way toward easing the anxieties of whites, who  have been financially and emotionally hurt by the campaign to isolate them from  the West's markets, culture and sports fields.    ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, during a U.S. tour in June, won assurances  from many congressional leaders that sanctions will remain in place until  apartheid reform is irreversible. The ANC says that point has not yet been  reached.    So far, De Klerk has said he's disappointed that foreign governments have  refused ""to acknowledge that the process in South Africa has become  irreversible. We sincerely say . . . there will be a new constitution. And that  constitution will be fair and just.    ""The time is right for the international community to re-evaluate the situation  and to put their money where their mouths are,"" De Klerk added.    The president said, though, that he did not come to the United States ""with hat  in hand"" to plead for an end to sanctions. ""That will take care of itself as  South Africans prove that we mean business,"" he said.    Sanctions against South Africa, passed over President Reagan's veto in 1986,  are among the most severe Pretoria faces. The American law outlines specific  steps that must be taken by the South African government before the  Administration can consider removing those sanctions.    The Bush Administration believes De Klerk has met most of those conditions. One  obstacle will be removed when the government releases about 2,500 political  prisoners. The government and the ANC have agreed on a plan to identify and  release those activists, beginning in a matter of weeks.    A more formidable obstacle is the lifting of the state of emergency in Natal  province. Three years of black faction fighting in Natal between supporters of  Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has  killed nearly 4,000 people.    Even if De Klerk receives no promises from Washington, the trip still will be  heralded back home as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The last South African  leader to visit the United States was Gen. Jan Smuts, in 1945, three years  before the National Party came to power.    Many white South Africans have chafed under the diplomatic and economic  isolation engendered by their country's system of apartheid, which segregates  neighborhoods, schools and hospitals and denies the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    Since 1983, the number of American firms doing business in South Africa has  dropped from 386 to 129. Nevertheless, many South Africans still admire  Americans and delight in American entertainment and products.    Two of the most popular programs on state-run television are ""LA Law"" and  ""thirtysomething."" Theaters here show many American movies. And South Africans  snap up everything from American canned goods to computers -- despite mark-ups  that average 400% of the U.S. sales price.    De Klerk's promises to negotiate a new constitution that will end apartheid and  extend voting rights to black people has greatly improved Pretoria's relations  with the United States, Europe and Africa. But that has yet to translate into  trade agreements to aid South Africa's sagging economy. Many foreign  governments are looking for more concrete signs of change.    The president already has promised that the next session of Parliament, which  opens in February, 1991, will scrap the Group Areas Act, a pillar of apartheid  that carves the country into separate neighborhoods for blacks, mixed-race  Coloreds, Indians and whites.    He has moved less quickly on opening schools. White public schools will be  allowed to open their doors to blacks next year if 72% of a school's parents  agree. But the government still maintains veto power and, even in integrated  schools, whites still will get first choice for openings.    De Klerk has been heartened, though, by the warm reception many blacks in South  Africa have given to his reform program. The graffiti artists in South Africa's  townships have splattered his first initials -- ""Viva F. W."" -- next to their  anti-apartheid slogans.    And recent opinion polls suggest that if a multiracial election were held  today, the white Afrikaner president would get one in five black votes.  (Mandela would get three of the other four.)    De Klerk was cheered by hundreds of Sowetans during his recent tour here. Many  were surprised to hear him admit that the conditions of many township  residents, especially those living in the hostels that have been the flash  points of recent violence, ""were absolutely unacceptable.""    ""My impression is that so much needs to be done,"" he said.    He had told Soweto primary school pupils that he and ""other leaders, the black  leaders, all of us, are trying to work out a new South Africa in which you will  be able to live happily.""    And at least some Sowetans were impressed by his sincerity.    ""A lot of people in the township really like F. W. They believe in him,""  Henrietta Mafokosho said. ""And they believe that in a few years, everything  will be OK.""    Times staff writer Jim Mann, in Washington, contributed to this story.

CEDLA asserts that eight out of 10 urban families do not  have  enough income to pay for their basic needs, according to  research carried out in La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba, and Santa  Cruz.    According to the study, 80.1 percent of the urban population  are poor, of which 49.4 percent are destitute, while the  percentage of non-destitute (those who earn enough to buy food,  but not clothes or pay for housing or anything else) reached  30.5 percent.    The CEDLA study, which was disseminated today by the JATHA  news agency, states that ""the neoliberal adjustment implemented  by Bolivian governments since 1985 has worsened the unfair  distribution of wealth, increased the concentration of income,  and reduced the purchasing power of salaries and wages.""    During the last few years, workers in the largest cities  extended their work week by four weekly hours, with low  salaries, lower income, and less labor stability.    The researchers said that not only has poverty increased,  but  the benefits to which a minority are entitled have been reduced  as well.    The report states that 15 percent of the working population  obtained half the income generated by the Bolivian economy,  while the remaining 85 percent of the working population got the  other half.    Bishop Edmundo Abastoflor, chairman of the Bolivian Bishops  Conference, today warned of the serious social consequences that  this gap between rich and poor, which increases daily, may bring.    ""It is shocking to see the squandering of money in the  downtown areas of Bolivian cities, with luxury cars and  millions' worth of construction work, while you can also see the  deterioration in the standard of living of the poor classes,""  said the bishop, who is worried about the increase of poverty in  the country.    Abastoflor said that the poor must be helped with political  and social measures so that they can improve their standards of  living with dignity, as is appropriate for human beings.     "
0,FT933-4400 ,"FT933-4400 _AN-DIIB8ABUFT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / End of S Africa sanctions era in sight      By PHILIP GAWITH   THE breakthrough made this week by South Africa's constitutional negotiators towards establishing a multiracial government promises significant relief to an economy that is short of good news, writes Philip Gawith. Agreement on a Transitional Executive Council (TEC), after many false dawns, has at last brought the end of the sanctions era in view. Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, has said the ANC will probably call for the lifting of remaining financial sanctions - most notably the embargo on International Monetary Fund/World Bank financing - by the end of the month. It is likely also to mark the start of an era of considerably increased international development assistance. As Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, made clear during a recent visit: 'The international community wants to help and to help substantially once the next step has been taken towards representative government.' The US and European Community have expressed similar intentions. Although white South Africans have for years with bravado dismissed sanctions as ineffective there will be no disguising the joy when they finally go. While a minority found succour in the romance of the besieged volk in its laager, most longed to be rid of the burden of being an international pariah. It could not come at a better time. Economists believe South Africa's net reserves have fallen as low as one month's import cover, while capital outflows and the lower gold price have driven the rand to a record low against the dollar. Top of the list will be re-establishment of links with the IMF. Since declaring a moratorium on the repayment of part of its external debt in 1985 South Africa has been forced to run a current account surplus to finance more than Dollars 1bn a year in debt repayments. This has seriously hampered growth. Renewed access to the IMF will allow South Africa to run a deficit and growth prospects will be improved. Banks will also be much happier to do business in South Africa when it enjoys the financial backing of the IMF. The IMF has made no secret in recent months of its willingness to lend to South Africa again, most recently in July when President FW de Klerk held talks in Washington with Mr Michael Camdessus, its managing director. The World Bank has also made clear it is ready to lend large sums, most for infrastructure and human resource development. Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the central bank, believes that the TEC agreement will be seen by the IMF and World Bank as the signal that the time is ripe to re-engage formally with South Africa. He said yesterday that in terms of the IMF's compensatory and contingency financing facility (CFF), South Africa is eligible for about Dollars 800m in assistance arising from balance of payments shortfalls related to the severe drought in 1992. The technical groundwork for the loan has already been done, but he stressed that an application would have to come from the finance sub-committee of the TEC. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, the Cape-based life office, argues that when the world economy starts growing again, South Africa's current account will benefit more directly than in the past when its trade was hampered by such factors as having to accept a political discount on goods and incur the cost of routing trade through a third party. Although nobody is expecting big capital inflows to the country, the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations should help stop the haemorrhage on the capital account. In the year to June, the total net outflow of capital not related to reserves amounted to R9.8bn (Pounds 1.4bn). Mr Stals argues that this 'is not a sign of economic weakness, but of the difficult political situation in which we find ourselves'. He believes that the removal of sanctions will allow investors to assess South Africa more in terms of conventional risk criteria, without 'extraneous' political distractions. There remain of course, as he is quick to recognise, ample reasons for believing that investors are likely to hold back until well after an election. At the very least, uncertainty about political stability, the shape of future economic policies, and the economy's seeming inability to emerge from a prolonged slump give considerable cause for caution. From the point of view of the US investor there are other obstacles too. At the last count, 26 states, 90 local authorities and 24 counties still had sanctions in place. The effect of these has been to prevent US bank lending to South Africa and US pension fund investment in companies with South African ties. The fact that some sanctions still remain in place against Namibia, which received its independence in March 1990, is a reminder of the obstacles that lie ahead.

According to the 1992 edition of the IRRC publication, International Business in South Africa, 508 non-US companies have direct investment or employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. Of these, 153 are British, 142 German and 111 are American. US companies are also returning to South Africa, but in much smaller numbers, says the report. Since President George Bush lifted the ban on new investment in July 1991, five US companies have established offices, bringing the total of US companies with direct investment or employees up to 111. US disinvestment from South Africa began on a substantial scale after the violence of the mid-1980s, with the number of US companies in the republic falling from 267 in May 1986 to 168 by October 1987 to a low of 106 in 1991, according to IRRC statistics. But the report notes that US companies remain reluctant to invest in South Africa 'because of more than 60 state, city and county selective contracting laws that penalise companies doing business in South Africa when awarding contracts'. Investors are also discouraged by violence and political uncertainty, the report adds. The trend towards establishing non-equity links with South African companies 'has continued to increase dramatically', the report continues. It says that 303 non-US companies have non-equity links (such as licensing or distribution agreements) with South African companies, a net increase of 132 from a year ago. US companies with non-equity links rose by 23 to 256. International Business in South Africa 1992, IRRC, 1755 Massachusetts Ave NW, Suite 600, Washington DC 20036. Phone (202) 234-7500. Dollars 250.

The Dollars 500m global offering of five-year bonds is likely to pave the way for a flood of new issues from other South African borrowers in both the public and private sectors. It is being closely watched by major South African companies and institutions as a measure of the acceptability of South African bonds on the global market and of confidence in the economic policies of the new government. The state-owned electricity utility Eskom and telecommunications company Telkom as well as several private companies are expected to approach the international capital markets over the next few months. Although South Africa has borrowed on the international markets before, this is the first time it has been able to approach the US market directly. The bond offering is expected to be launched either today or tomorrow. Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, the banks lead-managing the deal, were last night unable to comment on the pricing of the bonds, but the market expects a price about 170 to 200 basis points (1.7 to 2 percentage points) over US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. This compares with a margin of about 175 basis points available on Greek bonds of a similar maturity. Mexican debt is trading at about 200 basis points over US Treasuries. Both countries have a similar credit rating to South Africa. Earlier this year, South Africa was awarded an investment grade rating by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. Japan's Nippon Investor Services also gave the country an investment grade rating. However, Standard  Poor's, the other major US rating agency, awarded a sub-investment grade rating, albeit with a positive outlook. The launch follows the completion yesterday of a series of investment presentations in Asia, Europe and the US by a South African delegation, including Mr Chris Liebenberg, the finance minister; Mr Alec Erwin, his deputy; Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank; and Mr Tito Mboweni, labour minister.

He  also spoke of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the backup  measures being implemented, and the effects of the monetary  adjustment on the balance sheet of the Bank of Central African  States [BEAC]. He also mentioned the steps to take in response  to the presentation of the experts' report on economic and  monetary integration. Taking stock of the summit, the president  stated that the Libreville meeting helped adopt practical steps  to implement the backup measures. [passage omitted]    Analyzing the incidence of the monetary adjustment on the  balance sheet of the BEAC, the heads of state noted the negative  effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction  accounts, all of which are now in debt. Central Africa,  President Patasse said, is lagging behind its West African  counterparts and its issuing bank is not doing well, mainly  because of the selfishness of some states. This attitude has  worsened to such extent that the BEAC's balance relies on the  fragile economies of two states in the subregion.    [Begin Patasse recording] It is very easy to note that  Central Africa is ill as a result of the selfishness shown by  each of the subregional states. As a result of exaggerated  nationalism in the subregion, Central Africa is now lagging far  behind West Africa. I stress that if Central Africa does not  realize the danger we will get lost, and that is the main lesson  to draw from our Libreville meeting. When you analyze the  report presented by the BEAC governor, you will note that the  Central Bank hinges on the CAR in the first place and then on  Chad. When we take into account the transaction accounts, we  can say that as far as the Central African Region is concerned  there is a deficit. It is thanks to our country that the  Central Bank survives. But we must avoid boasting because the  essential element needed first of all is solidarity. [end  recording]    The main decisions made by the heads of state in Libreville  include: checking increasing inflation, reducing increases in  the prices of essential commodities, and negotiating with the  IMF the possibilities of ensuring an influx of funds to Central  Africa necessary to reestablish financial balance in the  subregion. But the main announcement that the head of state  made was the creation in the days ahead of the CEMAC. The heads  of state agreed on the examination of two draft texts to be  submitted to them for signature in order to rapidly put in place  the institutions of the new community. All this is expected to  be ready for the next summit slated for Ndjamena. Let us listen  to the president again:    [Begin Patasse recording] We will find solutions to our  problems. We will meet in Ndjamena in one or two week's time,  and we will find solutions. We have transcended the chauvinist  stage to tackle major problems confronting all of us, that is  how we will create the CEMAC. That is the main point of our  meeting in Libreville. We also examined security problems in  the subregion. Concerning this point, there are the examples of  our Chadian brothers that we have accepted on our territory and  the Cameroon- Nigeria conflict. These are the current problems,  but we are convinced that if political will exists in such a way  that we can pool our resources to rejuvenate Central Africa, I  am convinced that we shall overcome micro-nationalism which  constitutes an obstacle to Central Africa's development.

0,FT922-4626 ,"FT922-4626 _AN-CFDA4AEBFT 920604   FT  04 JUN 92 / Brazil transforms itself from villain into hero      By CHRISTINA LAMB      RIO DE JANEIRO   THE surprising star of Earth Summit proceedings so far is Brazil, which has transformed itself from the villain of the environmental world to playing one of most constructive roles in negotiations to forge a North-South consensus. Mr Celso Lafer, Brazil's foreign minister, says 'we consider that as host country our efforts should be to transcend specific positions and try to work out ways countries can find common ground on issues. We're capable of doing this because our own experience makes us aware of conflicts between North and south as we have both problems of poverty and industrialisation within Brazil.' Not only has the conference organisation been impressive for a country in economic crisis, but Brazilian diplomacy was instrumental in achieving agreement on a convention on climate change and its negotiators are currently working hard to obtain a consensus on the biodiversity treaty. It is hard to recognise the country that only three years ago remained defiant and defensive in the face of worldwide censure for its blatant encouragement (and financial incentives) for the burning down of its forests in the name of development. Part of Brazil's new role as defender of the environment emanates from its desire as host country to be seen as successful and its hope of being rewarded with the seat of one of the new commissions which may be created as a result of the summit. As the fifth largest country in the world it is also eager to make its presence more felt on the world stage. This has involved Brazil making compromises over the conference treaties which officials admit would not otherwise have been considered. Its past sensitivity on environmental issues, particularly as the home of the world's largest rainforest and biggest trove of biodiversity, could have easily led it instead to play a position as hardline as that taken by Malaysia, which trumpets its unfettered right to dipose of its resources as it sees fit. Despite Brazil's considerable poverty (40m people live below the poverty line) President Fernando Collor has made environment a priority issue since taking office two years ago and fully endorses the concept of sustainable development. In his opening speech yesterday he said: 'I belong to the generation that launched the first cry of warning against a mode of growth that was leading blindly to the extinction of life on Earth.' It is not just rhetoric. Partly by abolishing subsidies Brazil has reduced annual deforestation by half since 1989, causing a 1 per cent reduction in global emissions. Mr Jose Goldemberg, the environment minister, boasts: 'This is the only effective action taken anywhere in world to cut down emissions'. Mr Collor is talking of environmental and economic zoning of the Amazon to protect threatened species, and has demarcated large areas as Indian reservations, including one the size of Portugal for the 9,000 remaining Yanomamis. It is still easy to criticise Brazil for widescale logging and informal goldmining occurring in the Amazon, but its efforts to make the summit a success should certainly help it restore some green credentials.

Even under sanctions and with high levels of violence and political uncertainty, it is the continent's second largest tourist industry, accounting for almost 20 per cent of regional tourist income, more than double Kenya's 9.6 per cent. In 1991, Morocco headed the African league with 24 per cent of tourist revenue. Globally, South Africa is a tiny player accounting for less than 0.25 per cent of the international tourist business. Excluding African visitors, there were some 560,000 tourist arrivals last year, the bulk of whom (70 per cent) came from Europe, with the UK as the main market (26 per cent) followed by Germany (16 per cent) and the US (9 per cent). With a growth rate of 18,5 per cent in 1992, the Asian market - especially Taiwan (4 per cent) and Japan (1.5 per cent) - is becoming increasingly important. Growth accelerated in the first seven months of 1993 with the number of arrivals increasing 12.7 per cent. Overseas tourists spend an estimated R4,800 (Dollars 1,750) per visit (excluding air fares to and from the country) and the industry earned R2.75bn (Dollars 1bn) in foreign exchange in 1991, making it the fourth largest foreign currency earner, after manufactures, gold and other minerals. Aside from the lifting of sanctions, the main factor making for tourism growth at a time of global recession has been the liberalisation of the aviation policies and the expansion of air traffic capacity. In the past three years, 18 new airlines have started services to South Africa. A more market-driven aviation policy has resulted in more competitive market prices and the opening up of the charter market. The number of tour operators has more than doubled, while government has become more active in tourism promotion allowing accelerated tax write-offs for the accommodation industry, a R600m (Dollars 180m) loan programme for Eco-tourism projects and support schemes for small entrepreneurs. On the debit side, tourist perceptions of personal safety in South Africa have deteriorated markedly. In January 1990, some 70 per cent of overseas visitors rated the safety factor in South Africa good but by January this year, this rating had fallen below 30 per cent. The government's target is to more than treble the number of arrivals by 2000 reaching 1.75m visitors earning some R24bn in foreign exchange. With hotels operating at below 50 per cent of bed-night capacity, there is considerable scope for expansion without significant new investment in hotels. Nevertheless, three leading global players - Hilton, Hyatt and Sheraton - have expressed interest in opening up in South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

U.S. Interest in South Africa -- On the same page Peter  Fabricius writes ""In Washington"" on the amount of U.S. media  attention to South Africa. Fabricius says that according to THE  WASHINGTON POST, ""by many of the traditional definitions of  national interest, the U.S. might appear to have little stake in  the SA elections. There are no oil fields to protect, no U.S.  troops or bases in the region, no Soviet surrogates to contain  and no colonial guilt to assuage."" Fabricius therefore believes  part of the explanation for the U.S. interest in South Africa  ""seems to be enlightened self-interest. The Clinton  Administration has identified South Africa as one of the world's  10 best emerging markets and is trying hard to buy in while the  prices are low, so to speak.""

The IEC ""was operating in a  situation without precedent, necessitating guesswork and  assumption about how many people would vote, and where.""  Inkatha's last-minute decision to participate in the election  also ""put a huge additional burden on an already pressed  organisation."" Therefore, ""if an extra public holiday,  additional polling hours, a few million more ballot papers and  some careful negotiation about controversial ballot papers can  overcome the problem, the nation will have come off lightly.  The new South Africa was never going to be easy, but it is  here.""    SOWETAN    IEC Electoral Arrangements `Fine Job' -- ""It would have been  a miracle for yesterday's elections to have gone off without  technical hitches,"" states a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 28 April. The paper notes that the IEC  was blamed for ""shoddy arrangements in various areas."" ""In the  first place, such shortcomings are common to all elections. In  the second place, this country undertook this gigantic exercise  for the first time. Finally, the politicians should take much of  the blame for hindering the process towards election day and  making the work of the IEC difficult by the constant changing of  deadlines.

0,FT944-17899 ,"FT944-17899 _AN-EJFD1ABTFT 941006   FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: IFC investment firstfor South Africans      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor      MADRID   The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, yesterday announced its first equity investments in South Africa as part of a strategy to encourage new businesses among the country's poor black population. Mr Jemal-ud-din Kassum, IFC vice-president for operations, said that the investments - which will be made in a franchise financing fund and a life assurance company - would 'help bridge the gap between the first and third world parts of the economy'. The IFC, which promotes private sector activity, will invest R12.5m (Pounds 2.4m) in the South Africa Franchise Capital Fund. This will be a R50m vehicle to provide loans and equity to members of 'previously disadvantaged groups' so they can acquire franchises in businesses such as fast food, dry cleaning and photocopying chains. The IFC will also invest R41.6m in a 10 per cent stake in African Life Assurance (Aflife), a life assurance company that does most of its business with poor blacks. The franchise fund will help black businesses overcome shortages of capital and give them access to accounting and marketing expertise as well as the research and development facilities of larger organisations, Mr Tei Mante, director of IFC's sub-Saharan Africa department, said. The life assurance company, which is being restructured to be predominantly owned by black interests, will provide a home for savings from people in the townships and provinces. The two investments 'are all part of building a climate that provides a stable base for economic growth', Mr Mante said. The Aflife restructuring, which will entail the building up of a new sales force to cover black residential areas, was an 'example of the changes in ownership and control that are necessary for increased participation by previously disadvantaged groups in the formal economy.' IFC's partner in structuring and arranging the leasing fund was Nedcor Bank of South Africa. Nedcor will take a 25 per cent stake in the fund. The rest of the shares will be placed with a small group of international and South African institutional investors. In remarks to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Mr Christo Liebenberg, the South African finance minister, said the Bank's multilateral investment guarantee agency would soon give its first guarantee for an inward investment into South Africa. It is understood that this concerns an investment in the manufacturing sector.   Companies:-  South Africa Franchise Capital Fund.     African Life Assurance.     Nedcor Bank.

Beck, Karl S. Beck, longtime resident of Southern Africa, is a  senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.      WASHINGTON      In the nasty climate that is South African politics, Pieter W. Botha's sudden  resignation has quelled the thunderstorm over which National Party oligarch  will run the government. Unfortunately there is no sign things will get  substantially better soon. Frederik W.de Klerk, Botha's interim successor --  who appears certain to be elected president after whites choose their new  Parliament in September -- inherits a country that has been in a debilitating  crisis for more than a decade. De Klerk enters office with countless problems  and three assets: relief, expectations and opportunity.    Everyone is happy to see Botha go. His irrationality and tantrums are  legendary. Botha screamed at Cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors and  visiting U.S. congressmen. He once told his own vice president to ""shut up"" at  a meeting where Botha personally fired the director-general of the South  African Broadcasting Corp. for straying from his prescribed line for TV news.  He told Cape Town's Catholic cardinal to ""listen or get out"" when the cardinal  asked Botha to stop human-rights violations by the police and army. Given  Botha's close connections to South Africa's dreaded intelligence and security  forces -- forged during 14 years as defense minister -- his ire was terrifying.  Few had the guts to tell Botha the truth, and he clung to a dream world where  he relied on thugs, rogues and political alchemists to respond to the demand  for black rights, the most pressing issue confronting the South African  government.    Botha never accepted the fact that the majority of black South Africans support  the African National Congress, he never comprehended the effects of burning  barricades in Soweto on the decisions of bank presidents in Zurich and New  York. Botha also reserved a special contempt for foreigners who sought to be  involved in South African affairs. Two exceptions were British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but Reagan fell from grace after the U.S.  President imposed mild sanctions on South Africa in 1985, to ward off harsher  measures then gaining support in Congress. Botha still believes Reagan betrayed  him.    In August, 1985, as international financiers and Western governments waited for  Botha to deliver a speech drafted by the South African Foreign Affairs Ministry  to restore confidence in South Africa's stability, Botha threw away the text  and declared he would keep South Africa on a course of repression and  segregation. The next year, Botha promulgated state-of-emergency laws that the  police and army used brutally in an attempt to kill off support for the ANC and  its internal allies in the United Democratic Front. They failed, and the  effects of the state of emergency, still in force, were to strengthen the  resolve of anti-apartheid dissidents, to increase black support for the ANC and  to prolong the political stalemate while the government refused to talk to  legitimate black leaders.    Meanwhile large sums of money continue to flow out of South Africa, and no one  will lend South Africans capital needed to modernize industries and put  employment opportunities in sync with population growth. Black unemployment is  already dangerously high -- more than 60% in some areas. Blacks are  increasingly being politicized and activated against the government because of  their desperate economic conditions. Ironically whites, whom Botha claimed to  protect, are also pinched by the deteriorating economy, while feeling ever more  threatened by the country's permanent political crisis. Botha saw his role as  that of a parochial, white Afrikaaner politician. He leaves South Africa in a  terrible mess.    Many people expect, or hope, De Klerk will find a way out of the mess.  Principal among them is Thatcher, who met with De Klerk in London last month  and told him it is getting tougher everyday for her to defend South Africa from  those in the European Community and Commonwealth who want to punish Pretoria  for its treatment of blacks. De Klerk, for his part, probably responded by  assuring Thatcher of his plans eventually to release ANC leader Nelson Mandela  and to enter into negotiations with blacks.    What is less likely is that De Klerk could have told Thatcher he is prepared to  allow blacks equal political rights with whites. De Klerk is a segregationist  who wants to maintain white privilege despite spiraling political and economic  costs. He is solidly within the National Party right wing that hopes to attract  blacks away from the ANC by imposing black quislings on the black masses as  ""leaders"" and sponsoring public works projects in areas where blacks live. This  will never succeed. Similarly, De Klerk opposes admitting blacks into a  national Parliament on a one person-one vote basis. When he told Thatcher  recently that he will seek a system of government in a South Africa where no  racial group will be able to dominate any other, Thatcher reportedly  interjected impatiently: ""What are you, afraid the blacks will do to you what  you did to them?""    Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes  repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years  ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was  fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government  to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that  the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in  close touch despite their differing politics.    De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president  above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious  circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC  has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals  outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even  more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each  other about how they would relate during negotiations.    Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such  negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at  a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South  Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the  state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the  National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it  was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling  Namibian independence to South African whites.    Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to  arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the  steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party  hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A  group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk  when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening  patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the  crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: ""Gentlemen, I am prepared to  accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as  it keeps the National Party in power."" If this is indeed De Klerk's goal, God  help South Africa.

Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes  repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years  ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was  fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government  to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that  the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in  close touch despite their differing politics.    De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president  above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious  circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC  has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals  outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even  more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each  other about how they would relate during negotiations.    Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such  negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at  a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South  Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the  state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the  National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it  was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling  Namibian independence to South African whites.    Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to  arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the  steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party  hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A  group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk  when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening  patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the  crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: ""Gentlemen, I am prepared to  accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as  it keeps the National Party in power."" If this is indeed De Klerk's goal, God  help South Africa.      Opinion    "

Castro and the high-level delegation accompanying him  arrived  in Cuba at 2119 GMT and were welcomed by Army General Raul  Castro, vice president of the Council of State and Council of  Ministers and Armed Forces chief, and other ranking leaders.    Fidel Castro's arrival in South Africa on 9 May to attend  Mandela's presidential inauguration ceremony was a milestone in  the traditional ties of friendship and solidarity between Havana  and Africa.    The Cuban president and his entourage held several bilateral  meetings in Pretoria with over 20 statesmen and well-known  figures from Africa and the Middle East. Castro also granted  interviews to various news media from South Africa and other  countries.    Significant and historic were among the descriptives used by  sources close to Fidel Castro in reference to his conversation  with the African National Congress (ANC) leader and new  President Nelson Mandela, to whom Castro expressed Cuba's  resolve to initiate and develop multilateral cooperation.    Another important event was the establishment of diplomatic  relations between both states on 11 May, based on a protocol  signed by Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto  Robaina and Alfred Nzo, respectively. This, reports indicated,  was the first foreign policy decision of the new ANC government.    Fidel Castro thus concluded a tour that began in Barbados,  where he attended the First World Conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May.    At that regional forum, he urged developed nations to stop  polluting the environment and called for the equitable  distribution of wealth in the world to bridge the growing gap  between poor and wealthy states.    After the meeting in the Barbadian capital, where he also  met  with dignitaries and well-known conference attendees, the Cuban  president visited Ghana in western Africa during a technical  stopover en route to South Africa.    His stay in Accra, although brief, was considered official  by  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who welcomed Castro at  Katoka Airport for a friendly meeting.    The Cuban delegation, comprised also of National Assembly  President Ricardo Alarcon and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of  science, technology, and environment, traveled from Pretoria to  Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which, in July 1993, hosted the Third  Ibero-American Summit.    On that stopover en route to Havana, the head of the Cuban  Revolution also conducted various official activities with the  authorities in Salvador de Bahia, capital of Bahia State, who,  last night, gave a reception in his honor at Ondina Palace,  headquarters of the state government.

Even though  the visit to Burkina Faso by Velayati and the high-ranking  political delegation accompanying him is the second phase of our  foreign minister's tour that began on Tuesday, the delegation  actually stopped in two countries before arriving in Burkina  Faso. In addition to meeting and talking with officials of  Guinea, the delegation stopped briefly at the airport in the  Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on its way to Burkina Faso and talked  with the Chadian foreign minister.    During the meeting between the Iranian and Chadian foreign  ministers, Chad requested that the Islamic Republic of Iran  assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation  among countries of the South. This request is vitally important  to Chad, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield  in southern Chad.    In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on  economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Tehran and  Conakry, including discussions on cooperation in the  exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of  hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways.    In Burkina Faso our foreign minister and his delegation met  with the prime minister and discussed political and economic  relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the  initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic  and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a  joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic  cooperation between Tehran and Ouagadougou. To acquaint the  government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high  economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition  including products and industries of Islamic Iran be set up in  Ouagadougou.    Iran's diplomatic activities in Africa are of interest to  political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first  is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of  Iran strengthens the position of Muslims in Africa, especially  in Black Africa. The second is that this activity is  significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis  the array of forces by the North against the South. The third  is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and  political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with  experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial  experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an  important objective in our country's diplomatic policy.    At any rate, Tehran's new look toward Africa has attracted  the attention of many political experts.     "
0,FT943-13712 ,"FT943-13712 _AN-EGRD8AFRFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (34): Credit rating sought - Foreign borrowing      By MARK SUZMAN   One of the more dramatic signals of the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations has been the country's decision to seek an international credit rating. After an intense competition among international merchant banks for the right to represent the country, the new government in May appointed Goldman Sachs as its agent to secure a grading from the leading agencies, who are expected to announce their assessment later this year. Although South Africa has long borrowed money on European markets without a rating, it wants access to the American market, hence the the new move. Following the successful agreement with international banks on a repayment schedule for outstanding debt that had been caught in the 1985 standstill, and given its new-found political stability, the country feels the time is ripe to make formal entry into global capital markets. Depending on the success of the present initiative, a similar move into the Japanese market may follow early next year. Although political and economic uncertainty has long forced South Africa to pay a fairly hefty premium on offshore borrowing, government authorities are confident of achieving an investment grade rating of at least BBB. 'I would actually prefer a lower rating that we can improve upon, rather than a higher one which might be downgraded,' notes Mr Chris Stals, South African Reserve Bank governor. Even with the rating, however, initial borrowing is likely to be limited. The new budget makes allowance for about Dollars 500m, but Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, says that figure may well be increased, depending both on the final rating achieved and the comparative strength of international markets at the time of borrowing. The outcome of the government's initiative will also have a bearing on South African companies seeking to raise money offshore. Assurer Liberty Life recently announced plans for a Dollars 360m-Dollars 500m rights issue, and electricity utility Eskom and the Development Bank of South Africa are both likely to float issues some time later this year.

The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF  [Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of  Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa.  British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics,  shipbuilding and technical training.    British security interests are expected to increase  significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are  already working in several countries in the region and Mr  Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa  might return to the Commonwealth.    South African and British officials regard the appointment  of  Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating  that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which  could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa.    South African officials suggest the renewal of military  links  with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with  Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology  weapons industries.    South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain  its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has  allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious  contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1  billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters.    It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this  week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.     "

Nyatsumba concludes his  commentary: ""For Mandela's own sake, for the ANC's and indeed  the whole country's we must hope our leaders will be able to  combine reconcilatory moves with concrete steps, to send a  message that the lot of blacks will not stay the same, and that  some sacrifices by those who have been beneficiaries of  apartheid in the past will have to be made.""    WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN    KwaZulu Land Deal -- A brief editorial in the Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN in English on page 28 of its 27 May  to 2  June issue keeps alive the recent KwaZulu land transfer. The  editorial says that while President Mandela, ""master unifier  that he is,"" might have been expected ""to play down the  seriousness"" of the ""secret land deal,"" no one else has ""to fall  in step."" The paper sees the incident as ""an early test of the  way in which this country will work under the government of  national unity. The government, without effective parliamentary  opposition, will try and brush aside embarrassing conflicts  and...encourage the media to go along with this."" ""We won't,""  promises the paper.    NEW NATION    100-Day Reform Program Viewed -- ""The minutes have started  ticking by since President Nelson Mandela announced his 100-day  reform programme in Parliament this week,"" begins the  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 27 May in a page 14  editorial. We ""welcome the President's approach in making the  RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] a `people-driven'  process."" ""This approach played a critical role in giving a  voice to voters' needs and also shaped the programme of action  which was pursued by their leaders. It would be tragic if we  were to fail like the United States of America did during the  presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when the privileged white  community proved unwilling to share their material success with  people of other races."" The South African plan should succeed,  however, because it ""is aimed at unlocking the energies of the  multitudes who were denied the opportunities given their white  counterparts through the country's draconian apartheid laws.""    BEELD    Mandela's Parliamentary Address Viewed -- ""A people-centered  community -- this was the theme and refrain yesterday of  President Nelson Mandela's opening address in Parliament,""  begins a page 12 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg  BEELD on 25 May. ""Freedom and human dignity formed the basis of  the vision offered by Mr. Mandela, and the fact that he  mentioned the word vision confirms that he is aware of his task  -- that is, leading through inspiration. If the New South  Africa accepts these ideals then a good future awaits the people  of this country, and a people-centered community will be  established. Each government must have a philosophy, but that  alone will not create jobs or feed mouths. The real test will  be in the program of action -- the practicality of the policies,  the management, and the good leadership by government in  realizing the above."" ""Our impression is that President  Mandela's approach reflects a reasonable and sound policy.""    Country's Admission to OAU `Positive'-- A second editorial  on  the same page notes that ""South Africa's formal admission to the  Organization of African Unity is the fulfillment of a dream.  This will have a positive influence on the country itself, on  southern Africa, as well as in the rest of Africa."" ""For as  long as whites withheld equal rights from their fellow citizens  this dream would have been impossible to realize. Africa was  often placed in a serious dilemma because of South Africa. The  advantages of technical and economic contact often overcame  ideological aversion to the 'apartheid regime'. In addition to  this Africa was often guilty of worse atrocities than those it  accused the 'regime' of. Now that South Africa is allowed to  fulfill its rightful role, South Africans should not expect too  much, because Africa and the OAU carries very little weight  globally. In befriending the rest of Africa, South Africa  should not neglect its most valuable friend, the West.""     "

By Reviewed by Carolyn Slaughter, Slaughter's most recent novel is Dreams of  the Kalahari (Fireside Books / Simon & Schuster).      A reader should always expect something fresh and original from a new novel,  and, when we're promised a trip to Africa, expectations rise. Of course, Africa  has been too much explored in past years for most people not to be familiar  with the terrain: an abundance of beauty and space existing in uneasy  juxtaposition to poverty, hunger and brutality. We have seen how the old  colonial ways have been rediscovered by new tribes of expatriates bringing  their cinematic dreams of Africa with them, only to succumb to the white man's  tedious distractions of adultery and alcohol. Inevitably, they depart the  continent with a standard repertoire of horror stories: corrupt bureaucrats,  gratuitous military violence, the carnage of elephants for ivory. Even those  who travel no further than the local mall will have come across at least some  of these tales.    So, picking up Harriet Heyman's first novel, ""Between the Rains,"" one hopes for  a fresh intelligence that will throw a good strong light on a unique continent.  Sadly, we are disappointed. There are no new insights in ""Between the Rains,""  and I think the author knows it. In a letter home to her boyfriend, the heroine  perfectly expresses Heyman's own inadequacy: ""She could describe the speed of  the cats but not the thrill of tracking them. She could describe the killing,  but not how it felt that she and Max were the only human witnesses to it.""    The book opens with a young woman, Mirie Keane, leaving Manhattan. She takes  off for East Africa clutching a bag of photographer's equipment and some  romantic notions about photographing an elephant giving birth -- an act never  captured before on film. With a commission to take shots of a safari ranch, she  meets the usual round- up of old Africa hands and expatriates and has a few  exciting moments in the bush with wild animals. One of her photographs -- a  gory shot of a fatal buffalo attack -- brings her notoriety and enables her to  stay on in Africa. She shakes off the dust of her past and engages in an  unconvincing romance with a character who has not previously given her the time  of day.    The book limps along as Mirie, photographs safe in her bag, sets off for the  capital, only to run into military barricades. Soldiers ransack her belongings  and toss her film onto rose bushes strewn with the corpses of looters killed by  the army. Finally, reaching the airport, crowded with people making a hasty  exodus, the plane rumbles down the runway and we catch a last look at our  adventurer, who is giggling nervously in her seat.    Journeys should be as spiritual as they are physical. In leaving behind the  habits and attitudes of our everyday lives, we can be freed by the different  rhythms of another culture and experience something unexpected and exotic --  both in the land and within ourselves. Herein lies one of the main problems of  ""Between the Rains."" The writer too quickly connects with the disdain and  cynicism that is so much a part of the white experience in Africa. She sees  Africa as the expatriates do, and this accounts for the jaded and superficial  quality of the book. It is written without the benefit of imagination and  remains untroubled by intelligence. One tags along for the ride, but is not the  better for it.    The wonder of an elephant birth -- and this is the entire purpose of this  African sojourn -- is described with astonishing banality. The birthing pains  of a new nation, though given scant attention, are handled with the same  careless indifference.    ""Between the Rains"" seems to go to some lengths never to outreach itself, and,  because of this, Heyman has managed to bring back only a very small trophy from  her African adventure.

Even those  who travel no further than the local mall will have come across at least some  of these tales.    So, picking up Harriet Heyman's first novel, ""Between the Rains,"" one hopes for  a fresh intelligence that will throw a good strong light on a unique continent.  Sadly, we are disappointed. There are no new insights in ""Between the Rains,""  and I think the author knows it. In a letter home to her boyfriend, the heroine  perfectly expresses Heyman's own inadequacy: ""She could describe the speed of  the cats but not the thrill of tracking them. She could describe the killing,  but not how it felt that she and Max were the only human witnesses to it.""    The book opens with a young woman, Mirie Keane, leaving Manhattan. She takes  off for East Africa clutching a bag of photographer's equipment and some  romantic notions about photographing an elephant giving birth -- an act never  captured before on film. With a commission to take shots of a safari ranch, she  meets the usual round- up of old Africa hands and expatriates and has a few  exciting moments in the bush with wild animals. One of her photographs -- a  gory shot of a fatal buffalo attack -- brings her notoriety and enables her to  stay on in Africa. She shakes off the dust of her past and engages in an  unconvincing romance with a character who has not previously given her the time  of day.    The book limps along as Mirie, photographs safe in her bag, sets off for the  capital, only to run into military barricades. Soldiers ransack her belongings  and toss her film onto rose bushes strewn with the corpses of looters killed by  the army. Finally, reaching the airport, crowded with people making a hasty  exodus, the plane rumbles down the runway and we catch a last look at our  adventurer, who is giggling nervously in her seat.    Journeys should be as spiritual as they are physical. In leaving behind the  habits and attitudes of our everyday lives, we can be freed by the different  rhythms of another culture and experience something unexpected and exotic --  both in the land and within ourselves. Herein lies one of the main problems of  ""Between the Rains."" The writer too quickly connects with the disdain and  cynicism that is so much a part of the white experience in Africa. She sees  Africa as the expatriates do, and this accounts for the jaded and superficial  quality of the book. It is written without the benefit of imagination and  remains untroubled by intelligence. One tags along for the ride, but is not the  better for it.    The wonder of an elephant birth -- and this is the entire purpose of this  African sojourn -- is described with astonishing banality. The birthing pains  of a new nation, though given scant attention, are handled with the same  careless indifference.    ""Between the Rains"" seems to go to some lengths never to outreach itself, and,  because of this, Heyman has managed to bring back only a very small trophy from  her African adventure.

0,FT934-7752 ,"FT934-7752 _AN-DKRC7AGCFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (1): A new nation starts to take shape - Nearly four years after Nelson Mandela's release, South Africa begins a fresh era      By PATTI WALDMEIR   YESTERDAY South Africa broke the twisted mould of apartheid, and cast away the bits. After decades spent fighting the tide of history, which submerged other racist regimes long ago, South Africa yesterday opted to join the modern world. It can now play a full role at the United Nations, rejoin the Commonwealth, become a member of the Organisation of African Unity, and play a much-needed, constructive role in the development of southern Africa and beyond. Yesterday's agreement on a post-apartheid constitution is the first irrevocable step on the path to full democracy; but it is only a first step. The next few months and years will show whether South Africa's tenure as a democratic nation will be nasty, brutish and short, or stable, happy and prosperous; whether it will substitute black domination for white repression; whether it will defy the logic of divided societies worldwide, and nurture true multi-ethnic democracy. Though the mould of apartheid has been broken, Africa provides other unfortunate models for the new state: tyrannical regimes which abused power, crushed dissent and lay waste whole economies through maladministration, corruption and theft. South African politicians, black and white, bridle at the comparison: Finance Minister Derek Keys offers the consensus view when he insists that South Africa 'will be totally different from the rest of Africa. It always has been and it always will be'. Economically, that is obviously so. Mr Keys points to South Africa's clear superiority in terms of 'indigenous capital', both human and financial. The new leaders will manage the continent's most powerful economy, with gross domestic product equal to 75 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's gdp, with an economic hinterland which stretches as far north as Zaire, generating half of Africa's electricity. Even in broader international terms, it compares well: with a well developed stock market, banking sector, and body of company law, South Africa offers more to the investor than, for example, eastern Europe; and with foreign debt at USDollars 17.3bn, or 15 per cent of gdp, it is underborrowed by any standard. In political terms, too, South Africa is different. In 1957, when Ghana became the first African nation to gain independence from Britain, Kwame Nkrumah inherited a position of largely unfettered power. But South Africa's first black president - likely to be the African National Congress leader, Nelson Mandela - will find his room for manoeuvre far more circumscribed, in law, and more importantly, in fact. 'South Africa is too big for the ANC,' says one ANC member who bemoans the complexity of a society which imposes manifold constraints on the party of government: he believes they will inhibit the ANC's ability to transform South Africa virtuously; others welcome these constraints as curbs to abuse of power. But all would agree that South Africa does not fit the classic African mould of a society which easily falls prey to bad government. Strong interest groups counterbalance the power of government: chief among them is a strong, diversified and battle-hardened corporate sector; the 1.2m-strong labour federation Cosatu, historically allied to the ANC, has recently begun flexing its independent muscle, and is well organised and powerful enough to play the role of democracy's watchdog. The highly politicised and motivated township 'civics', or community associations, could also prove an important check on government power: for South Africa's 'masses' are not the fawning crowd which greeted Kwame Nkrumah, African liberator; they are demanding, well organised, and used to fighting their political corner. The list of powerful interest groups outside the ANC's sphere goes on and on: the 1.2m strong civil service is dominated by Afrikaners, who are scarcely natural allies of the ANC. The defence force, though professional and committed to supporting the government of the day, is also Afrikaans-dominated, as is the police. Last, and arguably least of the factors constraining an ANC government, is the constitution agreed yesterday by the main political parties. That constitution was meant to prevent majority domination through power sharing: it was supposed to guarantee democracy by ensuring that the minority losers in any majority-rule election would still enjoy a powerful say in government. It falls some way short of so doing: minorities will be represented in government, with every party earning 5 per cent of the national vote entitled to a seat in cabinet; but the power of minority parties in cabinet is precarious. The ANC, which will have both a president and a deputy president, will have its own way on any disputed decision. And though it has promised regular consultation with the second deputy president, drawn from the second largest party (probably Mr FW de Klerk, current president), he will have no statutory powers to frustrate Mr Mandela's will. The constitution fails to deliver other checks and balances which the ruling National Party had insisted were essential. The party's 1991 constitutional proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not interfere'. In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional governments: the constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms so vague (to impose uniform national norms and standards, to ensure proper regulation, and where there are implications for national security or economic policy) as seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred from imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'. National Party negotiators believe that they will not need entrenched constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC: they believe the ANC's assurances that it does not wish to govern alone (and does not believe it could do so effectively); and they judge their electoral strength will give them an important say in cabinet, though only if they are able to better their poll showing of 11 to 13 per cent. But clearly, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on crucial issues; probably, it had no choice. As a minority government whose power diminishes by the day, negotiators calculated that a deal done now would be preferable to that available next month or next year. And whatever the shortcomings of the constitution, agreement is better than continuing deadlock. Though it is not strong enough, it is far from illiberal, and should help to reinforce democratic forces. But if South Africa does escape some of the more grotesque abuses of power for which Africa is famous, it is scarcely likely to become a prosperous liberal democracy overnight. The new bill of rights enshrines tough emergency powers which can be used to restore stability after the April 27 elections. Agreement seems to exist between the ANC and NP that restoring stability, through temporary repression, is the highest post-election priority. According to this scenario, democracy will be a temporary casualty while the new government pursues stability and economic development; and if it succeeds in restoring law and order without repeating the oppression of the past, it will be widely popular with an electorate (white and black) fed up with crime and violence. Much will depend on whether the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be persuaded to participate in next year's elections: though he has made clear that he rejects yesterday's constitution, he could decide he has more to gain by fighting rather than boycotting an election. If he actively opposes the poll, the security situation could become untenable, especially if the white right wing, now in tactical alliance with Inkatha, also opposes the election. The ANC and NP must guarantee that there is critical mass at the political centre, and that the crackdown need only suppress the lunatic fringe. If Inkatha and the right wing, with their numbers and their firepower, are to be suppressed in unison, stability may be unattainable. But in the end, it is economics - and not politics - which will seal South Africa's fate. For yesterday's constitution marks a decisive shift in electoral power from the 'haves' to the 'have-nots' of South African society.' Popular expectations will soon strain the intentions of even the most benevolent government; at that point, it must either give in to populism, or suppress it. The latter now seems most likely: the new South Africa will start with a hefty dollop of the old. That will be unfortunate, but bearable; what will destroy South Africa's democratic prospects forever is failure to deliver a better economic deal to the masses. It is a tall order.

0,FT931-15924 ,"FT931-15924 _AN-DAJAPAD7FT 930109   FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Playing away from home - Practical Traveller: Nicholas Woodsworth says commonsense precautions can minimise health risks - from viruses to dodgy food and water - and offers suggestions for coping with the uncertainties and frustrations of travel in Africa      By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH   WHERE IN the world is it safe to travel? The answer, in the age of modern medicine, should be 'everywhere.' But it isn't. While medical science advances every day, so does global poverty and the bacteria, parasites, viruses, infections and diseases it breeds and spreads. Health risks to the traveller are in many cases greater than ever; short of staying at home and locking the door, there is no way of avoiding exposure to them. A few examples illustrate the point. A generation ago, new chloroquine-based drugs were highly effective in preventing malaria in tropical travellers. These days, many strains of malaria - some of them lethal - have developed drug resistance and every year now there are 2,500 cases of malaria brought back to the UK. Cholera, a disease for which vaccination is no longer obligatory, has made a comeback in South America and Africa. Aids continues unchecked: as many as 10m are now thought to have the virus worldwide. Not even the Mediterranean, Britain's favourite holiday area, is safe these days  - a diluted sewer, it now receives 2bn tonnes of sewage annually. Nor are Britain's coasts clean - up to half the country's beaches fall below EC hygiene standards. Travel may sound like a dangerous pastime, but it need not be. There are more than 25m trips made from Britain every year, and an upset stomach is the worst most of these travellers will experience. If risks cannot be avoided, a few commonsense precautions can minimise them to the point where they are worth taking. Some of the most important: FOOD HYGIENE. It is known by 1,000 euphemisms, but by any name diarrhoea is by far the traveller's most common complaint. In areas where the local water supply is suspect (most of the developing world), drink bottled water, avoid ice and salads, and eat only fruits and vegetables which you can peel yourself. Avoid milk products, food that has not been freshly prepared, and stay away from shellfish - only 4 per cent of Mediterranean shellfish-growing areas produce seafood fit to be eaten. The cost of a meal is no guarantee of its safety: five stars in the lobby says nothing about what goes on behind kitchen doors. Water purification equipment, medical kits and advice on self-treatment of intestinal infection, all vital in some areas, can be obtained from Medical Advisory Services for Travellers Abroad, the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tel (London): 071-631-4408. MALARIA. Today malaria is the second most common health complaint among travellers. With drug resistance now making many treatments wholly or only partly effective, informed advice on anti-malarial medication is vital. The Malarial Reference Laboratory (tel: 071-636-7921) provides free advice for individual countries. Specialists increasingly emphasise the importance of not being bitten by mosquitoes in the first place. In malarial areas use repellant liberally and wear long sleeves and trousers, especially in the early morning and evening. Use mosquito nets. Those impregnated with Permethrin are particularly effective. Malarial symptoms - fever, sweating, chills or headache - can develop up to one year after initial infection. Frequently, and sometimes tragically, symptoms are incorrectly diagnosed simply because the sufferer has failed to tell his doctor of a trip abroad. AIDS. It seems silly to note such an obvious and avoidable risk, but statistics continue to make a nonsense of human rationality: despite the fact that 70 per cent of Bangkok prostitutes are believed to be HIV positive, at least one-third of foreign male visitors to Thailand purchase their services. SUNSHINE. We all love to return home well tanned, and shrug off sun-burn as an integral part of holidaying. Take note, however, of the Australians, formerly the most passionate sun-worshippers: today very few are found on beaches without heavy protection from sunlight. Skin cancer has been clearly linked not just to long-term exposure to the sun, but also to short, intensive episodes of sunburn. There are literally thousands of other illnesses one could contract through foreign travel. Although most travellers' chances of contracting serious diseases are small, food and water, animals, insects and other people are all channels for infection. The best prevention is knowledge - knowing the risks and how to avoid them - and this is best obtained before going abroad. The most useful single volume of information is Traveller's Health (edited by Richard Dawood, Oxford University Press, Pounds 7.99). GPs are rarely well informed of health conditions overseas. Precise and up-to-date data on specific destinations, however, can be obtained from one of more than 30 British Airway travel clinics in the UK. Tel: 071-831-5333 for details. Like the BA clinics, Thomas Cook, 45 Berkeley Street, London (tel: 071-499-400) also gives vaccinations and information on travel destinations. While the British government still feels fit enough to fund it, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 4 St Pancras Way, London (tel: 071-387-4411) remains one of the best travellers' treatment centres in the world.

0,FT941-8776 ,"FT941-8776 _AN-EBRCXABDFT 940218   FT  18 FEB 94 / 'Clinton Lite' health plan gets a tasting: Slim-line alternative proposal draws criticism as well as praise      By GEORGE GRAHAM   President Bill Clinton's ambitious healthcare reform plan has suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks. While the Congressional Budget Office shed doubt on the medium-term financial consequences of the proposal, the Business Roundtable, an alliance of heavyweight corporate interests, disavowed the president's plan and threw its influence behind a rival approach promoted by Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee. Mr Cooper, a Democrat who is running in this year's race for the Senate seat once held by Vice-President Al Gore, has pitched his proposals firmly in the middle of the political spectrum. He likes to call his plan 'Clinton Lite', a slimline version of the president's package, stripped of some of the government involvement that Mr Clinton's Republican foes find so objectionable. The Cooper plan is, in fact, the only healthcare reform proposal before Congress to have picked up endorsements from both Republican and Democratic members. But the limelight has brought with it a new degree of scrutiny, and the details of Mr Cooper's proposals are coming in for searching criticism. 'I think that a more full exposition of Mr Cooper's bill is trouble for Mr Cooper, not the administration,' said Congressman John Dingell, who, as chairman of the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, holds sway over a large portion of any health reform legislation. The Cooper plan is aimed at introducing a form of the managed competition concept which has inspired many of the competing proposals. Insurance companies and healthcare providers would be strongly encouraged, by changes in the tax code, to form Accountable Health Plans. These plans must offer a standard package of health benefits, to be defined by an independent Health Care Standards Commission. Health plans would be required to enroll anyone who applied for coverage. They would be allowed to vary their premiums only by geographic location, and to a limited degree by the age of the policyholder; not on the basis of how sick people have been. Small businesses and individuals would be able to enroll in Health Plan Purchasing Co-operatives similar to the Clinton plan's Health Alliances, but with a lower cut-off point - only businesses with fewer than 100 employees would be able to join, whereas in the Clinton scheme all businesses with fewer than 5,000 employees would be obliged to join. Much of the support for Mr Cooper's ideas, however, stems from two central points in which his plan differs from the president's. Mr Cooper would merely ask businesses to offer health insurance to their employees, not require them to pay for it. Mr Clinton, by contrast, has sought to ensure universal coverage by obliging businesses to pay 80 per cent of the cost of health coverage for all their full-time employees, a mandate that has deterred many small companies that do not provide such cover, and even many larger businesses that do. A second difference is that both proposals claim they will bring market forces to bear in the healthcare system as their principal cost control mechanism. But while the Clinton plan would impose a cap on health insurance premiums if prices rise too fast, the Cooper plan relies on a tax mechanism. Health insurance benefits would be taxable if they exceeded the cost of the lowest approved health plan in the same geographical area. This would, Mr Cooper argues, encourage consumers to shop for the cheapest plan and discourage 'Rolls-Royce' policies. At the moment, health benefits may be fully deducted for the purposes of corporate income tax by the employer, and fully excluded from personal income tax by the employee. This loses the government about Dollars 65bn a year in tax revenue. For many of his fellow Democrats, the most damaging criticism now being levelled at Mr Cooper's plan is that it can claim to offer only universal access, not the universal coverage that Mr Clinton insists on and that most polls suggest is strongly favoured by public opinion. 'When I get my LL Bean catalogue every year I've got universal access to all kinds of warm clothes, but I don't have any coverage with those warm clothes until I whip out my credit card,' says Congressman Bill Ford, another influential House committee chairman. 'The thing that's missing from Cooper's plan is a credit card.' Mr Cooper offers government subsidies covering the entire cost of the premium, estimated to range from Dollars 2,100 a year for a single person to Dollars 5,565 for a two-parent family, for those with incomes below the official poverty line - now Dollars 11,866. The subsidy would diminish on a sliding scale to zero at twice the poverty line. But as Mr Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at Washington's Brookings Institution, pointed out in a recent critique, this would create a poverty trap by withdrawing benefits from those whose incomes rise above the poverty line - the equivalent of taxing income between Dollars 11,866 and Dollars 23,732 at an effective rate of 88 per cent. 'Although the Tennessee Democrat calls his plan 'Clinton Lite' it is not merely light but utterly empty on the central goal of the Clinton plan: universal coverage,' Mr Aaron wrote in the New York Times. Nonetheless, Mr Cooper and his backers seem likely to be an important voice as congressional committees get down to hammering out a legislative compromise.

I would like to ask you one very personal  question. You studied in South Africa. You were at Fort Hare  University, and you have been avoiding coming to this country  for very a long time. With the demise of apartheid how do you  feel being back in the Cape?    [Mugabe] It's a great feeling to be back to South Africa. I  was back actually at the time of the inauguration, to attend the  inauguration of President Mandela, and that was a great feeling,  a great feeling indeed because I had last been here in 1952,  only when I came back for graduation. I stayed in South Africa,  I think for two years up to 19...[pauses] end of '51, in the  Eastern Cape. A lot of things have happened since then, when I  was at Fort Hare, and apartheid was just beginning to be  implemented, and I remember the students who belonged to the  African National Congress Youth League planning real action by  way of demonstrations, sit-ins, and passive resistance, but  after that the struggle took other dimensions, and there was  armed struggle.    It was during that period -- we were in exile together with  the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and together we  planned the strategies to defeat colonialism in whatever form,  whether it was in the form of apartheid or in form of UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence], as in southern  Rhodesia then. And we got our independence in 1980, 14 years  before South Africa got its freedom and democracy.    Of course, when we got our own freedom, we never regarded  that as complete freedom of Africa, and we had always worked on  a program, yes, for us to get our own freedom in what was  Rhodesia, but also for others -- Namibia to get its own  independence; South Africa to get its own freedom and democracy,  and that was a long, long wait, a very long wait indeed. We all  longed for a day when apartheid would go, when we could interact  with South Africa, and we could visit South Africa and the South  Africans could visit us. The day has now come, so it's a  tremendous joy.    [Mashokwe] Were you at all surprised by the turn of events  come February 1990, when President De Klerk then announced these  changes?    [Mugabe] Yes, a mixture of both surprise and disbelief.  Surprise, because we never expected that the leader of an  Afrikaner Party, the National Party, which in fact had been the  initiator of apartheid, could one day reverse it in that  dramatic way. It was indeed dramatic, too dramatic for us to  believe, but there it was.    When it was first announced, we thought it was just  palliative, the statement was just palliative in that apartheid  would not really go, but when one measure after another was  taken to undo it and completely eradicate it from the statute  book, then we started to believe.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you ever regret the stance that  you took? You were known to be very vocal against apartheid.  You didn't mince your words on this. When you look back, your  country suffered a lot of economic ills. You were destabilized  in the process. When you look back, do you have any regrets?    [Mugabe] We don't regret having taken the steps that we  took.  In fact, a country like Zimbabwe, who did not go the full length  in opposing apartheid -- we wished we could have done more, but  it was not possible because of the linkage between our economies  -- the South African economy and Zimbabwe, a linkage that was  consolidated by Ian Smith during UDI, and when Rhodesia was made  to depend on South Africa. But politically, diplomatically we  took quite a rigid stand, and we were not to have anything to do  with those who were in charge of apartheid here and in  government, therefore, because we held them responsible. We  don't regret having taken that rigid stand at all, but we regret  the loss of life that ensued, the sabotage that was carried out  in Zimbabwe, destruction of ANC property and the loss of life  that followed that destruction of property. That we regret. We  still have those wounds. We still have the scars, the damaged  buildings. They still are there, and in fact we still have  prisoners we have arrested--people we have arrested for  committing those acts of sabotage. But all that was really the  amount of sacrifice we were called upon to make in order for us  to have the day that now we have. In order for us to return to  South Africa, we had to do all that.    [Mashokwe] The prisoners -- are they going to be released at  any stage? What are the possibilities?    [Mugabe] Well, we are reviewing their cases. There are only  five in our prison, and one of whom is a South African,  (?called) (Zwayo), and the other four were South Africa's agents  from white Rhodesia -- Rhodesians who worked with South Africa,  but President De Klerk and now President Mandela have all  appealed to me for possibly their release, but their death  sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment, and therefore  they are not going to die, but we are reviewing their cases.    I consulted with the Minister of Justice the other day, and  we thought we should review their cases in the same way as we  review the cases of our own, but now that here people have been  pardoned, people who were guilty of what one might call  political crimes, and had been pardoned, except a few, we might  very well review their cases in a favorable way.    [Mashokwe] In South Africa we talk of this truth commission  where South Africans are saying: Let's know what happened in the  past. Let's pardon people, including right-wingers probably.    [Mugabe] Pardons, sure, must be granted. The past must go.  Bygones must be bygones, and this is what I said in March 1980,  when I appealed to both the black and white community to work  together. They had to forget the past. They had now to  recognize that whether yesterday they had fought as enemies or  as allies, they could no longer actually do without each other,  whichever way things go. We shall live side by side with each  other, and therefore, there had to be a recognition of that  common belonging, a common denominator that came about as a  result of our independence.    The same with South Africa. There is that common denominator  and your situation here is even much more complex than our own.  We are only 10.5 million. You are 40-plus million, and  therefore it's a big population you have, but apart from that a  population that also subdivides itself into various races,  various tribes, people living in various regions and a number of  religious affiliations, and so it's a much more complex  situation, and I admire the stance that President Mandela and of  course the ANC have taken in demonstrating that this is now a  new South Africa, which requires a new ideology, a new political  outlook that binds everyone together and makes the people of  South Africa have a common destiny, which means there is that  greater sense of belonging to South Africa, greater sense of  nationality than there ever was before. At least that's what is  being cultivated and we admire that.    [Mashokwe] We talk now of the conference that you attended,  on the threshold of the new era. Many critics say that this  threshold never really reaches the ordinary people of southern  Africa, of Africa. What is your comment on this?    [Mugabe] No, it does reach to the ordinary people of African  grassroots, and we are always talking about the grassroots.  True, when policies are first enunciated they don't  immediately....[pauses] They don't go down to the masses until  they have been explained, but this is the work that our  subordinates must be doing in the regions and at various levels,  to tell the people that we are now one, but of course it will  take time for some of our people to forget and to forgive and  forget, but the leadership, if it does continue to preach  national reconciliation and national unity, national harmony,  the message will get through. I assure you.    [Mashokwe] Unemployment in Zimbabwe is said to be about a  fifth of your people there. We have the same kind of problems.  Is there no danger, not just in Zimbabwe -- South Africa has  the same problem -- is there no danger of unemployed people  overturning political gains?    [Mugabe] No, I think the numbers are exaggerated. We have  quite a lot of youngsters, yes, who are unemployed but our  situation is quite different from yours. We are less urbanized  than South Africa, less industrialized than South Africa. In  industries -- we have in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, yes --  but over 70 percent of the people, between 70 and 80 percent,  are over [sentence as heard]. And the youngsters who are  unemployed by and large are people with roots back in the rural  areas. They come into urban areas to seek employment, but when  they can't get that employment they go back to the rural areas.  There is hardly a Zimbabwean who says Harare is his home. None.    We all have our roots where people can do agriculture, and  this is a solution that really, that we find amongst us -- that  is, if the going is not that good in town, people can always go  back to the rural areas and eat, provided of course we have not  been struck by droughts, and so there is that aspect. People can  do agriculture, and our youth, we are now trying to mobilize so  some of them, I hope a substantial number, can pursue  agriculture you see, as a way of life. But this is not to say  we don't have a sizable number of people unemployed. Yes, the  reason they are unemployed is not because there had been any  mismanagement of the economy, but rather that colonial -- the  colonial legacy that we have has been that of underdevelopment  in what was regarded as the African sector in the rural areas  and also the development of skills was delayed or denied in some  cases.    Therefore, even though the jobs are there but they are jobs  for skilled men, and these cannot be found in every case. With  jobs in industry, even in the public service, you see, we have  jobs, but they require skilled people. In some cases the white  employers go out of Zimbabwe to get skilled personnel, people  with high skills whom they want to be managers or to be highly  trained technicians operating in the -- I mean, to undertake  operations in their industries. So that is one reason, but of  course we are now engaged in trying to transform the system and  opening it up to investment, encouraging existing investment to  expand and, thereby, create more jobs. It will take us time,  but we are doing that.    [Mashokwe] What role, Mr. President, do you see for South  Africa in the Southern African Development Community?    [Mugabe] Oh, a tremendous role. South Africa will now come  with its heavy muscle and join us. Heavy muscle, because it is  a highly developed country. It has its own problems, of course,  of underdevelopment in certain sectors, but you have highly  developed industries and that gives South Africa quite a muscle  with which it can interact with us as we relate to it, both  multilaterally within the region, and also bilaterally.    We trade with South Africa. Zimbabwe is the largest trading  partner South Africa has in Africa, and 20 percent of our  imports come from this country, and so we are quite a market.  Botswana gets about 80 percent of its imports from this country  and so also is a good market, and now what we want to see is an  economic order that binds us together in a cooperative way, and  of course the benefits must be reciprocal. We must open up our  borders, remove tariffs, or lower them for a start, and trade  with each other as freely as we can.    [Mashokwe] Is there no fear of this big brother image which  could probably bring about concern or suspicion?    [Mugabe] Oh, no, no, no. We are very happy. In fact we are  encouraging countries whom whenever we speak and this subject  arises, we always encourage countries to help South Africa at  this stage. South Africa will need a lot more of aid by way of  investment, even grants for a start. We had that kind of, you  know, boost at the beginning of our independence, and at least  to get us...[pauses] to get our economy to be reconstructed and  rehabilitated, and South Africa needs that kind of assistance  from the whole of the international community.    Yes, when one looks at Cape Town and Johannesburg, Durban,  and the other big cities one is impressed by what happens there.  But one must look also, even within those cities, at the  depressed areas, you see, the townships, that has been  neglected. One must look at the systems, social systems that  operate and see whether these systems are equitable or  inequitable. Look at the educational system. A lot needs to be  done really to rehabilitate, to reconstruct and restructure it  in such a way that it is the education that formally on the  blacks [as heard].    Education systems can be boosted, can be qualitatively  transformed and brought to the level of the education that was  obtained on the European side, and this is what we had to do in  our own country -- remove the inequities of the past, all the  inequalities.    That will require some funding, a lot, lot more funding and  investment is required in order for the economy to continue to  grow, and if South Africa prospers that way they will get the  benefits as well, by way of the new technology which has come to  South Africa.    There would be companies that will come to Zimbabwe, to  Botswana. We already have lots of South African companies in our  country and the technology that their parent companies acquire  here will be technology that the subsidiaries elsewhere will  require, but of course, within the system of our interaction,  cooperation, the benefits by way of technology will be our  benefits. The benefits by way of capital goods will also be our  benefit. We will use machinery for our mines from South Africa.  South Africa will sell them much more cheaply that Britain or  Germany, for obvious reasons, are likely to sell those same  goods to us. So, there is that benefit to be derived and we  don't think that money that comes to South Africa is money that  would have come to us, necessarily, no.    [Mashokwe] Fourteen years of Zimbabwe's independence. What  lessons are there for South Africa -- for this new emerging  democracy?    [Mugabe] Quite a number of lessons, and I don't think they  are lessons necessarily for the government or for Mandela. They  are lessons for the community. One, independence does not usher  in an era of manna falling from heaven. Never will there be  gifts the Almighty will shower down on the people of South  Africa. The people of South Africa have got to sweat, to work  hard. Now the environment is there. We must ask for the  opportunity, you see, for them to work. The opportunity for  them to have the necessary skills, the opportunity to be  appointed, given they have those skills, to jobs that they were  denied yesterday, and this is what the outlook must be on the  part of the people -- patience. They will require a great  amount of patience because delivery of benefits is a process, a  function really, of the development of industries.    Then there is the second aspect which has to do with racial  harmony. That has got to continue. If that fails then the  country is ushered into an era of conflict and a country as  large as South Africa, if it develops conflict you know what the  consequences will be and there will then be a spill over into  neighboring countries. One we would hope that doesn't happen.  We are glad that the policy that has been adopted by President  Mandela is one of racial harmony and one, of course, that seeks  now to get rid of the conflict between Inkatha and the ANC, the  conflict between the whites and the blacks, and if only the  people will heed that lesson, then we will have a very peaceful  and stable South Africa, but it will take time.    It has taken a long time for our own whites to adjust to the  new situation. Yesterday they were the leaders, they were,  well, the policy makers, and now that we are the policy makers  some of them find it extremely difficult to adjust.  Economically, they are still bosses in our country, the whites,  and they have not, you know, as it were, reoriented their  thinking. They have not fully adjusted. Some have adjusted but  they are only a small number.    Ian Smith is still talking the same UD language ... UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] language as in 1965.  He hasn't adjusted, but we didn't have to adjust. We adopted  the policies that we espoused, even during the liberation  struggle. We said to ourselves we are not fighting the white  man because he is white. We are fighting his policies. Once  those policies have gone the white man becomes acceptable, but  he will have to accept the new order, but you have people like  Ian Smith. You have your own Ian Smiths here who will continue  to fight for the old order, even though it's a futile struggle,  but it will continue until [laughs] death takes them, and so  really, we have got to be patient, and I would hope that my  brother President Mandela will be patient with them and not get  annoyed. We have been patient with Ian Smith. He still runs  his farm. We have not confiscated it in any way. We ...  sometimes you feel... [pauses] you feel the man is completely  unrepentant. Why continue to treat him justly, but then sense  and I think, magnanimity bids that, well, that the man is  harmless anyway. Let him have his outpourings and they won't do  anyone any harm.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, I'm running out of time.    [Mugabe] Yes?    [Mashokwe] The issue of the Frontline States, will it still  be there as the OAU has been accused of not being able to  address its own socioeconomic and political problems. Let's  look at Rwanda for instance?    [Mugabe] Yes, the Frontline States no longer have a front  line, and we do not regret that the front line has gone. I was  joking with former President de Klerk yesterday, when he asked  me whether South Africa was a member of the Frontline. I said  yes, and he said where is the front line? I said if the FL  still exists it's now the fishing line along the coast. And so  that's why we wanted the Frontline to (?leave) and that's where  we now are. So we can go fishing now, but we are looking at how  we can transform the Frontline into an organ that will be a  watchdog one, and come to the assistance of countries or a  country that will have lost control because of some instability  that has been triggered by lawless people.    And we have the example of Lesotho, what's happening in  Lesotho, and really Lesotho requires friends now. Friends who  believe in democracy. Not long ago they had elections there in  order to transform the military experience there, which the  people of Lesotho were forced to embrace for so long a time,  into a new democratic order, and the elections were won by the  BCP [Basotholand Congress Party]. But some people are opposed  to that experience. And we feel that Lesotho is really to be  allowed now some period of rest from military rule, and anyway,  a period it deserves, because everybody in our region is going  democratic. They will possibly be assisted.    And so the Frontline States, as a spearhead of the OAU, and  also of course as an organization of our own region, can be  transformed so it embraces not just the countries that fought  for Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa, but others also in our  region. Possibly the role of SADC [Southern African Development  Community], and has this political agenda, but not an agenda to  interfere in the domestic affairs of a country, an agenda really  to salvage a country, to save it from being torn apart by forces  that are inimical to progress and democracy. And that's the  role we hope those of our experts we asked to look at how the  Frontline States can be transformed, and the new look Frontline  States might be able to do.    But you made mention of the OAU and Rwanda. Well, the OAU is  a much larger organization than the Frontline States, and of  course the larger an organization is then the more complex and  the more problems, and in some cases the more contradictions it  embraces. And it's true that in Rwanda we have a situation that  should have been controlled long ago, but this is not to say  nothing was being done, President Mwinyi was working with our  encouragement on a program to get the leaders to agree to  proceed to elections, and in fact there is already an Arusha  Agreement.    Unfortunately, the incident of an air crash reversed the  process that was underway, but we hope we can once again, if we  send troops, as some of us have committed ourselves to do, and  bring the situation under control, and President Mwinyi can  start the exercise from there. He left it off where the air  crash and the events that followed disrupted it. So it's not  that nothing was being done in Rwanda, it is only that when the  event or the tragedy of the air craft that crashed happened, and  the subsequent developments, the Hutu rising against the Tutsi,  and we were not poised immediately to go into Rwanda and help  solve the situation, that was unfortunate.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion Mr. Mugabe, what do you want to do  when you stop being a politician?    [Mugabe] What do I want to do? I want to teach again. I  want to go teaching. When I retire from politics, obviously, I  want to do a little more reading, more writing especially, and  bring you into another focus of our people, and some of my  experiences in getting them to read and evaluate my experiences.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mugabe, thanks for your time and for honoring  us with this interview.    [Mugabe] Thank you.     "

Anywhere else in the world it would be the retreat of the rich, a private playground in an unspoilt environment. It's within easy reach from Johannesburg - a 60-minute flight east to Umtata, and then an hour's drive through the green hills of what used to be the Transkei homeland. On the cove's grassy slopes are scattered 42 bungalows. A tennis court and swimming pool are in easy reach, while alongside the jetty on the river which feeds the lagoon, a motorboat stands ready for fishing or bird-spotting expeditions. The hotel is not a retreat for the well-off. Dinner, bed and breakfast costs R125 a night - just over Pounds 20 - but the resort has only a handful of guests.* It is as if Umngazi is still cocooned and isolated from the outside world by the country's apartheid past. In the grim period after the mid-1980s, when Mr PW Botha, prime minister, defied the world and angry black teenagers took to the streets, Umngazi and hundreds of other resorts suffered the consequences. South Africa seemed to have put up the shutters against political reform, and the outside world shunned it: barely 250,000 tourists came to the country in 1988. But with the political transition and the inauguration of a stable government of national unity, Umngazi awaits discovery by visitors to the new South Africa. Many of those travellers who already knew what this spectacular country has to offer are looking back with something akin to guilty nostalgia to a time when a berth in the luxurious Blue Train could be obtained at short notice, or a room at the Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town with a view of Table Mountain - provided it wasn't the school holidays. Those days are well passed, for a vigorous promotion campaign is getting under way. 'Explore South Africa 95 Year' will be its theme, exploiting events such as the World Rugby Cup, the Comrades Marathon in Natal, the Million Dollar Golf Classic at Sun City and the Grahamstown festival 'The aim is to to achieve R9.5bn in foreign exchange earnings by 1996, based on 1m overseas visitor arrivals and 3.7m arrivals from Africa', says the South African Tourism Board's marketing plan. It may seem an ambitious target, but when the world discovers what South Africa has to offer it will beat a path to beaches, game parks, mountains and lakes served by an excellent transport and communications infrastructure, and offering lodges and hotels that range from budget class to the luxurious. Since the lifting of sanctions, direct air links with Australia and the US have been re-established, existing airlines have increased their services, and more than 20 new airlines are serving South Africa. Tourist sector officials acknowledge that coping with a million holidaymakers a year will strain the country's existing hotel capacity. But the sector is already preparing for a boom that will encourage hotels to upgrade their facilities and, above all, create jobs. And while the 1m target is four times the annual number of holidaymakers who came during the political traumas of the mid-1980s, Satour points to last years' figures as evidence that it is within reach. In 1993, the country earned about R6bn from 618,000 overseas tourists - 10.5 per cent up on 1992 - making the sector the fourth-largest foreign exchange earner after manufactured goods, gold and mining, and employing approximately 430,000 workers. Notwithstanding this increase, the potential has barely been tapped, say Satour officials. South Africa has less than a 1 per cent share of the international market and tourism accounts for only 2 per cent of South Africa's gross national product, compared to the world average of 6.1 per cent. There is scope for growth even in traditional strongholds. The UK is by far South Africa's largest overseas market, accounting for about 23 per cent of visitors - excluding those from Africa - and Germany is the second-largest source. But thanks to the new political environment and the number of new airlines serving Johannesburg, Satour can now exploit lucrative markets hitherto out of reach, such as India and Japan, and Scandinavia. But it is Africa itself that is expected to provide the most dramatic results, from a mere 200,000 arrivals in 1991 to a targeted 3.7m in 1996. Good news for the South African economy, but not happy reading for those who now have to share the country's scenic beauty with millions of newcomers. So don't delay: visit South Africa while the hotels are relatively cheap and underbooked, the beaches are not crowded, tourists are not fleeced, and Umngazi River Bungalows are not taken over by the package tour business. *Umngazi River Bungalows, near Port St Johns (0471) 22370   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Cairo yesterday for a three-day visit during which he will discuss establishing diplomatic links with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart. These will be the first bilateral talks between the two countries. The South African minister's arrival in Cairo follows his tour last month to Jordan, Oman and Qatar. It underlines Pretoria's determination to increase trade and investment and develop political relations in the region. Egypt, which formally applies the international embargo against South Africa, has very limited ties with the republic. These amount to the exchange of a handful of tourists and a small amount of informal import and export trade. But Egyptian officials said that once an election date and transitional executive council - which will advise the South African government before the planned elections - were named, Cairo would see no great impediment to diplomatic relations. Parties to constitutional talks in South Africa earlier this month said they hoped to fix an election date by early next month. The officials did not expect any progress on South Africa's desire to join the Organisation of African Unity, which will hold its annual summit in Cairo at the end of next month.

0,FT942-11536 ,"FT942-11536 _AN-EEED1ADQFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / Personal View: An example for the rest of Africa      By Lord CALLAGHAN   South Africa's elections were a reminder to those with jaded political palates how much the vote means when it has been denied for so long. Now comes the hard part - the fulfilment of the masses' expectations that the election of a government of their choice will in a very short time transform into reality their demands for decent housing, better schooling and more jobs. Not that their leaders were extravagant in their pre-election promises, although enthusiastic local activists over-egged the pudding. Among the national leaders, there is a sober appreciation of the tremendous tasks that they will face. I doubt whether this has gone home to the electors in the excitement of living through a truly revolutionary era. In truth, although a beginning can and must be made quickly, a levelling up process will take several years. As many as one-quarter of black people are living in miserable lean-to huts and shanty towns with flimsy housing materials, and with a lack of water, proper sanitation and electricity. The ANC believes that extra social expenditure can be financed by the faster rate of economic growth that they expect now sanctions have been lifted - and in fact the economy has already begun to expand. Another favourable factor is that the country's small international debt should permit additional borrowing, and it will have renewed access to IMF drawings and to World Bank loans. There are signs that many of the 200 to 300 overseas companies which ran down their operations as a result of sanctions are considering returning. The economy of South Africa is altogether larger and stronger than any of its neighbours. It manufactures nearly as much as the whole of sub-Saharan Africa put together and exports twice as much as all the rest. By comparison with its neighbours, it is an industrial giant in every respect. But when viewed against the industrialised west, its deficiencies are glaringly apparent. Sanctions had a bigger impact than was admitted. New investment declined seriously during the 1980s and, if it is to increase to the level at which it can sustain a fast rate of growth, the present low levels of domestic savings need to improve and a favourable climate needs to be established to encourage overseas capital to return. Both big parties in the new government favour lower tariffs and less protection with a reduction of subsidies to domestic industry. And both recognise the need to recover South Africa's international position in price and quality, despite the lack of skilled technical, managerial and professional manpower. But the incoming government must strive to formulate economic policies that will give confidence both at home and overseas, while at the same time transform the social landscape, finding work for the near 50 per cent unemployed, and deliver those basic services which the African people expect. Without economic success, the social improvements will not bear fruit. But without social reform, a democratic society would collapse, and the boldest multi-racial venture ever undertaken in Africa could dissolve in disorder or worse. It will be as difficult a task as any government has undertaken. The world cannot turn its back on South Africa at this crucial moment. Additional resources are needed to enable it to transform itself and to assist its re-integration with the rest of the continent. Whilst it is imperative that South Africa's revolution should succeed for the sake of its own people, an additional bonus will be the enormous impact it would have on sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. It is already a magnet for Africans in other African countries. A few of its continental neighbours have recently embarked on far-reaching reforms and show signs of progress. But that is not the general picture. Some are in turmoil: agriculture stagnates; many are unable to break free from the burden of foreign debt; there is corruption and an absence of sound government, indifferent and sometimes no education, grossly high military expenditure, ethnic tension; and so on. The example of a successful South Africa would galvanise other sub-Saharan countries. What energies might be unlocked if South Africa could hold out a vision of a future in which neighbours could integrate their resources and skills as a means of realising the potential of Africa's rich diverse resources and bringing hope to poverty-stricken millions? What better international role for a newly democratic, multi-racial country emerged from decades of isolation than to assist friends and neighbours weaker than itself to rejoin the mainstream of the international community? South Africa's revolution must not fail. The author was British prime minister from 1976 to 1979   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

0,FT932-7951 ,"FT932-7951 _AN-DEUB0AA9FT 930521   FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: W Africans hurt by EC beef policy      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   EC SUBSIDIES for beef exports to West Africa are destroying the livelihood of 4m pastoralists who rely wholly on cattle-rearing in the semi-arid Sahel region south of the Sahara, according to the British charity Christian Aid. With other European aid agencies, Christian Aid has launched a campaign for the abolition of these subsidies. Since 1984, EC beef exports to West Africa have increased seven-fold, subsidised to the tune of Pounds 280m by European tax-payers. Local beef prices have collapsed. The low-quality, subsidised EC beef sells at half the price of locally produced meat. Sahelian farmers are finding that no-one is prepared to buy their herds. EC beef dumping is not only threatening the survival of Sahelian communities, it also undermines aid from the EC itself to support livestock production in the Sahel. Hundreds of millions of Ecus from the European Development Fund have been spent on building refrigerated abattoirs in Burkina Faso, on improving cattle breeds in Mali, Gambia and Senegal, and on promoting disease control in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. An EC council of ministers meeting is expected to discuss the issue at the end of the month. Christian Aid argues that to stop the export of subsidised beef to West Africa would not seriously damage farmers in Europe. Less than 0.5 per cent of total EC beef production of 8.7m tonnes in 1991 was exported to the region.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     EHZ  Western Sahara, Africa.

Laut, a shot putter, was at Pilditch Stadium on the outskirts of Pretoria,  South Africa, on that October day in 1988, part of a contingent of 14 track and  field athletes from the United States who had chosen to ignore an international  ban on competition in South Africa. They were risking their eligibility by  competing in a country where apartheid in sanctioned by law.    Laut admitted he had mixed emotions as he stepped into the shot-put ring at  Pilditch, with 16 pounds of metal tucked between shoulder and chin.    ""I mean here I was, about to throw the shot in South Africa, and I'm thinking,  'Are you sure you want to do this?' "" recalled Laut, who swallowed his emotions  long enough to launch a 66-foot put -- the longest ever on South African soil.  ""I really had the adrenaline going on that one.""    The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United  States, recognized Laut's record by handing him a four-year ban from  competition. However Laut, an Olympian in 1984, is far from repentant --  recently he returned from his third trip to South Africa, a decision he fully  expects will earn him yet another ban, this time for life.    ""I'm guessing, but they'll probably give us a lifetime (ban) now because we  went back,"" said Laut of the five-meet tour in which he and 13 teammates  participated in November. ""I'm waiting to get the letter any day.""    Nine of the U. S. athletes who participated in the original October, 1988, tour  received TAC suspensions ranging from two to 12 years.    Laut, 33, said there is no simple reason for his decision to risk punishment by  competing in South Africa, although money was an important factor.    A standout shot putter at Santa Clara High, Moorpark College, San Jose City  College and UCLA, Laut earned a bronze medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. The  following year he won the TAC outdoor championships and, buoyed by those  performances, drew a bead on the 1988 Olympics.    Looking for a job that would provide him with both the cash and the time to  train, Laut tried out in the summer of 1986 for a position with the Oxnard Fire  Department. While running with a fire hose, he felt a sharp pain in both knees.  Ruptured tendons sent him sprawling to the pavement.    The following year, which Laut should have spent in training for the Olympics,  was consumed instead with rehabilitation. His few performances were poor and he  lost both his momentum and valuable financial support from Nike.    When he took a part-time time as a realtor, his training suffered. At the 1988  Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Laut, who needed to finish in the top three to  win a spot on the team, placed fifth.    When Skip Robinson, the track coach at Pasadena City College, approached Laut  at the trials and proposed a possible tour of South Africa, Laut was  apprehensive. Robinson was straightforward -- he told Laut this would be the  first such tour since 1962 and the first since the International Amateur  Athletic Federation banned South Africa from international track and field  competition in 1976.    Any athlete who went likely would face repercussions. Laut, however, was ready  to take a chance.    ""It sounded like a pretty serious commitment, but I'd lost my contract (with  Nike) and things were looking pretty bad, so I thought, 'Well, why not take a  chance and see?' "" said Laut.    According to published reports, the U.S. athletes were paid a minimum of  $10,000 per meet during the 1988 tour and, with performance bonuses, could earn  much more. Miler Jim Spivey claimed he was offered $200,000 to compete in the  meets.    Spivey declined the offer.    Though Laut refused to discuss specifics, he said he was paid somewhere between  $10,000 and $30,000. Whatever the sum, said Laut, money was the only way to get  athletes to take the risk.    ""You're not going to ask an athlete to risk his eligibility and his whole  sports career without paying them for it,"" Laut said.    Though money spurred Laut to take his first trip to South Africa in the fall of  1988, subsequent trips in April and November were taken for other reasons.    ""South Africa is the only place in the world I can compete now,"" Laut said.    ""I think that everyone who's gone over there has a goal and we're committed to  seeing it through,"" added Laut, whose tour teammates have included Olympians  John Powell, Ruth Wysocki, Tom Petranoff and Gregg Tafralis. ""Hopefully through  our efforts and what we're doing we'll maybe make a dent on this ban on sports  over there.""    Not everyone agrees. When plans for the first tour were announced, many decried  the idea, saying it would lend legitimacy to a political system that allows  South Africa's 27 million blacks no vote and little voice. Critics say the  tours have fostered no change, and many accuse the athletes who participated of  ignoring moral concerns for financial benefit.    ""The people that went there, they know its wrong,"" said George Mehale, a South  African who coaches track and field at Cal State Long Beach. ""Nothing changed  because they went.""    ""If anything, people are telling me informally that in a way they hurt the  cause -- not major injury, but they certainly did set things back,"" said TAC  President Frank Greenberg, one of several TAC officials who voted to ban the  athletes who participated in the 1988 tour. ""I think it's counterproductive  when individuals go. Global reaction against South Africa is getting stronger,  that pressure has already produced some changes.""    Supporters of sanctions against South Africa say the sanctions contributed to  President Frederik De Klerk's recent decisions to release political prisoners  such as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela.    De Klerk also lifted a decades-old ban on the African National Congress and  more than a dozen other groups dedicated to the abolition of apartheid; eased  government censorship of the media; and asked his justice department to reserve  capital penalties for the most severe crimes.    But De Klerk, whose Nationalist Party has ruled South Africa since 1948 and is  thus responsible for instituting the most repulsive separatist laws, left most  of the pillars of apartheid intact. The pass laws, which require blacks to  carry legal documents when traveling outside their townships, are still  enforced and the nation's black citizens are still not entitled to participate  in the government or in national elections.    Laut prefers to steer clear of debate. Others, however, vehemently defend the  tours.    ""We spent time doing clinics, promoting goodwill and helping people of all  colors,"" said tour organizer and coach Dick Tomlinson. ""Ours is a purely  humanitarian effort. We're trying to bring understanding and turn the lights on  the South African situation so people will realize that there are millions of  black South Africans who are being deprived of international sport.""    Laut said he has seen few signs of segregation during his trips to South  Africa. Critics argue that Laut and his fellow athletes were sheltered from  apartheid's worst. Although they were free to travel as they wished --  including visits to the volatile black townships of Soweto and Crossroads --  one team member admitted there was ""a strong possibility"" she and her fellow  athletes were sheltered during their visit.    ""We did go different places, but they had an itinerary set up with where they  were going to take us and what we were going to do,"" said Pamela Page, a  hurdler who participated in the most recent tour. Page, who is black, also said  that despite outward appearances of normalcy, something was amiss.    ""People were nice and they kept saying, 'We're trying to change, we're trying  to change,' but it was still strange,"" Page said. ""I'd be shopping and they  (white South Africans) would just kind of stop and look at me like, 'Wait a  minute.' It kind of caught them off guard.""    But while Laut admits he knows little about South Africa's politics, he does  know something of sport and he sees in South Africa a potential track  powerhouse.    ""There's just an unbelievable amount of talent over there, it's just amazing,""  Laut said. ""If they could become a part of the world, they would be a major  power in track and field in 10 years. That's my sincere belief.""    During the November tour, Laut and the rest of the U. S. contingent met briefly  with De Klerk. According to Laut, the president lent his support to the tour  and expressed hope that the South African athletes would soon be able to  compete internationally.    ""They've got a lot of national pride and I think they would really like to see  their country get back into international competition,"" Laut said.    Laut also expresses admiration for the South African athletes who continue to  train and compete in the face of an international ban that keeps them at home,  leaving them to compete against the same faces in the same places.    ""When I was in high school and college I always had that Olympic medal as my  dream. That was my focus, the driving force that kept me going . . . ,"" Laut  said. ""The South African athlete doesn't have that dream, but he keeps working  as hard as we do, maybe harder. To me that determination is amazing.""    For Laut, training and competition have also taken on a slightly different  slant from his college days. He has pared his training substantially --  slipping away from work in the afternoon to put the shot at Hueneme High or  lift weights in the garage of his home.    ""If I'm lucky, I can get in two hours of training a day,"" Laut said. ""It's not  what I need, but I know what to do now and I can eliminate a lot of the  nonsense stuff that I used to do. I just do the exercises that will help me  throw the shot, which is basically the whole name of the game.""    Laut will return to South Africa, possibly as early as April for the South  African national championships. According to Laut, a full team will probably  return to South Africa again this fall and there is talk of a contract with  sponsors and the South African Athletic Union that would guarantee such visits  for the next three to five years.    Laut's ultimate goal, however, is to compete in South Africa as a member of an  official U. S. team.    ""I'd like to be able to represent the United States, have USA colors, raise the  flag and compete for the United States,"" Laut said.

Though Laut refused to discuss specifics, he said he was paid somewhere between  $10,000 and $30,000. Whatever the sum, said Laut, money was the only way to get  athletes to take the risk.    ""You're not going to ask an athlete to risk his eligibility and his whole  sports career without paying them for it,"" Laut said.    Though money spurred Laut to take his first trip to South Africa in the fall of  1988, subsequent trips in April and November were taken for other reasons.    ""South Africa is the only place in the world I can compete now,"" Laut said.    ""I think that everyone who's gone over there has a goal and we're committed to  seeing it through,"" added Laut, whose tour teammates have included Olympians  John Powell, Ruth Wysocki, Tom Petranoff and Gregg Tafralis. ""Hopefully through  our efforts and what we're doing we'll maybe make a dent on this ban on sports  over there.""    Not everyone agrees. When plans for the first tour were announced, many decried  the idea, saying it would lend legitimacy to a political system that allows  South Africa's 27 million blacks no vote and little voice. Critics say the  tours have fostered no change, and many accuse the athletes who participated of  ignoring moral concerns for financial benefit.    ""The people that went there, they know its wrong,"" said George Mehale, a South  African who coaches track and field at Cal State Long Beach. ""Nothing changed  because they went.""    ""If anything, people are telling me informally that in a way they hurt the  cause -- not major injury, but they certainly did set things back,"" said TAC  President Frank Greenberg, one of several TAC officials who voted to ban the  athletes who participated in the 1988 tour. ""I think it's counterproductive  when individuals go. Global reaction against South Africa is getting stronger,  that pressure has already produced some changes.""    Supporters of sanctions against South Africa say the sanctions contributed to  President Frederik De Klerk's recent decisions to release political prisoners  such as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela.    De Klerk also lifted a decades-old ban on the African National Congress and  more than a dozen other groups dedicated to the abolition of apartheid; eased  government censorship of the media; and asked his justice department to reserve  capital penalties for the most severe crimes.    But De Klerk, whose Nationalist Party has ruled South Africa since 1948 and is  thus responsible for instituting the most repulsive separatist laws, left most  of the pillars of apartheid intact. The pass laws, which require blacks to  carry legal documents when traveling outside their townships, are still  enforced and the nation's black citizens are still not entitled to participate  in the government or in national elections.    Laut prefers to steer clear of debate. Others, however, vehemently defend the  tours.    ""We spent time doing clinics, promoting goodwill and helping people of all  colors,"" said tour organizer and coach Dick Tomlinson. ""Ours is a purely  humanitarian effort. We're trying to bring understanding and turn the lights on  the South African situation so people will realize that there are millions of  black South Africans who are being deprived of international sport.""    Laut said he has seen few signs of segregation during his trips to South  Africa. Critics argue that Laut and his fellow athletes were sheltered from  apartheid's worst. Although they were free to travel as they wished --  including visits to the volatile black townships of Soweto and Crossroads --  one team member admitted there was ""a strong possibility"" she and her fellow  athletes were sheltered during their visit.    ""We did go different places, but they had an itinerary set up with where they  were going to take us and what we were going to do,"" said Pamela Page, a  hurdler who participated in the most recent tour. Page, who is black, also said  that despite outward appearances of normalcy, something was amiss.    ""People were nice and they kept saying, 'We're trying to change, we're trying  to change,' but it was still strange,"" Page said. ""I'd be shopping and they  (white South Africans) would just kind of stop and look at me like, 'Wait a  minute.' It kind of caught them off guard.""    But while Laut admits he knows little about South Africa's politics, he does  know something of sport and he sees in South Africa a potential track  powerhouse.    ""There's just an unbelievable amount of talent over there, it's just amazing,""  Laut said. ""If they could become a part of the world, they would be a major  power in track and field in 10 years. That's my sincere belief.""    During the November tour, Laut and the rest of the U. S. contingent met briefly  with De Klerk. According to Laut, the president lent his support to the tour  and expressed hope that the South African athletes would soon be able to  compete internationally.    ""They've got a lot of national pride and I think they would really like to see  their country get back into international competition,"" Laut said.    Laut also expresses admiration for the South African athletes who continue to  train and compete in the face of an international ban that keeps them at home,  leaving them to compete against the same faces in the same places.    ""When I was in high school and college I always had that Olympic medal as my  dream. That was my focus, the driving force that kept me going . . . ,"" Laut  said. ""The South African athlete doesn't have that dream, but he keeps working  as hard as we do, maybe harder. To me that determination is amazing.""    For Laut, training and competition have also taken on a slightly different  slant from his college days. He has pared his training substantially --  slipping away from work in the afternoon to put the shot at Hueneme High or  lift weights in the garage of his home.    ""If I'm lucky, I can get in two hours of training a day,"" Laut said. ""It's not  what I need, but I know what to do now and I can eliminate a lot of the  nonsense stuff that I used to do. I just do the exercises that will help me  throw the shot, which is basically the whole name of the game.""    Laut will return to South Africa, possibly as early as April for the South  African national championships. According to Laut, a full team will probably  return to South Africa again this fall and there is talk of a contract with  sponsors and the South African Athletic Union that would guarantee such visits  for the next three to five years.    Laut's ultimate goal, however, is to compete in South Africa as a member of an  official U. S. team.    ""I'd like to be able to represent the United States, have USA colors, raise the  flag and compete for the United States,"" Laut said.

0,FT933-11876 ,"FT933-11876 _AN-DG0CFAF2FT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (1): Determined to press on - Ghana has blazed a trail in Africa, implementing economic reform while managing the transition to civilian rule. The toughest test may lie ahead, as the government seeks domestic and foreign investment vital for export-led growth      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   IN a continent full of strongmen propped up by sclerotic regimes, Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings, Ghana's leader since 1981, stands out for his shrewd ability to adapt to changing times - which may explain his enduring popularity. Last January Mr Rawlings effected the transition from military dictator to elected president with the same apparent ease as he abandoned revolutionary Marxism a decade ago to become the model pupil of the International Monetary Fund. His timely conversion to democracy spared Ghana the suspension of international aid that which has crippled other, less-adaptable African nations. But Ghanaians could be excused for believing that little has changed. They have the same president, almost the same government team and economic policies as before. The new parliament, dominated by Mr Rawlings' National Democratic Congress (because there is an opposition boycott), has yet to prove it can be an independent counterpoint to the president's authority. And many of the democratic safeguards enshrined in the new constitution, such as a human rights commission and an independent press council, have yet to be put in place. Most western observers judged the election to be relatively free and fair, but some Ghanaians, particularly the educated elite in Accra, argue that donor governments, desperate for a success story in Africa, turned a blind eye to unfair rules of the game that gave Mr Rawlings an unbeatable advantage. The electoral register, inflated by more than 1m names, was seriously flawed, and the opposition had been legalised barely six months before the election - hardly enough time to organise an effective campaign. It was a contest, they say, in which Mr Rawlings was the star player, linesman and referee. In protest, the four main opposition parties, ranging from the socialist followers of Ghana's founding father, Kwame Nkrumah, to the conservative New Patriotic Party (NPP), boycotted the parliamentary elections in December. It is a decision they now deeply regret. Their self-exclusion from parliament has left them almost as voiceless as they were under military rule. Furthermore, seven months into the new regime they are still bickering among themselves over how to survive in the political wilderness. Some, such as Mr Bernard Joao da Rocha, the NPP chairman, favour a policy of reconciliation with the Rawlings government. He asked, and obtained, permission to submit his party's views on the 1993 budget to parliament. 'The fact that we boycotted the parliamentary elections does not render this government illegitimate,' Mr da Rocha concedes. 'Our only hope of influencing policy is to establish a dialogue with the party in power.' But Mr da Rocha's pragmatism jars with the bitterness harboured by other NPP stalwarts. Professor Adu Boahen, the NPP presidential candidate, refuses to accept the results of the contest he lost. 'I will never recognise Rawlings as a legitimate leader. I have no wish to accord respectability to his government,' he says. If Ghana's democratic transition requires a leap of faith, then greater faith still is needed to believe that after a decade of economic reforms, the country is ready to make the qualitative leap into accelerated, export-led growth. Having spent the past 10 years trying to repair the damage caused by socialist mismanagement in the 1960s and 1970s, Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's veteran finance minister, believes the country is sufficiently recovered to shift its focus from reform to active development. His accelerated growth plan, unveiled at a Paris meeting of donors last month, is bold in conception. The target - to achieve 8 per cent annual growth rates by the turn of the century - is ambitious. Ghana is hoping to model itself on the newly industrialised nations of south-east Asia. If it succeeds, 10 years of liberalisation, deregulation and devaluation will have been vindicated. And the World Bank and the IMF, struggling to convince sub-Saharan Africa of the benefits of structural adjustment, will have a new development example on the continent. For the plan to work, Dr Botchwey is betting on a revival of manufacturing, believing that a leaner, export-oriented manufacturing sector can rise from the ashes of structural adjustment. The accelerated growth plan calls for non-traditional exports (everything that is neither cocoa, gold nor timber) to grow by 29 per cent a year throughout the 1990s. Investment and domestic savings ratios will have to improve substantially to sustain higher growth rates. And the sluggish agricultural sector, which has suffered from the collapse of cocoa prices and erratic weather conditions, will have to be prodded into greater productivity. Dr Botchwey's plan was overwhelmingly endorsed at the donor conference, which pledged a further Dollars 2.1bn in assistance over the next two years  -almost half a billion dollars more than the government had bargained for. There are reasons for optimism. Since Ghana began to swallow the IMF medicine in 1983, gross domestic product has grown by an average of 4.9 per cent a year, more than twice the sub-Saharan average of 2.1 per cent. It follows a decade during which real incomes per head in Ghana fell by 30 per cent. Yet Ghana remains desperately poor. Its average per capita income was only Dollars 400 last year. Low wages have led to an exodus of Ghanaian professionals. There are fewer doctors in Ghana now (one for every 15,000 inhabitants) than in 1975. The World Bank estimates that at current growth rates, it would take 20 years for the average poor Ghanaian to cross the poverty line. Hence the urgency to push for accelerated growth. A recent World Bank strategy document entitled 'Ghana 2000 and beyond - setting the stage for accelerated growth and poverty reduction', estimates that if growth rose to 8 per cent, then the average poor Ghanaian could cross the poverty threshold in 10 years. Ghana's fast-track development plan has a second, equally important objective: to wean itself off aid dependence by attracting new foreign investment and diversifying exports. Dr Botchwey says there are 'real signals' that this is already happening. 'A number of multinationals who quit in the 1970s are coming back,' he argues. 'They are looking at the comparative labour costs and are interested in producing on a large scale for export. There is tremendous scope for rapid expansion in agro-processing industries and in wood processing.' And yet Ghana's private sector success stories in export diversification remain limited. One company accounts for 90 per cent of Ghana's furniture exports. Another company produces most of Ghana's fruit juice exports. Pineapples are proving to be a lucrative alternative to cocoa, but only because they have been able to displace the more expensive produce from neighbouring Ivory Coast. Some multinationals which are encountering quota problems in the Far East have expressed interest in setting up manufacturing plants in proposed industrial incentive zones. But few investments have yet materialised. While the private sector in Ghana agrees with the broad thrust of the government's policies, there is much scepticism over its implementation. 'If we think that small manufacturers can suddenly become exporters, we are dreaming,' says Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of Unilever Ghana. 'We need to attract multinationals on the basis that they can come to exploit our cheap labour and natural resources.' Local manufacturers, Mr Yamson says, have little knowledge of export markets. They lack managerial skills and are starved of long-term domestic sources of finance. The government's Export Promotion Council has been ineffective in selling Ghana abroad, while a couple of venture capital funds set up last year have yet to lend a single cedi to budding entrepreneurs. Mr Yamson places more hope in a new trade and investment programme launched by US aid and other donors, which aims to provide the services and know-how that potential exporters need. The government, for its part, is introducing 'a new agenda of activism' that will target investors with special incentives. 'Picking winners is a hazardous thing,' Mr Botchwey concedes, so he has asked the private sector to draft guidelines for the selective protection of infant industries. 'The protection measures will have to be time-bound, the criteria clear and transparent, to avoid charges of political favouritism,' he explains. Whether all this can add up to accelerated growth remains to be seen. Much will depend on the government's ability to maintain a healthy macroeconomic environment. Last year, as Ghana prepared for the presidential election, the government was frightened into granting large pay increases to striking public servants who were on strike. The government's wage bill rocketed to 50 per cent of public revenues, derailing the delicately balanced budget. Inflation rose to 10.1 per cent in 1992 against a 5 per cent target. The World Bank and co-financing donors withheld Dollars 170m of development assistance. And overall economic growth slowed down to 3.9 per cent. Dr Botchwey moved swiftly to close the budget deficit by imposing a new 'killer tax' on fuels in January. Meanwhile, the Bank of Ghana (central bank) sharply jacked up its discount rate to bring the money supply under control. Inflation, however, is not expected to fall below 20 per cent this year. 1993, therefore, is being billed as a year of belt-tightening and retrenchment. Western diplomats in Accra do not expect the economy to take off again before 1995. But the determination is there to press ahead. And while the ink may still be fresh on Ghana's accelerated growth plan, the document marks a psychological turning point in the nation's history. By underscoring its faith in its own potential, Ghana is shedding its image as a victim of an unjust world economic order.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.

Political observers deem the visits as ""very important"" and  in line with bilateral interests for further strengthening of  political, economic and cultural ties as well as regional and  international cooperation.    In the pre-revolution era, Africa was ignored by the shah's  regime which had ties with only certain African countries such  as the racist South African regime. However, the following the  triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1079, Iran severed its  relations with the racist South African regime upon the orders  of the father of the Islamic revolution the late Imam Khomeini,  and expanded its ties with sub-Saharan African countries.    Islamic Republic of Iran now has established ties with 20  African countries at the ambassadorial level and ""very sincere""  relations with many others, but is yet to develop healthy  economic ties with them.    The six African countries which Velayati is to visit are  rich  in gold, diamonds, silver, bauxite, zinc, iron, copper, tin and  cobalt as well as in such agricultural products as coffee,  cocoa, tea, rice, cotton, sugar cane and pineapple.    Iran can have favourable cooperation with the said countries  and can invest in their mineral and agricultural sectors in  favour of common interests.    However, Iran has no direct aerial and marine transportation  links with the said countries to promote economic cooperation.    Contrary to Iran, the European Community, U.S., Japan and  even the Zionist regime have embarked on economic investments in  sub-Saharan Africa unilaterally to plunder the rich natural  resources of the deprived continent.

By HALFORD H. FAIRCHILD, Halford H. Fairchild, a social psychologist, teaches  in the Pan African Studies Department at Cal State Los Angeles.      A 22-year-old African American man was sentenced early this month in Los  Angeles to life in prison without the possibility of parole for distributing  crack cocaine. It was California's first implementation of President Bush's  war-on-drugs policy.    The sentencing illustrates misguided policy and, in fact, contributes to the  ravaging of the African American community and our society through poverty,  drugs, crime and a host of related maladies.    Incarcerating drug dealers distracts us from the true causes of drug abuse and  crime. To the extent that we are so distracted, the underlying causes of these  problems remain untreated, and we can expect the continued proliferation of  drugs and related crime.    More important, the war-on-drugs mentality is a metaphor for our approach to  social problems in general: Those who display pathological symptoms are treated  as the cause of those symptoms and then prescribed ""appropriate"" treatment. We  therefore ignore the socioeconomic realities that produce these pathologies.    Crack cocaine and other drugs of devastation are equal-opportunity toxins: They  permeate every ethnic group and socioeconomic stratum. But drug abuse and other  social poisons hit hardest at the more vulnerable segments of our society: the  racially isolated, unemployed, chronically impoverished and socially  disfranchised.    It is no surprise, then, that drug abuse and related criminal activity are  problems on a larger scale in the poor, ethnic- minority inner cities. This  fact provides a clue to the causes of these problems.    If we can understand the cause of social isolation, of chronic and  intergenerational poverty and of anomie and despair, then we can understand the  causes of drug abuse and related crime. And if this is true, then one thing is  clear: That 22-year-old African American man facing a lifetime in prison is not  the cause of segregation, poverty or social distance. His incarceration is not  the cure.    The causes of poverty include unemployment and underemployment. The causes of  unemployment are tied to the training of the work force and the availability of  jobs. Inner-city schools are marked by overcrowding, underfunding,  less-experienced teachers and academic failure. In some areas, the drop-out  rate for junior high school is nearly 25%. In many areas, the drop-out rate for  high school exceeds 50%. Without the necessary academic skills of reading,  writing and computation, the people living in inner cities are  disproportionately ill-equipped to compete in a highly technological workplace.  Moreover, the presumption of incompetence results in continuing racial  discrimination in employment.    Capital-intensive fiscal priorities, particularly within the military arena,  serve to eliminate jobs in favor of hardware for death and destruction. We  marvel at the technological sophistication of the B-2 Stealth bomber, but how  many jobs can such a weapon produce relative to more humane endeavors? How many  of these jobs can serve the employment needs of African American men?    The welfare system ensures that millions of Americans live in unremitting  poverty. This economic parachute opens only for the desperately poor, and  scarcely softens the fall from catastrophe to subsistance.    Drugs are the narcotic that eases the pain from this hardship. Funding drug  addiction requires illicit activity that preys on other residents of the  already economically impoverished community.    To end the cycle of drug addiction and related crime -- and the victimization  of people in our inner cities -- requires ending the underlying causes. We must  focus on improving access to quality education in the inner cities. We must  guarantee equal attainment of basic academic skills. We must increase access to  jobs and careers. We must eliminate employment discrimination. We must move  beyond mere equal opportunity to equal achievement in health, education and  general well-being. We must eliminate the motive for narcotics.    Instead, current government emphasis is on building jails and prisons; the  current construction program is the biggest in our history. And with a prison  population that is nearly 50% African American, the new cells promise the  continued removal of these men from the community and from positive economic  contributions to their families.    Misguided policy interventions, such as incarceration for life, actually  contribute to the perpetuation of the very problems they seek to ameliorate. A  22-year-old spending life in prison will have little chance to be a productive  member of his family, and no chance at all to be productive in his community.

By HALFORD H. FAIRCHILD, Halford H. Fairchild, a social psychologist, teaches  in the Pan African Studies Department at Cal State Los Angeles.      A 22-year-old African American man was sentenced early this month in Los  Angeles to life in prison without the possibility of parole for distributing  crack cocaine. It was California's first implementation of President Bush's  war-on-drugs policy.    The sentencing illustrates misguided policy and, in fact, contributes to the  ravaging of the African American community and our society through poverty,  drugs, crime and a host of related maladies.    Incarcerating drug dealers distracts us from the true causes of drug abuse and  crime. To the extent that we are so distracted, the underlying causes of these  problems remain untreated, and we can expect the continued proliferation of  drugs and related crime.    More important, the war-on-drugs mentality is a metaphor for our approach to  social problems in general: Those who display pathological symptoms are treated  as the cause of those symptoms and then prescribed ""appropriate"" treatment. We  therefore ignore the socioeconomic realities that produce these pathologies.    Crack cocaine and other drugs of devastation are equal-opportunity toxins: They  permeate every ethnic group and socioeconomic stratum. But drug abuse and other  social poisons hit hardest at the more vulnerable segments of our society: the  racially isolated, unemployed, chronically impoverished and socially  disfranchised.    It is no surprise, then, that drug abuse and related criminal activity are  problems on a larger scale in the poor, ethnic- minority inner cities. This  fact provides a clue to the causes of these problems.    If we can understand the cause of social isolation, of chronic and  intergenerational poverty and of anomie and despair, then we can understand the  causes of drug abuse and related crime. And if this is true, then one thing is  clear: That 22-year-old African American man facing a lifetime in prison is not  the cause of segregation, poverty or social distance. His incarceration is not  the cure.    The causes of poverty include unemployment and underemployment. The causes of  unemployment are tied to the training of the work force and the availability of  jobs. Inner-city schools are marked by overcrowding, underfunding,  less-experienced teachers and academic failure. In some areas, the drop-out  rate for junior high school is nearly 25%. In many areas, the drop-out rate for  high school exceeds 50%. Without the necessary academic skills of reading,  writing and computation, the people living in inner cities are  disproportionately ill-equipped to compete in a highly technological workplace.  Moreover, the presumption of incompetence results in continuing racial  discrimination in employment.    Capital-intensive fiscal priorities, particularly within the military arena,  serve to eliminate jobs in favor of hardware for death and destruction. We  marvel at the technological sophistication of the B-2 Stealth bomber, but how  many jobs can such a weapon produce relative to more humane endeavors? How many  of these jobs can serve the employment needs of African American men?    The welfare system ensures that millions of Americans live in unremitting  poverty. This economic parachute opens only for the desperately poor, and  scarcely softens the fall from catastrophe to subsistance.    Drugs are the narcotic that eases the pain from this hardship. Funding drug  addiction requires illicit activity that preys on other residents of the  already economically impoverished community.    To end the cycle of drug addiction and related crime -- and the victimization  of people in our inner cities -- requires ending the underlying causes. We must  focus on improving access to quality education in the inner cities. We must  guarantee equal attainment of basic academic skills. We must increase access to  jobs and careers. We must eliminate employment discrimination. We must move  beyond mere equal opportunity to equal achievement in health, education and  general well-being. We must eliminate the motive for narcotics.    Instead, current government emphasis is on building jails and prisons; the  current construction program is the biggest in our history. And with a prison  population that is nearly 50% African American, the new cells promise the  continued removal of these men from the community and from positive economic  contributions to their families.    Misguided policy interventions, such as incarceration for life, actually  contribute to the perpetuation of the very problems they seek to ameliorate. A  22-year-old spending life in prison will have little chance to be a productive  member of his family, and no chance at all to be productive in his community.  Both will go on, vulnerable to the unrelenting devastation of drugs and crime,  while society at-large assumes the burden of housing him for the next 50 years  or so.    "
0,FT923-6037 ,"FT923-6037 _AN-CH1BVABLFT 920827   FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Neighbours build up links with Pretoria - Philip Gawith on a struggling region which has found a new level of co-operation      By PHILIP GAWITH   ECONOMIC need has concentrated political minds in southern Africa where seven countries are co-operating in the handling of 8.2m tonnes of maize imported into the region, which has been devastated by one of the worst droughts this century. At the heart of the scheme is Spoornet, the state-run South African rail company, enjoying a level of regional co-operation which would have been unthinkable during the apartheid years. Although co-operation over the shipments was prompted by fears in some areas of possible starvation, it is also a sign of it being more acceptable for South Africa's neighbours - Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia and Malawi - to be seen doing business with it now that a transition to democracy is under way. This raises the question of what steps South Africa should take to integrate itself formally into the region and what sort of economic assistance the international community can offer. At the heart of these issues lies one broad plank of consensus: the southern African region will prosper or perish as a unit. Although differences in wealth and resources between countries mean that there will not be an even rate of progress or failure, it is inconceivable that South Africa will flourish in splendid isolation or that its neighbours will progress without it. South Africa is well aware, in the phrase of Dr Anton Rupert, the famous tobacco entrepreneur: 'If your neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep peacefully.' Already there are 27,000 Mozambican refugees living in the eastern Transvaal, victims of drought and civil war. Refugees are also filtering into the northern Transvaal from Zimbabwe. Not only does this sort of inflow strain limited resources, but the economic fragility of South Africa's neighbours also limits what ought to be important markets. According to a study by the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI)*, Africa accounts for only 7 per cent of South Africa's exports, with a quarter of this going to Zimbabwe. Aside from trade and humanitarian concerns, regional politicians are also aware that, in an era of capital scarcity, they have a lot of work to do if they are to garner even a fraction of international capital flows, very little of which currently come to Africa. The main obstacles to foreign investment in the region are problems of political instability, economic decay and a dilapidated infrastructure. However, the recent talks between Mozambican President Joachim Chissano and rebel Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, the upcoming elections in Angola, and South Africa's transition process all represent important progress, albeit of a very fragile kind. Peace, however, is only the first step. The extent to which governments will subsequently be able to forge a framework of economic co-operation remains to be seen. The potential for regional integration is also complicated by South Africa's dominant position whereby its gross national product (GNP) exceeds the combined GNP of the 20 member countries of the two regional trade groupings  -the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the new version of SADCC - by about 40 per cent. Conventional wisdom suggests that greater economic convergence is necessary for successful integration. In their more sanguine moments, South Africa's neighbours look on it as a market for their goods, and a source of funds for projects which other international investors or governments won't fund. Underlying that, however, is an anxiety that the normalisation of South Africa's political situation may be to their disadvantage. Thus the ODI special report, which investigates the possibility of granting financial and trade privileges to South Africa, found that the most common reaction outside South Africa when the possibility of EC preferences was raised was 'incredulity'. The report finds, however, that the gains from preferential trade regimes with the EC would be small because the bulk of South Africa's exports are metals and minerals which face low barriers. The authors conclude, therefore, that since South Africa's principal economic problems are domestic, not external, foreign assistance would probably best be directed elsewhere. This thinking is likely to be consonant with the priorities of any future government, which will face overwhelming pressure to improve domestic social conditions. Trade concessions will be welcome, and regional integration may provide a warm feeling of returning to the fold, but these issues will not top any list of economic priorities. *Trading with South Africa: the policy options for the EC.

0,FT941-12258 ,"FT941-12258 _AN-EA4DIAEYFT 940131   FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (3): 'Knowledge gap' is still widening - Education shows only patchy improvement      By JOHN AUTHERS   The world's young people, in the 1990s, live in the shadow of a 'knowledge gap'. While it continues to widen, the chances of the young generation in the developing world being able to help their nations achieve lasting economic progress remain slight. The second report on world education, published at the end of last year by Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation), provides stark evidence of the gulf in educational provision between richer and poorer nations. While many nations are now making real progress, goaded by the improvements made by the Pacific Rim countries on the back of strong national training systems, other areas - particularly sub-Saharan Africa - are being left further behind. The nine most populous developing nations - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - last December demonstrated that they thought increased educational provision was the key to economic progress, and stemming population growth, by pledging to provide their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest possible moment'. Within the poorer nations, research reveals another 'gap'. In the developing world, girls are still thought unlikely to contribute economically, and receive far less education than boys. In many cases their families do not think it is worth it, thwarting any attempt by the state to improve girls' chances in life. Unesco's figures on the school life expectancy - how long a child can expect to stay in formal education - in different countries make depressing reading. Africa south of the Sahara and southern Asia suffer the greatest problems. In the Saharan nation of Niger, girls can expect to stay 1.4 years in school, while boys do scarcely better with 2.8. In Guinea, girls can only expect 1.6 years in school, while in populous Bangladesh, boys receive 5.8 years at school, compared with 4.2 for girls. In both Niger and Guinea, textbooks are available for less than 30 per cent of primary school children, and the school year is short. Comparative figures show that Canadian girls can expect 16.5 years of formal education (a year more than their brothers). Both boys and girls devote more than 15 years to formal study in the US. However, some parts of the developing world now provide as much education as member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, South Korea educates its children for an average of 13.3 years  -more than Australia, level with Japan and Sweden, and only slightly behind the UK. Several Latin American nations now have an educational life expectancy of more than a decade. Unsurprisingly, low educational provision has led to illiteracy in later life, and according to Unesco, most adults in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are illiterate. The total number of illiterate adults is still increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab states, and in southern Asia. However, the overall 'literacy gap' appears to be declining, as better-educated children in other parts of the developing world reach adulthood, and there is some confidence that much of the current disparity - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa - can be explained by the wide range of local languages. In Ethiopia, for example, the education ministry has introduced the use of four nationality languages - Oromigna, Tigrigna, Sidamigna and Wolaitigna - in primary schools, rather than the official language of Amharic. The reform should improve the standards of general education, because children will be instructed in the language they use at home, but it may be that overall literacy statistics will prove harder to compute. While problems with basic literacy and other skills may prevent emerging generations from providing the 'engine room' of increased economic output which developing countries need from them, disparities in higher education may in the short term be even more damaging. Lack of a developed higher education system critically damages competitiveness, as it becomes impossible for a nation's industrial and research and development communities to keep abreast with developments elsewhere. Most Latin American and Asian countries now have university enrolment levels which conform broadly with university entries in the OECD nations - Unesco reports show that sub-Saharan Africa is now alone in suffering from a 'higher education gap' by comparison with the rest of the world. Foreign exchange programmes account for a smaller proportion of students than they did 10 years ago, and most aid for developing countries now comes through direct aid from banks and funds. Nearly half of this goes to the Pacific Rim countries, whose education systems have already been extensively reformed. As this aid is in the form of loans which will have to be repaid by the countries which receive it, and much money has been spent on physical infrastructure and buildings, which create their own recurrent costs, it seems, still, that nobody has a clear grasp of how the 'gap' in higher education can be closed.  -------------------------------------------------------------------              PUBLIC RECURRENT EXPENDITURE PER PUPIL  ------------------------------------------------------------------- In pre-primary, first and second level education 1990  -------------------------------------------------------------------                            dollars  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub-Saharan Africa            58 E.

""My monthly pension normally lasted two weeks. The rest of the time I could  only afford bread and tea,"" she said, drawing knowing nods from the three women  sitting around her. ""And then, even when I could buy sausage, it was difficult  to prepare a meal. I live alone and need a cane, you see.""    The fare may be plain and the tables rickety, but the presence of a soup  kitchen off quiet Novoizmailovsky Prospekt in this maritime city has wrought a  small miracle in the lives of 100 elderly Soviets. It provides a free midday  meal five days a week and, perhaps as important, it offers a chance to escape  loneliness, if only for 60 minutes a day.      A Small Miracle    It also is a small miracle in the pages of Soviet history.    Ever since the founding of this Communist country 72 years ago, Soviet  officials have asserted that the state protects the social welfare of all,  preventing unemployment, poverty or homelessness.    ""To acknowledge the existence of poverty was to acknowledge that this society  has a class structure, and for obvious reasons, no one wanted to do that,"" one  American specialist in the Soviet economy said in an interview.    But now, under the leadership of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, officials are  slowly admitting that millions of people have fallen through the cracks of the  social welfare system -- and that the state can use some help from private,  voluntary organizations to cope with the problem of elderly poor.    The process, however, is slow. The problem of elderly poor exists nationwide.  Leningrad is one of the few cities where it is beginning to be addressed.    Nonetheless, the American specialist, who asked not to be identified, noted:  ""Just by saying, 'Yes, we've got a problem,' they've taken a big step forward.""      $95-a-Month Pensions    One-fifth of the Soviet population is of retirement age, and, according to  official estimates, more than one-third of the country's 58 million retirees  receive pensions of less than 60 rubles a month, or about $95 at the official  exchange rate.    Those earning less than $120 a month are considered to be living below the  Soviet poverty level, and Soviet officials privately acknowledge that as many  as 50% of the country's elderly may fall into that category.    Comparatively, 9% of the U.S. population, or 23.8 million people, are retirees  receiving Social Security, and 1.4% of the population is composed of retirees  living below the poverty level of $450 per person per month.    In the Soviet Union, however, health care and housing are subsidized, generally  costing only a few rubles a month.    Zinieda A. Lavrov, 63, is among this country's elderly poor. A former worker in  a clothing factory, she receives 52 rubles a month in pension.    To understand how that translates in daily expenses, consider that Soviet  economists estimate it costs a minimum of 30 rubles a month to feed one adult  with only bread, porridge, milk and tea.    ""My husband, a journalist in Leningrad, died of a heart attack nine years ago,  and things took a turn for the worse,"" Lavrov said in the city's soup kitchen  over a healthy serving of cabbage soup.    ""The system was not able to care for me,"" she said. ""I sold all my jewelry so I  could have food, and then I didn't know what to do. Being able to come to this  free cafeteria once a day has saved me.""    Pensions vary in the Soviet Union, but average about 45% of a person's salary  at the time of retirement. Women who have worked for at least 20 years are  eligible to receive pensions at the age of 55, and men who have worked at least  25 years are eligible at age 60.    Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, addressing the Soviet Union's newly elected  legislators last month, drew sustained applause when he promised that a first  task of the lawmaking Supreme Soviet would be to amend the 30-year-old law  regulating pensions and to provide retirees with larger monthly allowances. But  Soviet media have said the amendment, even once approved, is not expected to go  into effect until 1991.    Thus, there is a desperate need for more free cafeterias like the one in  Leningrad.      Good Use of a Free Meal    About one-quarter of Leningrad's population of 4.4 million is of retirement  age, and many of those could make good use of a free meal a day, according to  Nayalya P. Dyachenko, a founding member of the Leningrad Mercy Society, which  opened the soup kitchen.    In addition, she said, about 20,000 Leningraders are homeless and in need of  help.    ""Right now in Leningrad, there are people dying from starvation,"" she said in  an interview.    But she said that opening more soup kitchens would not be easy.    ""Our society was founded two years ago with personal approval from Comrade  Gorbachev. From the beginning, we wanted to open the soup kitchen, but we  couldn't get permission,"" she recalled.    ""The official position was that by its mere existence, the free cafeteria would  show that there are people who are hungry and people who are poor,"" she said.  ""And in our schools we are taught such people do not exist in the Soviet  Union.""      Opened With Donated Funds    City officials finally relented, and the Leningrad Mercy Society, using funds  donated by 14 professional organizations and trade unions, opened the soup  kitchen in April.    The meals change daily, but the ingredients are often the same, including  potatoes and cabbage. Dyachenko estimates that running the free cafeteria for a  year will cost the equivalent of $35,200.    ""We don't have that much money right now, but we are sending volunteers out on  the streets with jars to collect change,"" she said. ""We're determined to keep  the kitchen open.""    Poverty is not the only problem cited by the nation's elderly. Alienation is  equally pervasive, and a need for companionship draws the elderly to  Leningrad's soup kitchen as surely as hunger.    ""When I gave one woman a certificate to indicate she was entitled to free meals  at our kitchen, she looked at me quite proudly and said she would give it a try  only for a day or two,"" said Dr. Vladimir A. Lykianov, a Mercy Society  volunteer who was given the task of selecting the 100 people living in the area  of the soup kitchen and most in need of daily meals.      'She Cried With Joy'    ""When I saw her a week later, she thanked me and cried with joy. It was not the  food but the new friendships that made her so happy,"" he said.    Most elderly Soviets who live below the poverty line are those whose nearest  relatives have either died or live far away, because families in the Soviet  Union usually take care of their own. Thus, the elderly poor here frequently  have very little human contact, Lykianov said.    Meals, remembered as a time of family sharing, can be particularly lonely.    Rosa P. Solovyov, 63, with light blue eyes and a single bottom tooth, lives  alone. A typist before retiring, she receives a pension of 60 rubles a month.    ""My husband died four years ago, and everything is so quiet now that he is  gone,"" she said. ""I don't eat much at home, but it's not the money only -- I  just don't feel like eating.""    ""Nor do I,"" added 81-year-old Agenya P. Lebediv, who was sitting across the  table from Solovyov. ""I am old now. I cannot see well enough to read, and it is  hard to walk. At home I mostly lie in bed and listen to the radio.""      Almost Like the Old Days    But when they go out for their daily luncheons together, the women said, it is  almost like the old days, when they were young. They put on their best clothes  and pat their hair into place. They try to forget about aches and pains, both  physical and mental.    ""We don't dwell on the bad times here,"" said 79-year-old Leida A. Dimetriv, who  was wearing a bright red dress and a string of imitation pearls.    ""The hour we spend here is the best hour of the day,"" Dimetriv said, nodding  firmly as she gestured at the lunch tables around her filled with elderly  Leningraders. ""We may be alone. We may be poor. But while we are here, we are  merry widows.""

But  Soviet media have said the amendment, even once approved, is not expected to go  into effect until 1991.    Thus, there is a desperate need for more free cafeterias like the one in  Leningrad.      Good Use of a Free Meal    About one-quarter of Leningrad's population of 4.4 million is of retirement  age, and many of those could make good use of a free meal a day, according to  Nayalya P. Dyachenko, a founding member of the Leningrad Mercy Society, which  opened the soup kitchen.    In addition, she said, about 20,000 Leningraders are homeless and in need of  help.    ""Right now in Leningrad, there are people dying from starvation,"" she said in  an interview.    But she said that opening more soup kitchens would not be easy.    ""Our society was founded two years ago with personal approval from Comrade  Gorbachev. From the beginning, we wanted to open the soup kitchen, but we  couldn't get permission,"" she recalled.    ""The official position was that by its mere existence, the free cafeteria would  show that there are people who are hungry and people who are poor,"" she said.  ""And in our schools we are taught such people do not exist in the Soviet  Union.""      Opened With Donated Funds    City officials finally relented, and the Leningrad Mercy Society, using funds  donated by 14 professional organizations and trade unions, opened the soup  kitchen in April.    The meals change daily, but the ingredients are often the same, including  potatoes and cabbage. Dyachenko estimates that running the free cafeteria for a  year will cost the equivalent of $35,200.    ""We don't have that much money right now, but we are sending volunteers out on  the streets with jars to collect change,"" she said. ""We're determined to keep  the kitchen open.""    Poverty is not the only problem cited by the nation's elderly. Alienation is  equally pervasive, and a need for companionship draws the elderly to  Leningrad's soup kitchen as surely as hunger.    ""When I gave one woman a certificate to indicate she was entitled to free meals  at our kitchen, she looked at me quite proudly and said she would give it a try  only for a day or two,"" said Dr. Vladimir A. Lykianov, a Mercy Society  volunteer who was given the task of selecting the 100 people living in the area  of the soup kitchen and most in need of daily meals.      'She Cried With Joy'    ""When I saw her a week later, she thanked me and cried with joy. It was not the  food but the new friendships that made her so happy,"" he said.    Most elderly Soviets who live below the poverty line are those whose nearest  relatives have either died or live far away, because families in the Soviet  Union usually take care of their own. Thus, the elderly poor here frequently  have very little human contact, Lykianov said.    Meals, remembered as a time of family sharing, can be particularly lonely.    Rosa P. Solovyov, 63, with light blue eyes and a single bottom tooth, lives  alone. A typist before retiring, she receives a pension of 60 rubles a month.    ""My husband died four years ago, and everything is so quiet now that he is  gone,"" she said. ""I don't eat much at home, but it's not the money only -- I  just don't feel like eating.""    ""Nor do I,"" added 81-year-old Agenya P. Lebediv, who was sitting across the  table from Solovyov. ""I am old now. I cannot see well enough to read, and it is  hard to walk. At home I mostly lie in bed and listen to the radio.""      Almost Like the Old Days    But when they go out for their daily luncheons together, the women said, it is  almost like the old days, when they were young. They put on their best clothes  and pat their hair into place. They try to forget about aches and pains, both  physical and mental.    ""We don't dwell on the bad times here,"" said 79-year-old Leida A. Dimetriv, who  was wearing a bright red dress and a string of imitation pearls.    ""The hour we spend here is the best hour of the day,"" Dimetriv said, nodding  firmly as she gestured at the lunch tables around her filled with elderly  Leningraders. ""We may be alone. We may be poor. But while we are here, we are  merry widows.""

The  meeting starts on Thursday [2 June].    On Friday, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will host what  is expected to be the final meeting of the Frontline states, the  regional alliance of southern African nations which opposed  apartheid. Officials said leaders of the seven-nation grouping  would discuss a new organisation to replace it.    Already in Harare is Benin leader Nicephore Soglo who hosted  the previous GCA meeting in June last year. Due to arrive on  Wednesday are the heads of state of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique,  Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Ivory Coast  and Botswana, and former World Bank head Robert MacNamara and  former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.    Founded with World Bank finance and based in Washington, the  GCA was established as an alliance of African nations and  Western donor nations with close ties to the continent. It was  part of a bid to counter a shift of Western financial support  from Africa after the fall of the Communist bloc. Backers  describe it as dedicated to ""keeping alive the good news in  Africa"".    Frontline heads of state are expected to support moves to  keep the body alive in spite of the transition to democracy in  South Africa. However, the group is expected to change its  ""confrontational"" name and adopt a new direction, working for  peace and political stability in the region and to provide a  forum for conflict mediation.

An editorial by the newspaper GRANMA, official organ of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, salutes the  electoral triumph of the African National Congress (ANC) in the  South African elections which, with its victory, has crowned the  process sealed in the fierce fighting of Cuito Cuanavale in  Angola.    GRANMA says that, the historic battle and defeat suffered by  the racist army in the face of the resistance of the Angolans  and Cuban international fighters changed the correlation of  forces in South Africa and led to the current triumph of the  South African people.    Regarding the struggle and merits of ANC leader Nelson  Mandela, the paper states that when he assumes his nation's  presidency, the world will have occasion to render tribute to  his wisdom, courageous revolutionary stance, and unwavering  principles.    It can be seen in all its dimensions that the triumph  corresponds to those who struggle and the example offered must  be again appreciated. The value of this example is heightened  at this shameful moment when so many have lowered their flags  and have repented for what they once were, it states.    The newspaper criticizes the regime of racial discrimination  that existed in South Africa, noting that capitalism and  imperialism were responsible for instilling in that state the  notion of superior and inferior races.    We are proud to have been and to continue to be close  companions of arms of Nelson Mandela and of the South African  people, the GRANMA editorial concludes.     "

HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer      ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar      Pope John Paul II, starting his fifth trip to Africa as Pope, raised the  possibility Friday of a formal visit to South Africa sometime in the next year.    The issue of a papal visit to South African came up at a press conference on  the Pope's flight from Rome to Madagascar, an island nation of more than 2  million Roman Catholics, the first of four stops in nine days.    Among the stops is Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters of the anti-apartheid African  National Congress, where the pontiff is expected to make a powerful  denunciation of apartheid. The racial separation policy in South Africa is an  important obstacle to a papal visit, he indicated.    ""Speaking sociopolitically,"" the Pope said, ""we all know very well what the  moral problems are in this sphere in South Africa.""      Not Directed at Leaders    But he added that papal visits are directed at Catholics, not necessarily their  leaders, and he suggested that he would make the evil of apartheid the theme of  any visit to South Africa.    ""The Pope must be respected in his role as someone who tells the truth,"" he  said.    Vatican officials said later that John Paul expects to make two further trips  to Africa in the next year, and a stop in South Africa could be included.    In his remarks en route to Madagascar, the pontiff also made one of his  strongest statements yet on another subject he is likely to take up during this  trip -- AIDS. He said that AIDS, which in the West generally strikes  homosexuals and intravenous drug users but in Africa is largely a problem for  heterosexuals, is something that reflects the decline in the moral order of the  times.    ""It is not a case of personal blame in each instance,"" he said, ""but many times  it is.""      AIDS Affects Up to 20%    AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is estimated to affect up to 20%  of the people of Zambia and Malawi, his two final stops on this trip. Among the  more prominent victims is the son of Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.    The Pope also said he might meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  when Gorbachev travels to Italy in November. Such a meeting would be the first  between the Pope and a Soviet leader.    Meanwhile, the pontiff's arrival in Madagascar placed him squarely in the  middle of a developing political maelstrom. He landed amid a ""papal truce""  called by opposition parties whose contention that last month's presidential  election here was rigged has led to riots that left six dead and 74 injured  last week in downtown Antananarivo.    The election, which was overseen by a committee of churches, including the  Catholic Church, gave President Didier Ratsiraka his third seven-year term with  62.7% of the vote, his smallest margin ever.      Foes Charged Fraud    The opposition complained of widespread fraud and of an electoral code that  allowed Ratsiraka to schedule the vote during the rainy season, when only he  could reach remote rural districts to campaign.    At one point the government hinted that unless the opposition halted public  demonstrations, it might be forced to cancel the Pope's visit.    The opposition, led by Manandafy Rakotonarina, a key figure in the 1972  revolution that drove out the colonial French, promptly declared a treve, or  truce.    ""No politician wanted to take responsibility for the cancellation of the  visit,"" a diplomat in the capital said.    On greeting John Paul at Antananarivo's Ivato airport Friday evening, the  Jesuit-educated Ratsiraka laced into the opposition, charging them with  fomenting ""anarchy and political bad faith.""    The Pope listened impassively from his seat in the airport's VIP lounge. In his  response, he made no allusion to Madagascar politics.    Madagascar's Catholics, about 20% of the population, are slightly outnumbered  by Protestants and overwhelmed by the 55% who profess belief in animism and a  mystical brand of ancestor worship.    Elaborate tombs adorn the countryside, and the streets are often blocked by  processions of carts carrying coffins. These are not exactly funerals, but  rites in which the bodies of the dead are exhumed at regular intervals,  reclothed, and led around the neighborhood to reacquaint the dead with the  living. The Malagasy people often make decisions based on what they gather to  be their ancestors' wishes.    The Catholic Church here long ago came to terms with these beliefs. One  prominent Malagasy noted that priests, far from objecting to such rites, ""often  themselves preside at the ceremonies. They coexist very comfortably.""    In contrast, Catholics have often had an unhappy relationship with the  country's rulers and nationalists. Four priests were killed last year by what  are thought to be political groups. Three were killed the year before, among  them an Italian priest who was beheaded by a nationalist youth group that was  later disbanded.    The killings were discomfiting echoes of trying times in the past. These  included a period in the 19th Century when a Malagasy queen had Catholics flung  off the cliff behind her palace, the peaked black roof of which rises over the  site of several events scheduled in connection with the papal visit.    Still, Ratsiraka is trying harder to appeal to Catholic leaders, as he is to  other Western powers. Press censorship has been lifted for the most part, and  opposition candidates were permitted to wage unusually energetic presidential  campaigns last month.    Furthermore, the president appears to be trying to reverse more than a decade  of economic decline here by shifting his economic policies from a brand of  socialism to Western-style free enterprise.      THE POPE IN AFRICA    1 -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Madagascar on Friday, the first stop in a  9-day African tour.    2 -- May 1-2. The Pope will make an overnight call at the French island of La  Reunion in the Indian Ocean. There he will beatify a 19th-Century holy woman  and meet with French Premier Michel Rocard.    3 -- May 2-4. The Pope will be in copper-rich Zambia, where per capita income  among the 6.7 million people is less than $500 a year and the economy is  stagnant.    4 -- May 4 -- Malawi, the Pope's last stop before returning to Rome, is, like  Madagascar and Zambia, about 25% Catholic, but its president is an elder of the  Church of Scotland. Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has led Malawi since independence from  Britain in 1964. The average Malawian earns only about $200 a year.

There he will beatify a 19th-Century holy woman  and meet with French Premier Michel Rocard.    3 -- May 2-4. The Pope will be in copper-rich Zambia, where per capita income  among the 6.7 million people is less than $500 a year and the economy is  stagnant.    4 -- May 4 -- Malawi, the Pope's last stop before returning to Rome, is, like  Madagascar and Zambia, about 25% Catholic, but its president is an elder of the  Church of Scotland. Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has led Malawi since independence from  Britain in 1964. The average Malawian earns only about $200 a year.

Liberty Life, the country's largest insurance company, is leading the way with a Dollars 500m convertible bond offering. Smaller debt and equity issues are sure to follow. Last week's budget included a government overseas borrowing target of R1.8bn (Pounds 320m). Yet buying rand-denominated assets remains difficult. Despite being the world's 10th largest equity market, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is notoriously illiquid thanks to a complex web of cross-holdings. Until South African companies and institutions are free to invest overseas, equities will remain gridlocked. The financial rand - a closed pool of currency through which all inward investment must be channelled - is another hurdle. True, foreign investors enjoy exceptionally high bond yields because the financial rand trades at a discount to the domestic currency. But the closed pool restricts liquidity, making it difficult to buy and sell. These factors are likely to limit the flow of foreign investment in South Africa, however promising the economic fundamentals may seem. While the discount on the financial rand remains high, the government may be too worried about capital flight to abolish exchange controls. The danger is that the discount will not close because international investors dislike dealing in the volatile financial rand. Unless the government takes the initiative, South Africa could find itself locked into a damaging stand-off.   Companies:-  Liberty Life Association of Africa.

0,FT933-10064 ,"FT933-10064 _AN-DHFBQAA9FT 930806   FT  06 AUG 93 / A need to pedal out of poverty in Bolivia: The new president's problems in the poorest country of South America      By CHRISTINA LAMB   CROUCHED at the side of a dirt road in the 12 de Octubre market in El Alto, the working-class township on the rim of the canyon above the Bolivian capital, La Paz, with a huge pile of gnarled potatoes spread on a blanket in front of her, Mrs Celia Ticono de Medina does not think highly of economic stabilisation programmes. Wrapped against the biting Andean air, in a colourful shawl with a pink-faced baby suckling at her breast, she tips her bowler hat and opens her mouth to reveal rotting teeth, blackened from chewing coca leaves to stave off hunger. Mrs Medina, aged far beyond her 32 years, has journeyed all night on the back of a truck from the mining town of Potos to sell the potatoes for the equivalent of a few dollars, however long it takes. She has five children and is married to a miner who lost his job in 1985 during the government's radical adjustment programme, often cited as the most successful such revision carried out under democracy in Latin America. Mrs Medina is not convinced: 'You can't eat stability.' Bolivia has reduced annual inflation from 26,000 per cent to less than 10 - the lowest in South America - and is seen as a model of how to tackle hyperinflation and debt crisis in a democracy. But it also illustrates the fact that economic stability does not necessarily bring prosperity. The poorest country in the region, its return to economic growth since 1987 has barely outpaced population growth. Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the victor of the presidential election held in June, is due to be sworn in as president today - independence day. He was planning minister in 1985-89 and the main author of economic adjustment. Combating poverty and improving wealth distribution are the main challenges facing him and he has no doubt about what voters want. 'The onus is on me to get the economy moving and get money to the forgotten people,' he says. Mr Palmiro Sora Sauzedo, assistant director of Plan International, a development agency, warns: 'It's time to democratise the economy as well as politics. Otherwise that was the last vote for the free market option'. For the average Bolivian, the costs of balancing the budget have seemed more tangible than the benefits. Living costs spiralled after the government slashed subsidies and raised public sector tariffs; unemployment rose with the sacking of state employees, including 23,000 metals miners; drastic cuts in import tariffs have made life hard for local industry; the budget squeeze has hit provision of public services. According to the World Bank, Bolivia's per capita income has fallen more than 20 per cent since 1980 to Dollars 700 (Pounds 469.70) now. The rural population has been hit hardest. Bolivia has the highest percentage of rural poverty in the world, with 97 per cent of the rural population below the poverty line according to the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development, compared to 85 per cent in 1986. Also during this period, the rural population increased by 1.4m to 3.4m  - about half the country's total. Nowhere is this clearer than on the altiplano, the high Andean plain on which 70 per cent of the rural population live. Scenes of llamas grazing on the shores of Lake Titicaca, under the snow-capped Mount Illimani, look misleadingly idyllic. Here average life expectancy is 46 years, infant mortality is 172 per 1,000 live births and family income averages 72 bolivianos (Pounds 11.40) a month. Mr Sandro Calvani, head of the UN Drug Control Programme in Bolivia and former World Health Organisation representative in Africa, says, 'poverty here is worse than in Ethiopia or Burkino Faso.' He is not surprised that, for many, growing the coca leaf is the only way. Some 10 per cent of the working population is involved in the coca trade, including many former miners. Bolivia is now the second largest producer of coca after Peru (and of cocaine after Colombia), generating some Dollars 650m-Dollars 700m a year, of which some Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m stays in the country. Rather than construct a real alternative to this ancient cultivation turned drug source for the developed world, Bolivia has become highly dependent on foreign aid. By contrast, foreign investment has been deterred by dithering government in the face of strong union opposition. Exports are declining - a trade surplus of Dollars 104m in 1989 had turned into a Dollars 561m deficit last year, the worst in a decade. Mr Sanchez de Lozada denies that the adjustment programme has worsened conditions: 'That's like blaming the fireman for the fire. People forget that, from 1980 till adjustment in 1985, GNP shrank 27 per cent because of the collapse in tin prices (Bolivia's main legal export) and the debt crisis. We found a very poor country with hyperinflation and left a very poor country without hyperinflation.' He blames the last government for not building on stabilisation. 'The problem is that, since then, we've had stagnation and thus not dealt with the terrible social problems left over from the 1980s.' The new president plans an ambitious transfer of wealth through the distribution of shares in state companies worth an estimated Dollars 4,000 per person. He declares: 'Stability is like a bike. We've stabilised and must now start pedallling, otherwise we will fall.'   Countries:-  BOZ  Bolivia, South America.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0,FT922-11696 ,"FT922-11696 _AN-CDXBCABLFT 920424   FT  24 APR 92 / Leading Article: Overhauling the aid agencies   THE THIRD WORLD is confronted by a hotch-potch of agencies anxious to provide funds to encourage its development. But this ad hoc system of development lending looks increasingly ill-equipped to meet the challenges posed by the fall of communism and the shift to more market-friendly economic policies throughout the developing world. Rationalisation is required; what is needed is not fewer agencies but more clarity over their respective roles. The many institutions in this business were created at different times for different reasons; their roles have been fine-tuned over the years to deal with newly-perceived problems. Together they are responsible for loan commitments of around Dollars 40bn a year, about 60 per cent of them made by the Washington-based World Bank. Beside it are the regional development banks for Asia, Latin America, Africa and, as of last year, Europe. Since the World Bank can only lend under government guarantee, a sister institution, the International Finance Corporation, was created to encourage private sector development in part by lending to private companies. Most of the banks operate concessionary lending arms for the poorest countries and other funds for special purposes. So does the International Monetary Fund which offers cheap long-term loans for countries undergoing structural adjustment of their economies. Net recipients At present, these institutions are getting more from the developing world than they are giving - they are net recipients of resources as borrowing governments pay more in interest and repaid loans than they receive from them. Increasing the amounts to be lent would be desirable, but only under the right conditions. These would include an improved ability on the part of the lending institutions to channel money to the private sector in developing countries. The current system discriminates against governments wishing to use the private sector to develop their run-down infrastructure. That the World Bank and some of its partners can only lend to governments - and the IFC and other private-sector lending affiliates have insufficient capital - reduces the incentive for Third World states to privatise their utilities. The institutions should also play a bigger role in the alleviation of poverty and in improving the environment. The World Bank is too big and remote to address the points of detail that are crucial to the success or failure of anti-poverty programmes, such as getting the money to the people who need it. New questions There are new questions too about so-called 'conditionality', the terms under which loans from the institutions are granted. The ending of the Cold War has raised the question of how much 'political' conditionality should be introduced. Whether the existence of democracy, however defined, is an appropriate condition for lending by the IMF and World Bank remains controversial. But whatever the right answer, this conditionality should not bite too deeply. It is, for instance, not sensible for the Inter-American Development Bank to be lending for balance of payments support to a country where the IMF and World Bank are not lending; but there is no reason why it should not lend for a road or poverty-alleviation project. The regional banks do have a distinctive role to play in offering specialist and informed assistance to private sector activities, many of them quite small in scale, and in helping to promote social welfare programmes. In many fields the World Bank is already too big adequately to monitor the results of its lending. But to perform these tasks the regional development banks must strengthen their intellectual resources (an area where they compare most unfavourably with the World Bank) and move ahead with administrative reforms. The reform that is definitely not needed is the replacement of the current fractured system by one overweening development lending institution, whatever some in the World Bank may believe. There is no monopoly on good ideas or good practice.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

0,FT923-7657 ,"FT923-7657 _AN-CHSA3AAFFT 920817   FT  17 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: The riddle of The Chairman - Jerry Rawlings, president of Ghana      By JULIAN OZANNE   The World Bank may be surprised to learn that its model economic recovery programme in Africa is described as 'economic blah blah blah' by Ghana's president. Flight-Lt Jerry John Rawlings, 45, is more at home in the cockpit of a fighter-jet than articulating the principles of the structural adjustment programme which has been adopted across the continent. But, in spite of his apparent contempt for economic theories and intellectuals, Rawlings has not wavered in his political support for tough and often unpopular reforms. One of Africa's most dynamic leaders, Rawlings has ruled post-colonial Ghana, often uncomfortably, for the past 13 years - longer than anyone else. Since his first populist military coup in 1979 against a corrupt, army-led government, he has set Ghana back on the road to economic rectitude and political maturity - although not without abuses of human rights that he now refers to as 'mistakes'. He has had to confront the problems facing other parts of Africa in the 1980s: marginalisation, corruption, the fall-out from the end of the cold war and external and internal pressures for democratisation. Having presided over reform of the economy, 'JJ', or 'The Chairman' as he is known, now faces a challenge equally demanding: the transition from the authoritarian, often idiosyncratic era of military rule to a multi-party democracy, culminating in presidential elections in November this year. He is shy of publicity and foreigners and rarely gives interviews. But recently he spoke to the FT in his modest private quarters inside the whitewashed, 16th-century, Danish-built castle which is home to Ghana's presidents. The Chairman, in a checked plaid shirt, jeans and army-green Reeboks, railed against his familiar targets - the hypocrisy of the 'so-called ethics' of the US, the way the west has sponsored brutal African dictators like President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and 'the greedy consumerist attitude of Europeans' which was destroying the environment. At times, he struggled to find the words for his emotional thoughts. But in an exceptional display of candour, he revealed the qualities which have made him popular. They include his acknowledgment of 'his own limitations', his plain speaking and an element of playfulness, revealed by his production of a huge tiger's claw he cut from a tiger's skin in an Ethiopian palace. To many, Rawlings is an enigma - a firebrand socialist who has pursued one of the continent's most widely praised free-market economic reform programmes, backed by aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Since 1983 he has backed a programme of devaluation, trade liberalisation, tight fiscal and monetary policy, and large reductions in the bloated bureaucracy. These policies have given Ghana an average real growth rate of 5 per cent a year, reduced inflation from an annual rate of 123 per cent in 1983 to 18 per cent last year, restored confidence and stimulated investment and the return of millions of dollars held overseas by Ghanaian nationals. Debt arrears of USDollars 600m were erased by 1990. Part of the answer to the Rawlings riddle lies in the fact that he has been shrewd enough to ensure that management of the economy, which he admits he does not fully understand, has been left to technocrats led by Dr Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, and including Dr Joe Abbey, the ambassador to Washington. 'They are workers but they like to call themselves advisors,' Rawlings jokes. He has also shown a political commitment to reform. Rawlings believes that in Africa the alleviation of poverty can be achieved only through a lean, free-market economy, backed, at least in the short-term, by western aid. Classical structural adjustment policies of devaluation, free-market liberalisation and cutting of subsidies have redistributed wealth and promoted growth. They have released state resources for education, health and infrastructure, and shifted the terms of trade in favour of rural farmers who make up most of the population. Rawlings said common sense dictated that he support economic reform. 'What we are aiming for is the humanising of capitalism . . . We have only done what is common sense to the ordinary person. Oppressed, poor people don't have to be told by foreigners and intellectuals about corruption, the price they have paid for their cocoa or bringing clean water to their villages.' This commitment to 'the people', combined with a reputation unsullied by charges of corruption, has made the programme one of the most successful in the continent. Rawlings' support for free-market policies, however, remains qualified, and he stresses that colonialism and the inequities of the international economic order remain powerful constraints on Africa's development. He also frequently lashes out at the west, complaining about the way Africa has become marginalised and 'ripped-off' by some foreign companies. Many question whether, with these views, Rawlings can deepen the limited successes of the reform programme, and move it forward to the next critical level. This requires a commitment to the private sector and foreign investment which would create self-sustainable growth without dependence on foreign aid. In three months Rawlings will return the country to civilian rule for a second time. So far, he has remained mute over whether he will be a presidential candidate. 'I have left it to God for guidance. That's what I tell the diplomats anyway,' he said, chuckling. However, having once before wrested the country back from an incompetent civilian administration, he hopes that Ghanaians will avoid being being badly served by politicians again. 'The people have become a lot more defiant. You can't fool the people any more with sweet promises. Thank God for it. The politicians would be better talking about the reality of hardship ahead which faces us, instead of trying to con people.' If Rawlings decides to run against as-yet undeclared opponents, he will face severe criticism of his human rights record, which includes executions, kidnappings, arbitrary detention without trial and confiscation of property. The Chairman admits that human rights abuses have been committed during the past decade, but he says he is genuinely sorry for past excesses. 'The humanity of our revolution is that the politicians can come back and smear us. In the French revolution, they were beheaded. Our crime is our humanity.' This humanity is best illustrated by his background and character, rather than by his erratic and flamboyant economic and political philosophy. He recalled his childhood on the streets of Accra, where he got into 'a lot of scrapes and whenever I heard a police siren my heart started pounding because I thought they were coming to get me'. During the interview, he prowled around his study, which has two televisions so he can get CNN, C-Span and watch videos about acrobatic and formation jet-flying, his first recreational passion. But his ferocity crumbled as he got up to hug his wife and children and listen to a little lecture from Mrs Rawlings about kicking his heavy smoking habit. Throughout his rule, he says, he has managed to make sure 'the office doesn't take away my personal freedom'. His bedroom is like a small workshop with tools spread out for building radio-controlled model aircraft. A punch bag hangs next to the dining table. He has made time for regular complex flying exercises, riding motorbikes and scuba-diving. Flying, he says, is the 'ultimate challenge' and 'anybody who does not enjoy these things does not get the best out of life'. If he stands and is defeated in the forthcoming elections, he says he will have to search for a job because 'I have no money'. But he says he might like to write a book on social psychology or become a preacher to continue his campaign against injustice.

The significance of the encounter ""extends well beyond  the formal reason for the calling of the meeting--the crisis in  Lesotho. In effect it amounted to a historic act of  reconciliation between South Africa and the Frontline states, of  which Mugabe is the chairman. It also signaled South Africa's  return to the regional fold, where it is bound to become a major  power.

""It was a brief meeting between the two South  Africans, the presidents of Zimbabwe and Botswana and the deputy  prime minister of Lesotho, but it was loaded with symbolism and  promise. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe is current chairman  of the Frontline States. He and Botswana President Quett Masire  are prominent members of the Southern African Development  Community (SADC), while both countries and Lesotho are members  of the Commonwealth, whose secretariat was consulted. The  regional linkages were clear, deliberate and relevant: South  Africa was being asked by other African states to help resolve a  regional problem."" This first meeting between Mugabe and De  Klerk ""should presage more amicable relations, both now and  after the April election. Doors are opening further afield,  too: the next government will be invited to rejoin the  Commonwealth and this week's events may help influence opinions  on both sides.""    SOWETAN    Botswana Meeting Platform for De Klerk To Meet  Mugabe--Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 January in a  page-10 editorial says many people must be ""disappointed at the  outcome of the meeting"" in Botswana between President Masire,  President Mugabe and President de Klerk concerning Lesotho's  military crisis. ""Here were three presidents who listened to a  presentation by Lesotho's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Selometse  Baholo, and then appointed a task force to investigate the issue  further. Why not act on the information provided by Baholo?""  This ""vacillation must stop if the Lesotho crisis is not to  develop into a major regional crisis. Unless the purpose of the  meeting was not to discuss Lesotho, but to provide a platform  for F.W. de Klerk to meet Mugabe before his term expires.

Its MPs ""will be subject to ANC discipline and the  orders of ANC parliamentary whips. If they vote against ANC  orders, they will lose their seats.

Addressing the World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, Mr  de Klerk told international business leaders that South Africa  would be foolish if it ""precipitately tore out the stitches from  wounds which are only now beginning to heal"".    But Mr Mbeki, speaking from the same platform, said his  sister-in-law was still looking for her unionist husband who had  disappeared without trace in Durban about seven years ago. ""We  are trying to find him and we are hoping somewhere in South  Africa there is somebody who knows what happened, who will come  and say I am sorry...because of the particular times in which we  were, we took him and because of who he was and what he was  doing, given those times, unfortunately we got rid of him.  That's why you can't find him. Because then his wife and two  children can at last say he is dead and do whatever custom and  tradition demand they do in the circumstances. It's that kind  of truth, (Deputy) President de Klerk, that we are looking for.""  His sister-in-law could then become part of the process of  national reconciliation, Mr Mbeki added.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk said South Africa had to be very  careful  how it approached sensitive questions relating to the past,  particularly with regard to amnesty, indemnity and the truth  commission. ""We agree that processes have to be developed to  put the political crimes of the past behind us once and for all,  that the wounds of the past must be healed. But such a process  cannot be allowed to develop into a tug of war or even a running  sore which might continue to suppurate for years."" The reality,  he said, was that during the past conflict, unacceptable crimes  were committed by followers of all sides and factions. ""We have  just completed four years of hard negotiation aimed at resolving  that conflict. We would be foolish if we precipitately tore out  the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal.""    Mr de Klerk also said it was important that South Africa  ""build well"" and not make basic errors that could weaken its  national structure in the future. He had no problem with  affirmative action, but the country should be very careful about  the way it implemented such programmes, and dared not throw  merit out of the window. ""Instead of drifting into new  state-sponsored discrimination against some members of our  society, we should redouble our efforts to remove any vestiges  of discrimination against any South African.""    Other issues that would have to be handled with sensitivity  and care were land ownership, financial discipline, the size of  the civil service and the funding of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme.

0,FT933-5763 ,"FT933-5763 _AN-DIAB3AGHFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (10): An optimistic outlook - Stock markets      By TONY HAWKINS   PROBABLY there is more optimism and enthusiasm about stock market development in Africa than about any other aspect of the business landscape. The strong rebound in Latin American markets since the end of the 1980s shows what could happen in sub-Saharan Africa as reform programmes take hold. Zimbabwe's experience is a case in point. Reforms introduced mid-year, including reduced taxes and guaranteed free exit for dividends and disinvestment proceeds, saw the ZSE index rise more than 50 per cent, driven by an influx of more than Dollars 2m in foreign money. Initiatives from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private investment agencies will boost the sector. In mid-1991, there were no funds operating in the region, but in the past two years, a number have been established, most notably the Africa Growth Fund (a venture capital vehicle), the Commonwealth Equity Fund, the Emerging Markets Fund and the Mauritius Fund, while London-based Genesis Emerging Markets Fund has minor African holdings. Also active in the fund field is the Wall Street-based Aidoo group, headed by a Ghanaian American, Judith Aidoo, which earlier in the year formed an investment advisory arm, Aidoo Group Asset Management. AGAM plans to market African fixed-interest and equity securities to US investors. Initially, it is using a niche market approach seeking to interest expatriate Africans living in the US and elsewhere in investing back home, while also targeting black Americans. The fund, of about Dollars 20m to Dollars 30m is likely to be followed by a purely equity fund at a later stage. South Africa comes into the picture here too, with scope for reversing the sanctions process of pension funds and institutional investors that divested from the country during the sanctions era. Ms Aidoo is also developing innovative ways of tapping into privatisation and debt restructuring financings. One of these involves linking the Clinton administration's proposed 'Russia Fund', designed to finance Russian privatisation, with debt relief for African countries that owe money to the Russians. Angola, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia together owe the former Soviet Union some Dollars 14bn. She suggests that Russia should sell its African debt to western donors in the G-7 group at deep discounts. The Aidoo group puts the market value of African debt owed to Russia at no more than 10c in the dollar. So a Pounds 1bn Russia privatisation fund could purchase Dollars 10bn of the total Dollars 14bn African debt owed to Russia. The purchasers could then either cancel the debt outright or use it for debt-for-nature or debt-equity swaps. Debt trade is also a growing area. The Aidoo group estimates the outstanding debt paper at around Dollars 180bn - or almost 30 per cent of the global market in emerging market debt - covering 60 to 70 issues with an annual turnover of some Dollars 13bn. Prices range up to 50 per cent of nominal value, but the average is lower at around 15 per cent. This year, Salomon Brothers in New York calculated Nigerian par bonds were the highest yielding collateralised Brady bond paper in the market, offering a yield of some 15 per cent compared with 9.3 per cent for Mexico. But the fundamental need is the return of sub-Saharan Africa's 'stock' of flight capital, which may exceed 80 per cent of GDP, according to the World Bank calculations. Only after Africans show themselves willing to invest in their own countries will foreigners follow.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.     ZWZ  Zimbabwe, Africa.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Speaking  at a press conference at the World Economic Forum summit in Cape  Town he said the African National Congress' economics department  and Finance Minister Derek Keys believed the controls should be  lifted as soon as possible. The way South African Business  responded to the political transition was going to be a key  determinant of this.    Mr Manuel welcomed their response to the programme and their  willingness to establish a fund for it. ""I think political  certainty will also see more investment by South African  corporations in new opportunities. All that will hasten the  date by which we will be able to announce the lifting of  exchange controls. It is a matter under discussion.""    Vice-chairman of the United States-based Citicorp and  Citibank Bill Rhodes told journalists he was ""very impressed""  with the realism of the new government. South Africa needed to  demonstrate it would continue to show fiscal and monetary  discipline to obtain a positive credit rating in international  markets. He said Citicorp had recently been granted a licence  to open a representative office in South Africa and hoped to be  able to do so in the next few months. It was already allocating  funds to trade finance facilities. He sensed a strong  recognition by the South African Government that they needed to  maintain the balance between economic reforms and providing  social necessities.    Mr Manuel said funds raised by merchant banks in the US for  investment in South Africa had done exceedingly well. ""They've  surpassed expectations. That must say something about the way  people are reading the moment in South Africa.""     "

Officials said millions of people will be affected, AP reports from Washington. Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import substantial quantities of grain. As the drought persists, estimates of the grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously. The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the continent's overall food crisis. The north-east is the most deprived area in Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The lives of 15m people are thought to be at risk. Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come soon. The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that the drought could lead to widespread famine. About 98m people live in the affected regions in southern Africa. 'Considerable donor assistance will be needed to avert a major humanitarian crisis in the region,' the US State Department said last week.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The dream has ended. A year after having served as the site  of the UN Conference on Environment and Development, Brazil is  confronting the most insidious type of attack on the  environment: the tragedy of poverty. Diseases considered  eradicated, such as cholera and leprosy, are returning, exposing  a reality quite different from the ideals of a healthy life  preached at Rio-92. The Brazilian basic sanitation system is a  failure, and has caused the country to spend billions of dollars  to combat illnesses that could easily have been avoided with a  mere supply of sewers and clean water.    According to the health expert, Paulo Buss, vice president  of  education and training at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Fiocruz,  Brazil's poverty is responsible for the resurgence of five of  the world's seven oldest plagues: malaria, leprosy,  leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and cholera. He claims that the  deeper the Brazilian recession, the larger the number of  inhabitants vulnerable to these diseases becomes. According to  the Fiocruz studies, malaria has already reached the level of  530,000 cases per year, concentrated in the States of Amazonas  and Para. Tuberculosis, on the other hand, has totaled 80,000  cases, distributed throughout the entire territory.    Although it failed to evoke the interest of Brazilian  diplomats, the problem was not ignored at the 1992 meeting. In  the Health Charter, the principal document produced at the  parallel conference on environment, health, and development,  health specialists from all over the world warned of the  relationship between the inequitable income in Brazil and short  life expectancy at birth. They claimed that the high perinatal  and infant mortality rate could be explained by the difficulty  in gaining access to quality preventive and remedial health  services.    The cholera epidemic is another example of this  relationship.  Studies show that most of the 8,000 cases reported this year  affected the population group earning less than two minimum  wages. The health experts explain why poverty is an ecological  problem as well: ""Both extreme poverty and extreme wealth are  associated with predatory use of natural resources, resulting in  dissipation, pollution, and environmental deterioration.""  According to the document, hasty solutions almost always have  ephemeral results, often ultimately causing new problems even  more difficult to solve.    Brazil is the champion of ephemeral solutions. During the  year of Rio-92, the public sector spent nearly $11 billion in an  attempt to cure the immense contingent of sick Brazilians. Over  560 billion cruzeiros were spent on consultations at hospitals  and health stations run by the federal, state, or municipal  governments, resulting in 13.6 million hospital confinements.    In 80 percent of the consultations and 65 percent of the  hospital confinements, the fundamental cause of the gigantic  first-aid facility that Brazil has become is just one: the lack  of basic sanitation. It is estimated that, each year, the  government spends $2.5 million treating illnesses directly  caused by the extremely bad conditions under which most of the  Brazilian population lives.    A summary of the poverty (of which hunger is only one  component) may be observed in a survey conducted by the  Brazilian Association of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering,  ABES: 92 percent of Brazil's municipalities lack sewage  treatment; 59 percent have no final destination for waste; and  50 percent are without treated water.    In the Northern region, where diarrheas rank first on the  list of diseases with the highest mortality rate, only 2.24  percent of the population is served by the sewer system. In  Amazonas, only the capital, Manaus, has the system, and yet it  is still without suitable treatment.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sewer Systems in Brazil                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Area                     |Municipalities with sewa-|Municipalities with sewa-|  |                         |ge collection systems (i-|ge treatment (in percent)|  |                         |n percent)               |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brazil                   |47                       |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |North                    |8                        |2                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northeast                |26                       |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Southeast                |91                       |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |South                    |39                       |7                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |West-Central             |13                       |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: IBGE [Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]/ National Sur-|  |vey on Basic Sanitation                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------       "

In 1980, manufacturing value added (MVA) in sub-Saharan Africa totalled Dollars 12bn - 0.4 per cent of the global total if South Africa is excluded, or Dollars 30.5bn (1.1 per cent) including South Africa. Ten years later, in 1990, the region's share had slipped to 0.9 per cent; though if South Africa is left out, it remained at 0.4 per cent. By 1980, it had become clear that misguided, if well-intentioned, attempts to promote industrialisation had saddled the continent with a battery of inefficient, internationally uncompetitive manufacturing firms, many owned by governments. Since then, structural adjustment measures - especially trade liberalisation, tariff reform, exchange rate devaluation, deregulation, positive real interest rates and privatisation - have changed the rules of the game. Industries that grew up behind tariff walls and import controls - many of which should never have been established - were thrown into the deep end of global competition. Macroeconomic stability aside, the most important single factor in industrial adjustment has been establishing - and sustaining - competitive exchange rates. Given the size of the domestic market and high inflation, substantial devaluation has been necessary to re-establish competitiveness in both domestic and export markets. Also crucial is the simplification of import regimes to ensure that manufacturers importing raw materials or parts do not face bureaucratic hurdles and heavy import taxes. Critics of structural adjustment claim that the reform package implies de-industrialisation, destroying domestic capacity and favouring imports. World Bank researchers insist that there is no evidence for this, pointing out that in nine countries where macropolicies improved, manufacturing output grew substantially faster than before adjustment. Ultimately, though, there is only so much policymakers can achieve. Thereafter, it is up to private initiative and investment, which is where the problem arises. Abundant raw materials and low-cost labour are no longer enough. Technical and managerial skills, scientific and marketing know-how, prompt deliveries and high-quality products are essential, achieved primarily by foreign investment by global companies. In 1990, for instance, Singapore's manufacturing output was almost half that of the entire African continent, due in large part to the presence of some 3,000 affiliates and subsidiaries of multinationals. Unido figures show African productivity levels at about one tenth of those of north American manufacturers - the comparative figure for Asia is 18 per cent. But because average wages in Africa are less than 9 per cent of the north American level, as against 16 per cent in Asia, sub-Saharan producers still have a competitive edge on cost grounds. However, this is not enough; the key role of human capital cannot be exaggerated. In the 20 years to 1990, Africa's productivity rate - relative to north America - fell from 16 per cent to 10.5 per cent, while Asia raised productivity to 18 per cent from 12 per cent. But the most important factor in productivity is the region's low levels of investment in physical plant and in human capital. Government policy will help but the turnround in African industry will depend on the return of the foreign investors. So long as they remain scarce, so too will Africa's industrial capacity.

The Azerbaijani economy is in a crisis condition; those  citizens who live only on wages have dropped below the poverty  line. There is no need to comment in detail on the tricky social  and political problems such poverty has caused or may cause. If  the impoverishment of the masses continues at the present rate,  it will eliminate all opportunities for the democratic  development of society and our Motherland's defense capabilities.    The deepening economic crisis and further impoverishment of  the population are processes that run in parallel and are  interrelated. The exacerbation of the economic crisis in  Azerbaijan is caused by both objective and subjective factors.  At the same time, the currently adopted contradictory decisions  are a sign of vagueness of the strategic line in the economy.    Periodic wage increases for the purpose of neutralizing the  tricky problems of impoverishment in the end do not solve the  problem, since the pace of wage increases lags far behind the  pace of increases in the cost of living. Thus, the main burden  of economic decline falls on the shoulders of the low-income  strata of the population, while the persons and state bodies  whose responsibility it is to avert the crisis apparently are  relieved of the need to conduct a firm economic policy. This  situation cannot continue for long, however.    While expressing our concern in connection with the current  situation, we believe it necessary to implement the law on wage  indexation for the purpose of averting a further worsening of  the population's standard of living. This law by itself cannot  help to improve the material situation of those living on earned  wages. By setting up a mechanism for its implementation, it is  possible to freeze the current difficult material situation of  the workers and avert a further worsening of it. If we begin to  implement this law, the persons and structures currently  shirking their responsibility for governing at the expense of a  decline in the popular standard of living will be forced to  conduct decisive, well-thought-out, comprehensive political  reforms.

C. Tsai]    [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African  police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental  Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan  diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade.    Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection  Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said  the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's  National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU  on wildlife protection.    None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved  in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said.    Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been  interviewed by the EIA.    The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to  express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In  addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation  group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations.    During a meeting of nongovernment organizations (NGO)  following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva  Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South  African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino  horns.    A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a  diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of  the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body.    The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in  February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was  found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued  by the South African Government.    Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing  Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.     "

KINNEY and HOWARD FRUMKIN, Joseph A. Kinney is executive director  of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago. Howard Frumkin, a director  of the institute, is on the faculty of the Medical School of the University of  Pennsylvania.      Dangerous work is a major contributing factor to poverty in America. Most  people assume that workers' compensation, insurance and lawsuits take care of  families when injuries, fatalities or disease strike. The reality is much  different.    Families often experience a sharp reduction in income when injury from  dangerous work strikes, prematurely ending careers. For example, workers'  compensation supplies at best two-thirds of a worker's historic (average of the  last two years) earnings, and usually provides far less. Meanwhile, benefits  such as health insurance may be lost, imposing drastic new expenses on the  family.    America needs to understand the scope of this problem and how it came about.  Before 1911, a work-related injury or disease was considered the fault of the  worker. In the following decade, most state governments passed workers'  compensation programs, a no-fault insurance scheme that covered medical  expenses and lost wages when workers were injured.    These programs had a significant unintended consequence: They tended to  legitimate worker injury by ""taking care of it"" with modest compensation  payments. In other words, some injury was accepted because compensation,  however meager, was available. Employers' insurance costs could be comfortably  predicted and made a part of each year's budget. Business as usual prevailed.    Workers' compensation programs were adopted in an era when workplace accidents  were widely recognized, but occupational diseases were nearly invisible. Since  then, through tragedy after tragedy, we have been reminded that black lung,  asbestosis, silicosis, lead poisoning, cancer and other diseases may begin with  workplace exposures. But there are many barriers to workers' compensation for  diseases, and it is estimated that less than 10% of serious disease cases are  currently compensated. Many deserving workers simply go without.    Even for those who receive workers' compensation, the payments are likely to be  inadequate. In fact, families experiencing the temporary or permanent loss of a  breadwinner in the 1980s are probably worse off than those who experienced a  comparable loss in the 1970s. Workers' compensation payments are tied to the  victim's wages, and real wages of middle- income Americans have declined during  the last decade. Sixty percent of a machinist's wage today buys less than 60%  of a machinist's wage 15 years ago. Further, unrealistic caps on compensation  -- typically ranging between $200-$250 a week -- often impose limits that  assure absolute poverty for many families.    Moreover, the availability of lawsuits as a remedy has greatly diminished in  recent years. Responding to the alleged liability crisis, state legislatures  have imposed low wrongful death caps and greater restrictions such as  comparative negligence requirements. In many states, lawsuits arising from  dangerous workplace incidents have dropped from a trickle to a halt.    The magnitude of this problem is not small. Studies at the Mount Sinai School  of Medicine in New York show that as many as 70,000 men and women die of  occupational disease each year. According to the National Safety Council,  11,000 men and women die from traumatic workplace accidents each year. Another  70,000 workers are permanently disabled. We believe that 50,000 more  individuals will be disabled and off the payrolls for at least six months this  year.    Based on demographic patterns, we can estimate that at least half of the total  -- or at least 100,000 -- disabled men and women will have dependents, and that  the majority of them will suffer a substantial decline in income after losing a  breadwinner.    This problem has not come cheap to the public. Congress has partly addressed  the problem by tapping Social Security -- robbing Peter to pay Paul. Working  with government analysts, we estimate that workplace accidents and diseases  cost the Social Security Trust Fund $7.65 billion in fiscal 1988. This Band-Aid  strategy, while helpful to some workers, simply transfers the costs of  dangerous workplaces from employers to taxpayers.    It is terribly wrong for a family that suffers one tragedy to suffer another.  Two solutions are needed. First, we need better ways to compensate workers who  become injured or ill while on the job. Workers' compensation must be expanded  to cover illnesses, must provide adequate wage replacement and must be  streamlined to achieve prompt payments. Other strategies, such as insurance  mechanisms, litigation and service programs, must be considered.    A second key element is the prevention of workplace injuries and accidents. As  we come to understand the nature and costs of the problem, we must apply this  understanding to research, risk assessment and enforcement of strong health and  safety standards. By addressing the problem on the front end, we can reduce the  contribution of dangerous workplaces to suffering and poverty in America.

Pictures crowded the walls of her living room, a memorial to a past  life. A copy of the Lord's Prayer hung above the door. Artificial flowers,  faded with age, decorated the coffee table.    A few hundred miles from Daisy's place, down the coast in Columbia, S.C.,  69-year-old Mattie Collins lived in a tired old house on the edge of town. She  moved there after being evicted from her apartment 3 months before. Health  problems, a son-in-law who stole from her and a string of bad luck drove her  into poverty.    Daisy and Mattie represent just two of the 8.3 million older Americans who live  alone. More than 40% live at or near the poverty line. Most of the elderly poor  receive only enough help from social workers and volunteers to survive --  occasional visits from social workers or home health aides, a meal a day from  Meals on Wheels or a few dollars' worth of food stamps.    Elderly women make up 80% of those who live alone. While Social Security and  Medicare have helped to halve the poverty rate among senior citizens over the  past 25 years, millions remain destitute.    Daisy Thomas and Mattie Collins recently gave a visitor a glimpse into this  world.    Daisy's hands shook and her voice wavered as she spoke about growing old and  living alone in a city that she once loved. Her neighborhood, where children  once played in the streets, is now home to drugs, poverty and violence.    ""Sure, I'm afraid of being robbed. I got my Social Security check stolen right  out from under me one day,"" she said, her eyes filled with fear, as if the  incident had just happened. ""I had just cashed my check and that boy grabbed  most of it and I never saw him again. Getting old is not for everyone.""    After the robbery -- which took place nearly a year ago -- she kept the  dead-bolts on her front door locked tight.    ""When you get robbed, that's it. Nobody is there to return it to you. You just  have to get by on what's left.""    To her visitor, it seemed hot in her cramped living room, but to Daisy, it  still felt cold. Her eyes wandered nervously around the room, reflecting the  discomfort she felt having someone there. She didn't want people to know how  poor she really was.    ""I hate to ask people for money, but if you get hungry enough, you'll ask,"" she  said.    Two days after that conversation, Daisy died, alone in her final moments just  as she had been in the final years of her life.    Daisy, who suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic heart  failure, survived on a Social Security check and some food stamps. Not much was  left after she paid her rent and utility bills.    And she received little outside help. Underfinanced and short-staffed, the  nearby office on aging could only afford to send someone by once every 8 weeks  to tell her she was still on the waiting list for a home-care program.    In a deteriorating neighborhood in Columbia, Mattie slowly ate the meal  delivered once a day by the local office on aging, pretending not to notice the  cockroaches crawling on her TV tray and couch.    ""I don't want to sound like a preacher,"" she said quietly, ""but people  shouldn't be treated like this.

Wire    "," LA061490-0209   233672    June 14, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition      View; Part J; Page 12; Column 1      740 words      MOST OF THE ELDERLY WHO LIVE ALONE IN POVERTY ARE WOMEN      From Times Wire Services      In a tiny apartment in a run-down Philadelphia neighborhood, Daisy Thomas lived  alone. Pictures crowded the walls of her living room, a memorial to a past  life. A copy of the Lord's Prayer hung above the door. Artificial flowers,  faded with age, decorated the coffee table.    A few hundred miles from Daisy's place, down the coast in Columbia, S.C.,  69-year-old Mattie Collins lived in a tired old house on the edge of town. She  moved there after being evicted from her apartment 3 months before. Health  problems, a son-in-law who stole from her and a string of bad luck drove her  into poverty.    Daisy and Mattie represent just two of the 8.3 million older Americans who live  alone. More than 40% live at or near the poverty line. Most of the elderly poor  receive only enough help from social workers and volunteers to survive --  occasional visits from social workers or home health aides, a meal a day from  Meals on Wheels or a few dollars' worth of food stamps.    Elderly women make up 80% of those who live alone. While Social Security and  Medicare have helped to halve the poverty rate among senior citizens over the  past 25 years, millions remain destitute.    Daisy Thomas and Mattie Collins recently gave a visitor a glimpse into this  world.    Daisy's hands shook and her voice wavered as she spoke about growing old and  living alone in a city that she once loved. Her neighborhood, where children  once played in the streets, is now home to drugs, poverty and violence.    ""Sure, I'm afraid of being robbed. I got my Social Security check stolen right  out from under me one day,"" she said, her eyes filled with fear, as if the  incident had just happened. ""I had just cashed my check and that boy grabbed  most of it and I never saw him again. Getting old is not for everyone.""    After the robbery -- which took place nearly a year ago -- she kept the  dead-bolts on her front door locked tight.    ""When you get robbed, that's it. Nobody is there to return it to you. You just  have to get by on what's left.""    To her visitor, it seemed hot in her cramped living room, but to Daisy, it  still felt cold. Her eyes wandered nervously around the room, reflecting the  discomfort she felt having someone there. She didn't want people to know how  poor she really was.    ""I hate to ask people for money, but if you get hungry enough, you'll ask,"" she  said.    Two days after that conversation, Daisy died, alone in her final moments just  as she had been in the final years of her life.    Daisy, who suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic heart  failure, survived on a Social Security check and some food stamps. Not much was  left after she paid her rent and utility bills.    And she received little outside help. Underfinanced and short-staffed, the  nearby office on aging could only afford to send someone by once every 8 weeks  to tell her she was still on the waiting list for a home-care program.    In a deteriorating neighborhood in Columbia, Mattie slowly ate the meal  delivered once a day by the local office on aging, pretending not to notice the  cockroaches crawling on her TV tray and couch.    ""I don't want to sound like a preacher,"" she said quietly, ""but people  shouldn't be treated like this. You work hard all your life and then you get to  the point where you can't do it anymore.""    From a wheelchair in her cold, empty living room, she told of being evicted by  her last landlord without even a chance to move her belongings.    ""They threw away all of my things,"" she said.

In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ortega noted actions carried  out by Nicaraguans in 1993 in support of their Cuban brothers,  stressing the importance of these actions in light of existing  poverty in that Central American country.    Amid poverty that affects 70 percent of the population, with  more than six of 10 citizens unemployed and suffering the  effects of the neoliberal policy of the Violeta Barrios  government for the past three years, our people generously  showed their solidarity, Ortega said.    He added that people from the humblest neighborhoods and  towns, patients who received free medical treatment in Cuba,  professionals and technicians trained in that contry, and  relatives of others now in Cuba on scholarship participated in  the campaigns to collect milk and food for the children and  people of that heroic Caribbean nation.    In addition, he said, thousands who have never been to Cuba  but who completely identify with the people of Jose Marti also  participated.    As an organization, the Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN) actively participated in these efforts, guiding its  militants and followers to strengthen the solidarity committees  in all departments and permanently condemning the blockade on  Cuba at all international forums.    Ortega added that in its relations with the Nicaraguan  Government, the FSLN obtained from President Barrios official  support for transferring the collected food and has always  insisted on the need to maintain normal diplomatic relations  with Havana, despite pressures.    During the past three years, he stressed, there have been  campaigns to have Nicaragua break relations with Cuba and  withdraw its embassy in that country. In countering those  campaigns, the FSLN has maintained a permanent struggle with the  government -- although in silence, understandably -- to prevent  our country from participating in the isolation of the island.    In Central America, Ortega stressed, the FSLN carried out  actions in 1993 to counter U.S. pressures to have the Cuban  issue included in presidential summit agendas.    Ortega said that after the signing of the Salvadoran peace  agreements Washington should contribute to detente in Latin  America by lifting the blockade of the Cuban revolution, which  is the desire of most nations as expressed during the past two  UN General Assemblies.

General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with praise during his visit, the first by a South African leader. He said Mr de Klerk deserved a place alongside the most famous black South African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric. These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian, given the open hostility which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades. But Gen Babangida went beyond rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation. Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in South Africa, likely within months. Reconciliation with South Africa may prove the largest foreign affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a civilian government at end of the year. Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis which they hope will give the continent new clout in international relations. There were protestations of African brotherhood from both, each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two superpowers.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

This policy, called  the ""New Frontier Program,"" aims to provide comprehensive  assistance to southern African nations, which are attracting  much global interest, so as to improve the economic situation of  the whole region on the occasion of RSA's achieving the  historical change from white domination to multiracial  coexistence. Japan especially aims to stress the expanded  range of its international contribution, which tends to be  regarded as ""Asian-oriented.""    Providing ODA to the RSA has been allowed since 1990 only  for  the purpose of helping black citizens to become self-reliant.  However, by the end of 1992, Japan had only provided about 100  million yen in small-scale grants and technical cooperation.    Following the new administration's inauguration, it is  expected that larger assistance will be needed in the future.  Therefore, Japan wants to positively extend cooperation in the  form of loans and other aid on the premise that the OECD's  Development Assistance Committee will designate RSA as a  qualified recipient of assistance.    With regard to Mozambique, Japan has already decided to  provide it with full-fledged ODA in the form of bilateral  assistance, while also participating in UN Peacekeeping  Operations. Japan is now studying details of the plan.  Moreover, in light of the establishment of the new  administration in the RSA, Japan will expand its assistance  program to cover Botswana, where the Southern African  Development Community's secretariat is located, so that Japan  can carry out comprehensive assistance. Japan provided  Mozambique with about $200 million in bilateral assistance from  1988 to 1992, and Botswana with about $5 million from 1987 to  1992.     "

0,FT941-10902 ,"FT941-10902 _AN-EBGC7AFBFT 940207   FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (25): Continent of hazard and opportunity - Africa      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Which of the world's emerging markets can boast an investment fund where a Dollars 1,000 stake a year ago has risen to nearly Dollars 1,500? Surprisingly, the answer is Africa. Even more surprising, the country concerned is Nigeria, where the economic reform programme has collapsed  - but a shrewd purchase of Nigerian debt is paying off for investors. The New York-based International Asset Transactions decided in 1992 that Nigerian promissory notes (issued in the mid 1980s to clear Dollars 4.2bn in trade arrears) and par bonds (which discounted commercial bank debt at 40 cents to the dollar in a 1991 settlement with the London Club) were underpriced. Gus Udo and Donna Young of IAT noted that servicing these deals cost Nigeria comparatively little - around 14 days a year of the country's 1.4m-barrel daily production of oil. They reckoned that no sensible government would alienate the banks and the trading houses by defaulting on the terms of the two settlements. So, in January 1993 they launched the Nigeria Emerging Market Fund, an open-end mutual fund registered in the Cayman Islands, with about two thirds in Nigeria Central Bank promissory notes and most of the balance in Brady par bonds. The results have been remarkable. Behind the general view that Africa's debt instruments are generally undervalued lies a fundamental reappraisal of the continent's prospects. 'Africa is poised for growth,' declares Morgan Stanley, which has launched a Dollars 40m Africa Investment Fund. Its bullish 50 - page appraisal of the continent argues that the economic and political reforms under way for the best part of a decade are coming good. Prices for the region's exports such as cocoa, coffee, gold are recovering, and industrial metals are bottoming. Africa, argues the report, which includes a useful guide to the dozen stock markets operating and the 20 others being developed, 'harbours undervalued assets, particularly in the natural resource and manufacturing sectors'. 'Where stock markets are up and running,' says Morgan Stanley, 'investors can find attractively priced issues, both on a price-earnings and price-to-book basis.' By international standards the African market - excluding South Africa, which ranks just outside the world's top 10 - is tiny. Its exchanges have a combined market capitalisation of around Dollars 12bn compared to India's Dollars 91bn. Nevertheless, the belief in the resurgence of Africa's fortunes, led by hopes for a thriving post apartheid South Africa, has caught the imagination of international fund managers. Mr Miles Morland, of London-based Blakeney Management, calculates that at least Dollars 3bn of foreign money is being targeted at South Africa and a further Dollars 1bn at the rest of Africa in 1994: 'Peanuts in Mexico or Hong Kong, but they are liable to blow the African market apart at the seams.' The total amount of stock available in the whole of Africa (excluding South Africa) is about Dollars 2.2bn, he reckons: 'If almost half of this turns over in 1994, a huge increase on the 1993 levels, there will still only be Dollars 1bn of African equities to be fought over by local investors, global investors and all the new Africa funds.' The continent's heavyweight is South Africa. With a market capitalisation of some Dollars 150bn, South Africa is not so much an emerging market but a re-emerging market, comments Nigel Scheckter of Micropal, the Boston-based fund performance measurement service, which monitors 26,000 funds. But 'the true float is tiny relative to the wave of US guilt money that will elbow its way into the market this year,' says Mr Morland. Foreign buyers have already made their mark on Diagonal Street. Figures supplied by Baring Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthing in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. 'The market is the best one-way ticket I can think of, barring the 20 per cent bloodbath prospect' - a reference to fears that the April elections may trigger destabilising violence. Elsewhere, Mr Morland singles out Ghana, a tiny market but likely to grow rapidly as the privatisation programme led by Ashanti Gold moves ahead, Zimbabwe, where foreign buying in the second half of 1993 helped more than double the industrial index, Morocco and Tunisia. Is the excitement warranted, are the risks appreciated, and how well do the analysts know Africa? Morgan Stanley's upbeat view of the continent does not overlook the problems  -pointing among other things to weak management, and what it calls Africa's 'fear and distrust of foreign business influence'. But the overall picture that emerges may strike some readers as too rosy. The assertion that 'tribal tension in most of black Africa is probably less of a problem than racial tension in the US' may simply be an unorthodox view. More serious is the assertion that 28 of Africa's 50 states 'have economic reform programmes in place'. This list is based, says Morgan Stanley, on World Bank evaluations - not always, it should be said, the best judge of its own reform efforts. Some examples of reform listed by Morgan Stanley are risible - such as Zaire, where the political and economic malaise deepens by the day. Also on the list is Burundi, where the recent coup (which took place after the report's publication) illustrates the volatility of the African condition. The inclusion of Sao Tome, little more than a dot in the ocean, trivialises the list. Nigeria - 'a powerhouse waiting to happen', according to Morgan Stanley - 'perseveres with its structural adjustment programme, launched in 1986', writes the analyst. At the time the report was published (October 1993) it was clear that Nigeria's erratic attempt to implement the programme was the reason an IMF agreement lapsed some two years ago. Any hopes that Nigeria's military regime would revive the lapsed programme were set back last month, when it fixed the exchange rate and local interest rates at unrealistic levels. Africa's performance in general has been weak. As Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe writes in a recent paper: 'More than a dozen years after the launch of aid-funded structural adjustment programmes, it is impossible to identify a single mainland sub-Saharan country that has made a success of economic reform.' 'The best that can be said,' he continues, 'is that in countries such as Ghana and Uganda, the spiral of decline has been reversed, but it will take well into the next century before earlier living standards are regained.' A somewhat tougher investment appraisal comes from the Meridien BIAO group which runs a network of banks in 20 countries across Africa, led by Andrew Sardanis and Colin Goodwin, two veteran Africa hands. The investment climate is improving, says Colin Goodwin, president of the group, 'but by nothing like enough. 'Investment through individual African stock exchanges is not the best route for the emerging market fund,' he adds, 'as these exchanges are still too small and surrounded by too many restrictions'. The response of Africans with resources abroad may well prove the acid test of whether an African investment makes sense: if the continent's politicians, businessmen, civil servants are not risking their capital, foreign investors may suspect that Africa's elite knows something they do not. *Africa: Wrestling with the stigma of history.

Last year, gross national product (GNP) in provinces and  autonomous regions with a high density of ethnic groups -- Inner  Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and  Qinghai -- reached 293.8 billion yuan ($33.8 billion). And the  annual per capita income of farmers and herdsmen in the eight  areas exceeded 720 yuan ($83).    China has 55 minority nationalities with a total population  of 91 million. Most live in remote mountain areas where the  economy has traditionally lagged behind other parts of the  country.    But since 1949, the government has worked out a series of  preferential policies to promote economic growth in these areas.    In 1984, a law governing the regional autonomy of minority  nationalities laid the foundation for the development of  relationships between all nationalities as well as economic,  cultural, scientific and technological progress.    There are five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures  and 123 autonomous counties.    To advance local industry, the government started 1,400  large  and medium-sized enterprises in the eight autonomous regions and  provinces. These enterprises have since become the pillars of  the local economy. And industry is now complementary to the  traditional agriculture and animal husbandry.    Last year, the total output value of agriculture and  industry  in these areas hit 540 billion yuan ($62 billion). Industry  accounted for 59.8 percent of the local economy, up from 14.8  percent in 1949.    In recent years, township enterprises in ethnic areas have  progressed steadily. Relying on local natural resources, labour  and State loans, these enterprises are engaged in a diverse  range of industries.    From 1991 to 1995, the State will allocate 100 million yuan  ($11.5 million) in low-interest loans to these enterprises.    State subsidies have been promoting economic growth in  minority nationality regions.    In 1955 a special subsidy for minority nationality regions  was set up. In 1964, two reserve funds were established for  these regions. By the end of 1979, the State had allocated more  than 3 billion yuan ($344 million) to minority regions through  the three projects.    From 1980 to 1987, grants increase by 10 percent under a new  State subsidy system. By 1991, the grants totaled 80 billion  yuan ($9.2 billion).    In 1980, the government set up a development fund for  economically backward regions. By 1991, half of the fund, 4  billion yuan ($459 million), went to minority nationality  regions.    Ethnic regions also topped the State agenda for poverty  relief. The poverty line in these areas was set lower than other  regions so that more counties would benefit from the State  subsidies.    Eleven years ago the government provided 200 million yuan  ($23 million) in annual loans to the agricultural development  fund in Hexi and Dingxi, of Gansu Province, and Xihaigu, of  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The loans will continue until  the end of the century.    To create a favourable environment for economic development,  the State spent 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) on materials for  the regions to upgrade infrastructure.    And in 1990 the State set up a special fund to provide  minority people with sufficient, food and clothing; the fund  covers 143 poverty stricken counties in ethnic areas.    As a result of government efforts, minority living standards  have greatly improved. In 1992, the per capita income of  farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous areas hit 548 yuan ($63),  six times that of 1978.    Minority nationality regions, however, took longer to open  up  to the outside world compared to coastal areas.    But since China has developed friendly relations with its  neighboring countries, the government has encouraged minority  regions to make the most of their geographical positions and  boost their border trade.    China has 22,000 kilometres of border land, of which 19,000  kilometres are in minority regions.    Last year, trade in the eight autonomous regions and  provinces reached $5.7 billion. And trade with Russia, Myanmar  [Burma] and Vietnam is especially active.    Due to diverse traditions and customs, minorities have  different kinds of daily necessities.    Before 1949, ethnic regions suffered a shortage of daily  necessities. They had problems exporting the locally made  products, and consequently, prices for these goods were very low.    Over the past four decades, the government worked hard to  rectify the existing price structure, subsidizing grocery stores.    And companies producing goods for minority groups enjoy  preferential loans, investment and taxation policies. Special  low-interest loans have also been set up to help the technical  innovation of these enterprises.     "

Also used are poverty statistics from the 1990 Census. The Board adopted this combined approach in order to target funds for high-need areas more effectively. Funds designated for a particular jurisdiction must be used to provide services within that jurisdiction.  The National Board based its determination of high-need jurisdictions on four factors:  1. Most current twelve-month national unemployment rates;  2. Total number of unemployed within a civil jurisdiction;  3. Total number of individuals below the poverty level within a civil jurisdiction; and,  4. The total population of the civil jurisdiction.  In addition to unemployment, poverty was used to qualify a jurisdiction for receipt of an award.  Jurisdictions were selected under Phase XII (PL 103124) according to the following criteria:  Jurisdictions, including balance of counties, with 18,000+ unemployed and a 6.1% rate of unemployment.  Jurisdictions, including balance of counties, with 500 to 17,999 unemployed and an 8.5% rate of unemployment.  Jurisdictions, including balance of counties, with 500 or more unemployed and an 11.7% rate of poverty. Jurisdictions with a minimum of 500 unemployed may qualify for an award based upon their rate of unemployment or their rate of poverty.

(b)     Grant award process.     (1) United Way of America has been designated as the fiscal agent for the National Board and as such will process all Local Board plans. Payments will be made to organizations recommended by Local Boards for funding. Local Boards have the right to reallocate funds throughout the program period, as they determine necessary. When a Local Board reallocation between two or more LROs occurs, the Local Board must promptly notify the National Board in writing so that the National Board's records can be updated accordingly.  (2) The National Board offers two methods of payment to LROs. The two methods are either direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) or checks. The National Board encourages LROs to take advantage of direct deposit where possible.  (3) To ensure greater accountability and reporting, awards totaling less than $100,000 are paid in two equal installments. Awards totaling $100,000 or more will be paid in three equal installments.  (4) The National Board will distribute second/third payments once the jurisdiction's compliance review is completed for the previous program period. Second/third payments will be held in escrow until all compliance exceptions are satisfied by the LRO.  All payments will be mailed directly to the LRO. Second and third payments will be mailed to the LRO only upon the written request of the Local Board Chair which encloses the LROs interim report. The Local Board will authorize second and/or third payments once it is assured that the organization is implementing the current program as intended and according to the guidelines in the Plan.  (c)     Client eligibility.     The National Board does not set client eligibility criteria. Local Boards may choose to set such criteria. If the Local Board does not set eligibility criteria, the LRO may use its existing criteria or set criteria for assistance under this award. However, the LROs criteria must provide for assistance to needy individuals without discrimination (age, race, sex, religion, national origin, or handicap).             Note:     Funds allocated to a jurisdiction are intended for use within that jurisdiction. Residents of or transients in a specific jurisdiction should seek service within that jurisdiction.         Citizenship is not an eligibility requirement to receive assistance from EFSP. The National Board does not mandate nor recommend the use of any particular existing criteria (i.e., food stamp guidelines, welfare guidelines, or income guidelines).      Section 2.4Eligibility of Costs      The intent of this appropriation is for the purchase of food and shelter to supplement and extend current available resources and not to substitute or reimburse ongoing programs and services. Questions regarding interpretation of the program's guidelines should be cleared by the LRO with the Local Board prior to action. Local Boards unsure of the meaning of these guidelines should contact the National Board at (703) 7069660 for clarification prior to advising the LRO.  If an expenditure requested by an LRO is not listed below as eligible, the Local Board has the option of requesting a waiver from the National Board for consideration.       "

Mr Mandela, on a two-day visit to London, is due to hold talks today with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and address members of both houses of parliament. The ANC expects the constitutional negotiations under way in South Africa will soon set a date for the country's first all-race elections, paving the way to a government of national unity. The election itself would follow within a year. Mr Mandela told a press conference that the ANC had 'issued an investment code which provides that there will be no expropriation of property of investors. They will be allowed to repatriate their dividends and profits, and we think that will go a long way to reassuring investors to invest in our country'. The ANC leader once again appealed to whites to stay in South Africa: 'They have the knowledge, the skills . . . without them it is going to be difficult to address many of the socio-economic problems facing the country.' An early foreign policy decision of a new government would be to rejoin the Commonwealth, Mr Mandela said later at a lunch in his honour hosted by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general.

TALKS  WITH GOVERNMENT BEGIN THIS WEEK.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MITCHELLS PLAIN, South Africa      The highest-ranking exiled leaders of the African National Congress, speaking  directly to South Africans for the first time in three decades, told a rally  here Sunday that this week's talks with the government signal the beginning of  the end of ""the misery of apartheid.""    ""South Africa shall never be the same again,"" ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo  told about 10,000 supporters gathered on a soggy sports field on a cold,  blustery day. ""Ours is a society in transition to a new order.""    In one of the most remarkable scenes in the nation's history, Nzo, South  African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo and other leaders who direct the ANC's  guerrilla war against Pretoria mounted a stage in this mixed-race township near  Cape Town.    ""It's so weird . . . so very strange to see Joe Slovo up there,"" said Alexandra  Noble, a 20-year-old white college student in the crowd of black, white,  mixed-race and Indian faces.    Nzo, Slovo and their colleagues, who returned Friday from exile in Zambia, have  for years been the most notorious of the white government's enemies. Until  February, their words and even their photographs were banned from the country's  books, newspapers and television.    Their public appearance Sunday, guarded by their aides as well as South African  police officers, indicated just how far South Africa has come in the 2 1/2  months since President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the bans on anti-apartheid  groups and invited the ANC and others to the negotiating table.    ""We are together at last, and we are here because you, the people of South  Africa, made it happen,"" said Slovo, a 63-year-old white lawyer who fled South  Africa at age 35 under threat of arrest.    Until recently, Slovo was the ANC's chief military strategist and directed  operations that killed or maimed hundreds of black and white civilians. As  leader of the Communist Party and member of the ANC's executive committee, he  is a key figure in the ANC-Communist Party alliance and the leader most feared  by many white South Africans.    Slovo and Nzo, the day's keynote speakers, abandoned much of the war talk that  has characterized ANC speeches in the past.    ""We have come in a spirit of conciliation,"" Slovo said. ""If there is a way  forward without bloodshed, the whole world knows we will grab it with both  hands.""    During three days of talks beginning Wednesday, an ANC delegation, led by  Nelson Mandela, and a government team, led by De Klerk, will discuss the  remaining obstacles to negotiations.    Among those hurdles are the ANC's insistence that the four-year-old state of  emergency be lifted, that political prisoners be freed and that the 15,000 ANC  exiles be indemnified from prosecution. The government wants the ANC to abandon  its armed struggle, which De Klerk claims has fueled an upsurge of township  violence in recent weeks.    The ANC leaders used the forum Sunday to explain their reasons for agreeing to  government talks, a move that has been criticized by many young ANC supporters  who believe De Klerk has not yet moved far enough to warrant talks.    ""We have come to the table in search of a future of peace and equality,"" Slovo  said. He criticized ""armchair revolutionaries,"" an apparent reference to the  radical black Pan-Africanist Congress. Groups like the PAC ""scream treason when  the word dialogue is mentioned,"" he said.    Slovo praised De Klerk's ""courage"" in removing some of the obstacles to peace  in South Africa. But he said the president ""has only removed one or two bolts  from the door. The master lock has not yet been opened.""    Part of the blame, he said, lies with white South Africans ""who have allowed  their human feelings to be washed away by their swimming pools and champagne.""    Slovo said the ANC needs to see more reforms from the government before it  considers relinquishing its 30-year-old armed struggle.    ""It is because we spoke with the AK-47 (rifle) that dialogue is at least in the  air,"" he said. ""We will be ready to walk through the door (for negotiations)  when we see signs of real democracy. Short of that we will have to break down  the door.""    Slovo also outlined the ANC's negotiating strategy, reassuring opponents of the  government that his organization would not back down from its demands for  majority rule, a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution and a  redistribution of wealth. The government has said it will grant the 27 million  black majority the vote but it wants political protection for the 5 million  whites.    ""We accept that the time may arise when a degree of compromise is needed,""  Slovo said. ""But there is a limit -- and this is the gap that must be closed.    ""We can't go to the negotiating table ready to abandon (the ANC's demand for)  majority rule or forget that 90% of the productive property in this country is  owned by whites,"" he said.    ""A future South Africa without majority rule is a future South Africa in which  we cannot touch the economic fruits of our country. It's just apartheid by  another name.""    Until the government shows its willingness to meet the ANC's demands for  negotiations, foreign governments should maintain their economic sanctions and  diplomatic isolation of Pretoria, Slovo added.    ""There should be no reward yet for a country that still has all the main  ingredients of apartheid,"" he said.      Photo, South African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo at rally Sunday.

""South Africa shall never be the same again,"" ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo  told about 10,000 supporters gathered on a soggy sports field on a cold,  blustery day. ""Ours is a society in transition to a new order.""    In one of the most remarkable scenes in the nation's history, Nzo, South  African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo and other leaders who direct the ANC's  guerrilla war against Pretoria mounted a stage in this mixed-race township near  Cape Town.    ""It's so weird . . . so very strange to see Joe Slovo up there,"" said Alexandra  Noble, a 20-year-old white college student in the crowd of black, white,  mixed-race and Indian faces.    Nzo, Slovo and their colleagues, who returned Friday from exile in Zambia, have  for years been the most notorious of the white government's enemies. Until  February, their words and even their photographs were banned from the country's  books, newspapers and television.    Their public appearance Sunday, guarded by their aides as well as South African  police officers, indicated just how far South Africa has come in the 2 1/2  months since President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the bans on anti-apartheid  groups and invited the ANC and others to the negotiating table.    ""We are together at last, and we are here because you, the people of South  Africa, made it happen,"" said Slovo, a 63-year-old white lawyer who fled South  Africa at age 35 under threat of arrest.    Until recently, Slovo was the ANC's chief military strategist and directed  operations that killed or maimed hundreds of black and white civilians. As  leader of the Communist Party and member of the ANC's executive committee, he  is a key figure in the ANC-Communist Party alliance and the leader most feared  by many white South Africans.    Slovo and Nzo, the day's keynote speakers, abandoned much of the war talk that  has characterized ANC speeches in the past.    ""We have come in a spirit of conciliation,"" Slovo said. ""If there is a way  forward without bloodshed, the whole world knows we will grab it with both  hands.""    During three days of talks beginning Wednesday, an ANC delegation, led by  Nelson Mandela, and a government team, led by De Klerk, will discuss the  remaining obstacles to negotiations.    Among those hurdles are the ANC's insistence that the four-year-old state of  emergency be lifted, that political prisoners be freed and that the 15,000 ANC  exiles be indemnified from prosecution. The government wants the ANC to abandon  its armed struggle, which De Klerk claims has fueled an upsurge of township  violence in recent weeks.    The ANC leaders used the forum Sunday to explain their reasons for agreeing to  government talks, a move that has been criticized by many young ANC supporters  who believe De Klerk has not yet moved far enough to warrant talks.    ""We have come to the table in search of a future of peace and equality,"" Slovo  said. He criticized ""armchair revolutionaries,"" an apparent reference to the  radical black Pan-Africanist Congress. Groups like the PAC ""scream treason when  the word dialogue is mentioned,"" he said.    Slovo praised De Klerk's ""courage"" in removing some of the obstacles to peace  in South Africa. But he said the president ""has only removed one or two bolts  from the door. The master lock has not yet been opened.""    Part of the blame, he said, lies with white South Africans ""who have allowed  their human feelings to be washed away by their swimming pools and champagne.""    Slovo said the ANC needs to see more reforms from the government before it  considers relinquishing its 30-year-old armed struggle.    ""It is because we spoke with the AK-47 (rifle) that dialogue is at least in the  air,"" he said. ""We will be ready to walk through the door (for negotiations)  when we see signs of real democracy. Short of that we will have to break down  the door.""    Slovo also outlined the ANC's negotiating strategy, reassuring opponents of the  government that his organization would not back down from its demands for  majority rule, a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution and a  redistribution of wealth. The government has said it will grant the 27 million  black majority the vote but it wants political protection for the 5 million  whites.    ""We accept that the time may arise when a degree of compromise is needed,""  Slovo said. ""But there is a limit -- and this is the gap that must be closed.    ""We can't go to the negotiating table ready to abandon (the ANC's demand for)  majority rule or forget that 90% of the productive property in this country is  owned by whites,"" he said.    ""A future South Africa without majority rule is a future South Africa in which  we cannot touch the economic fruits of our country. It's just apartheid by  another name.""    Until the government shows its willingness to meet the ANC's demands for  negotiations, foreign governments should maintain their economic sanctions and  diplomatic isolation of Pretoria, Slovo added.    ""There should be no reward yet for a country that still has all the main  ingredients of apartheid,"" he said.      Photo, South African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo at rally Sunday.

Council Chairman (Vin  Trengrove) said in Johannesburg that any decision to retain  detention without trial would also fly in the face of the  constitutional principles recently endorsed by the multiparty  negotiating process and by the TEC itself. Mr. (Trengrove)  called on the TEC to reaffirm its commitment to the repeal of  Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which provides for  detention without trial.     "

Botha and Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned head  of the African National Congress, was of historic consequence. It recognized  the reality of the black majority, the need for negotiations, the inevitability  of change.    For Botha, 73, two months from retirement and already replaced as leader of the  ruling National Party, the meeting culminated a cautious relaxation of  apartheid that he has implemented. For Mandela, almost 71, perhaps close to  release from prison, it was almost certainly the beginning of formal  consultations in which the ANC will play a major role.    Both Botha and Mandela emphasized the importance of peaceful change in their  45-minute meeting. That is consistent with what the government in Pretoria has  been saying recently about the need for change and what the ANC has been saying  about the need to restrict the use of violence to avoid further acts of  terrorism against civilian populations. There is, of course, no guarantee that  peaceful change is possible at this late date, for neither Botha nor Mandela  can control what whites and blacks will do, and neither can promise an  equitable agreement on the future of the nation. But there is a hope that was  not there before the two men met.    If constructive negotiations do, in fact, result, they will coincide with moves  elsewhere in Africa to resolve a variety of disputes with talk, rather than  arms. There are new proposals for negotiations to end the rebellion in the  southern Sudan and the war between Eritrean liberation forces and Ethiopia.  South Africa has stopped sending arms to the UNITA guerrillas fighting the  government of Angola as part of a broader peace agreement to bring independence  to Namibia and end the Cuban intervention in Angola itself. Only the United  States is continuing to supply lethal equipment to the Angola rebels. And in  Mozambique, there are signs of progress in ending the murderous scorched-earth  warfare of the RENAMO rebels.    Most whites in South Africa apparently cling to the hope that they will be able  to contrive a formula for the future of their country that will guarantee  continued control by the white minority. However, the new Democratic Party,  claiming support of 24% of the white voters, has put forward a proposal for a  nonracial political system, with guarantees for minorities, that would emerge  through a lengthy transition. And the new leader of the National Party, F.W. De  Klerk, in line to succeed Botha as president after the Sept. 6, is expected to  accelerate efforts to eliminate apartheid and extend the vote to the black  majority.    The clandestine meeting between Mandela and Botha is no substitute for the  release of Mandela from prison, for amnesty, for recognition of the ANC, for  accepting the open negotiations. As Mandela explained in a press statement  Wednesday, a negotiated settlement is what the ANC has sought for 28 years.  Until this latest meeting, however, the government has not seemed to understand  that the violence it does through repression and denial of rights is as lethal  to the cause of peace as bombs in crowded streets. Now, perhaps, the dialogue  can begin.

A few hundred miles from Daisy's place, down the coast in Columbia, S.C.,  69-year-old Mattie Collins lived in a tired old house on the edge of town. She  moved there after being evicted from her apartment three months before. Health  problems, a son-in-law who stole from her and a string of bad luck drove her  into poverty.    Daisy and Mattie represent just two of the 8.3 million older Americans who live  alone. More than 40% live at or near the poverty line. Most of the elderly poor  receive only enough help from social workers and volunteers to survive --  occasional visits from social workers or home health aides, a meal a day from  Meals on Wheels or a few dollars' worth of food stamps.    Elderly women make up 80% of those who live alone. While Social Security and  Medicare have helped to halve the poverty rate among senior citizens over the  past 25 years, millions remain destitute.    Daisy Thomas and Mattie Collins recently gave a visitor a glimpse into this  world.    Daisy's hands shook and her voice wavered as she spoke about growing old and  living alone in a city that she once loved. Her neighborhood, where children  once played in the streets, is now home to drugs, poverty and violence.    ""Sure, I'm afraid of being robbed. I got my Social Security check stolen right  out from under me one day,"" she said, her eyes filled with fear, as if the  incident had just happened. ""I had just cashed my check and that boy grabbed  most of it and I never saw him again. Getting old is not for everyone.""    After the robbery -- which took place nearly a year ago -- she kept the  dead-bolts on her front door locked tight.    ""When you get robbed, that's it. Nobody is there to return it to you. You just  have to get by on what's left.""    To her visitor, it seemed hot in her cramped living room, but to Daisy, it  still felt cold. Her eyes wandered nervously around the room, reflecting the  discomfort she felt having someone there. She didn't want people to know how  poor she really was.    ""I hate to ask people for money, but if you get hungry enough, you'll ask,"" she  said.    Two days after that conversation, Daisy died, alone in her final moments just  as she had been in the final years of her life.    Daisy, who suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic heart  failure, survived on a Social Security check and some food stamps. Not much was  left after she paid her rent and utility bills.    And she received little outside help. Underfinanced and short-staffed, the  nearby office on aging could only afford to send someone by once every 8 weeks  to tell her she was still on the waiting list for a home-care program.    In a deteriorating neighborhood in Columbia, Mattie slowly ate the meal  delivered once a day by the local office on aging, pretending not to notice the  cockroaches crawling on her TV tray and couch.

The action was  launched by 10 of the country's labor union federations which  are demanding a minimum salary increase of 30 percent to  compensate for the loss of purchasing power following the  devaluation of the CFA franc. The strike is said to be 75  percent effective, and is taking place in an atmosphere of  absolute calm. From Cotonou, Ange-Hermann Gname reports.    [Begin Gname recording] Government offices, schools, customs  offices, the main post office, and some parastatal offices have  complied with the 72-hour strike order issued by the Federation  of Beninese Workers' Unions, and have done so in absolute calm.  This morning, the few workers who turned up at their workplaces  either went to provide minimum services or to see for themselves  the absence of their colleagues from work. Since this morning,  the national radio has only been broadcasting a very light  program which has not exceeded two and a half hours of air time.  Policemen have been guarding the deserted government offices  against any possible acts of vandalism. The Agency for Air  Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar has also joined the  strike and there was no movement of planes this morning at the  Cotonou International Aiport. Only a minimum service permitted  the flight by a Nigerian military aircraft of President  Nicephore Soglo -- chairman of the Economic Community of West  African States -- to Liberia, where he is supposed to chair the  inauguration ceremony of the new democratic institutions in  Monrovia today.    As we can see, the strike order has been well followed by  the  workers at a time when the Cotonou government is having a lot of  difficulty in easing the social tension which has worsened since  the devaluation of the CFA franc.

First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence  was  the the subject of a MAIL  GUARDIAN front page story last  week,  which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that  South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or  material from another country, or provided another country with  nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted  that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel,  and its provision of yellow cake uranium to Israel, were not  part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and  conventional weapons.    His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation  chief  Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that  Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive  military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium  and yellow cake.    It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for  State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get  tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g  Blaauw ultimately secured ""was sufficient for the manufacture of  12 atomic bombs"".    The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South  African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments  of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were  notified each time a shipment was successfully completed,  according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S.  journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem.    Much of what South African officials withheld from the  public  was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's  compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According  to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying  numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy  Corporation ""received some tritium in 1977, but after the  withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its  quality, the material remained in store until 1987"".    During that time, according to the IAEA document, South  Africa was engaged in ""theoretical and practical"" research on  ""lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible  future use in boosted devices"".    The government also did the preliminary engineering work on  a  reactor -- ""to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay""  -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA,  repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration.  It adds: ""In September 1985 the South African government  decided to...stop all work related to possible plutonium devices  and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow further  development work on implosion technology and theoretical work on  more advanced devices.""    The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the  refusal  of international financial organisations to roll over their  loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if  sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government  would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose  could be to attack--or threaten--nations within range of its  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.    Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice,  South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With  extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions  of Israel's Jericho missiles.    After the two countries jointly tested a South African  Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S.  officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel  was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering  nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa  only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only  intended the six which were actually made as a ""deterrent"".  This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail  Washington to save the established order from ""total onslaught"".    At an international conference last weekend to discuss  future  nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African  National Congress] science and technology department, Roger  Jardine, slammed De Klerk's ""list of lies"" about South Africa's  nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry  to be opened to full public scrutiny.     "
0,FT941-5911 ,"FT941-5911 _AN-ECDC4ABMFT 940304   FT  04 MAR 94 / Fund managers watch S African cliff-hanger with bated breath: South Africa is on the threshold of an investment 'third wave'      By MATTHEW CURTIN   A select group of visitors to South Africa with around half a billion dollars to invest are following the country's nail-biting political negotiations with particular interest. They are 28 fund managers from some of the most prominent European and North American investment institutions on a week long tour. They will be seeking the answer to one question above all else: what are the prospects for a stable, post-apartheid South Africa? Signs are that the representatives from New York's Lazard Freres and Merrill Lynch Asset Management, London's IDC International and Toronto's Goodman  Co, among others, have liked what they have heard from minister of finance Derek Keys, the ANC's economics department, the Reserve Bank, and businessmen such as Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries (SAB), and Mr Hans Smith, managing director of the steel-maker Iscor. Mr Richard Jesse, at stockbrokers Martin  Co, which arranged the visit, says there is no doubt that even the most cautious foreign investors 'like the concept' of investing in South Africa. A successful outcome to the political negotiations currently under way would remove much of the remaining unease about the country's investment risk. But with elections so close, many will take the attitude that waiting a few weeks more before committing funds 'can do no harm when you have been waiting for 50 years'. When they do take the plunge, South Africa is likely to see indirect foreign investment which will dwarf the sums spent on shares since the lifting of sanctions in September which saw records broken on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 'The JSE has seen hundreds of millions of rands of foreign money. Now it will see hundreds of millions of dollars,' says Mr Jesse. The change in sentiment is dramatic (only 10 companies accepted Martin  Co's last invitation for a fund managers' visit in October), and has been fuelled by the feverish interest in emerging markets. Mr Miles Moreland of the London-based Blakeney Management, which specialises in discovering 'new' markets, says South Africa is on the threshold of a third wave of offshore share buying. The first wave saw hedge funds and the 'more nimble, unrestricted' investors buy South African shares for much of 1993, and move quickly to take profits this year. Then came the specialist Africa funds such as Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.3m) Africa Investment Fund, and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern African Fund, listed on Wall Street on Friday. Mr Moreland says the more cautious global investors, the large mutual and pension funds, are about to follow. This comes about as much the result of growing confidence in a growing South African economy as the JSE's forthcoming inclusion in the International Finance Corporation's emerging market index and Morgan Stanley International's developing market index. The JSE in one of the world's largest stock markets by capitalisation (about Dollars 170bn) but is under-represented in emerging market portfolios. When the JSE is added to indices by which the performance of share portfolios are judged, emerging market fund managers will have to redirect some of the Dollars 8bn assets they manage to South Africa to ensure they have even exposure to a market which represents at least 10 per cent of the value of all emerging markets. Ms Maria Ramos, an ANC economist, says any increase in indirect investment is welcome, as its improves market liquidity and economic confidence. That will be vital if a new government is to raise new funds on international capital markets. But she points out it does not create jobs. Direct foreign investment will be critical if the estimated 6m unemployed South Africans are to find work. Job creation has risen swiftly this year to the top of the agenda at the National Economic Forum, which links government, business and trade unions. However, as high-profile as the announcement of the return of Industrial Business Machines (IBM), Kodak and Reebok have been, the sums involved with the companies' reinvestment are small. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic), the US government agency which helps US businesses invest abroad, completed a 10-day visit on Tuesday by announcing a Dollars 75m equity investment fund aimed at black business, and small business partners. Mr Richard Morningstar, an Opic vice-president, says the trip was an 'unqualified success' but admits the agency can only make the smallest, albeit important, contributions to the economy. Even if the political transition proves surprisingly free of violence, and fears of future macro-economic indiscipline are unwarranted, foreign companies contemplating direct investment are entering a competitive domestic market. Mr Jesse says it is easy to say a foreign brewer or pharmaceutical company should be able to rush into South Africa, but large indigenous groups are unlikely to give ground easily to competitors. Foreign investment will be good for stockbrokers' pockets but promises no free ride for the economic planners. See World Stock Markets   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

He emphasised the mission was not designed to raise funds yet, but to pave the way for future funding when appropriate. He said the high-powered roadshow was the first opportunity the government, which took power after the country's first all-race elections in April, had had to go abroad to market the country's policies and philosophy. The officials would use the credit ratings assigned to South Africa in October by American and Japanese risk assessment agencies 'to establish ourselves in the minds of potential investors'. Moody's Investors Service and Nippon Investors Service gave the country investment grade ratings, while Standard  Poor's gave it its top speculative ranking, with a 'positive' outlook. The ratings will enable South Africa to tap a wider range of markets and investors than would otherwise be possible. Mr Liebenberg said three teams of officials would travel to Europe, east Asia and the US. Apart from Mr Liebenberg, they would include Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, deputy finance minister Alec Erwin, and labour minister Tito Mboweni. The officials would be accompanied by represen- tatives of Goldman, Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, which have been named lead managers for the country's first global offering.

A White House statement said Mr Clinton had asked Mr Brian Atwood, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, to head the bipartisan delegation including members of Congress and private organisations. The group would try to prevent mass starvation in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya by investigating and then raising and co-ordinating more help from global organisations. 'The crisis in the east Africa region threatens every nation in the region and is caused by drought conditions and civil conflicts,' the White House statement said. 'At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid widespread famine, but an estimated 20m people are currently at risk and may have to leave their homes to search for food.' It said concerted regional and international action two years ago prevented a similar drought in southern Africa from becoming a severe famine. 'Our effort to head off the incipient famine will be both short- and long-term and will help the nations of the region address what have become chronic food shortages.' The delegation is to examine programmes sponsored by the US government and other donors in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya, and meet heads of state and government representatives. The current delegation will travel to Rome, Geneva, and Brussels to seek increased aid for east Africa. The White House said it would meet officials of the World Food programme, the Food for Agriculture Organisation, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and leaders of the European Union.

His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation  chief  Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that  Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive  military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium  and yellow cake.    It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for  State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get  tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g  Blaauw ultimately secured ""was sufficient for the manufacture of  12 atomic bombs.""    The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South  African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments  of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were  notified each time a shipment was successfully completed,  according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S.  journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem.    Much of what South African officials withheld from the  public  was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's  compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. According  to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying  numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy  Corporation ""received some tritium in 1977, but after the  withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its  quality, the material remained in store until 1987.""    During that time, according to the IAEA document, South  Africa was engaged in ""theoretical and practical"" research on  ""lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible  future use in boosted devices.""    The government also did the preliminary engineering work on  a  reactor -- ""to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay""  -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA,  repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration.  It adds: ""In September 1985 the South African government  decided to .. stop all work related to possible plutonium  devices and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow  further development work on implosion technology and theoretical  work on more advanced devices.""    The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the  refusal  of international financial organisations to roll over their  loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if  sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government  would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose  could be to attack -- or threaten -- nations within range of its  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.    Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice,  South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With  extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions  of Israel's Jericho missiles.    After the two countries jointly tested a South African  Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S.  officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel  was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering  nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa  only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only  intended the six which were actually made as a ""deterrent"".  This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail  Washington to save the established order from ""total onslaught"".    At an international conference last weekend to discuss  future  nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African  National Congress] science and technology department, Roger  Jardine, slammed De Klerk's ""list of lies"" about South Africa's  nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry  to be opened to full public scrutiny.     "

In a statement issued at the end of the 30th African  Development Bank (ADB) and 21st African Development Fund (ADF)  annual meetings in Nairobi, temporary governor for the People's  Bank of China Yin Jieyan said that Africa's development relies  on the unremitting endeavours by the governments and peoples of  African states, but the international community also bears a  significant responsibility for this.    Yin Jieyan, who is also the head of the Chinese delegation  attending the meetings which started officially on Wednesday [11  May], said the founding of the ADB embodies the aspirations of  the African people in pursuing economic independence.    Yin Jieyan said ADB in the past 30 years has surmounted  various difficulties in her efforts to promote the industrial  and agricultural development on the African Continent, to  improve the living standard of the African people, and to  enhance the close cooperation among its member countries.    He noted that for promoting the economic development in  Africa, the ADB had adopted positive policies, including forest  development and population control.    Referring to difficulties the African countries are facing  in  economic development, Yin Jieyan said Africa has been developing  at a low speed for several years, the balance of payments has  shown a sustained deficit, the terms of trade have been  deteriorating further, the debt service ratio has exceeded 25  percent in several consecutive years. Other difficulties  include the natural disasters and trade protectionism of the  Western countries, he said.    On China's commitment to the African Continent, the head of  Chinese delegation said while developing her domestic economy,  China has never forgotten her duty to support Africa's economic  development. ""China is ready to continue making due  contributions to Africa's economic development through the ADB  and ADF, which we consider the most important financial  institutions in Africa,"" he added.

Among them 14,000 hectares are  planted with rice and 3,000 hectares with peanuts. In the most  productive year, the district can produce 63,000 tonnes of  grain. Its per capita in grain is 260 kg. People in the  district also engage in fishing, salt production, and livestock  breeding.    ""However, after six years of implementing Resolution No. 10  on the contractual system, only 65 percent of households in the  district earn enough grain for self-consumption. The remaining  35 percent face a grain shortage and numerous difficulties due  to poverty, among them more than 11 percent experience hunger  [dqois] from five to six months.""    What is the main causes of hunger and poverty experienced by  the abovementioned 35 percent of the district's households?  Through our studies, we found that these households had  insufficient capital, used poor cultivation methods, while the  cost of production was too high and the price of rice was  relatively low in the market.    ""Indeed, more than half of the 35 percent poor households  are  short of capital; they have too many children, most of them are  in poor health. Worse still, they could not pay their debts to  the local agricultural cooperative year after year.""    To overcome these difficulties, the district must strive to  encourage the peasants to plant new high-yield rice and peanut  varieties to attain an average rice yield of 45 quintals per  hectar and peanut, 20 quintal per hectare. The district must  also strive to plant more soybean and sweet potatoes on its  fallow land to attain a production target of 70,000-80,000  tonnes of grain by the year 1997.    The goal of the district is to overcome hunger by 1998,  reduce the number of poor households by half, and help 40  percent of the total households in the district lead a better  life by the year 2000.    ""The struggle against hunger and poverty is a difficult  task.  It requires coordination from various sectors and branches while  efforts must be made from the top to the lowest level. It is  necessary to carry out this struggle in close association with  the implementation of the family planning program to reduce the  population growth rate of the district from 2.4 percent at  present to 1.7 percent in the year 2000.""

0,FT941-12392 ,"FT941-12392 _AN-EA4DIAA8FT 940131   FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (8): Patchwork solutions  -Leslie Crawford profiles Undugu's work in Kenya      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   'Mama, I'm hungry, buy me something to eat.' The boy's voice is soft, but his eyes are desperate. The rags he wears flap about his thin legs. I give him a sweet bun and a coupon which will entitle him to a hot meal and a bath in one of the shelters run by Undugu Society, a non-government organisation devoted to the care of destitute children. There are more than 130,000 street children like him in Nairobi, an inescapable reminder of Kenya's decline into poverty and social strife. The children - or 'parking boys' as they are known in Kenya - survive by begging, prostitution, or theft. They cheat their hunger by sniffing glue. They are regarded as pests by the police and as an eye-sore by the local tourist authorities. Every few months, police make half-hearted efforts to sweep them off the streets. As the government cannot afford to keep them in juvenile detention centres for long, the children soon return to their old haunts. Over the past 21 years, Undugu (the name means 'brotherhood' in Swahili) Society's work has evolved from rescuing children from the streets to addressing the problems that drove them there in the first place. The core of Undugu's work revolves round providing under-privileged children with basic education and survival skills. It has also become increasingly involved in trying to relieve poverty in Nairobi's sprawling slums. Through small loans for small business ventures, skills training and community-based health and nutrition projects, Undugu hopes it might be able to alleviate the economic hardship that causes family break-ups and abandoned children. Providing low-cost shelter for the urban poor has been another priority. Despite Undugu's efforts, the plight of Nairobi's street children gets worse every year. Rapid population growth, rising unemployment and structural adjustment policies have hit urban dwellers particularly hard. Nairobi's overcrowded slums lack basic sanitation and are often plagued by water shortages. The removal of food subsidies has priced most staples, including maize, beyond the reach of most urban households. Children are withdrawn from schools because parents cannot afford school fees. Malnutrition is on the rise. 'At best, we can only provide patchwork solutions,' says Friar Arnold Grol, the Dutch missionary who founded Undugu Society in 1973. 'We cannot solve national problems, and we should not be a substitute for the lack of government policies to fight poverty and injustice.' Friar Grol does not believe in handouts or food aid, but he is now feeding the 1,000 children who attend Undugu's schools. 'Children were dropping out because they had nothing to eat,' he explains. For the first three years, children are taught basic literacy and numeracy skills. The fourth and fifth years are dedicated to learning a trade. 'We teach them to become self-reliant,' says Grol. Undugu is also sponsoring 400 children in state schools and seven at university. The white-haired friar is a familiar figure round the wood and metal workshops and the garage, which train future carpenters and mechanics as well as providing Undugu with an income to finance other projects. There is a tangible pride in what they do, as well as some grumbling about low wages. 'When I look at the kids who are still on the streets, with no future, I know I am lucky to be here,' says Francis, an 18-year-old carpenter. Undugu's latest project - centres which provide street children with meals, counselling and a bath - was developed in partnership with the private sector. Nairobi residents are being encouraged to buy coupons at Barclays Bank which they can then give to street children, instead of giving them alms. The coupon entitles children to food and a thorough scrub. 'It was our way of mobilising all of Nairobi in the care of our vulnerable kids,' says Aloys Opiyo, one of Undugu's supervisors. 'All of society should be involved in looking after them, not just the non-government organisations.'   Countries:-  KEZ  Kenya, Africa.   Industries:-  P8351 Child Day Care Services.

The petition also asks the FCC to turn down KCET's request for a new  transmitter in Bakersfield.    Barbara Goen, spokeswoman for KCET, said the station could not comment about  the petition because executives there had not yet seen it.    Under FCC rules, anyone may file a petition to deny a station its license, but  such petitions are rarely successful. They are most often used as a tactic to  compel a station to respond to the petitioner's complaints.

The group also wants the station to set up a paid position for an  ombudsman.    Horowitz became the focus of national media attention in October, when KCET  decided to pull ""South Africa Now"" for alleged bias -- a decision the station  later rescinded -- and he claimed credit for raising the issue of the program's  balance with station executives.    Horowitz said his organization decided to challenge KCET's license because ever  since the ""South Africa Now"" controversy, members have been unable to get a  fair hearing for their views.    KCET's Goen disagreed with that contention, saying, ""Mr. Horowitz has had an  unprecedented amount of communication and access to KCET.

Horowitz became the focus of national media attention in October, when KCET  decided to pull ""South Africa Now"" for alleged bias -- a decision the station  later rescinded -- and he claimed credit for raising the issue of the program's  balance with station executives.    Horowitz said his organization decided to challenge KCET's license because ever  since the ""South Africa Now"" controversy, members have been unable to get a  fair hearing for their views.    KCET's Goen disagreed with that contention, saying, ""Mr. Horowitz has had an  unprecedented amount of communication and access to KCET. He has had meetings  with the chairman, the president, the executive vice president, the general  counsel, the head of programming and several other board members over a  two-year period. . . . There comes a point where certainly we think we have  heard what he has to say.""    "

At a speech delivered to the chamber of commerce of Belgium  and Luxembourg and the ACP states (Africa, Caribbean and the  Pacific), he stressed that (black) Africa was changing and the  continent's image as the ""black"" continent which it had until a  few years ago no longer corresponded to the reality of the  situation.    The Zambian president, who peacefully succeeded Mr. Kenneth  Kaunda following elections in 1991, an almost unique event in  Africa, has been on a three-day visit to Belgium since  Wednesday, during which he is to meet European Community  officials.    Mr. Chiluba, a former trade unionist, added that ""new  leaders"" and ""new regimes"" had appeared, who were asking for  time in order to continue with democratization.    ""The best way of helping us in this matter is by investing  in  my country,"" he added.    Mr. Chiluba believes that Zambia now possesses a pluralist  political system. ""I could be beaten at the next elections,"" he  stressed.    The Zambian president also affirmed that his government had  been insisting on the privatization of the economy since 1991.  ""Previously"" (under the regime of the single party of the left,  editor's note) it had been 80 percent nationalized. Other  priorities are the fight against inflation and investments in  roads and education.    Mr. Chiluba was received by King Albert II on Thursday  morning. Following a meeting with the ambassadors of the ACP  states, he met in the afternoon with European Commission  President Jacques Delors.    Friday morning, he will be meeting with Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes, and the secretary of state for cooperation  development, Mr. Erik Derycke, over a working lunch.     "

0,FT934-7735 ,"FT934-7735 _AN-DKRC7AGTFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (19): In search of recognition - Philip Gawith discusses foreign investment      By PHILIP GAWITH   AFTER the isolation years, South Africa's business community is enjoying being back in the fold, hoping the world will want to lend to the country, trade with it and, above all, invest in it. First prize would be a headline investment of the 'IBM to build Dollars 1bn plant' variety. Clearly the optimists are going to be disappointed, for the time being. First, the world has changed. Before isolation, the eastern bloc and China were no-go zones and the Pacific Dragons had barely entered the business lexicon. Nor had South America embarked upon widespread financial liberalisation. Change in all of these areas has opened a host of markets competing for the multinational investment dollar. Second, save for special cases - such as investment flowing from the recent issue of cellular telephone licences - it is unlikely any significant investments will be made until it is clear South Africa has achieved a stable transition. This is not, however, to say that nothing is happening. On the contrary, there is a ferment of activity. Examples include: Alfa Romeo is again selling cars in South Africa and Volvo will soon be doing so: IBM is probably going to return through an investment in a local distributor; Hoechst has expanded its operation by paying R70m for a polyester fibre plant; Foodcorp has signed a deal with Pillsbury; Lufthansa has added an extra flight and is flying on a daily basis; ferrochrome producers Samancor and Nippon Denko have formed a joint venture, while Mitsui will distribute some of Sasol's chemicals in Japan and Korea. The list goes on. So, while the headline investment may be absent, the incremental internationalisation of the corporate scene is proceeding apace. The main trend to be observed is as obvious as it is understandable: companies want to establish a presence, but without any significant equity commitment. As Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented recently in Washington: 'They're offering us their services, not their money.' The deals one is hearing about are thus in distribution, licensing and franchising. At issue here is not only the question of who will come, but how they will do it. Any future government is sure to have a very strong commitment to black economic advancement, a process that many US investors, in particular, are likely to want to support. Given the underdeveloped state of black business in South Africa, franchising (sectors with strong potential include hair care salons and fast food outlets) and joint ventures are the most logical routes of assisting this process. There are, for example, many small black business contractors, but often they will lack access to credit to buy materials and have non-existent financial or administative systems. The process of finding partners, however, will not be easy. Despite years of activity in this field, the US embassy is still not in a position to offer a list of potential partners. According to the Reserve Bank, at the end of 1992 total investment in South Africa by foreign residents amounted to approximately Dollars 30bn. This included repayable debt of about Dollars 18bn and about Dollars 12bn of South African corporate equities and bonds issued by government and other public and private sector borrowers. About half of the latter sum is 'direct' investment - in South African subsidiaries and branches of foreign companies - with the other half being invested by non-residents in rand denominated paper ('portfolio' investment). During the sanctions years, South Africa experienced a net outflow of foreign investment from the country as many companies, especially US ones, disinvested. The stock of US fixed investment in South Africa shrunk as a result by a third, to roughly Dollars 1bn and 110 companies. Although some UK and European companies also left, most stayed and already have a presence in South Africa. From an investment perspective, the Japanese and Asian presence is negligible. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, speculates that the order in which foreign countries will 'carry the baton' when they return might be: US, Japan, UK and other Europeans. How will they be received by a future government? The key policy document in this regard is the 'Agreed framework in relation to foreign direct investment', a product of the National Economic Forum, and endorsed by the ANC. This is largely a motherhood-and-apple pie affair, but points worth stressing are: Realisation of the importance of stability and 'consistent, credible economic policies'; The view that South Africa should not introduce special tax incentives to attract FDI, the object rather being 'the equal application of reasonably low corporate tax rates which remain stable'; During the transition assurances will be provided on security of investment, foreign exchange policy, and minimisation of bureaucratic obstacles; Industrial incentives will be equally available to foreigners and locals.

But today, as SWAPO sits on the verge of realizing its dream in Namibia's first  free and democratic elections, the rhetoric of war has given way to the  practicalities of politics.    SWAPO leaders still call each other ""comrade,"" reiterate their devotion to  socialism and promise a redistribution of wealth from the mostly white  landholders to the black masses. But, having seen Africa littered with failed  Marxist policies, they have promised a mixed economy, freedom of speech, no  mass nationalization and protection for the property of whites who want to  stay.    ""Our policy is to leave the sad history behind us, to adopt a much more  flexible approach and to write our future on a clean sheet of paper,"" says  SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, the bearded leader who has spent half his 60 years  in exile. His efforts will be watched closely in neighboring South Africa,  especially by whites who fear that a black government in Pretoria would usher  in communism and force them out.    SWAPO is heavily favored to win at least a majority in the five-day Namibian  elections, which ended Saturday. Initial results are expected to be announced  late today. Ten political parties have been vying for power in the  U.N.-supervised elections, and SWAPO needs a two-thirds majority to control the  72-seat constituent assembly and write a new constitution for Namibia.    No one knows for sure what SWAPO will do with the new power. Although Nujoma's  chief aides hold advanced degrees in political science from American and  European universities, they have no practical experience in government. Until  last June, in fact, SWAPO was only a liberation movement with a dream. Now it  is a political party with a constituency to keep happy and, perhaps soon, a  country to run.    The Marxist principles to which SWAPO held fast for so long have been dated by  recent ideological changes in the Soviet Union. And today, African countries  founded on Marxist principles, from Angola to Mozambique and Ghana to Tanzania,  are embracing free-market solutions to their economic troubles.    This may be the first and last multi-party election in Namibia. SWAPO has long  favored a one-party state, believing that the Western model of multi-party  democracy does not work in developing African countries. But Nujoma also has  said he would consult with all other parties in mapping the country's future.    ""If SWAPO doesn't turn us into a Communist nation, we'll be OK,"" said Anton  Ferreira, a white Namibian who waited in line more than six hours to vote on  the first of five days of balloting last week.    A white woman standing nearby added: ""If SWAPO wins, people are going to get  used to standing in lines like this.""    Despite its talk of unity and conciliation, SWAPO's history of planting land  mines on white farmers' land and allegations that it tortured black Namibians  believed to be spies has made many here wary.    SWAPO's foreign affairs chief, Theo-Ben Gurirab, says the organization  regretted the torture. But others, including Nujoma himself, have not been  penitent.    ""I'm not regretting anything,"" Nujoma said as voters went to the polls. ""We  lost hundreds of our comrades in the war because of information those traitors  supplied to South African troops. Do you think we were stupid enough to let  them carry on?""    Nevertheless, SWAPO now says it wants to establish a bill of human rights for  Namibia. And Nujoma says the fighters of his People's Liberation Army, who  surrendered their arms to return to Namibia for the elections, will form the  basis of a small national army designed only for defense.    Few of the country's 80,000 whites, who account for less than 10% of the  population but own 65% of the land, relish the prospect of a SWAPO government.  But many agree with SWAPO that South Africa has siphoned off much of Namibia's  wealth over the years.    ""We've been exploited by South Africa for 75 years, why not give Sam Nujoma a  chance,"" said J. P. D. Blaauw, a retired brigadier in the South African air  force. Blaauw, who lived in Namibia as a child, flew from South Africa last  week to vote and said he plans to move here permanently after independence.    SWAPO will face many of the same logistical problems that South Africa has  faced in trying to administer the territory, which is twice the size of  California, with a dozen ethnic groups and only 1.3 million people, 60% of them  illiterate. To help the South African administration stage the first one-man,  one-vote national elections in the vast, rugged landscape, the United Nations  had to bring in more than 7,000 peacekeeping troops, police monitors, election  supervisors and administrative workers.    An independent government in Namibia will have to accept, at least at first,  its economic links with South Africa, whose government it calls the ""apartheid  colonialists."" About 90% of its exports go to South Africa and three-fourths of  imports, mostly food, come from there.    Its primary port city, Walvis Bay, will remain a South African enclave even  after independence.    SWAPO has promised over the years to redistribute the country's resources and  exert more centralized control over the economy. The main target for land  redistribution is whites, especially foreign absentee landlords.    ""There are white farmers here who own up to 20 farms. That is a crime,"" Hidipo  Hamutenya, SWAPO's chief spokesman, says. ""They will be asked to choose the one  they like best and give the rest to the people.""    But SWAPO leaders also have said that farmers using their land effectively and  producing food for the country will be left alone. And they say no land will be  confiscated without negotiation with the owners.    SWAPO is counting on the country's reserve of diamonds, uranium and other  minerals, which now make up 75% of foreign exchange earnings, to help it  improve the schools, health care and housing of black Namibians.    Although it once believed in nationalizing the mining industry, SWAPO now says  it intends to negotiate new contracts with the mining companies. It  specifically has said that the companies will be required to reinvest ""a  substantial part"" of their profits in Namibia.    The mining companies, which currently have a tax rate of 60%, doubt they can  afford to pay more. But they believe Namibia's mineral potential has been  largely untapped and that more mining companies will be lured here if trade  sanctions against Pretoria, which still extend to Namibia, are lifted.    SWAPO's biggest headache, though, may be dealing with the raised expectations  of the black masses, most of whom are landless and 30% jobless.    ""We will educate the people that independence is not a panacea, that they will  have to work hard and produce,"" Hage Geingob, SWAPO's election director,  recently told the South African magazine Leadership. ""It would be a serious  mistake to believe that independence is the time for people to make big claims  on the state.""

I lived in Zimbabwe the last three years, lecturing in the College of  Agriculture at the University of Zimbabwe. It became apparent to me that the  major concerns of the government, eight years after independence, were  employment, education and health. This country is now going through a stage of  development that South Africa may well face in the future. There is a race  against time because of the enormous population growth. It has been estimated  that over 50% of the black population in both countries is under 15 years of  age. Surely, the South African children will also need and demand better  opportunities for employment, education and health. How can these be created  without some investment in carefully targeted impact programs in these sectors?    Finally, we must not overlook the interdependence among countries in southern  Africa. Peace and stability in South Africa is interwoven with peace and  stability in southern Africa. We should not let this window of opportunity pass  for stabilization in the region. To facilitate the cause of justice in South  Africa it would, therefore, seem imperative to create opportunities through  selective investments.

Perhaps it is time to  re-evaluate the call for total economic sanctions and disinvestment from South  Africa.    I lived in Zimbabwe the last three years, lecturing in the College of  Agriculture at the University of Zimbabwe. It became apparent to me that the  major concerns of the government, eight years after independence, were  employment, education and health. This country is now going through a stage of  development that South Africa may well face in the future. There is a race  against time because of the enormous population growth. It has been estimated  that over 50% of the black population in both countries is under 15 years of  age. Surely, the South African children will also need and demand better  opportunities for employment, education and health. How can these be created  without some investment in carefully targeted impact programs in these sectors?    Finally, we must not overlook the interdependence among countries in southern  Africa. Peace and stability in South Africa is interwoven with peace and  stability in southern Africa. We should not let this window of opportunity pass  for stabilization in the region. To facilitate the cause of justice in South  Africa it would, therefore, seem imperative to create opportunities through  selective investments. Clearly, we must re-evaluate the call for total economic  sanctions and total disinvestment.    PHLLIP D. NORTHCRAFT    La Jolla      Letter to the Editor    "

Gen.  Matos said government soldiers were becoming impatient over  delays in the Angolan peace negotiations in the Zambian capital  of Lusaka. He said it was necessary to put an end to the  tension being experienced in various parts of Angola as a result  of the civil war. Gen.

The show of solidarity was to have begun with  a rally addressed by ANC President Nelson Mandela and Namibian  President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on January 27, but Mr Mandela  cancelled his visit. ANC spokesman Gill Marcus said the ANC  President had other engagements.    SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said senior ANC and  SWAPO officials would address meetings and rallies across  Namibia to raise money for the ANC's election coffers. He said  SWAPO's support for the ANC was part of the responsibility it  felt towards South Africa. SWAPO was confident of, and hoped for  an ANC landslide victory and felt a need to contribute in the  same way the ANC had helped SWAPO to victory in the 1989  Namibian elections.    Mr Garoeb said SWAPO believed the ANC, with its ""pragmatic  and experienced leadership"", was the party best structured to  manage a post-election South Africa and keep southern Africa  stable.    Money would be raised at SWAPO branch and regional level in  cooperation with the National Union of Namibian Workers. Mr  Garoeb appealed to all South Africans living in Namibia to  register and vote for the ANC on April 27.    In an editorial on Monday, the Windhoek Advertiser warned  that SWAPO's support for the ANC risked drawing Namibia into a  partisan role in a potential future civil war. ""In the event of  a troubled South Africa plunging into civil strife of  proportions where factions go over to guerrilla war and  unrestricted sabotage, Namibia will not be spared. Our  allegiance with the ANC will under such circumstances be on the  debit side of Namibia's interests,"" wrote editor Hannes Smith.    Mr Garoeb dismissed Mr Smith's comment as the ""cry-baby  attitude and professional negativism from a confirmed pessimist""  who could not see anything good about the SWAPO government.     "

Nelson Mandela talks about the  obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its  path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to  practice an ""open-door policy"" toward the international  community, without ""tyrannizing"" investors. Pre-election  opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes.    [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is  officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to  the transitional government whose task is to organize the first  free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the  enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be  multiplying. Who are the die-hards?    [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional  government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha  Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom  Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do  nothing but pursue an ""all or nothing"" tactic. Inkatha above  all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African  National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many  sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the  greatest number of political demands can be taken into account.  Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the  other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the  negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we  had set, just to keep the negotiations open.    [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an  armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the  country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the  extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to  apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups?    [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to  talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner  People's Front included. As far as we have been able to  establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front  are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how  dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our  discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are  understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say  the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the  negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling  that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual  understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with  Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the  negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27  April.    [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's  negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance  reached?    [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather  the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the  Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim  constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election  that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the  parties and organizations forming the transitional executive  council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress  in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to  speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go,  issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the  election itself, which is set for 27 April.    [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this  connection?    [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely  central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we  are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the  interests of South Africa above any party interest.    [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising  difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations  between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment?    [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are  obviously differences between us, but we are working together as  partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the  Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April  election.    [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and  AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization?    [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of  the fact that we are both organizations working for the  liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa.  However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is  exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election.  However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not  detract from its being an organization working for liberation.    [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC  could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is  your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in  government?    [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are  holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC  of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being  unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and  inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation  movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the  people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities.    [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international  economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are  they showing confidence in South Africa?    [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to  believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the  United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been  favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently  shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some  major international companies are still put off by the spread of  violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create  a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to  the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required  to attract further investment.    [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue  toward foreign companies?    [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids ""tyrannizing""  investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments  must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations  and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give  companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should  also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our  country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has  kept on the sidelines for a long time.    [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart  of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize,  apart from the South African people?    [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long-  suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize.  Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the  Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort  that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.

Created in 1986, the PNAFN was designed to help needy  families living below the poverty level and whose purchasing  power may deteriorate now that staple product prices are being  adjusted.    This program ""is part of the auxiliary measures provided  under the economic recovery plan in order to alleviate the  social impact of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) on poor  populations, living below the poverty level.""    Thus, in 1986 and 1992, the PNAFN spent as much as D93.834  millions, and projected 1993 expenditures alone amounted to  D26.26 millions.    According to a Ministry of Social Affairs survey of 61,000  heads of households covered by this program, the recipients are  as follows:     -  57 percent are women;    -  52 percent are over 60;    -  17.5  percent are handicapped;    -  3 percent are covered by Social  Security;    -  18 percent had a paying job at the time of the survey  (15.2 percent on construction sites, 4.5 percent in agriculture,  and 1 percent in services).    That last figure, according to the speaker, reflected one of  the inadequacies of the programs, which suffers from some  problems in targeting recipients.    Therefore, since 10 May 1993, the ministry has undertaken an  exhaustive survey of the 101,000 families covered by the program  and of another 59,000 families eligible for aid, in order to  update and overhaul the program and set up local, regional, and  central files on poverty.    Since that program alone is not adequate to ensure the  social  advancement of needy families, the Ministry of Social Affairs  believes that it must be supported by additional efforts. For  his part, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of  Social Affairs, made the following suggestions:     -  ""To make all participants aware of the social dimension of  any development efforts, and to improve the identification  capacity of social advancement projects.""    -  ""To finance social  advancement programs essentially through solidarity (private  efforts, especially foundations and non-governmental  organizations).""    -  ""To associate nongovernment organizations to  the application and management of social advancement projects.""    -  ""To adopt a consensual approach as to which indicators are to  be used by the various participants.""

Assistant Secretary General of the OAS, Christopher R.  Thomas, said a major objective of the assembly ""is to look at  ways of boosting and promoting development in the context of  consolidating democracy in the hemisphere"".    Development, he added, ""is at the core of the stability of  democracy and progress of most of the countries of the  hemisphere and so we must pay special attention to issues such  as critical poverty which threatens stability and democracy"".    According to Thomas, the special general assembly will also  examine the mechanisms through which OAS technical assistance is  provided so as to make such assistance more effective.    He said the assembly will consider a recommendation that two  instruments within the OAS responsible for the provision of  technical assistance - the Inter-American Council for Economic  and Social Affairs and the Council for Education, Science and  Cultural Affairs - be merged into a single council for integral  development.    The establishment of a single council, he said, will provide  for better coordination and serve to make OAS technical  assistance more effective and efficient.    ""I know there is some concern in the Caribbean that this new  development because of the emphasis it places on the  multilateral approach to providing technical assistance could  result in a reduction of such asssistance to our Caribbean  member-nations, but there is no tangible indication of this,"" he  said.    Mexico's permanent representative to the OAS, Ambassador  Alejandro Carrillo Castro, said the assembly was being convened  ""so that we can focus on the issue of critical poverty and take  advantage of this new mechanism to ensure the best use for all  of us of the resources at our disposal.""    Canada's permanent representative to the OAS, Brian Dickson,  chairs one of two sub-committees preparing for the special  general assembly.    He said in an interview that the establishment of a single  council for integral development within the OAS ""will help to  alleviate problems such as duplicaton and  over-bureaucratization"" which impede the effectiveness of  technical asssitance.    ""The OAS has made, we think, some very important efforts to  reform and to adapt itself to the beginning of a new century and  to respond to the new challenges which are before us.    ""We believe that the efforts it is making in the area of  technical assistance are very important in analyzing what the  OAS is doing now, how it could do things better and how it could  be more responsive to the needs of the hemisphere,"" Dixon said.

[passage omitted]    [Havel] I would like to say that the principle of civic  disobedience as such is a respectable form of defense by a group  of citizens in the conditions of a dictatorship, apartheid, and  so forth. In my view there is neither room, motive, nor logical  reason for such a principle of disobedience in a democracy where  power has really come from the people -- in free elections.    It also strikes me as somewhat alarming that this view is  voiced by an official of the party which has on many occasions  throughout its history proved its opposition to democracy. I  wonder if this appeal is not a harking back to the communist  methods of conquering power.    [Tamchyna] I hope it will not sound too lofty if I say that  all the world's eyes have over the past few days been focused  primarily on the Republic of South Africa [RSA], where the first  multiracial elections are over and the results known, and  probably no one expected those results and the new division of  political forces to solve all the problems of the Republic of  South Africa. My question is probably something like this: Will  the new political structure of the Republic of South Africa be  able to appreciate the concept of democracy not only in terms of  its advantages and rights but also with all the duties and  responsibilities it entails?    [Havel] The process of national liberation and extrication  from white domination is a logical, legitimate, and lawful one  which has taken place throughout the world, and I think that the  fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa is cause for  universal delight. The Republic of South Africa naturally faces  a difficult time ahead. All countries which freed themselves  from colonial domination have experienced and are still  experiencing difficult times, but they probably do have to pass  through this phase.    Since you are asking me, I would like to take the  opportunity  to praise the achievements of President de Klerk, who at one  time paid an official visit to our country during which we  talked at length. He really is a courageous man. He has made a  decisive contribution to these changes. He was well aware that  after putting into effect the changes he is now instituting and  which he considers to be right, he would lose the presidential  office. But he put justice before his own position. I think he  is a man who deserves worldwide recognition and who was rightly  awarded the Nobel prize. By this I do not mean to say that  Nelson Mandela did not deserve it.

Mr.  Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has decided to  suspend its participation in the electoral campaign in protest  against the assassination of three of its members, including a  deputy who was elected in the first round of the elections. The  CAR will not rescind its decision unless the security of its  members is totally guaranteed. Olabire da Cruz, who is in Lome,  explains the issue to Africa No. 1.    [Begin Cruz recording] Confirming the decision made by his  party's steering committee following a long meeting, CAR  Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor stated that this suspension will remain  in force until security is guaranteed for all candidates.  According to him, this is not possible for two of them at  present. Already, by early yesterday evening, the CAR's  decision was rather foreseeable, especially as this party and  its ally, Edem Kojo's party, had withdrawn from the state media  program arranged by the Ad Hoc Audiovisual Communications  Commission for 14 February. The Rally of the Togolese People,  the former single ruling party, therefore participated in the  program alone. All the same, it will not be surprising to see  CAR rescind its decision very rapidly.    Meanwhile, after vehemently condemning last weekend's  assassinations, the International Committee for Monitoring the  Ouagadougou Agreement did not hide its concern and fear for the  consequences that this act may have on the democratic process.  It therefore appealed for the restoration of confidence among  the various parties and hoped that security measures will be  taken as soon as possible.    Similarly, the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT] categorically  denied any implication in last weekend's assassinations. In a  statement, the FAT headquarters said that immediately a group of  people in military uniform does anything wrong, some  ill-intentioned and unscrupulous voices are raised and attribute  this to the security forces. A strong warning was sounded to  all those who use military uniforms to commit reproachful acts  in a bid to stain the honor of the Army. [end recording]     "

Several banks have been interviewed. Mr Etienne Calitz, director-general of the department of finance, said yesterday the multi-party Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which is in charge of government policy leading up to next month's elections, had compiled a shortlist of candidates. He declined to name the banks involved. However, they are thought to include First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers. The first task of the successful applicant will be to guide the new government through the delicate process of obtaining a credit rating from the two leading international rating agencies, Moody's and Standard  Poor's. Discussions with the agencies are expected to begin once the elections are over. South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating, as this would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. An investment-grade rating would also reduce South Africa's funding costs and allow a broader range of investors to buy its bonds. The adviser will be selected by the technical committee of the TEC's finance sub-council, which has the responsibility of drawing up a foreign loan finance strategy for the new government. The first foreign debt issue of a new government will be an important test of international confidence in South Africa's new administration, and of the ANC's economic policy in particular, given its likely victory in the April elections. Mr Calitz said a new issue would primarily have 'benchmark value'.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

When l was a student, l would use electronic mail. Soon, l will be able to talk to Joyce face-to-face, using the latest in video-conferencing systems. We can share access to current real-time and on-line communication systems, such as Internet. To communicate with Esi, my uncle in Lagos, is much harder. Although Nigeria is one of the most advanced African nations, communicating can be difficult. Even in the most cosmopolitan places there can be problems. In April 1992, the international phone service connecting the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Europe was down for nearly a week. In fact, there is a distinct feeling of remoteness whenever I try to contact my Nigerian relatives. Nigeria, like many developing countries, is not part of the new communications order. Along with many others in the west, I enjoy the latest in communications technology. Most Nigerians, however, do not have easy access to a telephone or computer - never mind the infrastructure of a modern global communications network. In the west, the humble telephone is taken for granted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use. Cheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while international rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people. By comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive. The other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution is the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications world; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African context. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has only 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages. The 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the world, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only Internet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire African continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national telecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone lines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does not even feature. At a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society, there is a danger that the developing countries will become further marginalised and impoverished. In all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications technology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect, created a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the developing countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to be applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of the developed nations. Yet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an essential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and television were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations between north and south. The US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds in developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are eagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies, Africa is largely an IT desert. We are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'. This is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the gap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under international investment programmes, could help to develop more modern industries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to help improve agricultural production.

AFRICA BLACKS, STUDENTS PROTEST ON EVE OF VOTE      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Police using whips and dogs broke up a protest march Tuesday in the sleepy  white college town of Stellenbosch, and hundreds of thousands of voteless  blacks nationwide began a two-day strike on the eve of elections that will be  the most severe test of white support for the government since it came to power  41 years ago.    South African whites will cast ballots today in parliamentary elections that  have been upstaged internationally by attempts to crush a monthlong black  defiance campaign organized to discredit the voting and protest apartheid laws  and police curbs on peaceful protest.    Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party is favored to extend its  rule for five more years with a slim majority in the controlling white chamber  of Parliament, which includes less powerful houses for mixed-race Coloreds and  Indians but no representation for blacks.      Could Lose Quarter of Seats    The National Party's own leaders predict that it could lose up to a fourth of  its seats to the right-wing Conservative Party and the liberal Democratic  Party. Such a swing would affect De Klerk's pledge to lead the country away  from the ""distrust, suspicion and fear"" that grip white and black South  Africans.    At stake in the elections is the pace of reform in South Africa, where 26  million blacks are ruled by 5 million whites under the system of racial  segregation called apartheid.    Many blacks consider the elections meaningless, and the call for workers and  students to stay away capped a campaign of civil disobedience that has touched  off dozens of bloody confrontations with the police, 1,600 arrests and, the  government says, 70 unrest-related deaths.    ""Any political activity that ignores black people is doomed,"" said Anglican  Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has been  arrested twice in the past week. ""The driving force of change in this country  lies among the disenfranchised, not in Parliament.""    On Tuesday, police dispersed more than 500 white students and black workers who  marched from the University of Stellenbosch, the alma mater of most of South  Africa's white leaders, to the center of that town in the lush wine country  near Cape Town. Demonstrators ran screaming through the streets when the police  unleashed dogs. Some protesters were beaten with whips, and dozens were  arrested.    In Pietermaritzburg, 450 college students and faculty members were arrested in  a similar march, organized to present a petition calling for an end to police  violence against peaceful protest.      Predict Spread of Strike    Black union leaders predicted that the worker strike would spread today, and  most black, mixed-race and Indian students across the country were boycotting  classes as well.    In an open letter to De Klerk on Tuesday, the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose  affiliation of most anti-apartheid groups in the country, said the elections  ""still symbolize apartheid and the perpetuation of white minority rule. We  therefore demand that our right to peaceful protest be respected. . . .""    The Mass Democratic Movement began the defiance campaign Aug. 2, when 270  ailing blacks sought treatment at whites-only hospitals. Since then, it has  targeted whites-only beaches and schools as well as state-of-emergency laws  that prohibit most anti-government activity from meetings to marches.    Meetings in churches were generally allowed by the government until Monday,  when riot police blocked the doors of two churches in downtown Cape Town and  arrested a dozen leading clerics, including Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, the  mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. They were  released after a few hours in jail.      Tutu Reconsecrates Cathedral    Tutu reconsecrated his cathedral Tuesday, telling parishioners that the police,  in ""a scandalous breach of religious liberty . . . sank to new depths when they  desecrated my cathedral.""    The government has attempted to justify its crackdown by contending that the  defiance campaign is orchestrated by the outlawed African National Congress to  violently disrupt the elections. However, defiance leaders say they are using  nonviolent protests to highlight the plight of the black majority.    Although the escalating unrest has sullied South Africa's image overseas, many  political analysts believe it may actually help the National Party in the  elections by driving whites fearful of a black revolution away from the more  liberal Democratic Party.    However, it may also slightly boost the far-right Conservative Party, which  says the unrest is an example of the trouble the government can expect if it  makes good on promises to dismantle apartheid.      Controls 123 of 166 Seats    The National Party now controls 123 of the 166 seats at stake in the white  chamber of Parliament, while the Conservatives have 22 seats and the Democrats  20. National Party leaders concede that they may lose 20 to 30 seats, reducing  their majority from the current 74% to as low as 56%.    Government opponents have predicted an even greater swing of seats, which would  create a ""hung Parliament"" in which no party has an outright majority. In that  case, the National Party would be forced to form an alliance with the right or  the left, analysts say.    The Conservatives' platform calls for stricter enforcement of apartheid and the  partitioning of South Africa into separate white and black states. The  Democrats support a one-person, one-vote system that would bring blacks into  government on an equal footing with whites.    The National Party, which came to power in 1948 on a platform of strict racial  segregation, has sought the political middle ground. While De Klerk remains  committed to racially segregated schools, hospitals and residential areas, he  has promised to start negotiations with black leaders and draw up a new  constitution to share power but prevent ""black domination.""      Voting for All 3 Houses    The voting is for all three houses of Parliament, the white chamber as well as  smaller chambers representing the country's 3 million mixed-race Coloreds and 1  million Indians.    Black leaders have declined to endorse any party.    ""The elections are a non-issue,"" said Hilda Ndude, Western Cape publicity  secretary for the United Democratic Front, the 2-million-member anti-apartheid  coalition banned from political activity.

""The country at large has  been caught up in social turbulance since Sharpeville, since  before Mr Mandela went to jail. and the backwash swirls around  him: unrealistic expectations, lingering angers and spites,  destructive behaviour designed to make a country ungovernable  rather than to make it succeed, and habits of dependency,  resentment and irresponsibility."" And the ""greatest threat to  the future"" is the ""flight of capital, the wariness of investors  that arise from perceptions of crime, random violence, labor  indiscipline, rampant white-collar crime, fiscal profligacy,  ostentatious mandarism and all the other social ills the country  inherits from the NP [National Party]."" ""Mr Mandela's first  challenge is to set a different tone"" and deal with a civil  service ""adept at looting, a parasite class."" ""Mr Mandela is the  only leader in a generation who has had the moral stature to  call this nation back to work, to impose a stern discipline and  to command patience. He should not hesitate to impose on his  administration his own instincts for order, frugality and  propriety.""    SUNDAY NATION    Vigilance -- Following the inauguration last week, this  country is ""bound together with a sense of optimism about the  future,"" ""the unfolding process could certainly represent a  genuine change of fortune for the country -- but only if some of  the basic needs of the deprived majority see signs that their  vote is working for them to usher a new era,"" an editorial in  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on May 15 on page 10 states.  Strikes in Transkei, Bophuthatswana and among Eastern and  Western Cape interpreters ""mark the beginning of many tests  which our newly-found freedom will be subjected to"" and ""further  trouble could either be contained or be allowed to spread to  areas like Ciskei, Venda, Lebowa and even Qwaqwa."" ""It is true  that in our newly-attained democracy, the right to strike is  part of the workers' democratic right in order to achieve their  desired result. But this should take place in a disciplined  fashion."" ""Our liberation was a costly one and we need to defend  it with everything at our disposal. Should we relax, we should  know that we are sitting on a powder keg which will consume all.""    BEELD    RSA Can Be Rainbow of Hope -- ""Yesterday at the Union  Buildings the world was witness to the formal birth of a new  South Africa committed to justice, peace, and dignity for all  its people,"" says a page 12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 11 May. ""President Nelson Mandela said after his  inauguration before world leaders that we are a rainbow nation  which has made peace with itself and the world. The leaders who  cheered his statement are now morally bound to help make the new  South Africa a success in its growth and development. But their  role is limited. The lead will still have to be given by  President Mandela and deputy Presidents F. W. de Klerk and Thabo  Mbeki. However, ""they cannot tackle the great task ahead alone.  There rests on the shoulders of all of us a great  responsibility. The people who set aside their grievances to  stand peacefully and patiently in line to vote will now have to  work hard to maintain peace and reconciliation, and make South  Africa a country of security and prosperity for all its people.""  ""If South Africa can achieve success, it will be a rainbow of  hope and promise to the rest of the world.""    Constsructive U. S. Approach Welcomed -- A second editorial  on page 12 of BEELD argues: ""The presence in South Africa of a  high level U. S. government delegation led by Vice President Al  Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Trade Secretary Ron Brown  is more significant that it would appear on the surface. Not  only do they represent the most senior U. S. delegation yet to  visit South Africa; their visit follows shortly after the  announcement of the `Clinton Plan' of economic and social  upliftment for South Africa involving 2.16 billion rands over  the next 3 years. It also follows on the U. S. President's  earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in  the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton  administration is busy putting words into action and reaching  out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done.  This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7  countries -- could provide the spark which the South African  economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually  contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach  is most welcome.""    Police Now Serve Accepted Government -- A third editorial on  the same page quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu's statement in Cape  Town on Monday that the police deserve praise for their role  that day, and his reference to them as ""our police."" BEELD  continues: ""These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive  new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African  society."" ""That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South  Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the  force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional  dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a  minority government, but of a generally accepted government of  all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the  development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new  symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal  the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact,  it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,'  it's `our country.'""     "

The communique, signed by the Mexico City Urban Front of the  EZLN, stated that ""we are struggling against the violence of  poverty and hunger, against the violence of the electoral farce  and unemployment, and against the disease of the poor. We are  fighting for socialism.""    The communique added that ""we are considered outlaws because  we are doing this,"" but one ""cannot consider it legal when our  demands for a better future are massacred with bombs. We also  have a right to speak, but unfortunately the government only  understands the language of weapons.""    After making its accusations against the Army, the EZLN  urged  the Mexican soldiers not to kill innocent people. ""If you have  any courage, you must admit that you can no longer tolerate the  look of hunger on the faces of our children. If you commit  murder, we will be implacable. Refuse to kill honest Mexicans,""  the communique stated.    The rebels said they will not carry out any attacks in  Mexico  City, then asked: ""Have you not yet seen that economic  liberalism has failed? Do you not yet understand that other  brotherly peoples of the hemisphere will follow us?""    The EZLN also sent a public message to Guatemalan Indian  leader Rigoberta Menchu, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize,  indicating that it is aware of the problems afflicting the  Guatemalan refugees in Mexico and that ""perhaps now the Mexican  state will no longer be interested in keeping up the facade of  protecting refugees in its efforts to implement its repressive  policy in the fields of Chiapas and throughout Mexico.""    The communique added: ""Do not be surprised if the government  withdraws its support from the refugees, begins to repress them,  and accuses them of participating in our struggle. That  irresponsible rumor is already circulating among the  authorities, who are always ready to seek obscure and disguised  enemies where there is only one answer to hunger and oppression.""    The Mexican Government had circulated the rumor that there  were Central Americans among the rebels. On Wednesday the  National Defense Secretariat announced that one Guatemalan had  been arrested, and Deputy Government Secretary Socorro Diaz read  a communique stating that the guerrillas are directed by  ""foreign and national"" experts.    The EZLN reiterated that it bases its uprising on the  Constitution and advised Rigoberta Menchu ""to consider our  struggle as nothing but a desire to rid ourselves of 500 years  of poverty and oppression.""

Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year. However, Mr van Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.' His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern Africa could cause famine in much of the region. The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on the average. It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food. Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most seriously affected. The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for southern Africa this year. Total food imports for the region could be as high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year. Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said, with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail wagons. It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq and the Horn of Africa.

The homeland's commissioner of police, Major General Manyane  Noqayi, has been taken hostage by striking policemen and is  being held along with about 30 of his officers at the police  college in Bisho. A spokesman for the striking policemen said  Brigadier Gqozo would be taken to the Bisho Independence Stadium  this morning to address the armed forces. The estimated 3,000  policemen who commandeered the police college said earlier that  they would only accept the fact that Brigadier Gqozo had  resigned if he informed them in person. The policemen, whose  ranks were bolstered by Ciskeian soldiers who refused an order  to surround the college, are sticking to their demands before  releasing the hostages. The demands include pension payouts and  an investigation into corruption among senior police officers.    Earlier, Brigadier Gqozo resigned and asked that South  Africa  take over the administration of Ciskei. South African minister  of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, said SADF [South African Defense  Force] troops along the border with Ciskei have been put on  standby in case they were needed to be deployed in Ciskei. The  number of hostages being held by the striking policemen has  grown to 42, and includes five women. A spokesman for the  striking policemen said they had asked the ANC [African National  Congress] to send marshals to protect businesses and government  buildings in Ciskei. He said they did not want a repeat of the  disruption which had occurred in Bophuthatswana.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has decided that  two  administrators should be appointed to run Ciskei. The council  would appoint one administrator and the government the other.

Since the two countries  established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed  smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations  and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close  attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan  Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts  it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that  the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an  early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability.    He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal  affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's  development. China hopes that African countries will realize  peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly  relations.    Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in  Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build  themselves according to their own situations. If big powers  really care about Africa, they should not fill out a  prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer  aid to Africa to promote its economic development.    Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in  Angola.  He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and  economic support that his country has received from the Chinese  Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for  national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on  one side. Following major changes in the international  situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together.    Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand  that  there is only one China, and that it will never develop any  official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that  economic relations and trade between the two countries will be  further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.     "

0,FT942-4204 ,"FT942-4204 _AN-EFJCMAF0FT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Chemicals vital for African agriculture'      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   Africa will have to start using large amounts of chemical fertilisers if the continent is ever to solve its own food problems, according to Mr Norman Borlaug, a prominent agriculturalist, who won the Nobel Peace prize in 1970 for engineering India's 'green' revolution. Mr Borlaug told a meeting at the Overseas Development Institute yesterday: 'Some people say that Africa's food problems can be solved without the application of chemical fertilisers. They're dreaming. It's not possible'. He said that the environmentalists advocating traditional farming methods failed to recognise the rapid growth in population expected in the continent. The population of sub-Saharan Africa was set to double in the next 22 years, he claimed, which would put a considerable strain on non-chemical farming. China had managed to transform its production of cereals in the five years between 1975 and 1980, increasing yields by a tonne a hectare by using chemical fertilisers, Mr Borlaug said. China's output of cereals had risen from 238m tonnes to 285m tonnes during that period even though farmers had already been using organic compost on the land. Today China produced the most cereals in the world with average yields of 4 tonnes per hectare, Mr Borlaug said. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest use of fertiliser in the world and soil nutrients were so low that other efforts to raise crop productivity would not be successful until fertility was improved. Mr Borlaug said, however, that it was extremely expensive for African countries to import fertiliser, and he called on industrialised nations to provide the continent's farmers with access to adequate inputs.

Implementing the ""80-Million-People  Seven-Year Plan"" and Helping Impoverished Regions Change Their  Backwardness Is the Historical Responsibility of the Party and  the Government    It has been seven or eight years since we began assisting  the  poor in development on a large scale across the country. Since  we have always stuck to the principle of assisting the poor in  development, we have obtained very great achievements. Vast  numbers of cadres and people in impoverished regions across the  country have made huge efforts on this, and various relevant  quarters, both in the central and local authorities and all  circles in society, have given vigorous support, thus making an  important contribution to assisting the poor in development.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping says socialism is about eliminating  poverty. This is a long-term and arduous historical task. The  task of the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan,"" as was  discussed at the meeting, is to resolve the problem of food and  clothing for 80 million people in the seven years from now to  the end of this century and to help them escape poverty and  attain prosperity. This is an unshirkable historical  responsibility of our generation of communists and the people's  governments at all levels.    Completing the task of the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year  Plan"" is of great significance. First, it has a bearing on  whether or not we can satisfactorily achieve the second-step  strategic goal of China's modernization. At present, everyone  across the country is striving hard with a view to doubling GNP  again and allowing the people to lead a comparatively  comfortable life. If the problem of clothing and food for tens  of millions of people in China remains unsolved by the end of  this century, then we cannot say that the second-step strategic  goal has been satisfactorily achieved. Second, it has a bearing  on whether or not our party and the people's government stick to  the goal of attaining common prosperity. The PRC will have  through half a century by the year 2000. If, in struggling for  two generations, tens of millions of people still cannot solve  the problem of food and clothing, but live in poverty, how can  we embody the aim of communists wholeheartedly serving the  people? How can we bring to light the superiority of the  socialist system? Whenever we, communists at all levels who  shoulder heavy responsibilities, recall this question, we will  feel uneasy when eating and sleeping. The ""80-Million-People  Seven-Year Plan"" formulated by the State Council is determined  to steadily solve the food and clothing problem of the masses by  the end of this century. We must never postpone the problem to  the next century. This is a major strategic plan which is of  significance both economically and politically and which must be  carried out without failure. Leading comrades in party  committees and governments at all levels and comrades in charge  of all quarters and divisions must consider this task an  important matter, attach great importance to it, do it properly,  and strive to complete it as scheduled.    II. Implementing the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan""  and Assisting Impoverished Regions To Develop Their Economies Is  a Strategic Measure To Gradually Narrow the Difference Between  the Eastern and Western Regions    Of the 80 million people throughout the country at present  who have not completely and steadily solved the problem of food  and clothing, over 80 percent are concentrated in the central  and western regions, and most are concentrated in the southwest  and northwest. Speaking in this sense, solving the problem of  food and clothing for the masses in impoverished regions and  helping them escape poverty and attain prosperity is a question  of gradually narrowing the difference between the eastern and  western regions.    On this question, we should have a correct and comprehensive  understanding. 1) Differences exist objectively. The  development of things is unbalanced. There are differences  between different countries around the world and differences  also exist within countries. This is determined by historical,  natural, geographical, social, economic, and other factors. It  is impossible to completely eliminate differences within a short  time. 2) We should gradually narrow differences with a  positive attitude with a view to eliminating them in the end.  We will stick to the policy of encouraging some people and  areas to get rich first through honest labor and legitimate  operations so they can bring along and help the development of  backward areas in order to achieve the goal of ultimately  attaining the common prosperity of the whole nation. If all are  poor, then nobody can help. Only when some areas are a little  developed earlier and have stronger economic strength will they  be in a position to help the backward areas. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said: ""Poverty is not socialism (The Collected Works  of Deng Xiaoping, Volume Three p 225)."" He also said:  ""Socialism is not where a small number of people are rich while  the majority of people are poor.""    ""The greatest superiority  of socialism is common prosperity. This is something that  reflects the nature of socialism (p 364, the same volume)."" In  order to narrow differences and achieve common prosperity, we  have already done a great deal of work. Viewing the matter  vertically, we see when comparing ourselves that both developed  areas and impoverished areas are developing. Viewing it  horizontally, the difference between impoverished and developed  areas is tending to widen. Therefore, we must draw the great  attention of party committees and governments at all levels,  adopt effective measures, and make efforts to narrow differences  between regions.    Encourage and urge advanced coastal areas which have  become prosperous first and large and medium-sized cities to  bring along and help the impoverished regions. Generally  speaking, there are two channels to help and assist impoverished  regions. The first channel is that we distribute national  income a second time through the state and then tilt toward the  impoverished regions. The second channel is that we have those  who have become prosperous first help and assist those who will  become prosperous later. Big cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and  Shanghai, as well as the coastal provinces whose economies are  comparatively developed, all have this responsibility and  obligation. But this does not mean the simple uncompensated  supply of money and goods, but union and cooperation on the  basis of common development mainly through mutual benefit and  reciprocality. There are varied forms. They can jointly  exploit resources and transform the resource advantages into  economic advantages. They can offer technical support to help  upgrade quality and product standards and enhance the ability of  economic growth. They can offer a stable sales market to  encourage the development of production. They can offer  employment opportunities through the importation of labor  services. They should combine the resource advantages and labor  advantages of impoverished regions with the technology,  information, and capital advantages of the developed regions to  achieve a rational allocation of resources. This is both  beneficial to the development of impoverished regions and  developed regions and to the coordinated developed of the entire  national economy. This kind of cooperation is worthy of  vigorous promotion and must be carried out.    The state will give sufficient financial and monetary  support to impoverished regions. To assist the poor in  development, there must of course be appropriate capital inputs.  Without inputs, there will be no output, nor will there be  enough food and clothing or development. Over the years,  financial authorities and banks at all levels have made very  great efforts to increase inputs to assist the poor in  development, and they have attained good results. But in our  work to assist the poor, we have now entered a stage where major  difficulties have to be tackled. As time is very limited, it is  will be very difficult to completely and steadily resolve the  problem of food and clothing for the masses by the end of this  century. Without corresponding guarantees of capital, it will be  very difficult to do so. The State Council has already decided  to provide an additional one billion yuan of work relief funds  and one billion yuan of poverty-assistance credits at discount  interest rates [tie xi dai kuan 6317 1873 6313 2949] beginning  this year. In the future, as financial strength expands, the  state will continue to increase inputs to assist the poor.  Local governments at all levels should also increase inputs in  impoverished regions accordingly. The three municipalities of  Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the six coastal  provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, and  Liaoning, should raise their own poverty-assistance funds. The  central authorities' poverty-assistance funds will be  concentrated in the poverty-stricken central and western  provinces (regions).    To increase inputs in poverty assistance, we cannot merely  depend on the government, but also forces in society must pool  poverty-assistance funds in various areas within the scope  allowed by state policy.    The state should tilt major projects toward  impoverished regions. Although impoverished regions in the  western regions are comparatively poor at present, they are rich  in resources, which is a big advantage. When formulating  development plans, all divisions of the State Council should  fully consider this advantage. They should arrange for some  resource exploitation projects of a comparatively large scale  and some infrastructural projects for impoverished regions in  keeping with the principle of giving equal priority.  Fundamentally speaking, in order to thoroughly change the  backwardness of impoverished regions, we should, to a very large  extent, depend on the impetus of these key large-scale projects.    Gradually straighten out prices of raw materials and  primary products through reform. Under the previous  planned economic structure, prices of raw materials and primary  products were very low, and prices of farm products were not  high either. Presently, the price structure and the circulation  structure are being reformed in keeping with the requirements of  establishing a socialist market economic structure. As reform  is deepening, it will be possible to achieve exchange at equal  prices for timber, petroleum, coal, nonferrous metals, and all  other resources in nationwide integrated markets and developed  areas. This is an important measure to promote the development  of the central and western regions. The impoverished central  and western regions should also use the favorable opportunity of  reform and opening up to develop themselves.    Improve the quality of personnel and scientific and  technological levels in impoverished regions. This is a  very important measure of fundamental significance. Over the  years, we have had very good progress in training personnel in  impoverished regions and in exchanging cadres between the  western and eastern regions. We should continuously stick to  this and expand it. There are now two kinds of noteworthy  large-scale flows across the country. The first is that of the  labor force flowing from the west to the east and that the scale  of labor service exports is continuously expanding. The second  is that craftsmen and skilled personnel are flowing from the  east to the west and that they are found in every corner of the  cities and countryside of the western regions.    The flow of  labor from the west to the east not only enables impoverished  regions to participate in the development of the national  economy by making use of the large numbers of employment  opportunities created by developed coastal regions, but can also  improve the quality of laborers in impoverished regions. This  is a special kind of training. The flow of craftsmen and  skilled personnel from the east to the west is, in fact, a kind  of technology export. It can improve the technological level  and expertise of impoverished regions in a more effective and  more practical form. These two flows are of very great  significance to improving the quality of laborers and improving  scientific and technological levels and must be fully affirmed  and continuously developed. As for the large-scale ""wave of  migrant workers,"" we must not let it flow freely but should  actively divert it and rationalize its flow in an orderly way to  reduce confusion in social order and economic losses.    It is necessary to experiment with open-style poverty  assistance on the basis of sticking to developmental poverty  assistance. In order for impoverished regions to develop,  they surely need to develop township and town enterprises and  develop their tertiary industry. While setting up township and  town enterprises in these regions, we can also experiment with  developing industry in areas with appropriate conditions by  giving profits and tax income back to the impoverished regions  and arrange for the employment of the labor force in these  regions. This may overcome the unfavorable position of  impoverished regions in developing enterprises and is beneficial  to enhancing the efficiency of enterprises, enhancing the  efficiency of poverty-assistance funds, and upgrading  poverty-assistance work overall.    Mobilize forces in society to support the development  and construction of impoverished regions. Over the years,  various quarters, including state organs, mass organizations,  democratic parties, large and medium-sized cities, developed  regions, industrial and commercial enterprises, universities and  colleges, scientific research academies and institutes, and the  People's Liberation Army have carried forward the spirit of  assisting and aiding the poor and have actively participated in  the development and construction of the impoverished regions.  In addition to giving financial and material support, they have  utilized their own advantages and assisted the poor with their  knowledge, science and technology, and talented personnel. They  have acted as go-betweens for impoverished regions, come up with  proposals and plans, and introduced projects and technology to  them. They have undertaken to help a region until it finally  gets out of poverty and attains prosperity. All these methods  have made important contributions to poverty-assistance work at  the previous stage. This not only reflects the affectionate  concern of all circles in society for the impoverished regions  but also embodies the traditional virtues of our Chinese nation.  We hope that all circles in society can further mobilize  themselves, have genuine affection and love, and make  contributions. Here we have to specifically stress that I hope  that large state industrial and commercial and foreign-trade  enterprises extend to the impoverished regions, set up projects  there, choose projects with good efficiency, and combine their  own development with the development of the impoverished regions.    Alleviating poverty and eliminating poverty is a global  issue. It is also the duty of the United Nations and numerous  other international organizations. China's elimination of  poverty is part and parcel of the world's elimination of  poverty. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation  between China and international organizations in assisting the  poor in development so that the international community can  better understand and support China's poverty-assistance work.    Impoverished regions should carry forward the spirit of  self-reliance and arduous struggle. Support from the state  and help from society are both necessary, but the efforts of the  impoverished regions themselves are more important. External  factors act through internal factors. Henan's Lin County and  many other counties, townships, and villages that have become  prosperous first have a history of arduously pioneering a cause.  We should learn from their spirit and experiences. Only when  we have this can we overcome difficulties, escape poverty, and  attain prosperity. Moreover, we should pay attention to picking  good cadres who have a spirit of making sacrifices, who can bear  hardships and stand hard work, and who maintain ties with the  masses; consolidate leading groups at all levels in impoverished  counties; maintain relative stability; and allow them to rest  assured and lead the masses in changing their backwardness.    III. In Implementing ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan,""  We Should Carry Out the Provincial Governor Responsibility  System, in Which Responsibility Rests at Every Level, Mainly at  the Provincial Level, Under the Unified Leadership of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council    I agree to the principle of unified leadership with  responsibility resting at every level and mainly at the  provincial level stressed in the 80-Million-People Seven-Year  Plan. Taking the provincial level as the mainstay demands that  the major responsible comrades in the provincial CPC committee  and provincial government care for and pay good attention to  assisting the poor. We should be clear about one point,  however, namely that the provincial governor takes charge.  Implementing the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan"" and  solving the problem of food and clothing for the masses is a  systematic project. It involves such economic activities as  finance, banking, agriculture, water works, industry, and  commerce, as well as various aspects such as culture, education,  public health, and family planning. Practice over the years  proves that it is not enough for vice governors to take charge  separately as it is very difficult to coordinate various aspects  and various quarters. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the  head of the government to take charge of everything and make  overall plans and arrangements.    The very criterion with which to measure whether or not  leading cadres at all levels really work for the benefit of the  people and care for the plight of the people is whether or not  they can complete the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan"" as  scheduled and solve the problem of food and clothing for the  poor population of their own localities. When determining the  good and bad work of a province, region, or municipality, we  must not merely look at the rate at which its economy grows but  also at whether its efficiency is good or bad, whether the  people's living standards have improved quickly or not, and how  well the problem of food and clothing for the poor population  has been solved. Our leading comrades at all levels must not  merely pay attention to developed regions, but must all the more  place in their hearts the plight and warmth of the ordinary  people of the impoverished regions. All provinces, regions, and  municipalities must formulate their own plans in keeping with  the demands of the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan."" They  must set demands for progress and make specific plans regarding  how many people have had their problems solved this year, how  many will have their problems solved next year, and how the  problem has been solved. They should conduct an inspection each  year during which the good will be commended and the bad  criticized so that everyone is urged to complete their tasks as  scheduled and do not slacken their efforts at all.    All divisions of the government should continue to make it  their unshirkable duty to assist the poor in development. In  addition to mainly helping a particular impoverished region,  they must formulate poverty-assistance plans for their own  business or division in keeping with the tasks set forth by the  ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan"" as specific contents and  measures for implementing the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year  Plan.""    Implementing the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan"" is an  arduous and glorious duty. I believe that as long as everyone  has confidence, is united as one, makes concerted efforts, and  courageously tackles difficulties, we will surely be able to  achieve the goal of the ""80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan"" by  the end of this century, and the economic and social development  of the impoverished regions will enter a new stage.

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Before the revolution, the regime did not pay much  attention to ties with Africa in its foreign policy. After the  revolution, for various reasons, that attention was considerably  increased. There was first the expansion of diplomatic ties.  The next step was the expansion of cultural, economic,  commercial, and industrial ties. By the expansion of industrial  ties, I mean those countries are eager to use Iran's industrial  goods. During that period there were very good examples of  cooperation with those countries in that field. The inception  of temporary or permanent trade and industrial exhibitions in  some countries was one of the first steps taken and was very  successful in those countries.    One of the main reasons for the extraordinary welcome by all  the African countries in which we opened exhibitions is that not  many countries can compete with Iranian prices, while the  quality of our goods is relatively high, particularly the  quality of goods offered there. In some commercial and economic  fields, the private sector could definitely be more active, and  in some other fields the public sector. Without exception all  the African countries we visited asked for the expansion of  economic and commercial cooperation.    [Correspondent] To what extent could cooperation with Africa  help our presence on the international scene?    [Velayati] Because of the end of the cold war, some Western  countries are today interfering more blatantly in the internal  affairs of Third World countries, particularly African  countries, without any consideration for their endemic  characteristics. They have disturbed the situation in some  African countries. The people of Africa are wise to this and,  therefore, seek cooperation with countries that have  particularly more influence on the international scene.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much.

0,FT942-11797 ,"FT942-11797 _AN-EEDEHADIFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: South Africa looks forward   South Africa's transition from minority rule to democracy is something to celebrate. Not even the painfully inefficient election count can spoil an event of such moment and one whose significance extends well beyond the region. A stable, democratic and economically successful South Africa might yet offer hope for a continent debilitated by debt, disaster and disease. It could even become a model for other countries where ethnic and racial tensions present seemingly insuperable barriers to economic progress. Fulfilment of these hopes will be as difficult as the transition itself, but South Africa has made an encouraging start. President FW de Klerk has left office with a grace that has enhanced his reputation and augurs well for his expected role as second vice president. General Constand Viljoen, the former armed services chief, steered the conservative right away from confrontation and into the election. He deserves credit for defusing what could have been a destabilising clash. Above all, the president-elect, Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the victorious African National Congress, is preparing for office with the pragmatism and compassion that is his hallmark. With the grim legacy of apartheid all around him, he was right to strike a note of urgency in his victory speech on Monday night, promising that he and his team will roll up their sleeves and get South Africa back to work. Cabinet places He was also wise to offer places in his cabinet to parties which failed to reach the 5 per cent that would give them automatic representation in a government of national unity: the liberal Democratic party, the radical Pan Africanist Congress and Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front, which seeks reassurance that Afrikaner culture will survive. It would be wise to extend a similar invitation to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, although his Inkatha Freedom party may have attracted sufficient votes to secure it a cabinet seat. Chief Buthelezi's difficulties with the ANC and its leader are well-known. Yet nothing can be lost by attempting to bring this prickly personality into the fold. In selecting his cabinet Mr Mandela must also look beyond his domestic constituency. A careful balance is needed to reassure international investors, who look for stability. They will wish to see continuity of the sound economic policies that have characterised the transition. The retention of Mr Derek Keys, the present finance minister, in one of the main economic portfolios would constitute a clear signal that this is understood. Mr Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank, should be asked to stay in his job. It may be difficult for Mr Mandela but room should be found for both men, not as token whites but as key players in South Africa's new economic team. Investment code Mr Mandela must also be on his guard against those who argue for an investment code. Rev Leon Sullivan, the US-based campaigner, achieved some success in urging foreign companies who decided to maintain their operations in the old South Africa to end discrimination on the shop floor, introduce training programmes and accept social responsibilities in the black community. He and others now advocate similar terms for would-be foreign investors. These objectives are well-meant, but to make them a condition displays a misunderstanding of the tough competition for investment. No lobby urges the same conditions for other developing nations. Some investors are showing strong interest in post-apartheid South Africa, whether as a market in its own right, or as a base for operations in the rest of Africa. Yet the new government is in no position to lay down terms that might drive investment capital to more attractive Asian homes. Indeed, Mr Mandela should bear Asian lessons closely in mind as he looks to the future. That implies a market-driven exchange rate, a competitive business environment, a close partnership between government and the private sector, trade liberalisation, encouragement of multinationals with their worldwide marketing facilities, technology and management skills and an efficient civil service. He will best serve the new South Africa if he applies these principles. He might also then galvanise the rest of Africa, for whom he is already an inspiration.

Mandela, a political storm already was  brewing over whether the move warrants relaxation of U.S. sanctions against  South Africa.    From his retreat at Camp David, Bush telephoned South African President  Frederik W. de Klerk and ""pledged U.S. willingness to help create a climate for  negotiations"" between the nation's white minority leadership and its black  majority.    Bush also invited the South African leader for talks at the White House, adding  that Mandela would also be invited after his scheduled release today from 27  years of imprisonment.    In a separate statement, Bush praised De Klerk for showing ""bold and  imaginative leadership in recent days, which has earned the admiration of many  of us who hope for swift and peaceful evolution in South Africa.""    Under De Klerk, South Africa has legalized the African National Congress and  about 60 other banned political groups, freed leading black prisoners and  pledged to negotiate a new constitution. In his dramatic announcement Saturday,  De Klerk also said that a nationwide state of emergency would be lifted if no  further violence accompanied Mandela's release.    Although Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman J. Cohen said  De Klerk's initiatives could lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions ""within the  next few weeks,"" black leaders and key lawmakers cautioned the Administration  not to move too fast.    California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus, said the United States ""should continue to use the moral and  economic lever of even more stringent sanctions as a vehicle for helping to  accelerate the end of apartheid in a nonviolent context.    ""While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost three decades of  imprisonment for his political beliefs,"" Dellums said, ""I am concerned that no  mention has been made about the release of more than 2,000 other black South  Africans still in prison because of their struggle to end apartheid.""    The issue of imprisoned blacks has been controversial because many held on  criminal charges are considered by black opposition leaders to be political  prisoners.    Sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 over President Ronald Reagan's veto  prohibit new U.S. investment and bank loans in South Africa; bar imports of  South African iron, steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products; outlaw  sales of computers to South Africa, and prohibit U.S. landings by South African  Airways.    Under the terms of the law, Bush is empowered to modify or suspend the  sanctions if political prisoners are freed and if South Africa meets any three  of four other conditions.    The four conditions are:     -- Repealing the 1986 state of emergency.     -- Lifting a ban on democratic political parties and allowing all races to  participate in the political process.     -- Repealing the Group Areas Act, the apartheid law dictating where blacks can  live and work.     -- Negotiating with the black majority without preconditions.    The 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency allows South African police to detain  suspects for up to six months without charging them or bringing them to trial.  It also allows the government to restrict protests and to bar the press from  areas of unrest.    Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), House majority whip and author of the 1986  sanctions legislation, also indicated his opposition to a quick lifting to  sanctions.    ""Just because we freed one man doesn't mean that we freed an entire nation,""  Gray said.    Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, an anti-apartheid group,  also argued against lifting sanctions.    ""Clearly, the U.S. has played a significant role in bringing the South African  government to this historic point,"" Robinson said. ""Progress could be seriously  stalled by the failure of the U.S. and European governments to maintain  sanctions and continue pressure for further reform.""    Robinson termed Mandela's release ""a tiny step on a long road to dismantling  the apartheid system.""    Last week, President Bush hinted that he was interested in lifting sanctions.    ""I think when people move in the right direction, it is certainly time to  review all policy,"" he said.    Administration sources stressed that Bush would not move precipitously without  consulting Congress. But a congressional source involved in the issue expressed  concern that the White House might try to loosen sanctions before serious  negotiations between South Africa's blacks and whites are under way.    Among the possible first steps would be lifting the ban on landing rights for  South African Airways, the source said.    Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on African affairs,  announced that he was ""indefinitely suspending"" further action by his  subcommittee on a bill that would expand existing sanctions. But Simon also  noted that Mandela's release and the conditional pledge to lift the state of  emergency in South Africa ""still fall short of an end to apartheid, and it is  premature for the United States to begin lifting sanctions at this point.""    Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa who met  with De Klerk in South Africa last month, urged the Administration to be ""very  careful"" in handling the issue.    ""There are still hundreds upon hundreds of political prisoners in South African  jails, and the emergency is still in effect,"" Wolpe said in an interview. ""The  situation must be created in South Africa where anti-apartheid activists are as  free as the government party to organize, to move about the country and to  speak freely. Then we can talk about beginning negotiations.""    Wolpe also called on the White House to use as a model America's recent  approach to events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.    ""We did not move prematurely in relaxing pressures in place (in Eastern Europe)  until we believed that the process of change was irreversible and that  fundamental change was occurring,"" he said.

But Simon also  noted that Mandela's release and the conditional pledge to lift the state of  emergency in South Africa ""still fall short of an end to apartheid, and it is  premature for the United States to begin lifting sanctions at this point.""    Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa who met  with De Klerk in South Africa last month, urged the Administration to be ""very  careful"" in handling the issue.    ""There are still hundreds upon hundreds of political prisoners in South African  jails, and the emergency is still in effect,"" Wolpe said in an interview. ""The  situation must be created in South Africa where anti-apartheid activists are as  free as the government party to organize, to move about the country and to  speak freely. Then we can talk about beginning negotiations.""    Wolpe also called on the White House to use as a model America's recent  approach to events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.    ""We did not move prematurely in relaxing pressures in place (in Eastern Europe)  until we believed that the process of change was irreversible and that  fundamental change was occurring,"" he said. ""I hope we do not have a double  standard as we approach South Africa.""

'We are in a position that when it is appropriate we can apply,' he said, welcoming a favourable US State Department pronouncement. The statement had been long in preparation but was made 'more pointed' after the by-election defeat of the National party at the hands of the right-wing Conservative party on Wednesday. It acknowledged that economic conditions in South Africa, with severe unemployment, will 'have a direct and decisive impact on the success of the new democracy which emerges from the current negotiations'. The State Department, while vague on its IMF policy, said the US was 'prepared to consider a proposal' for an IMF facility. A provision of law, the Gramm amendment, prohibits US support for an IMF facility unless four conditions are met. A Department spokesman said three had been, but it was not yet clear the fourth had. That requires South Africa to seek balance of payments support from the private markets before going to the IMF. Mr Michael Christie, Washington director of the South Africa Foundation, a private-sector South African group, said he had been privately assured the US would now back an IMF facility. The timing was subject to debate because inflation was now 15 per cent. But he said the country, which now desperately needs to expand its economy through imports, had the option of going to the IMF. A formal finding by President Bush earlier this week that South Africa has made 'significant progress toward the elimination of apartheid' has paved the way for new Eximbank lending to the South African government. 'We are also encouraging US exports to non-governmental South African importers who have endorsed and proceeded toward the implementation of fair labour standards,' the state department added. 'If the Secretary of State certified that a South African firm meets these standards, US exporters to such a firm would also be eligible for Eximbank support.' Companies owned by non-whites are exempt from any requirements.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Here is the full text of the royal speech delivered before  delegations of over 124 countries: ""Mr. Chairman, honorable  premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. Director General, honorable  delegates, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,    We, and the world at large with us, have just crossed a  watershed, one of those decisive moments in history in which  mankind unfailingly taps its wellspring of energy and  psychological strength to launch a new grand design, conjure up  hope of a brighter future and dispel the specter of despondency  or disheartenment.    The atmosphere of this moment we are sharing calls to mind  the unforgettable memory of the Anfa conference that took place  in Casablanca in 1943, at which we had the privilege of  accompanying his majesty our father, may God have him in his  mercy. The purpose of the conference, attended notably by  President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, was to prepare  the allied disembarkation in Europe, but it marked the beginning  not only of the allies' long march to victory but also of the  far-reaching movement of liberation of the people still under  colonial rule.    Those men, whose action and abnegation restored freedom and  democracy in the world, knew that the cessation of hostilities  was not the same thing as peace, and that as the same causes  will produce the same effects, they would be unable to establish  enduring peace except in a setting favorable to lasting economic  growth. The lessons they drew from the 1930s and in particular  from the impact of protectionism on world-wide economic activity  and security decisively shaped the drafting of the San Francisco  Charter and the Bretton Woods Agreements. The aborted  International Trade Organization would have rounded off the  institutional framework for the multilateral management of the  world economy, but the vagaries of politics dashed the hopes of  those architects of the peacetime world.    Thus, we have had to wait almost half-a-century in order at  last to manage to bring the privileges of power within the sway  of law.    By bringing into being the world trade organization today,  we  are enshrining the rule of law in international economic and  trade relations, thus setting universal rules and disciplines  over the temptations of unilateralism and the law of the jungle.  This collective profession of faith actually marks the end of  the colonial pact and embodies genuine interdependence.  Regardless of the size of our economies, from now on we shall  all enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same  obligations. we share the same goals and must meet the same  challenges: Tackling the scourge of unemployment, redressing  the problem of social exclusion, or finding appropriate ways of  responding to our environmental or other concerns.    The fact that the trade negotiations that we have just  solemnly concluded were launched in Punta del Este and ended in  Marrakech, in other words, in two countries of the south, must  be seen as heralding a new age in which the antagonisms between  the industrialized and developing countries will fade away. The  alliances forged during these negotiations between partners  having different levels of development show that this process is  now under way. It is up to us to deepen it and strengthen it.    The rise in the number of contracting parties, which lends a  universal dimension to the agreements just signed, together with  the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall, mark the end of  the ideological cleavages that have hampered the smooth  development of the world economy. Henceforth, four fifths of  the world's population live in market economies and over a  hundred countries have embarked on the privatization of  public-sector enterprises.    Lastly, the fact that the Marrakech meeting coincides with  the implementation of the agreements between the PLO and Israel  is a good omen. Those agreements, enabling the Palestinian flag  to fly over part of its territory, are the beginning of a  process that will finally extinguish the oldest hotbed in the  world.    All of this means that the world of tomorrow can scarcely  resemble the one in which we have lived until today. Changing  production systems and consumption patterns, the emergence of  new multimedia technologies and the rapid growth of related  services will further speed up the globalization of markets for  goods, services and capital.    This globalization could herald greater inequalities among  countries and aggravate the symptoms of social exclusion which  may be observed in the rich as the less prosperous countries.  It therefore calls for the creation and use of new machinery of  collective solidarity as well as a new approach to economic and  social development problems. The reason why many developing  countries have courageously restructured their economies in  order to integrate them better into the international economy is  that they are convinced of the virtues of financial discipline  and of the need to cushion the ensuing transitional social cost.  This cost requires a counterpart from the developed countries  in the form of corresponding adjustments favoring markets access  and transparent conditions of fair competition, in particular  through greater monetary stability.    The special situation of Africa deserves a particular  attention. Morocco, a Muslim, Arab and African country, was a  pioneer of emancipation movements in Africa and it is fully  aware of the challenges to be faced. We must assess the  situation with lucidity and admit that the results of forty  years of independence are mixed. Of course mistakes have been  made, successes have been achieved here and there, but no one  can ignore the latent risks of a situation in which the  imbalance in levels of development is so sharp. We must not  misjudge the shape of the future nor the danger of excluding a  whole continent from the global economy. After all the measures  taken to save Africa, we should ask ourselves if the time is not  ripe for a veritable Marshall plan to alleviate the poverty and  suffering of millions of people.""    ""Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr.  Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies, and  gentlemen,    When we invited you to consider signing the final act of the  Uruguay round in Marrakech, an invitation which you did us the  honor and pleasure of accepting, we were motivated by a number  of important considerations.    To cite only some of them, for many centuries Marrakech has  been a crossroads of trade and civilization between Africa and  Europe and between the latter and the Arab world.    It was in Marrakech, in 1788, that the exchange of letters  between Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben 'Abdellah and George Washington  led to the Kingdom of Morocco being the first nation to  recognize the independence of the United States of America.  These texts are still in force and deal with peace, friendship,  and freedom of navigation and trade.    It was also in Marrakech, in 1856, that an exchange of  diplomatic instruments took place between Queen Victoria and  Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane. The trade agreement which was the  subject of this exchange set up the frame for the majority of  treaties of the time. Its modernity and conformity with the  rules and disciplines we have just adopted today would surprise  many people: The most-favored nation clause was used in it for  the first time.    Thus it is in one of the oldest trading nations in the world  that the most complex and most important trade negotiations in  history have been concluded.    By putting its signature beside those of the contracting  parties present here, the Kingdom of Morocco is reaffirming a  tradition of free trade from which it never swerved from its  origin through the last world war.    This tradition is not simply confined to trade, but embraces  the wider area of the options facing society. In adopting  pluralism and prohibiting a single-party regime in its first  constitution proclaimed upon independence, Morocco was fully  aware of the fact that a truly liberal economic policy must  first of all be based on the values of democracy, and of  political and trade union pluralism.    Its steadfast determination to promote an economic system  which gives pride of place to private initiative and the  stimulus of equitable competition has allowed Morocco to follow  the path of sustainable growth, remedy structural imbalances and  attract foreign investment.    The experience we have gained over the centuries has allowed  us to establish our vocation as a land of reflection, courage  and innovation and has taught us the virtues of humility and the  essential need for lucidity.    This leads us to conclude that, although the Marrakech  agreements constitute a cornerstone of our common structure,  they cannot be considered as an end in themselves.    These agreements should rather give us food for thought and  spur our creative imagination for building a new international  order.    We believe that the conditions have just been provided for a  collective and calm reflection on the functioning of the global  economy in the next century.    Trade is only one element in a trilogy in which monetary and  financial issues are interdependent. The impact of the monetary  policies followed by the major actors in the international  economy often leads to counterproductive effects which  jeopardize what has been achieved by our restructuring efforts.    In this respect, we propose studying with your respective  heads of state the possibility of establishing an  intergovernmental group to study the new mechanisms for  international economic negotiations with a view to:    -- improved coordination of action by the IMF, the IBRD  [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the  WTO [World Trade Organization]    -- a greater contribution by countries of the south to  concerted implementation of a strategy to give the global  economy a new impetus so as to come up with the appropriate  response to the scourge of the twenty first century, which will  be unemployment.    ""Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr.  Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies and  gentlemen,    We give thanks to God for having allowed our meeting to be  one of those which, in contributing to international  cooperation, widen its scope, strengthen its bases and  consolidate its rules. The Marrakech charter which concludes  this meeting is a further valuable contribution to the series of  international conventions on which our world of today has based  its unity, turning away from the causes of strife and enmity to  become part of the cycle of relations promoting the reign of  peace and understanding.    When Morocco expresses the pride it takes in having hosted  the meeting, it simply is rightfully expressing its aspirations  and its choice to always remain open onto the world and adhere  to the principles of international cooperation.    We should all therefore welcome the gigantic step forward  towards broader and more intensive international cooperation,  this progress towards the international solidarity which we hope  will be the hallmark of the next century. And more than any  other promise, it is the confirmation of this solidarity that we  hope for from the proposed new world order.""     "

The authors say fighting and banditry have become worse in some areas, and claim aid workers are unanimous in describing the security situation as having deteriorated since western intervention. The report maintains that the overall food supply problem had been overcome as early as October 1992, before the US troops landed. Over-supply of food has damaged the agricultural sector, says the report. Efforts at disarmament of rival factions have been 'sporadic and half-hearted', and both the UN and the US have failed in the peace process by giving warlords an 'unwarranted legitimacy' and not consulting a cross-section of civil society. The highly critical analysis is by Ms Rakiya Omaar and Mr Alex de Waal, co-founders of African Rights. The small, UK-charity funded organisation was formed last December after they resigned from Africa Watch, part of a US-based international network of human rights monitors. The experience of the authors in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa will give weight to their analysis. Their judgment is also likely to be backed by several of the charities working in Somalia. The report calls for a UN commission of inquiry into the operation, disarmament of warlords, and greater attention to long-term economic rehabilitation and the peace process.

Chapman, Jr. will  be President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' planning and  economic policy minister. In exclusive statements to EL PANAMA  AMERICA, Chapman explained what his first actions will be as  planning minister.    First he will ""draw up a current account budget with work  programs and investments that reflect the priorities of the new  government. This is an essential instrument for governing, "" he  stressed.    Law No.32 of 31 December 1993 established the State General  Budget at 3.9034 billion balboas, 1.9286 billion balboas of  which correspond to the central government's budget.    ""I believe the budget policy must be guided by the objective  of generating savings in the current account -- in other words,  more revenue than operational expenses -- so we can use the  savings to finance the investment program,"" Chapman said.    The central government's 1994 budget plans for 1.4158  billion  balboas in current revenue and 512.8 million balboas in capital.  Of these, 324.3 million balboas will come from external credits  (IFI's [International Financial Institutions], credits,  donations from governments and other institutions).    Chapman admitted that the reality of this country and of all  countries is that governments do not have the capacity to  finance investment programs themselves. ""If we want to  undertake the ambitious investment program that the country  requires, we need foreign financing. That is inevitable,"" he  added.    ""From a basic standpoint, the country needs to draft its own  economic plan that emphasizes national priorities based on the  new government's viewpoint,"" he said.    According to Chapman, ""the economic program must serve as a  guide for the implementation of subsequent budgets and for  Panama's relations with the IFI.""    ""My intention, and I have spoken about this in detail with  the president-elect, is to invert the traditional relationship  that Panama has had with the IFI. Throughout this relationship,  we have responded to their initiatives rather than to our own,""  the economist added.    The new economic plan will bear in mind the positive aspects  of the current Strategy for the Modernization of the Economy.  The economist indicated that ""perhaps due to the political  structure of the Endara government, it is an incomplete  strategy. It lacks some key elements for improving the  economy's productivity.""    ""For a program to be successful domestically, it must be  gradual and coordinated. This tells us that so-called shock  treatments make no sense. I do not believe in that,"" the  president of the Investigation and Development Company (INDESA)  said.    A third priority for the future planning minister ""is to  develop, simultaneously with the two previous priorities, a  social action program organized on a scientific basis with clear  national objectives.    The main ills affecting Panamanians are unemployment and  poverty. According to official figures, unemployment is at 14  percent and poverty and extreme poverty affects 50 percent of  the country.    According to Chapman, the initiatives to fight poverty must  be directed at the poorest sectors while achieving economic  growth.    In the last four years, the Panamanian economy has  registered  growth rates of 3.4, 5, 8, and 5.9 percent. Nevertheless, this  behavior is due to special situations related to the economic  and political crisis of 1988 and 1989.    The future planning minister said ""this high growth will not  be maintained."" Nevertheless, the country is sustained by  strong foreign exchange stemming from mature industries that are  condemned to slow growth while others will disappear, such as  the military bases. [sentence as published]    ""The objective of the economic plan is to achieve  competitiveness to attract the foreign investments that have not  come to Panama over the past 10 years. This will generate more  jobs and improve purchasing power,"" Chapman said.    Asked about the populist and producer-state theories  promoted  by the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) in the 1970's,  Chapman said: ""Only God and rocks do not change. Ideas and  people change.""    Chapman indicated that privatization is not a panacea. If it  is not done well, it could create serious problems.  Privatization is justified when it produces social benefits or  accomplishes objectives that could not be reached otherwise.""    A serious obstacle the new administration will face  beginning  1 September is the servicing of the commercial debt, which in  December 1993 reached $1,978,200,725, not including interest,  which amounts to more than $1.2 billion.    ""This is a serious problem that must be handled carefully,""  Chapman said. Meanwhile, the negotiating team of the current  administration is trying to reach an agreement that will benefit  the country.    The economist said educating Panamanians to meet today's  demands is another priority task. ""There is no reason why  Panamanians cannot have the same productivity as the Japanese,  Koreans, and Chileans.""    Chapman told EL PANAMA AMERICA that ""there are great  expectations in the private sector about the opening of specific  opportunities for investment.""    ""I am very optimistic about Panama's future, even though we  have such serious problems as the commercial debt, poverty, and  unemployment. I have accepted the post because I want those  opportunities to materialize,"" Guillermo Chapman said.     "

0,FT922-11818 ,"FT922-11818 _AN-CDWA1AD3FT 920423   FT  23 APR 92 / Prince warns on population increase      By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent   PRINCE CHARLES warned in London yesterday that environmental improvement and alleviation of Third World poverty would be jeopardised by the predicted doubling of the world's population to 10bn by the year 2050. He said that some delegations to the forthcoming Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro were blocking discussion on the need to reduce the growth in world population. The prince did not name the delegations which he said were determined to prevent discussion of the issue. But they are understood to include the Vatican, the Philippines and Latin American countries. The UK strongly favours having the population issue on the agenda of the summit, to be held in June. 'I don't in all logic see how any society can hope to improve its lot when population growth regularly exceeds economic growth,' he said. 'We will not protect the environment until we address the issue of population growth and poverty in the same breath. I wish that these simple and incontestable truths could find greater prominence on the Rio agenda.' The prince was addressing a session of the World Commission on Environment and Development which will issue a statement tomorrow giving its views on the Earth Summit. The commission was formed in 1984 by the United Nations to draw up a global environmental agenda. The prince said that unless a far-sighted agenda for action was worked out 'we will be sacrificing the survival or our grandchildren and great-grandchildren for short-term gain'. Negotiations for the summit have been marked by differences between industrialised and developing countries. But the prince asked why resources could not be pooled to 'tackle the unfolding crisis together'. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister - who heads the commission - warned that the summit could fail unless the 'watering down' of proposals during preparatory talks was reversed by pressure of public opinion. 'We must enter a period of firm action,' she said.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

In fact, outside of a few lawyers and tax advisers, it is difficult to find anyone who likes it. Even the Reserve Bank, which administers the policies, never tires of saying that it would like to rid the country of this albatross. Earlier this month Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented: 'An early end to the dual-currency system is not in the offing.' He also noted, that 'the financial rand will remain as long as the domestic political and social instability . . . continues'. With South Africa facing an election on April 27, 1994, and the immediate aftermath a great unknown, few believe the financial rand will go before the end of 1994 at the earliest. While most exchange control regulations are aimed at stopping people taking money out of the country, it is the dual-currency system that most affects foreign investors. In terms of this system South Africa has a commercial rand, the official rate of exchange used for all normal commercial activities; and the financial rand which is basically a currency for non-resident investment or disinvestment. The aim of the financial rand is to protect the country's foreign reserves. The system is designed to ensure that when foreigners repatriate their investments, they do not do so at the expense of the country's reserves. Foreign investors need to pay close attention to the financial rand as it is a highly volatile currency easily capable of negating any gains made in, say, an investment in equities or bonds. Indeed, many foreigners suffered heavy losses in the second half of 1992 when the currency weakened dramatically. Although turnover in the market has increased, it remains a very thin market, skittish and difficult to predict, and easily moved by a large order. Financial rands are created when a non-resident sells his South African investment to a South African. He must be paid in rand, which rands are then deposited in his account with an approved dealer in foreign exchange (all of the main banks). Once in his account, the rand becomes financial rand which can only be sold by the non-resident owner to another non-resident against payment in a foreign currency. By definition, residents can never own, and hence sell, financial rand (though, in very limited circumstances, locals may use financial rand for offshore transactions). Residents are also not allowed to buy financial rand as this would require foreign exchange - precisely what the system is supposed to avoid. In considering when the financial rand might be abolished, it must be remembered that this subject is inextricably bound up with South Africa's debt standstill arrangements. These were introduced in 1985 and covered the country's repayable foreign debt (then Dollars 13.6bn, now down to Dollars 5bn in terms of a final agreement reached last September). The government's position was that it would have been unfair if a restriction had been placed on repayment of foreign debt at that time without also restricting the repatriation of foreign investment in South African equities. This would have led to undesirable arbitrage transactions  -hence the introduction of the financial rand. Likewise, it is most unlikely that the Reserve Bank will scrap the financial rand system while foreign creditors remain subject to a debt repayment scheme. The latest scheme is due to run for eight years. For South Africa to consider ending it before then - that is, repaying the affected debt - will either require that it manages to roll over a substantial amount of the Dollars 5bn still subject to the scheme, or that its reserves grow to the position where it feels they can withstand a sizeable capital outflow. Current levels, which cover only about six weeks of imports, are a long way short of the required level. The best indicator that the financial rand is ripe for abolition will be when the discount to commercial rand, currently about 20 per cent, either narrows considerably or disappears altogether. This is unlikely before South Africa is seen to have achieved a stable and sustainable transition.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr. Meir Shumer, 48, an Israeli citizen, is in police  custody  after appearing in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on  Tuesday.    Police say this is the fourth time in 18 months they have  seized diamonds or gold smuggled on El Al flights from  Johannesburg to Tel Aviv.    Immigration records show that Mr. Shumer's arrest came on  his  thirteenth trip to South Africa since 1990.    On most of his visits, police said, he stayed for between  one  and three days before returning to Israel -- almost always  choosing to fly El Al.    Police say El Al's Saturday-night flight appears to have  become a hot favourite with professional smugglers and dishonest  emigrants in spite of El Al's reputation for having the  strictest security in the world.    The possibility that airline staff may be colluding with  smugglers has not been ruled out.    Last year Reserve Bank investigators working on a  R179-million fraud case were told by an informant in a sworn  statement that the airline's staff were helping wealthy South  Africans get their riches out of the country.    Within weeks of this, Germiston diamond and gold unit  detectives arrested El Al security officer Derek Joel Niss, 35,  for trying to smuggle a suitcase filled with more than 670  Krugerrands into a plane cargo hold.    Niss said after his conviction that he suspected a cartel of  emigrating South Africans had paid him the R5,000 cash bribe he  received for each coin-filled suitcase he slipped on the plane.    He said he had handled about 20 consignments before his  arrest.    Niss's arrest was the second time police had seized gold  coins destined for Israel on an El Al flight. Last February  they found a suitcase containing 1,100 Krugerrands which had  been checked in for transport to Tel Aviv. The owner has still  not been traced.    And in another diamond-smuggling case, police arrested  Israeli courier Moshe Landman when he tried to board an El Al  flight 18 months ago with R55,000 in diamonds hidden in one of  his boots. Landman had travelled to South Africa 15 times --  mostly with El Al -- before being caught.    Last Saturday police swooped on passengers travelling  overseas on various airlines at Jan Smuts.    Diamonds and gold unit detectives Colonel Clement Jackson  and  Captain Henk van Rensburg picked out Mr. Shumer from the line of  passengers moving through passport control.    Mr. Shumer, who claims to be a diamond consultant, was taken  to a cubicle and asked to strip down to his underwear, said  police. He was then arrested.    Police said Mr. Shumer arrived in South Africa with his wife  -- it was her first trip -- two weeks ago and the two apparently  took time off to holiday in George and Cape Town.    Mrs. Shumer, who was also searched, went on to Tel Aviv. Mr.  Shumer was not asked to plead when he appeared in the Kempton  Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. A bail hearing has been set  for February 23.    If convicted, Mr. Shumer faces a maximum sentence of 10  years' imprisonment and R250,000 fine.    Police says they are now obliged to carry out more frequent  and more thorough searches of passengers using El Al.    Explaining how smugglers were slipping past his security  officers, an El Al security spokesman said the airline was  mainly concerned with apprehending potential hijackers and  terrorists.     "

Underlying the article is an assumption that the only legitimate aim for a social security system is the minimalist one of relieving poverty after it has already struck; and that the only source of finance for a better deal for people in poverty is the means-testing of so-called 'universal' benefits. But a social security system in a sophisticated modern society should be multi-purpose; and there are far more obvious areas of expenditure (or foregone revenue) which could fund an attack on poverty. Child Poverty Action Group believes that an extension of means-tested benefits is not an appropriate response to the call to 'modernise' the welfare state. First, it would not be able to respond to the current emphasis on individual aspirations. It is very difficult to improve your own situation through your own efforts if you are caught in the inevitable 'poverty trap' caused by withdrawing means-tested benefits as well as paying extra tax and national insurance contributions. Second, further means-testing would inevitably move us further away from individual rights to benefit for women; means-tested benefits are inevitably assessed on the basis of the couple or family unit, in a way no longer considered acceptable for income tax. Third, there seems now to be broad agreement that state help should be enabling, not controlling - yet means-testing gives enormous powers of intervention in the personal lives of the means-tested, and means that even those in work are dependent more on the state's decisions about benefit levels than they are on their own efforts for their financial position. Last but not least, it is difficult, if not impossible, for means-tested benefits to give real 'social security' as a basis on which people can experiment in today's changing labour market patterns, and on which children can rely if their parent(s) move in and out of today's changing family situations. The arguments of today's pro-selectivists are not 'radical', as you claim; they are just wrong. It is a pity that the Financial Times appears to have joined the ranks of the new means-testers.

0,FT942-6829 ,"FT942-6829 _AN-EFBDVAG7FT 940527   FT  27 MAY 94 / South Africa aims to double arms exports      By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry. Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, said yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Dollars 270m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. Mr de Waal noted, for example that South Africa sold a variety of weapons - rifles, grenades, mortars - worth R100m to Rwanda over a five-year period. He said the deal was terminated late last year because of evidence the weapons were used against the Rwandan people. In recent weeks, Rwandan Hutus loyal to the government have been blamed for horrific slaughters of minority Tutsis and other Hutus that killed tens of thousands of people. Mr Peet Smith, Armscor general manager for imports and exports, said the new government's policy permitted arms exports to countries only to defend their sovereignty and not where the weapons might be used to violate human rights. Despite anxieties about exports to the rest of Africa, South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future. Selling more of its respected military hardware is the key to Armscor's survival, Mr de Waal said. The company currently more than R800m of arms per year, which he said represented less than 0.5 per cent of the international arms market. Products that could sell well abroad include sophisticated Rooivalk helicopters, frequency-hopping radio transmitters and receivers that avoid interception, landmine-proof armoured vehicles, advanced mine detection equipment, and G-5 and G-6 long-range artillery. Mr de Waal identified Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe as potential markets. This will be eased by Tuesday's UN Security Council decision to lift a mandatory ban on the sale of arms to South Africa. President Mandela said this week Pretoria should be allowed to sell weapons if it wanted to and Defence Minister Joe Modise, a former guerrilla fighter, said expanding weapons exports could create 20,000 jobs.

0,FT943-14 ,"FT943-14 _AN-EI3DUAIPFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (57): After apartheid, optimism grows - South Africa / The crucial problem is government spending      By MARK SUZMAN   For most of the past decade, South African planners have been warning that without drastic policy changes in the political and economic arenas, the domestic economy was doomed to continue on a downward spiral of high inflation, low growth and stagnant employment. Testifying to the accuracy of such predictions, South Africa's economic record over the past 10 years has been dismal, averaging growth of less than 1 per cent a year. At the same time, triggered by the combination of sustained political unrest, the loss of international confidence, and gross economic mismanagement by the government, inflation and government spending soared while investment, domestic savings and overall business confidence plunged. Now that the political side of the equation has finally been resolved, however, there is widespread optimism in the country that the economic challenges can be tackled with equal success. And with political change fortuitously coinciding with an upturn in the global business cycle, there is a widespread belief that South Africa can become an economic engine capable not only of pulling millions of its own citizens out of the mire of poverty, but acting as a catalyst for renewed growth in the region as well. Unfortunately, however, the situation is not that simple. The distorted policies of the apartheid era have left a deep-seated and destructive economic legacy that will take years to resolve. The crucial problem remains government spending, which accounted for 21 per cent of GDP over the first half of 1994 - a figure double the norm in most developing Asian economies. This extraordinarily high level of government involvement in the economy causes other problems, too. Funding the budget deficit, expected to be 6.6 per cent of GDP, diverts money from new fixed investment while continued spending by government intensifies inflationary pressures. The high level of government borrowing also means that gross domestic saving in the economy, essential to help fund new development, is at only 16 per cent of GDP. Compounding the problem is the fact that the economy remains overwhelmingly dependent on commodity exports, which account for some 71 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Although the government has been trying for some years to switch the focus to manufactured goods, it remains hampered by the fact that South Africa's economy is still highly protected, and many of its enterprises uncompetitive by global standards. In addition, the maintenance of a relatively expensive workforce with a low skills base acts as a further obstacle to development. In an international competiveness survey released by the World Economic Forum this month South Africa ranked 35th out of 41 countries and came last in the 'people' category, assessing the educational and training levels of the general populace. Despite all this, however, the underlying fact remains that the economic outlook for South Africa is better than it has been for decades. Growth this year is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, below the more optimistic forecasts made at the beginning of the year, but still up on 1993's 1.1 per cent, which itself followed four years of painful recession. Next year the figure is expected to reach between 3.5-4 per cent. The consensus among most economists is that provided the government sticks to conservative fiscal and monetary policies, South Africa is capable of continuing to generate domestic growth of around 3.5 per cent for the next five years. But to achieve more than that, a significant inflow of foreign investment, bringing with it exposure to new international skills and technology denied to the country during its years of isolation, is desperately needed. So far, the first condition seems to be met. Despite the immense political pressures on the ruling African National Congress to provide the populace with tangible benefits following the demise of apartheid, it has successfully resisted the temptation to undertake high spending, populist policies that would further destroy the economy's fragile base. Indeed, in its public statements to date, including the June budget, the government has been a model of fiscal probity, stressing its commitment to reducing the budget deficit and promising to fund its centrepiece reconstruction and development programme through savings rather than new borrowing. And while inflation may be rising, its current level of 8.2 per cent is still well down on the double digit rates that characterised the 1980s. In addition, trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel has shown an encouraging willingess to take on entrenched business lobbies and has already started to dismantle tariffs in sectors such as the motor and textiles industry to force South African manufacturers to become more competitive. Despite its good track record, however, the markets remain sceptical of the government's ability to successfully rein in spending - a fact signalled in the recent rise of bond yields to more than 17 per cent, representing a real rate of return of more than 9 per cent. And while industrial restructuring is an essential step if South Africa is to successfully start pursuing an export-led growth strategy, in the short term it is likely to depress rather than enhance growth prospects. However, most analysts agree that the key to whether the South African economy can finally step on to the high road of renewed growth is whether it can successfully attract renewed inflows of foreign capital. Although the country has seen net capital outflows of around R50bn between 1985 and the first half of 1994, since June the situation appears to have stabilised. But it has not yet reversed. People have stopped taking money out of South Africa, but few people are yet willing to start putting new investments into the country. Meanwhile, the country's foreign reserves remain seriously depleted and are currently able to cover only five weeks of imports. With total foreign currency debt at only Dollars 16.7bn and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, one possible means of correcting this is renewed borrowing. However, the far more desirable route is new foreign investment. But while a large number of foreign companies have set up offices or franchise operations in South Africa over the past 18 months, few have yet made any investments of any significance. As a result, over the next few years South Africa is likely to follow a path of only moderate growth, representing a significant improvement over the recent past but still well short of the high levels the ANC needs to satisfy the needs of its black constituents.

A statement from the administration said aid would be concentrated on the poorest 50 countries, which received three-quarters of bilateral aid in 1993-94. 'Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of know-how to countries in transition remain particular priorities for the ODA's work,' it said. The statement was disputed, however, by the World Development Movement which recently won a High Court challenge over the funding of the controversial Pergau Dam in Malaysia. It said the channeling of more aid through Europe and to commercially tied projects would leave fewer funds for poverty-focused country-to-country aid. Ms Harriet Lamb, development movement campaign officer, said Africa in particular would suffer as, on the ODA's own calculations, the percentage of total British aid to Africa was set to fall from 14.4 per cent in 1994-95 to 12.1 per cent in 1997. Mr Ben Jackson, the movement's campaigns co-ordinator, complained that the chancellor had had to stump up Britain's share of the Edinburgh summit's commitment to increase European aid by 60 per cent by the end of the decade. He said: 'Unlike some of his European counterparts, he has failed to match this promise with extra funding for the overall aid budget. 'Britain is punching well below its weight as an aid giver. This will mean biting cuts in Britain's aid for long-term development programmes essential for the world's poor.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

It will be the first time the two sides have met for formal constitutional negotiations since multi-party talks broke down last May at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Since then, the gap between the two sides on the crucial issue of power-sharing has narrowed, with the ANC proposing this week that South Africa be ruled by coalition even if one party wins a majority of votes in the first elections under a permanent constitution. ANC officials tried to force the pace of next week's meeting, which will be held over three days at a secret location, by rejecting as too slow the timetable announced on Thursday by President F W de Klerk, who forecast elections for an interim government by April 1994. Amnesty International human rights group has released a report documenting physical abuse of prisoners in ANC camps outside South Africa. The victims were often labelled as South African government spies, but most appeared to have been genuine ANC members, imprisoned because they raised grievances or policy differences, it said.

0,FT933-7680 ,"FT933-7680 _AN-DHTCQABFFT 930820   FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Focus of S Africa reforms shifts to trade  -The revised offer to be presented to Gatt      By PHILIP GAWITH   WHEN South Africa started on the road of political reform in 1990, this was as much a function of the crippling economic cost of apartheid as it was a reflection of the moral and political bankruptcy of that policy. Since then, the country's faltering political fortunes have hogged the limelight. Later this month, however, South Africa will present a revised trade liberalisation offer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which forms part of a revision of trade policy as fundamental as the political reform under way. Mr Stef Naude, director general of the Department of Trade and Industry, comments: 'Without a doubt, this is the biggest reform of trade policy ever undertaken in this country.' The aim of the reform is simple: the transformation of the existing industrial base, fed for decades on a diet of political isolation, import substitution and strategic self-sufficiency, into an internationally competitive, export-led manufacturing sector. The Gatt offer is but the first of many initiatives which include reform of export incentives, investigation of export processing zones, more efficient anti-dumping legislation, a trade agreement with the EC and the future of the South African Customs Union. Pursued against the background of a weak economy, unemployment running at over 40 per cent and fundamental political transition, it is a Herculean labour. No longer can government unilaterally decree policy changes. Democracy, transparency and consultation are the new watchwords. When it comes to economic policy, the imprimatur of the National Economic Forum, the tripartite body where business, labour and government are represented, must be sought. At least in the area of trade policy, there is fairly broad consensus among these three groups as to the way forward. Nobody would argue with the premise, contained in the government's recently published Normative Economic Model, that 'Much of the country's future economic prosperity will be determined by its ability to play a bigger role in international trade in industrial goods.' This clearly requires conformity to Gatt, whose signatories all benefit from 'most favoured nation' status and 'national treatment' - the first ensuring that any tariff cut offered by one country to a second must automatically be extended to all other trading partners, and the second guaranteeing that an exporter is treated just as a local company is treated. 'There is no way South Africa can fully reintegrate into the global economy outside Gatt,' said Mr Stef Naude. Conformity to Gatt is not the only reason for lowering tariff barriers. It is also necessary to remove the anti-export bias in South Africa whereby protection makes the local market more profitable than exports. It also raises input costs for local exporters, making them uncompetitive compared to exporters elsewhere who can obtain inputs at world prices. A recent World Bank study of South Africa's trade policy found that it was not overly protective, 'but far too fluid and complex, and biased against exports.' Compared to developing countries, the protection level is fairly average. According to NEM, South Africa's tariff barrier (weighted by import values) stands at 21 per cent, though this rises to 27 per cent when account is taken of special import surcharges  - which survive for fiscal rather than protection purposes. South Africa's revised Gatt offer will thus have two main features: first, it will involve a one-third reduction in average tariff rates. Second, it includes a dramatic rationalisation of the tariff structure which is virtually unmatched in its complexity. Instead of the current high degree of dispersion, tariff levels will range, at 5 percentage point intervals, from zero to a maximum of 30 per cent (with the exception of the motor industry). Also, almost all tariffs will be bound - which means, in theory, they can never be raised, only lowered. This compares with only 55 per cent in its original offer. South Africa has also committed itself to phasing out emergency dumping formula duties, - a measure which has been the main instrument to counter disruptive competition. to be replaced by proper anti-dumping measures, further reducing the overall level of protection in the country as formula duties often resulted in an increased overall level of protection. The Gatt offer - particularly the lowering of import tariffs - should not be seen in isolation. All parties agree that it will have to be accompanied by supply-side support measures to assist local industry to improve its competitiveness. With unemployment already at alarmingly high levels, the social and political costs of simply dropping tariff barriers, without other policies introduced in parallel, are unthinkable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICA: ESTIMATES OF EFFECTIVE PROTECTION (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Protection on Subsector                            Inputs     Output     Effective                                                           Protection  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Food, Beverages and Tobacco            15.2       13.7           8.8 Textiles, Apparel,  Leather           27.8       43.6          93.6 Wood  Wood Products                   14.0       21.7          39.7 Paper  Paper Products                  9.5       13.3          22.2 Chemicals                               7.5       18.9          50.6 Non Metallic Minerals                   5.2       19.8          34.3 Basic Metal                             4.7       11.2          23.2 Metal Products  Equipment             17.1       18.2          20.3 Other Manufacturing                     2.8       10.9          62.8 Manufacturing                          12.6       17.8          30.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Industrial Development Corporation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The present National Frelimo Cadres Meeting is taking place  during a crucial moment in the life of our people, particularly  in the life of our party.    We say crucial because of the immense and urgent tasks that  we face today. With peace, we have gained renewed hope to  reconstruct Mozambique, to normalize the life of each citizen,  and to follow the steady path of development, democracy, and  progress for all our people, firm and united as always.    We say crucial because the wishes and aspirations of our  people, affirmed in our political ideals, will only be realized  if there is a strong and competent government after the October  elections, if the elected Assembly of the Republic is truly  representative of our people's political and cultural diversity,  and if the president -- to be elected by the people --  represents and intends to realize these political ideals.    It is crucial, therefore, that our party emerge convincingly  victorious in the coming general multiparty elections.    It is clear to us that Frelimo's victory in the coming  elections is a national necessity, a patriotic cause which goes  far beyond political party limits and interests.    What we are going to do here, esteemed comrades, is to  prepare and organize our victory. We are going to prepare and  organize a better future for our people.    Our mission and pledge before all of our countrymen: to  provide a better future for each and every Mozambican, with more  hospitals, more schools, more workplaces, more houses, and  better working conditions in factories and farms.    This path that we have to thread is already reflected in the  immense work we have carried out since we gained peace for our  people with wisdom and patience: hundreds of kilometers of  roads have been opened or repaired; dozens of bridges have been  rebuilt; hundreds of hospitals and schools have been rebuilt and  new schools and health posts built; factories and other  production centers have resumed production; more than 800,000  Mozambicans who lived as refugees in neighboring countries have  returned to the fatherland and about three million people who  lived as displaced people inside the country have normalized  their lives.    All these things reinforce our conviction that we are on the  right path and that the hope that our people have today is  strengthening their desire to participate in the reconstruction  of Mozambique. We have to know how to use all this potential  knowledge, experience, and love for the fatherland of which our  people are the rightful custodians.    Dear comrades:    The National Frelimo Cadres Meeting will specifically center  its discussions on the electoral manifesto, the government  program after elections, and the party tasks in preparation for  the coming elections. These are the principal components of our  electoral strategy. Our proposals and recommendations will be  channeled to the Special Session of the Frelimo Central  Committee scheduled to take place after this meeting. The  session will also center its discussions on the above issues.    Today there is a lot of talk about democratization, as if  this was the most important issue for our people. It is true  though that the consolidation of democracy constitutes a  necessity in our present moment, our party's goal.    Democracy has no meaning, however, if people have no food;  if  everyone does not have access to health care and education; if  everyone cannot enjoy freedom of movement throughout the  national territory.    We always have to bear in mind what our people's priorities  are. To better realize these priorities, we have to increasingly  create better conditions for the participation of citizens and  all social forces in decision-making at all levels of our  country's life.    The example of democracy begins in our midst, with our  militants, in our party organs. This meeting expresses the  consolidation of the democratic exercise in our party. We have  to constantly improve our working methods to reveal our  individual and local initiatives, with a view to heightening the  intervention of our party organs and militants in society.    The cohesion and unity among party members, sympathizers,  and  all citizens who support Frelimo's cause must be reinforced,  particularly if we take into consideration the wave of violent  and defamatory criticism leveled against us by some political  forces.    We must always be present in society so that these  defamations do not make the Mozambican people forget what the  principal reason was for the present situation of misery  experienced by most of our People.    The principal reason for this misery was the war of  destabilization mounted from abroad, where Mozambicans were used  to destroy their own country, villages, schools, and hospitals  which were useful to their countrymen and their families;  factories, farms, shops, roads, and bridges, which produced,  traded, and helped to distribute products which we all need.    Mozambicans used to serve the interests of revengeful  settlers, Rhodesian racists, and ""apartheid"" bosses, ended up  becoming victims of this criminal process.    Now that they are part of the national political chess game,  they need houses, schools, hospitals, shops, and factories which  they themselves destroyed. Today they want voters and these  voters are among those who lost their loved ones, among those  who suffered the most inhuman physical mutilations carried out  on orders of anti- Mozambican forces abroad.    The atmosphere of national reconciliation, peace, and the  need to reunify the Mozambican family cannot make us indifferent  to attempts to manipulate the awareness of our people and  falsify history. The darkest pages have been registered in the  life of our people in our country's history, but the most  beautiful pages have also been registered. These beautiful  pages of freedom, independence, fraternity, and national unity,  peace and reconciliation of which we are so proud to champion,  constitute our constant source of inspiration, the constant  foundation of our convictions to face the great challenges of  today and tomorrow.    Dear comrades:    On 25 June this year, Frelimo will celebrate 32 years of  existence and Mozambique 19 as an independent country.    During all these years, we accumulated abundant political  and  technical experience. Our party has always had the capacity to  adjust course following the country's reality in each historical  moment, as well as the courage to identify inadequate policies  and mistakes in order to find solutions. These are some of the  reasons which make our party an esteemed organization.    We are proud to note that most of the participants of this  meeting are cadres who were trained academically and/or  professionally after national independence, as is the case with  dozens of thousands of others found in every corner of this  beautiful Mozambique.    It was these cadres, alongside all other militants and the  people, who enabled Frelimo to draw up objectives and realize a  vast plan of actions for the benefit of the people, despite the  adverse conditions created by acts of aggression carried out by  the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa.    Between 1975 and 1977, the Frelimo government overcame the  crisis in the operation of public administration, following a  massive exodus of qualified technicians.    Until 1982 access to education increased. The number of  primary school pupils doubled, while the number of secondary  school students quadrupled.    More than 5,000 higher institute technicians have been  formed  since national independence. We reduced the rate of illiteracy  by 20 percent. We established another 358 health posts and  centers; while laboratory network quadrupled.    More than 400,000 people began to have clean water,  particularly from wells; important projects were carried out  through the dams of Pequenos Libombos, Corumana, Cuamba, and  Lichinga; we realized our development strategy in  telecommunications and rehabilitated railroads on the Nacala,  Beira, Limpopo Corridors, as well as textile factories in the  north of the country.    I have just cited a few examples of what was accomplished. A  lot of what we built was destroyed by the enemies of Mozambique.  Since our mission is to serve the people, however, even during  the war, our party cadres have always carried out the best of  their work for the country.    Today, with renewed hope and conviction, once again our  cadres demonstrate their political maturity, their technical and  professional abilities, and their immense love for the people.    On behalf of the Frelimo Central Committee, I would like to  salute with great affection all our cadres, men and women, who  throughout the country gave and continue to give great lessons  of patriotism, self-denial, and commitment to our project to  make Mozambicans a truly happy and prosperous people.    Cadres are pillars of the party. That is why we must  continue to do the best we can so that together we can  consolidate peace, justice, and democracy, promote our country's  development and progress, so that each of us can develop and  realize his or her talents as a citizen.    Dear comrades:    We have favorable conditions for obtaining victory in the  coming general elections.    We have a people who continue to respect and admire Frelimo,  because our party has always been known to embody their most  noble ideals and aspirations.    Proof of this are the visits that I recently made to the  Provinces of Gaza, Sofala, Tete, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado.    The affection accorded to the president of the Republic and  other government officials demonstrate the deep esteem for  Frelimo. We need to respect and guarantee the development of  this attitude.    We have a party which has more than 900,000 members. We have  the best cadres in the country. We have youth and women on our  side. What we need is just to work hard, with great tenacity,  since no victory is obtained without efforts and sacrifice.    I repeat: Victory has to be prepared, victory has to be  organized. Let us therefore devote ourselves, with all our  knowledge and energy to work after we have prepared and  organized ourselves here for victory.    Comrades:    As from 1 June, the voter registration process will begin  throughout the country. This is an important pointer for us to  view with optimism the peace process in Mozambique.    This is an important step forward so that in October this  year Mozambicans aged 18 and over can exercise their right and  civic duty to vote in the first multiparty elections the  president of the Republic and deputies of the Assembly, those  whom they feel are the best representatives of their  aspirations, those whom they feel have the ability and  experience to remove our country from the present state of  poverty and decisively move toward economic and social  development.    What we want today is what we have always wanted, but the  mentors of war against Mozambique never allowed us to realize  this.    We want happiness, prosperity, and progress, in brief,  wellbeing for all our people.    It is true that we have been experiencing some delays in the  implementation of the General Peace Accord.    These delays do not, however, jeopardize the implementation  of all phases of the process as provided for in the accord. The  Mozambican Government will continue to carry out all efforts to  guarantee that the multiparty elections take place on 27 and 28  October this year.    There are other positive aspects that need mentioning.  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] officials, particularly  its leader Afonso Dhlakama, have repeatedly reiterated before  the national and international communities their commitment to  never again resume war, even in case of defeat in the coming  elections.    Renamo has been presenting lists of areas under its control  to be integrated into state administration. This process,  however, must on one hand be carried out speedily, so that these  areas can be opened to all political parties and allow  businessmen to carry out their activities there.    On the other hand, the process must be carried out with all  seriousness, common sense, and good faith, to avoid pretexts  that could lead to new delays in the implementation of the  General Peace Accord.    We are still concerned about the lack of freedom of movement  of citizens in areas under Renamo control; the movement of armed  elements belonging to this organization; and the policy of  violence and torture against citizens who do not obey their  orders or who simply do not show sympathy toward Renamo.    The beating of local officials in Xai-Xai, on the Renamo  leader's orders, are a serious human rights violation and a  gross violation of the law and the General Peace Accord itself.  This issue does not stop being a political issue, even if this  is a criminal offense which must be examined and resolved in  accordance with the law in force.    In other words, there are still Renamo elements who have not  abandoned the tendency to commit crime, which has always  characterized them during various years of the war.    This is neither the first nor the most serious violation of  human rights and breach of the law by Renamo. Frelimo and the  government have been exposing such actions carried out by Renamo  men.    The national and international communities, as well as the  UN  Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], must not minimize these  incidents.    We would like to call on the Renamo leadership to behave in  a  civilized manner in the political game and order its men to  strictly adhere to the General Peace Accord, as well as to  respect the law and the legally installed authorities.    Dear comrades:    The present political atmosphere being experienced in  southern Africa encourages us to view our future with promise.    In South Africa, the African National Congress' victory, and  the election of our friend and comrade, Nelson Mandela, as the  first South African President chosen by the people marks the end  of ""apartheid"" and the birth of a new South Africa where  citizens of all races and ethnical groups are equal before the  law; where repression and oppression ceased to be the policy of  the state; a new South Africa which replaces the policy of  destabilization of neighboring countries, including Mozambique;  a South Africa which stands for cooperation and good  neighborliness. In South Africa, the people have chosen the  party that has always defended them from massacres and acts of  aggression, the people chose the party that better embodied  their interests and aspirations.    The end of ""apartheid"" in South Africa and the establishment  of a democratic government represents a great victory for all of  mankind, particularly for the peoples of southern Africa.    The peoples of our region were targets of the policy of  destabilization of the ""apartheid"" regime. Mozambicans today  still bear the scars of the policy of aggression of the racist  regime.    Now that South Africa has reemerged with a new political  stance in the region, this reinforces our hope for a better  future for the region and Mozambique in particular.    We all anxiously await South Africa's admittance as the 11th  member of the Southern African Development Community.    In Malawi, a new President, Bakili Muluzi, was  democratically  elected, ending a regime that had ceased to have the support of  the people long ago.    Armed men who took part in massacring Mozambican populations  and destroying economic and social infrastructures transited  through or from Malawi.    We give major importance to the visit that President Bakili  Muluzi has just made to Mozambique.    This is the first time that a head of state or the  Government  of Malawi made an official visit to our independent country.  Mozambique is also the first country that the Malawian head of  state visited. These facts reflect the new political situation  in that country.    All conditions have now been created so that relations of  friendship and cooperation between Mozambique and Malawi can  reach the high levels that we have always desired.    Beginning now, our relations with Malawi are based on mutual  respect, on noninterference in the internal affairs of each  country and on a mutually advantageous cooperation.    We continue to view with optimism the conclusion of the  present peace talks between the Angolan Government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    Although there is still concern about eventual impasses  which  could be artificially introduced in the process by the mentors  of war in Angola, the news that the parties are moving toward a  negotiated solution of the conflict is a positive step forward.    We would like to encourage the government led by the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola to continue with efforts  aimed at establishing peace in Angola, and we would like to urge  UNITA to finally respond with seriousness to the appeals of the  Angolan people and the entire world to silence arms in that  fraternal country.    We would like to reiterate our solidarity with the Angolan  people, and it is our hope that they will finally have peace and  tranquility and thus contribute to their national development.    Dear comrades:    As we begin the National Frelimo Cadres Meeting, we would  like once again to stress that we came here to hear your views,  welcome your views and opinions, in order to build the solid  foundations of our victory in elections.

0,FT932-9794 ,"FT932-9794 _AN-DELCNAEDFT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Break-up signals overhaul of corporate South Africa      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   GENCOR's announcement that it plans to unbundle came as no surprise, but this does not diminish the significance of an event whose political and business ramifications are likely to be widespread. It almost certainly heralds the beginning of a gradual, but far-reaching, overhaul of corporate South Africa. Over the next 10 years and beyond, groups such as Anglo American-De Beers, South African Breweries, Rembrandt, Anglovaal, Old Mutual and Sanlam, which dominate South African corporate life, are likely to be significantly restructured. Two factors will determine the pace and extent of this restructuring: the vigour with which a future government might pursue anti-trust policies, and the extent to which corporate South Africa voluntarily restructures, for reasons either of self-preservation or economic self-interest. The African National Congress, likely to be the largest partner in any future government, is committed to introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies weaken the influence of the country's largest groups, and promote private sector efficiency. There is also considerable support for unbundling in the investment community where many hold the view that the economy has become too concentrated, stifling initiative in the process. With the exception of Gencor, however, corporate South Africa has shown little enthusiasm for unbundling. Most captains of industry are not convinced unbundling has economic merit. Anglo American, in particular, has defended its size with vigour, sophistication and some success. Ultimately, however, these arguments, couched mostly in economic terms, are unlikely to sway the ANC, which objects to the degree of corporate influence exercised by a few whites. Yesterday's announcement is only the first salvo in a long debate. And practical barriers to unbundling have to be addressed - most obviously, who, other than the existing large groups, will buy the assets of companies that unbundle. Gencor's announcement will certainly force some of the other large groups to take a harder look at unbundling, if only because the onus of proof has shifted towards those favouring the status quo.

0,FT943-13 ,"FT943-13 _AN-EI3DUAIQFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (56): Not growing, but recovering - Africa      By TONY HAWKINS   After a dismal decade of stagnation and decline, sub-Saharan Africa can, at last, see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is the result of firmer commodity prices, faster world trade growth, accelerating economic reforms in many countries, and the remarkably smooth political transition in South Africa. The IMF forecasts growth of 3.4 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995  -well above the average 2.2 per cent over the past decade. However, this marginally brighter prospect should be seen in perspective. Africa is not growing, but recovering. In the past 10 years, per capita incomes fell 0.8 per cent a year. Nor is the recovery solidly based. Events in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda, ongoing hostilities in Angola and the uneasy mood in Mozambique ahead of the October elections underscore its fragility. Tensions in Nigeria and Zaire could any day spill over into serious regional economic disruption. A recent research paper by World Bank economists William Easterly and Ross Levine* explains the region's poor performance 'statistically' in terms of poor education, political instability, weak infrastructure and financial systems, overvalued exchange rates, ethnic diversity and 'troubles with neighbours'. This last effect is explained in terms of critical mass; the writers argue that if African neighbours act together to reform their economic policies, as indeed is happening increasingly now, there will be positive spillover and demonstration effects across national borders. This leads them to conclude, optimistically, that Africa's poor growth performance is 'very much reversible', even if some adverse factors, such as poor education and infrastructural decay, will have long-lasting effects. Factor into their analysis, a rejuvenated South African economy, and the potential for positive cross-border spillovers is considerable. At current exchange rates, following the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA Franc in January, South Africa's GDP of Dollars 120bn falls not very short of that of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa - Dollars 135bn to Dollars 140bn. South Africa's economy, too, has stagnated for the past dozen years, and its return to growth of 4 per cent annually, which is not unrealistic, would be a significant boost for the regional economy, especially for southern Africa. There are two distinct schools of thought on this. On one side, it is argued that the South Africans will be so preoccupied with their own internal problems - especially the successful implementation of their social advancement programme, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), that they will pay little attention to the rest of the region in the immediate future. The alternative viewpoint holds that South Africa is on course to become the locomotive for much of sub-Saharan Africa, partly as a growing market for African primary products and some low-price manufactures, but more importantly as an exporter of capital, skills and services. It's no coincidence that South African firms are in the forefront of the privatisation of hotels and cement plants in Mozambique, the planned sell-off of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, involved in tourism in East Africa, manufacturing and mining in Botswana and Zimbabwe and the development of the region's financial infrastructure. While western banks are pulling in their horns in Africa, Stanbic, South Africa's leading banking group, has expanded by taking over the African operations of ANZ Grindlays. Fledgling stock exchanges being set up all over the continent will benefit from South African advice and expertise. There is enormous, largely untapped potential for integrated tourism programmes linking destinations in Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Botswana and Zimbabwe with South Africa. South Africa's Escom is becoming the hub of a regional energy grid, drawing on Pretoria's excess capacity but also electricity imports from Mozambique's Cahora Bassa, and South African investors may develop the Pande gas deposit in Mozambique. The 1992 drought was a reminder of just how dependent southern Africa had become on South Africa's transport system, in spite of ambitious donor-funded programmes which were intended to reduce that dependence. The bulk of the maize and wheat needed came in through South Africa. The trade numbers tell the same largely lopsided story. In 1992, South Africa had an estimated trade surplus of R13.8bn (Dollars 4.8bn) with the rest of Africa. Most of this was with its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners - Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia - which between them accounted for R9bn. But it also had sizeable trade surpluses with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mauritius and Mozambique. While such a one-sided trade pattern - African exports to South Africa were worth R2.6bn compared with imports of R16.4bn - is a cause of concern to both sides, it is likely to get worse rather than better. African countries are finding South African products to be cheaper (in some cases), often more appropriate, and frequently more readily available with shorter lead times. The Dollars 225m Hartley Platinum development in Zimbabwe announced last month will source much of its capital equipment from South Africa. At the same time, there is little appetite in South Africa itself for the rest of the region's goods, which are largely poor quality, and cannot compete with imports from Asia. The signs are that the existing south-north trade and payments gap will widen, despite increased purchases of African primary goods - Kenyan coffee, Malawian tea, Botswana soda ash, Angolan oil, Zimbabwean tobacco and Zambian copper - by South African firms and increased tourist spending by holidaymakers from the south. Southern Africa, in particular, has much to gain from closer co-operation in transport, energy, tourism and even education, but hopes of a regional free trade area and of broadening the existing rand monetary area to include other countries, are almost certainly premature. The hearts are willing, the rhetoric is there in spades, but harsh economic reality speaks otherwise. At the end of the day, few African leaders are prepared to surrender an ounce of what little of economic autonomy they have managed to salvage from bilateral and multilateral donors, and multinational corporations. Whether South Africa's re-emergence will be the catalyst providing the neighbourly spillover for the rest of the region is highly problematic. President Mandela and his largely untried team have to prove that they can break the African mould, delivering the east Asian cocktail of rapid growth with improved equity, that has eluded the often-feeble efforts of the rest of the continent. History, and hard economic numbers are against them, but at the tail-end of a decade of wasted aid and often-ineffectual policy reform in sub-Saharan Africa, the new South Africa is the region's best bet. * Africa's Growth Tragedy.

One such person handed over 300,000  in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana  bank account last week. Most South Africans are still not rich  enough to afford top Botswana hotels and are staying with  friends, but in Zimbabwe and Namibia the caravan parks are  already filling up. Some South Africans will simply be making  temporary use of neighboring countries.    Botswana itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic  drop in supplies of food. Over 80 percent of our food comes  from South Africa and traders have been warned that strikes,  hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited  supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior Bank of  Botswana official assured (?journalists) last week that  Botswana's currency will be protected, but a dramatic 6.8  percent drop in the South African rand since January is bound to  affect the Botswana pula, which is partly linked to the rand.  People in Botswana are filling their cupboards with tinned  food, as they hear of South Africans' advice to stock up with  food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great  days of election and freedom approach.    The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries  first, although the influx of money will be a temporary  blessing, as Botswana is merely being used a conduit for the  outflow of cash.

0,FT943-13714 ,"FT943-13714 _AN-EGRD8AFPFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (32): Generous Gatt 'window' - Exporters are finding new markets open for trade      By MARK SUZMAN   South African exporters are a little overwhelmed by their new-found international respectability. After years of developing expertise in such arcane skills as transhipping and re-labelling to try and counteract sanctions imposed as a result of apartheid, companies find that many countries are now rolling out the red carpet, and new markets from Asia to eastern Europe to Latin America - long out of bounds - are now open for trade. As part of this new order, the South African government is starting to formalise its trading relationships. At the top of the list comes readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. South Africa's formal submission to the Uruguay Round was accepted late last year and a fundamental restructuring of its tariff structure will shortly get under way to bring the country more in line with international norms. The adjustments required by Gatt will involve pain for some highly protected industries but, by securing classification as an 'economy in transition', South Africa has managed to get a generous eight-year window for leading employment-oriented industries, such as textiles and motor vehicles, to adjust to the new arrangement. The deal also allows some leeway in the reorganisation of South Africa's contentious, and widely abused, General Export Incentive Scheme. Meanwhile, new trade agreements are giving further impetus to trade growth. President Clinton gave South Africa GSP status in May, allowing preferential access to the US market for a wide range of goods, and the European Union has announced its intention to do the same by the end of the year. A more formal, separate trade treaty with the European Union is under discussion, as is the possibility of some kind of associate member status with the Lome aid group. Also on the agenda are a set of new regional trade arrangements. At the World Economic Forum meeting last month, President Mandela and other southern African leaders signalled their intention to work towards a regional free trade agreement. As a first step towards this goal, in August South Africa will join the South African Development Community, a grouping of 10 southern African states originally formed to try and reduce dependence on South Africa. In the shorter term, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has already signalled his intention to restructure the South African Customs Union, which South Africa shares with Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland and in which it currently pays out some R5.6bn of a customs and excise revenue pool of R16.3bn to its partners. It is also seeking to renew a bilateral trading arrangement with Zimbabwe. Reflecting all this activity, exports have been soaring, and in 1993 totalled R78.3bn as the country ran a current account surplus of R5.9bn  - although this year's surplus is likely to be lower due to a higher import bill. But despite this success, the majority of exports are still primary products and while the proportion of manufactured goods has been increasing there is still a lot of room for improvement. A survey of exporters by the South African Foreign Trade Organisation estimates that South Africa's manufacturing industry is at a 15 per cent cost disadvantage to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, with its only comparative advantage in electricity. In addition, the report notes that after years of focus on the domestic market, local manufacturers have a 'tendency to blame external factors' for failures, and many fail to take export promotion and planning seriously. 'South African manufacturers still lack an export culture,' acknowledges one senior trade official. 'Until that changes, growth will be disappointing.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

This means that China now has a fundamental basis  to go by in carrying out the work.    Soil erosion in China, which is enormous in magnitude and  covers vast tracks of territory, has inflicted great harm on the  country. It has brought about long-term low yields and poverty  to localities, and even is endangering the subsistence of the  masses of people in some localities. Moreover, the running down  of silt in large quantities has caused floods and waterlogging  along the lower reachers of rivers. To work out this national  program for water and soil conservation, the Ministry of Water  Resources organized national forces to conduct large amounts of  investigation and study, scientific experiments, and observation  analyses.    In its reply, the State Council stressed: To do a good job  in water and soil conservation has a bearing on economic and  social development and on ecological environmental improvement,  and helps China shake off poverty and gain prosperity. It also  has a bearing on the development and harnessing of rivers and  lakes, as well as on the state's construction in the energy,  railway, communications, and mining industries, and other areas  of endeavor. It is a basic national policy that will yield  success in our time and will bring benefits throughout the ages.  Therefore, we should uphold it for a long time. The reply  pointed out: Water and soil conservation is a systems  engineering undertaking. It must adhere to the principle of  ""prevention as the key factor, overall planning, comprehensive  prevention and control, suiting measures to local conditions,  and stressing better management and efficiency."" Effective  efforts should be made to ensure the prevention, protection, and  supervision of soil erosion, and to ensure law enforcement work.  The policy should be implemented whereby those who harness  rivers and lakes and those who manage and protect them will reap  the benefits therefrom. While devoting our primary efforts  toward bringing the Huang He and the Chang Jiang under control,  we also should pay close attention to checking soil erosion in  other rivers and to the water and soil conservation work in the  key soil erosion prevention and protection areas, supervision  areas, and control areas at all levels.    The ""National Program for Water and Soil Conservation"" puts  forward two propositions on soil erosion control, of which the  second one suggests a more rapid pace of control. The State  Council's reply agreed in principle to carry out the water and  soil conservation work in accordance with the second proposition.     "

Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South  Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure  on the white-led government.

This means that China now has a fundamental basis  to go by in carrying out the work.    Soil erosion in China, which is enormous in magnitude and  covers vast tracks of territory, has inflicted great harm on the  country. It has brought about long-term low yields and poverty  to localities, and even is endangering the subsistence of the  masses of people in some localities. Moreover, the running down  of silt in large quantities has caused floods and waterlogging  along the lower reachers of rivers. To work out this national  program for water and soil conservation, the Ministry of Water  Resources organized national forces to conduct large amounts of  investigation and study, scientific experiments, and observation  analyses.    In its reply, the State Council stressed: To do a good job  in water and soil conservation has a bearing on economic and  social development and on ecological environmental improvement,  and helps China shake off poverty and gain prosperity. It also  has a bearing on the development and harnessing of rivers and  lakes, as well as on the state's construction in the energy,  railway, communications, and mining industries, and other areas  of endeavor It is a basic national policy that will yield  success in our time and will bring benefits throughout the ages.  Therefore, we should uphold it for a long time. The reply  pointed out: Water and soil conservation is a systems  engineering undertaking. It must adhere to the principle of  ""prevention as the key factor, overall planning, comprehensive  prevention and control, suiting measures to local conditions,  and stressing better management and efficiency."" Effective  efforts should be made to ensure the prevention, protection, and  supervision of soil erosion, and to ensure law enforcement work.  The policy should be implemented whereby those who harness  rivers and lakes and those who manage and protect them will reap  the benefits therefrom. While devoting our primary efforts  toward bringing the Huang He and the Chang Jiang under control,  we also should pay close attention to checking soil erosion in  other rivers and to the water and soil conservation work in the  key soil erosion prevention and protection areas, supervision  areas, and control areas at all levels.    The ""National Program for Water and Soil Conservation"" puts  forward two propositions on soil erosion control, of which the  second one suggests a a more rapid pace of control. The State  Council's reply agreed in principle to carry out the water and  soil conservation work in accordance with the second proposition.     "

On the third day of anti-govermnent protests, riot police  fought running battles with protesters, firing buckshot and  teargas to put down the unprecedented unrest in the homeland.    To add to political woes besetting President Lucas Mangope's  government, the African National Congress [ANC] called for a  mass stayaway from work in Bophuthatswana on Thursday and the  launching of a consumer boycott.    Pule Sekwana, speaking for civil servants who have embarked  on a widespread strike that has triggered much of the unrest in  the homeland, said on Wednesday: ""The strike will continue and  we will bring down the government down.""    In the first death in the unrest, the homeland's information  service said the policeman was shot dead ""by members of the  public"" in the Bophuthatswana township of Mabopane, north-west  of Pretoria. The policeman was at a police post when gunfire cut  him down.    A doctor at a Mafikeng surgery told SAPA he had treated 35  people for gunshot wounds on Wednesday afternoon and another  victim for other injuries. Those treated were apparently victims  of police shooting protesters late on Wednesday afternoon around  the capital Mmabatho and in neighbouring Mafikeng. Another man  was treated for gunshot wounds at Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital.    ""Most of the people we treated were shot in the torso and  upper body, and we removed buckshot from many of the wounds. We  also treated a number of grazes which could have been caused by  sharp ammunition,"" said Dr Anwel Hoosenmia, who treated the 35  victims at his surgery.    Earlier, riot police clashed with students at the University  of Bophuthatswana, firing volleys of teargas shells as the  students erected barricades with rocks and tree branches and  hurled stones at the police. No injuries were reported. The  street outside the university campus resembled a battle field  with streets signs and huge garbage skips blocking the road and  access to the campus still being controlled by heavily armed  police.    The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], meanwhile,  failed  on Wednesday in its bid to impose its authority in the homeland,  after two-hour talks with President Mangope and his cabinet.  ""The government of Bophuthatswana stated it is unable to  accede to the iec requests as this would be tantamount to  acceptance of the non-recognition of Bophuthatswana's  sovereignity,"" said a joint statement released after the  meeting. The IEC delegation was headed by its chairman, Mr  Justice Johann Kriegler.    The IEC requested the homeland government to permit  electioneering and voter education campaigns and to allow voting  facilities for South African citizens.    Mr Justice Kriegler said the meeting had clearly failed to  achieve its objectives and delegates would have to continue  trying to negotiate an agreement. he told reporters after the  meeting that the Transitional Executive Council and the South  African Government might take ""such action as they see fit""  following Bophuthatswana's rejection of its demands.    The TEC said on Tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties with  the  homeland, cut financial assistance and restrict the movement of  the homeland's officials in South Africa if Bophuthatswana  failed to allow free political activity within a week.    Bophuthatswana's Economic Affairs Minister Ephraim Keikelame  accused South Africa on Wednesday of ""aggression and  intimidation"" and ""denying the rights of Bophuthatswana citizens  of self-determination"". He said south african citizens living  in Bophuthatswana had ""the right to vote freely if they want to  campaign on the soil of South Africa but not in Bophuthatswana"".    But the homeland's striking civil servants, demanding  protection for their pensions in the face of political  developments in South Africa, said they were now also pressing  for the immeditae reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South  Africa. The homeland is to be reincorporated into South Africa  after the April 26-28 elections.    The strike has triggered the worst unrest seen in  Bophuthatswana in its 17 years of ""independence"". Schools have  been closed and health services and general government  administration severely disrupted.    And a day after striking employees of the homeland's  broadcasting corporation took President Mangope's son hostage,  the president on Wednesday fired all workers and announced the  closure of radio and television broadcasts. The striking  Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation workers are demanding a  50 per cent pay increases.    ""The Bophuthatswana cabinet today decided to close Bop  Broadcasting Corporation's [BBC] two television stations, Bop-TV  and Mmabatho TV, and the three radio stations, Radio Bop, Radio  Mmabatho and Radio Sunshine, until further notice,"" BBC Chairman  Eddie Mangope announced in a statement.    President Mangope, who survived a military takeover in 1988  after South Africa sent in troops to put down the rebellion, has  accused Foreign Minister Pik Botha of stoking unrest in  Bophuthatswana to justify his ouster and military intervention.    Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  leader Euguene Terreblanche, joining the fray, on Wednesday  offered to send his militants to the homeland to help Mr Mangope  withstand what Mr Terreblanche called an African National  Congress/SA Communist Party/Pik Botha plot. On Tuesday the  Conservative Party charged the chaotic events in the homeland  were a ""communist textbook case"".    In another development striking teachers marched to the  South  African Embassy in Mmabatho on Wednesday to demand South  Africa's military intervention in the homeland.    Following the late afternoon clashes around Mmabatho, Dr  Hoosenmia said he and his wife, Dr Sumedha Munim, spent most of  the afternoon treating victims at their Mafikeng surgery. A  police armoured personnel carrier Hippo was parked outside. Dr  Hoosenmia said patients in the surgery were prevented from  leaving the premises by the police. Two of those treated in the  surgery were sent to hospitals in South Africa as their wounds,  both in the stomach, were too serious to be treated in the  surgery.    The centre of Mafikeng on Wednesday night still showed signs  of the running battles with dirtbins thrown on streets and  garbage littering most of station street in the city centre.  Many store windows shattered in the unrest had been been  replaced while glazers were working in the dark to repair other  damaged shopfronts.    Staff at PG Glass in Mafikeng went on strike at 4pm, leaving  only one company, Motorglow, to repair the many broken plate  glass windows. Motorglow also replaced more than 100 car  windows and windscreens on Wednesday afternoon.     "

Having based its foreign policy on defending rights of the  world's oppressed, from the triumph of the Islamic revolution in  1979, Tehran, which severed ties with racist Pretoria, is to  resume its economic and political relations now that a popularly  elected government has come to power in South Africa.    The Iranian Cabinet approved establishment of  economic-political ties with South Africa in January 1994 with  the collapse of apartheid and commissioned the Foreign Ministry  to pave the way for removing the sanctions against the country  and set up relations with it.    Economic and political experts anticipate establishment of  firm and multilateral relations between Iran and South Africa  and foresee steady expansion in the future.    According to informed sources, South Africa, which was once  the main consumer of Iranian oil, intends to resume its economic  ties with Iran by importing crude oil, and the first official  agreement to be signed between the two countries is expected to  include the supply of Iranian crude oil for South African  refineries.    Iran expressed interest in improving its economic and trade  ties with the country a month after the lifting of United  Nation's economic sanctions against it.    Now it is expected that Iran would play an active and  substantial role in South Africa's economic programmes and that  the two countries' volume of exchange would rise to dlrs.

I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to  participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson  Mandela tomorrow.    Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by  his  friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at  the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international  airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house  and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral  and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation.  I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the  South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South  Africa is also a main point of their conversation.    Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over  the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in  office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the  sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when  he carried out a broad program of activities that included  participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province.    The two countries have also adopted, at different  international forums, common positions on just causes, when  firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to  great enemy pressures.    Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the  spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens  our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young  Ghanaians are studying in Cuba.    Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban  personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the  delegation members reported on the main activities taking place  in our country.    We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where  the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's  inauguration.

But it stopped short of blaming senior ANC officials for the abuses, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. In a report released yesterday, a three-man commission appointed by ANC president Nelson Mandela echoed criticisms from an earlier internal commission of inquiry, saying that ANC security officers had beaten, tortured, detained without trial, and in some cases executed detainees. But it named only two senior ANC officials and accused them of relatively minor abuses.

In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television  that  was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: ""The  effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's  independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the  elimination of apartheid.""    Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle  waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their  objectives, saying: ""Sooner or later, Namibia would have been  independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway.""    Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's  leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban  leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to  reach ""this political miracle,"" which I view as a very great  victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the  progressive forces.    The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of  Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the  high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded  yesterday.    When asked about conditions for normalizing relations  between  Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the  economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than  30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel.    Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for  the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and  sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the  political, economic, and social system they consider best must  be respected.    Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and  that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install  socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro  affirmed: ""We have nothing against the United States.""    The Cuban president praised the recently concluded  conference  in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and  industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the  degradation of the environment.     "

Qian expressed his satisfaction with the smooth growth of  bilateral ties, adding that China and Zaire enjoy a traditional  friendship which he believed has stood the test of time.    He stressed that China places great importance on developing  its ties with Zaire and intends to make concerted efforts  together with Zaire to enhance bilateral cooperation in every  field.    Qian said he appreciates and supports the efforts that Zaire  has made in safeguarding its state independence and sovereignty  and its stand opposing foreign interference, which speaks highly  of Zaireans' efforts to overcome difficulties and resume  national stability.    He noted that Zaire is an important country in Africa and  its  stability and development will be of great importance to Central  Africa and the whole continent.    Qian pointed out that dramatic changes in the international  situation has brought many new difficulties and problems to  Africa.    Meanwhile, he said, they also stimulate the African people's  new awakening.    Qian noted that more and more African countries have come to  realize that their common aspirations are to oppose foreign  interference, safeguard political stability and seek economic  development.    He said it is of great importance for African countries and  other developing countries to strengthen unity and cooperation.    The Chinese Government supports African countries' efforts  toward the realization of peace and development on the continent.    Qian asked Ngbanda to convey the Chinese leaders' greetings  to Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.    During the meeting Ngbanda conveyed a letter from President  Mobutu to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, adding that Zaire and  China have a very good relationship and that it is his hope that  such ties will grow in a wide range of areas.    Wang Changyi, Chinese assistant foreign minister, attended  the meeting.    Ngbanda and his party arrived here on June 1 as guests of  the  Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Rand Merchant Bank, one of South Africa's three largest investment banks, is to borrow Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) from a syndicate of international banks within the next two weeks, according to Citibank, the US bank which is arranging the deal. Although the amount is relatively small, larger deals are likely to follow. Gencor, the South African mining company, is expected to come to the syndicated loans market at the end of this year with a seven-year Dollars 537.5m loan to help finance the company's acquisition of Shell's Billiton metals and minerals business. These loans are emerging as South Africa seeks a debt rating from the international rating agencies, and follow the completion in July of the first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African company, a Dollars 300m deal for Liberty Life, the country's largest life insurance company. South Africa plans to tap the international bond market, when it has acquired a rating. Many international banks are keen to lend to South Africa which is viewed as a high growth area but which has been largely closed as a result of sanctions. In a syndicated loan, one or two banks arrange a transaction and parcel out portions of the loan in order to share the risk. Citibank, which is in the process of sounding out interest among other banks, said the loan will have a final maturity of one year with individual drawings maturing in 90 to 180 days. It said European banks are expected to be the main participants but also reported strong interest from the Middle East.   Companies:-  Rand Merchant Bank.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Once considered a luxury, rice has become the chief staple food and major source of calories for some 70m of West Africa's 200m people. Output in the 17 countries that make up the region has risen by more than 5 per cent a year since 1980, doubling to a record 6.6m tonnes last year, the highest increase for any of the major cereal crops. The popularity of rice in West Africa, particularly among urban dwellers, means that consumption has shot up at an even faster rate than output, exceeding 9.5m tonnes in 1992. Some 3m tonnes had to be imported last year at a cost of Dollars 600m, putting a severe strain on scarce reserves of foreign exchange. While countries in the region are trying to encourage yet higher output, and cut down on imports, farmers are facing a number of problems that could put a brake on expansion. Rice is still a relatively new crop in West Africa and high-yielding varieties suitable for the region have yet to be developed. A research institute, the West Africa Rice Development Association, based in Bouake, Ivory Coast, which is trying to develop improved varieties of rice and encourage sustainable farming practices, is facing a funding crisis. Warda, which was set up in 1970, was recently forced to close one of its stations in Sierra Leone because of the withdrawal of funds by USAid, The US government aid organisation. Two other research stations, at Bouake and at Saint Louis in Senegal, are down to skeleton staffs. The World Bank, one of Warda's largest donors, last year cut its annual funding from Dollars 1.785m to Dollars 1.5m, while the European Community slashed support from Dollars 532,927 to Dollars 324,000. Only two of the regions's 17 countries contributed funds for Warda's research, despite their interest in producing more rice from their own fields. 'If the countries who spend so much money importing rice, divert only a tiny fraction for us to do research it would help solve the problem,' said the association's director-general, Dr Eugene Terry. A panel of rice experts that conducted a review of Warda's work said that it had been 'reduced close to the level of critical mass, and in some aspects may already be below it. This is an extremely serious and urgent situation'. Most rice in West Africa is not grown in Asian-style paddies but by small farmers in upland areas without the benefit of irrigation. Africa's existing upland rice varieties are hardy but yield less than a tonne per hectare, compared with a global average of about 3.5 tonnes. Upland farmers in West Africa who apply fertiliser are averaging more than two tonnes a hectare, but fertiliser is not widely available. When Warda was first established, it concentrated on adapting high-yielding rice varieties developed in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere to West African conditions. It was hoped that these varieties could give Africans the benefits Asians were enjoying. But Warda admits that this approach proved 'misdirected'. In the hot dusty winds and extreme temperatures of West Africa the Asian varieties fared badly, and researchers are now trying to improve local varieties. Higher yielding varieties could have an important environmental spin-off, enabling farmers to allow longer fallow periods in between rice cultivation. Much of the expansion of rice output in West Africa has taken place because farmers have shortened these fallow periods, but at the risk of serious land degradation. Researchers point out that provided the right varieties can be found there is considerable potential to expand the output of rice from West African inland valleys. These valleys cover about 19m ha, and rice now only grows on about 5 per cent of them.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P0112 Rice.   Types:-  MKTS  Production.

0,FT943-7356 ,"FT943-7356 _AN-EHXE7AA9FT 940824   FT  24 AUG 94 / S Africa cautious on scrapping currency controls      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Liberalisation of South Africa's exchange control regulations will not be possible until the country gets an international credit rating, Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday. Delivering his annual report in Pretoria, Mr Stals said it was clear the existing system would have to be scrapped to ensure sustainable, long-term growth for the country. 'In the long run and in the interest of future economic growth, South Africa must liberalise its foreign exchange market and revert to a system of unitary floating exchange rates,' he said. However, Mr Stals noted that in other countries exchange controls were abolished only as part of a macro-economic restructuring programme, often with the help of international institutions, and that at the very least South Africa must wait until it had full access to international capital markets. South Africa's two-tier currency comprises the commercial rand, used for all regular balance of payments transactions, and the financial rand, used by foreigners as a discounted investment currency. Exchange restrictions have been in place since the 1960s. 'The abolition of exchange controls in isolation without any supportive measures may cause serious disruptions in the initial phase of the transition and force the reintroduction of old controls, or even the application of other new direct controls over markets, all of which may be more damaging to the economy,' he said. South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to help it get an international credit rating from the main agencies, a process expected to be completed by October. In addition, Mr Stals reiterated his previously stated preconditions for the scrapping of the financial rand, including a narrowing of the differential between the two exchange rates and a rise in foreign reserves, currently able to cover only five weeks' imports. In recent months, continued speculation over demise of the investment currency has led to severe gyrations in its exchange rate, while fears over the inflationary pressures such a move might unleash have contributed to soaring government bond rates. Responding to the recent upturn in the inflation rate, which rose in June to 7.5 per cent from a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, Mr Stals signalled that the Reserve Bank would probably have to tighten monetary policy to help lower inflationary expectations and cautioned the new government against trying to increase spending. 'Many of us have a desire to force-feed the economy beyond its actual potential and to exert pressure on the monetary system to accommodate these desires by simply creating more money,' he warned. Mr Stals also said that while he was confident the country's capital account would continue to improve, it would be 'naive' to believe that huge amounts of capital would flow into the country even if exchange controls were lifted. Social and political stability, economic viability, sound fiscal and monetary policies and productivity improvements were of even greater importance for most foreign investors.

PEACEKEEPERS CAN DO MORE;    SUCCESSES SHOW ABILITY TO TACKLE OTHER HOT SPOTS, WIDER ROLES      By CYRUS VANCE and BARRY BLECHMAN, Cyrus Vance, a member of the Palme  Commission, was secretary of state in the Carter Administration. Barry Blechman  helped to draft the commission's report. He is a former assistant director of  the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.      In the broad sweep of international events, no development has been more  important in the last two years than the considerable progress that has been  made in resolving conflicts in the developing world. This is the conclusion of  the Palme Commission, a group of 16 former heads of state, cabinet-level  ministers and political leaders, chaired by Sweden's late Prime Minister Olof  Palme, which met sporadically between 1980 and April of this year.    At its final meeting, the commission noted that as late as 1986, there were 36  armed conflicts around the globe, virtually all in developing regions. Because  these wars occurred primarily in areas already debilitated by poverty and  underdevelopment, the human suffering was extraordinary. An estimated 3 million  to 5 million people died as a direct result of war; millions more have fled the  fighting, seeking food, shelter, health care and escape from political  persecution. Indeed, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees is aiding 13  million people at present, an appalling figure and an odious index of the  world's continuing inhumanity.    Within the last two years, progress has been made toward the relief of this  suffering. U.N. mediators have made possible a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war,  although not yet a peace settlement. They have also brought an end to the use  of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, although not to the civil war in that country.  U.S. mediation has led to the conclusion of agreements that could help to  advance the cause of peace in Namibia and Angola. Other efforts by the United  Nations and by regional leaders to mediate conflicts have met with varying  degrees of success in Central America, the Western Sahara and Cambodia.    U.N. forces will play a role in ensuring the peace in many of these situations,  as they do already in the Middle East and several other regions. There are  10,000 soldiers from 23 countries now serving in the ""blue-helmet"" force. They  carry out two kinds of operations: U.N. peacekeepers impose themselves between  contending forces to avert incidents that could flare into war, while unarmed  U.N. observers monitor, report and mediate between local commanders in the  field. At present, there are eight operations of each type under way, and the  prospect of several more in the near future.    The development of a more stable and peaceful international system requires  greater attention to U.N. peacekeeping. Changes in U.N. procedures --  particularly a strengthening of the secretary-general's authority to monitor,  report on and recommend actions concerning international conflicts -- could  enable peacekeeping missions to be mounted in a more timely manner and carried  out more effectively. Moreover, both the roles envisioned for these  international military forces, and the resources available for them, could  usefully be expanded.    Traditionally, U.N. peacekeepers have been used to oversee cease-fires and  other temporary means of ending armed conflicts. In the more peaceful climate  that now exists, more wide-ranging functions can be envisioned:     -- U.N. forces could be used to oversee elections in situations such as  Namibia's.     -- Maritime peacekeeping forces could be established to ensure free passage  through vital international waterways, like the Strait of Hormuz, in situations  such as the recent hostilities in the Persian Gulf, and to maintain security in  waters troubled by pirates, as in Southeast Asia.     -- In certain other types of situations, U.N. peacekeeping forces could be  used to respond to international terrorists, as well as to protect mini-states  from mercenaries and other external threats to their security.     -- U.N. experts and logistical capabilities could even be used to help contain  the effects of ecological catastrophes that threaten neighboring states,  particularly in nations that lack the resources or expertise to deal with such  problems alone.    Such an expansion of peacekeeping functions could not take place unless greater  resources were made available to the U.N. organization. Indeed, resources  limitations have already curbed peacekeeping operations. Because of fiscal  constraints, for example, the size of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group in  Namibia was reduced by nearly half and its start delayed. It does not require  imagination to understand that problems currently threatening the peace  arrangements in southern Africa are related to this ragged start.    Military units in national armed forces, including the armed forces of the  permanent members of the Security Council, that might be made available for  peacekeeping should be earmarked now, before they are needed, along with the  air- and sea-lift units that could move them to trouble spots in a timely  fashion. Specialized equipment should be stockpiled, particularly seismic and  acoustic sensors, communications gear and mobile radars, all of which could be  helpful in monitoring disengagement zones. Industrialized nations might help  developing states to train and equip their military forces for peacekeeping.    Financing peacekeeping operations has always been a problem, with various  states at times refusing to pay their assessed contributions. At its last  meeting, the Palme Commission proposed that a special peacekeeping fund be  established and built up to a total of $2 billion over a few years. The fund  would be financed on the basis of a general formula assessing U.N. members,  with no one member expected to pay an excessive share. Voluntary contributions  to the peacekeeping fund also would be encouraged, particularly from those  states like Japan and West Germany that, as a matter of law or policy, do not  participate directly in peacekeeping operations.    The world is in the midst of a warming trend in international relations. Not  only have East-West relations improved greatly, but there is at least  diplomatic movement in virtually all troubled regions. Such trends come and go,  however. The nations of the world must act now to take the concrete steps  necessary to preserve and expand the progress which has recently been achieved.

Other efforts by the United  Nations and by regional leaders to mediate conflicts have met with varying  degrees of success in Central America, the Western Sahara and Cambodia.    U.N. forces will play a role in ensuring the peace in many of these situations,  as they do already in the Middle East and several other regions. There are  10,000 soldiers from 23 countries now serving in the ""blue-helmet"" force. They  carry out two kinds of operations: U.N. peacekeepers impose themselves between  contending forces to avert incidents that could flare into war, while unarmed  U.N. observers monitor, report and mediate between local commanders in the  field. At present, there are eight operations of each type under way, and the  prospect of several more in the near future.    The development of a more stable and peaceful international system requires  greater attention to U.N. peacekeeping. Changes in U.N. procedures --  particularly a strengthening of the secretary-general's authority to monitor,  report on and recommend actions concerning international conflicts -- could  enable peacekeeping missions to be mounted in a more timely manner and carried  out more effectively. Moreover, both the roles envisioned for these  international military forces, and the resources available for them, could  usefully be expanded.    Traditionally, U.N. peacekeepers have been used to oversee cease-fires and  other temporary means of ending armed conflicts. In the more peaceful climate  that now exists, more wide-ranging functions can be envisioned:     -- U.N. forces could be used to oversee elections in situations such as  Namibia's.     -- Maritime peacekeeping forces could be established to ensure free passage  through vital international waterways, like the Strait of Hormuz, in situations  such as the recent hostilities in the Persian Gulf, and to maintain security in  waters troubled by pirates, as in Southeast Asia.     -- In certain other types of situations, U.N. peacekeeping forces could be  used to respond to international terrorists, as well as to protect mini-states  from mercenaries and other external threats to their security.     -- U.N. experts and logistical capabilities could even be used to help contain  the effects of ecological catastrophes that threaten neighboring states,  particularly in nations that lack the resources or expertise to deal with such  problems alone.    Such an expansion of peacekeeping functions could not take place unless greater  resources were made available to the U.N. organization. Indeed, resources  limitations have already curbed peacekeeping operations. Because of fiscal  constraints, for example, the size of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group in  Namibia was reduced by nearly half and its start delayed. It does not require  imagination to understand that problems currently threatening the peace  arrangements in southern Africa are related to this ragged start.    Military units in national armed forces, including the armed forces of the  permanent members of the Security Council, that might be made available for  peacekeeping should be earmarked now, before they are needed, along with the  air- and sea-lift units that could move them to trouble spots in a timely  fashion. Specialized equipment should be stockpiled, particularly seismic and  acoustic sensors, communications gear and mobile radars, all of which could be  helpful in monitoring disengagement zones. Industrialized nations might help  developing states to train and equip their military forces for peacekeeping.    Financing peacekeeping operations has always been a problem, with various  states at times refusing to pay their assessed contributions. At its last  meeting, the Palme Commission proposed that a special peacekeeping fund be  established and built up to a total of $2 billion over a few years. The fund  would be financed on the basis of a general formula assessing U.N. members,  with no one member expected to pay an excessive share. Voluntary contributions  to the peacekeeping fund also would be encouraged, particularly from those  states like Japan and West Germany that, as a matter of law or policy, do not  participate directly in peacekeeping operations.    The world is in the midst of a warming trend in international relations. Not  only have East-West relations improved greatly, but there is at least  diplomatic movement in virtually all troubled regions. Such trends come and go,  however. The nations of the world must act now to take the concrete steps  necessary to preserve and expand the progress which has recently been achieved.      Opinion    "

The deal will be financed through a share-swap, and the price - estimated at about IPounds 20m (Pounds 19m) - will be calculated on the average share price of the first 28 days of trading of Argus Newspapers when the group is floated in April this year on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Independent is purchasing its stake from the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company and the Anglo-American Corporation. The deal will give the two companies around 4m new shares in the Independent group, equivalent to a 5 per cent stake. Independent will have effective control of Argus with its 31 per cent stake. Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive officer of Heinz, added that the smoothness of the transaction confirmed the commercial sense of doing business in South Africa. A team from Heinz was evaluating partnerships with local companies. Last week Independent Newspapers acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing in the UK which publishes The Independent and Independent on Sunday. It also owns 20 per cent of APN, the Australian regional newspaper group. In 1992 it failed to acquire the Fairfax publishing group in Australia, and later failed to buy Mirror Group Newspapers in the UK. Argus Newspapers turned in pre-tax profit of R53m (Pounds 10m) on sales of R685m in 1993. The group's interests include the Star and the Sowetan, the country's most popular daily newspapers, as well as publications in Cape Town and Durban. Mr O'Reilly's ties with South Africa go back to his first visit in 1955 as a member of the British Lions rugby team. He shunned investment in South Africa during the apartheid era, but cultivated close links with Mr Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, and then Mr Nelson Mandela. His commercial activities in southern Africa have been restricted so far to Olivine Industries, a joint venture with the Zimbabwe government.   Companies:-  Independent Newspapers.

That is  their intent. They even included this in a document known as the  New South Africa Foreign Policy Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] Well, from the point of view of our relations with  Mandela, the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We  have had close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we  are family. Regarding foreign relations we are not demanding  anything, or putting conditions; the closer our friendship with  a country, the less we ask to establish ties. We allow  circumstances and the appropriate moment to determine the  establishment of ties. In the special case of South Africa, at  this time, we could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son.  However, we have not pressed the issue of formal ties. I believe  that perhaps tomorrow it will be brought up in the talks with  the foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with  the foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps he will bring this up and ties will be immediately  established. However, we will not bring it up. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up as a demand or as a  request from us.    However, it seems inevitable that those ties will be  established quickly because there are few countries with whom we  have stronger ties -- kinship and fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I do not speak with  ministers of other countries. We talked like old relatives. I am  convinced all of them want the prompt establishment of ties; but  out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    Now, it is a matter of formalities. That formality could be  fulfilled today, tomorrow, or the day after. Very soon.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, further on this issue but  on another aspect, independently of whenever the diplomatic ties  are established: In what fields do you believe that cooperation  could be developed the furthest in areas of common interest  between Cuba and South Africa?    [Castro] Whenever we speak with South Africans or South  African cadres, we discover great prospects. The first thing we  notice is in the spiritual sphere. When they talk with us, at  times, the things they say truly moved us. They express a  fondness for Cuba which leaves us really speechless. There is an  incredible bond of affection. I believe that few times has there  been such a great bond with any country. When we speak with them  and discuss their plans and ideas, given South Africa's  condition, on one hand they have great development and high  living standards; on the other hand, great social needs, for  example, enormous need for housing, public health, schooling,  and jobs. I was talking with the transportation people. I was  introduced to every minister today at the luncheon. I was told  they have many people who lack the means to move. I spoke with  the transportation minister who said he has a difficult task  ahead of him because means of transportation are inadequate even  though it is a developed country. South Africa is a developed  country. It has important technology, important industries; yet  it has a large population that for many years has lived under  apartheid and has a great stash of needs and dreams of a better  life.    Therefore, the government is faced with having to find  solutions to those problems. When you speak with the  transportation minister you find out about these needs. When you  speak with the housing minister, you find out about those great  needs. When you speak with the sports ministers, you find about  their dreams of developing sports. If you talk with the public  health minister, you see their dreams of improving their  people's health services; thus, the enormous social sphere on  which there are prospects for cooperation between both nations.  This would be beneficial both ways: cooperation from us based on  our experiences, as well as South African cooperation based on  their experiences, and technological development.    [Text] I also spoke with the education minister. They have  great education projects. In other words, all you need to do is  talk a while with each one of these cadres and ministers to  understand that there is a very broad field for cooperation  between Cuba and South Africa. This is undoubtedly the most  developed country in southern Africa.    You should see the road infrastructure. I was telling the  transportation minister: You may have a problem of not enough  means of transportation, but you have great roads. They have  good infrastructure in many areas. The problem is that the  wealth has not been distributed fairly. You find, next to a  superdeveloped world, let us say, an underdeveloped world.    With no other country, even in Latin America, are there such  prospects for cooperation as there are between South Africa and  Cuba, to the extent that we seriously work and study  possibilities and continue to develop that highly fraternal and  warm bond between our two peoples. I must add that we have taken  notice of the very respectful treatment extended to us by every  social sector, not only by ANC members but by the nonblack and  mixed blood sectors, as well. We have also been welcomed by the  white population. We have to keep in mind that this is a  multiracial nation with millions of people from diverse ethnic  backgrounds who have a vital need to cooperate among themselves.  Today, we saw this spirit of cooperation.    Everyone is saying, and justifiably, that the hardest part  begins now. Everyone knows that the hardest part follows the  period of change, of liberation. That is true. I do not think  his [Mandela's] task is easy. However, I believe that they have  developed a significant talent to find solutions. What we saw  today heightened our optimism regarding South Africa's future.  Although we cannot say that South Africa's problems are solved,  they have solved great problems. They have reached today, but I  think they are going to have to continue the struggle. There is  no doubt that Mandela is the man with all the qualifications to  lead this process. He has secured decisive support. I believe he  has to continue working to consolidate what has been achieved so  far and avoid divisiveness. A united country is essential. This  is what we most hope for, and we hope they attain it. Cuba will  be very proud to develop cooperation with South Africa.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, right now, in such a  convulsed world, what does Mandela's victory mean for the  progressive forces?    [Castro] I believe it is a great victory, a great victory of  the South African peoples, the African people, and all the  progressive forces in the world. It is a veritable example and  hope. I believe that South Africa is called upon to exert a  great and positive influence over the entire continent. It is a  renaissance, a revival, proof that great victories can be  achieved even after the disasters that have befallen the world  and that many things are still possible in a unipolar world.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and  South Africa had great differences because of Angola. Did you  ever think then, or later, that you would be here today in the  former capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South Africas and two moments  in  history. For specific reasons, strong clashes took place at a  certain time in history. Now, however, there is a new South  Africa in which such clashes no longer exist -- only peace,  harmony, respect, and affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. First of all, we had to save Angola and its  independence. We were in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning  of intervention by foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our  support -- for 15 years. So many things happened. We had a  strong presence, but it was not strong enough because we could  not, nor did it depend on us alone to, reach a solution to the  problem.    In Angola we fought with the greatest selflessness. The rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would say that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted -- difficult but not through our fault. Cuba  fulfilled its duty every step of the way. Cuba contributed to  the solution of the highly difficult problems that arose. I do  not want to criticize anyone. I believe today is not a day to  criticize. Perhaps history will record this.    This reminds me of what Jose Eduardo [dos Santos] said to  me during today's luncheon, the very heartfelt, friendly words  from the depths of his soul regarding the [words indistinct]  meaning of Cuba's support to the southern Africa nations of  Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. He pronounced truly moving  words. This is why, in the analysis of our conscience, we find  nothing to reproach.    In one of the most difficult periods, in the end, we had to  make very hard decisions; and we did so. They were the correct  decisions. The problem had to be solved. We could not afford to  be so weak that we had to endure foreign intervention and be  strong enough to solve the issues of foreign intervention. In  such cases, if you are weak, you may incur a great defeat; if  you are strong, you can spare many lives. This is the way it  happened in Angola. We accumulated such a potential that it was  possible to solve the conflict with a minimal loss of lives.  Those were decisions made by Cuba, alone and solely. History has  been distorted many times; but in 1975, when we decided to help  the Angolan people against foreign intervention, the decision  was Cuba's alone. At other times when we had to act in difficult  situations, the decisions were Cuba's alone; at times, it is sad  to say, in order to overcome mistakes made by others. I do not  want to say by whom. However, I am not going to blame the  Angolans; it was others.    We found we needed to act; even in the last, very difficult  situation, mistakes were made -- not our mistakes. That final  situation was decisive or Angola would have been lost, with all  the consequences and losses that would mean for the Angolan  people and ourselves. All this influenced the events that  afterward culminated in those negotiations by virtue of which  Namibia's independence was attained with the implementation of  Resolution 435.    I think this helped accelerate the process of the South  African struggle against apartheid. The main, essential, and  decisive merit belongs to the South African people. Our action  might have helped accelerate that process. This is how we see  it. This is a subject on which we have to be very careful. We  should not be the ones speaking about this, but others. The  South African and Angolan peoples have spoken of the selfless  and noble solidarity of Cuba with their countries. We lived  diverse moments which I believe shall be recorded in history as  they happened.    To date, I see the events and development of the situation  in  South Africa as something wonderful. Much depends on what  happens in South Africa, whether the country attains peace,  harmony, and unity. This is what all of us ought to struggle for  and contribute toward, so that the result of the efforts and  sacrifices of many create a country that can serve as a model to  the world on how to solve such complex problems as the ones  experienced here.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, do you not believe that  this history is being written now? Today, Mandela referred to  the guests at the inauguration, you among them, and said, and I  quote: Not too long ago, we had to fight and in that struggle  many nations helped us, nations represented here today.    [Castro] I believe he said more: Nations which even spilled  their blood.    Yes, I was moved by that part of the speech. We owe a debt  to  history for the possibility of giving, offering, and reflecting  on the essence of everything that has happened in the last 18 or  19 years. It is now 1994 and this began in 1975. Actually, it  began before 1975 with our cooperation with the peoples of  Guinea-Bissau and Angola, who were fighting against Portuguese  colonialism. All in all, it began over 30 years ago.    The main part took place after 1975 when Cuba made a full  commitment, when the Revolution committed itself fully. We have  to point out that our Revolution played all its cards in that  struggle, and more than once. A defeat under those conditions  would have meant the end of the Cuban Revolution.    All this happened after 1975. We have to gather all that  information. We have not yet written the history of the Cuban  Revolution, but one of the most brilliant pages of the history  of the Cuban Revolution was its selfless cooperation and  solidarity with Africa. As someone once said, the leader of  Guinea-Bissau, I remember, Amilcar [Cabral] said: When we are  independent, Cape Verde and Cuba should become a federation.  That is what he said. By this, I mean to say that he had  extraordinary internationalist feelings. He is the one who said  that someday our dead from Angola would rise up to negate the  smear campaigns against Cuba by those who say that Cuba had  ulterior economic and material motives in Angola.    He said those unforgettable words. Amilcar's death was  truly sad. He was assassinated as other leaders have been. It  pains me that (Zamora Machel) was not present in this  celebration. It pains me that Oliver Tambo was not here today.  There were so many people who struggled and deserved to see a  day like today. It is painful to remember that they are no  longer with us. However, we have the consolation of knowing that  their work yielded fruit and is present in all these things we  are seeing.    Well, our history could not have been more selfless, more  supporting, more noble than that we have written in connection  with the peoples of Africa and other parts of the world. I  believe we have been steadfast toward our African heritage, our  cultural heritage, our blood lines; toward our principles of  solidarity with people struggling to gain their independence,  their freedom; toward our principles of commitment to just  causes in this world. We will never regret this. I believe  future generations will always remember this with pride.    However, we must assume full responsibility with history, by  ensuring that it gets written. It is about time to write down  history. Or others will -- and who knows what they would write?    [Unidentified reporter] We have witnessed the burial of  apartheid, yet everyone is filled with happiness and joy; we  experienced it this morning at the inauguration.    [Castro] We have witnessed the burial of apartheid and the  birth of freedom. What we witnessed today is beautiful in the  extreme. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity  among the South African people, among every sector, and every  ethnic group. You cannot imagine how much we wish right now that  this process continue developing in that direction.    There are many things remaining in this world to be buried,  however; and it seems the number of undertakers is on the  increase everywhere. We also saw this in Barbados [words  indistinct] irresponsibility which with the world's natural  resources and living conditions are being destroyed. The number  of undertakers of evil is on the increase, as well as the number  of midwives of good.     "

In a message released in Pretoria by the Caribbean  delegation, Castro told the South African president-elect of the  Cuban people's joy over the establishment of a multiracial and  democratic government in South Africa.    The Cuban head of state said in brief statements to PRENSA  LATINA he wishes Mandela peace, harmony, and unity in the great  task he must fulfill as of tomorrow when, during a solemn  ceremony, he takes the oath as president of South Africa.    Castro had earlier expressed joy at being in South Africa  for  Mandela's inauguration. The two men will meet for the first  time in Pretoria tomorrow, during the solemn ceremony.    Castro added this is an important day: ""It is an opportunity  to experience an event of historic importance for the peoples of  Cuba and the world,"" he said.    The Cuban president is one of 42 heads of state who have  announced they would attend the event, which will also be  attended by many well-known figures.    The Caribbean statesman arrived in Pretoria by highway from  Johannesburg, where he arrived on Monday on a flight from Accra,  where he spent a 12-hour technical stopover en route from  Barbados.    Castro was welcomed in Ghana by his friend Ghanaian  President  Jerry John Rawlings, who within the past few hours also traveled  to South Africa where the presidents of Nigeria, Angola,  Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Palestine have already arrived.    A source close to the Cuban delegation disclosed Castro has  already received several requests for interviews and meetings  from heads of state and government, and from journalists who are  in South Africa.    Among the earliest requests were those from the presidents  of  Sudan, Nigeria, the PLO, and South African television stations.    It is expected the period following Mandela's inauguration  will be one of intense work for Castro, the source added.    The Cuban high-level delegation is lodged at the Arcadia  Hotel and consists of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon, president of parliament, and Environment, Science, and  Technology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon.

According to Governor Fu Xishou, one of them is to improve  the contract responsibility system for land utilization. ""This  is the key to stabilizing rural policies,"" he said.    The provincial government has decided that after the 15-year  contracts for land utilization expire this year, farmers may  renew their contracts for 30 years more.    During the contract period farmers are entitled to lease or  mortgage the land or become share-holders.    The period of contracting for barren mountains, land and  water surface may extend up to 70 years.    Anhui is one of China's major agricultural provinces.  Although some five million rural laborers left the fields for  urban areas to seek employment last year, the province still  reaped a grain harvest of 25.96 million tons, an increase of  10.8 percent over the previous year and becoming the only  province in southern China to record a grain increase.    The past decade has seen this East China province not only  become self-sufficient in grain but also sell more than two  billion kg of grain a year to other parts of the country.    ""The establishment of a grain reserve system and a grain  risk  foundation is another measure,"" the governor noted.    The provincial government plans to reserve 600 million kg of  grain to ensure timely grain purchase from farmers and arouse  their enthusiasm for farm production.    In addition, Anhui will increase its input into agriculture.    While continuously boosting its grain output, the provincial  government is determined to pay attention to quality and  efficiency in line with market needs.    It will concentrate on the production of quality rice,  cotton, oil-bearing crops, tea, livestock and poultry, silk,  fruit, vegetables, aquatic products, traditional Chinese herbal  medicines and edible fungus this year.    According to the governor, the government will select 10  counties, 20 production bases and 50 administrative villages to  try out an overall agricultural development project.    Meanwhile, the government is determined to reform the census  registration system to gradually transfer 10 million surplus  rural laborers to urban areas.    At present, the governor noted, Anhui is growing grain on  six  million ha of land, and is expected to produce 25 billion kg of  grain this year, about the same as last year. Its summer crops  are growing well.    The governor disclosed that the province still has three  million people, accounting for five percent of the provincial  population, living below the poverty line.    The provincial government has vowed to exert more efforts to  help these people to rise above the poverty line within three to  five years and live comfortable lives within eight years.    To reduce farmers' financial burdens, the provincial  government has already revoked 87 charges.     "

I warmly welcome our  brothers and neighbors, the leaders of the African-Muslim  countries: Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in the same manner as  we welcomed our friend Museveni, the Ugandan president, and  before him our brother Deby, the president of Chad.    The Libyan people welcome and appreciate such solidarity  from  their brothers because it will consolidate the Libyan people's  position in its confrontation with the conspiracy led by three  colonialist-Western countries. [passage omitted]    The Libyan people feels comfortable after the effort it  extended to the neighboring fraternal peoples and deems that the  patriots have assumed power in these countries and the agents  have fallen.    The Libyan people has undertaken numerous responsibilities  toward these peoples. The victory of the will of the peoples of  Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, and the consolidation of  freedom and democracy....[pauses] On the other hand, from the  viewpoint of the Western imperialist countries, what the Libyan  people were doing was considered support for international  terrorism, and considered the training camps for those leaders  and peoples, who were carrying out a liberation war, as  terrorist camps. This pretext has now been exposed, and this  Western propaganda, which they used so frequently in the  aggression against Libya, has fallen. But, it seems that the  colonialists will not let the Third World achieve stability and  build itself in order to progress.    After these national movements won in these countries, we  see  that the colonialist countries work toward creating trouble and  problems for them. The material evidence that condemn the  countries of Western colonialism are obvious. They accuse us of  all untrue accusations and refuse to be confronted with the  facts that condemn them. Regrettably, this will not lead to an  understanding between us.    We all know that these peoples now, in Niger, Burkina Faso,  and Mali, who aspire for stability and construction, are today  the target of a new plot. The role of the old type of  colonialism has been concretely confirmed. This implicit and  flagrant interference in the domestic affairs of these peoples  contradicts the statements and declarations made by these  countries.    In the past they accused Libya of being behind the  destabilization of African states. Yet, it transpired that  Libya was behind the cause of liberation and people's democracy.  Now, the very states who used to accuse Libya are the ones who  are trying fervently to destabilize the African continent.    These are inhuman ethics and a flagrant injustice. The  Western states are constantly pursuing these states; they are  trying to sow instability in them; they deny them a chance to  prove themselves. Psychologically speaking, we feel as if we are  facing groups who are enemies of humanity. We are facing a  mentality used to arrogance and the enslavement of others. This  is not an accusation, but a reality.    Who on earth can belittle a person who happens to have a  black skin? Who in the world introduced the words racial  discrimination to the dictionary? They are the Western  colonialist states.    Regrettably, we are facing peoples who are defying the whole  of mankind. We are in confrontation against arrogant states,  who impose their wrath against us; they use a veto against our  future. When we raise our voice and resist, they accuse us of  being warmongers, and against peace.    What kind of peace are they talking about? They are talking  about surrender and that Third World people should surrender  without making a stand. We have decided, nonetheless, to  resist. A fact that they must understand.    Africa should not be destined to face poverty and misery  until doomsday merely because of its skin, which was God's  creation. They have begun a new flagrant interference.  Regrettably they have meddled with the United Nations, which  used to be the refuge of peoples seeking peace and protection.  They have torn up the UN Charter. They had no right to tear up  a charter that was written by the people.    They have trodden on international law; they have no right  to  do so. It is an international law and not an internal one.  They have been using the United Nations for a purpose  completely different from the one that was intended for it.  They are using the United Nations as a vehicle for  neo-colonialism.    Before, they used the League of Nations to impose their  protectorate on the colonized Third World countries. As soon as  they fiddled with it the League of Nations fell.    Today, the Western powers are accused of working seriously  for the fall of the United Nations. The best proof is the fact  that they have been using the United Nations for their  manipulation; they have transformed it into an instrument in  their hands. They have trodden on its charter.    Today, they are carrying out their own work in the name of  the United Nations. They are using the United Nations outside  its Charter. Thus, they have decided to kill the United  Nations. This attitude is a serious one that can be very  harmful to people of the world. This means that we will face a  new form of chaos. The world will be transformed into a jungle;  and the Western states will be responsible for the outcome.    What is happening these days in a number of Third World  countries is clear proof of what I have just said. They believe  that the Third World is made up of children and duped people;  this is in addition to their inferior attitude toward Africa;  they think that the African people are mere gorillas living in a  jungle; they do not believe that the inhabitants of Africa are  human beings. Even Dr. Barnard, the heart surgeon who succeeded  in performing the first heart transplant operation used to hold  this way of thinking; i.e., black people are not human beings,  consequently, one should carry out tests on them unreservedly.  Consequently, he carried out numerous tests on black people,  like the test performed in the West on mice and rabbits.    After having killed a large number of people and destroyed  their hearts, he succeeded in perfecting the right heart  transplant technique. All this stems from their attitude of  inferiority toward the black race. They think that we do not  understand this.    Their behavior is aimed at undermining our will, our desire  to live, and our right to our land. Now, they are interfering  in the internal affairs of every state; they believe that we are  children and duped to the extent that they create problems, then  they claim that they have to send military forces to solve these  problems.    We are aware that they are the ones who created these  problems so that they have a pretext to intervene and solve  them; they think that we are naive and ignorant and imbeciles to  be fooled by this game. Their mentality is still that of Vasco  de Gama; they think that Africa still resembles the one  discovered by Vasco de Gama when he gave Africans shells and  beads and took raw material and land in return. All Western  states are like Vasco de Gama; they share the same mentality as  that of Vasco de Gama; they still perceive and consider us as  the same people who were discovered by Vasco de Gama. These are  the matters that incite revolution, and force us to accept the  challenge. Why do they not leave Mali alone, and stop their  interference? They should let this poor country rebuild itself  and live. Why do they not leave Niger and Chad alone? All the  suffering of these countries is due to this policy.    They must understand that while we meet at this level we are  fully aware of their conspiracies. It is our right to fight and  we have decided to fight so that they respect us and recognize  that we are people like them, at least like them, even if we  believe that we are better than them because we do not commit  the acts they are committing. Therefore, our mentality is more  noble than theirs. We do not have the mentality of absurdity,  human disdain, race, and color segregation. They take pleasure  in the suffering of the African peoples and laugh at the  backwardness of the African that they imposed on them in the  first place.    They consider Africa as a jungle, a place for hunting, a  source for raw materials, and a garden where you can pick  fruits, but they consider its inhabitants as gorillas. Thus is  the Western culture that led to colonialism, and world wars, and  it is the one we are facing nowadays under various names.    In Libya, they confronted us in the Gulf of Sirte. When the  world condemned them and this problem was over, they invented a  problem called al-Rabitah. When it became clear that al-Rabitah  was a pharmaceutical plant, and the world condemned them and  showed solidarity with Libya, they created the so-called  Lockerbie issue.    In this context, the Libyan people hails your stance during  the OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit meeting. The  Libyan people hails its brothers and neighbors, as well as all  the African leaders who stood with the Libyan people.    The world condemned them in the Gulf of Sirte and al-Rabitah  cases, and is now condemning them in the Lockerbie case.  Despite all this, we hear astonishing things. They say that  Libya is defying the international community. Who is defying  the international community?    For them, the international community means the Western  colonialist countries. As for the others, they are not at the  level of the international community.    The conspiratorial memorandum handed by the United States,  France, and Britain to the United Nations was considered as the  will of the international community. They ignore the will of  Africa.    What do they have to say about the OAU summit meeting held  yesterday in Tunis that expressed support to Libya and the  proposals it made. Are the African countries considered out of  the international community?    The Nonaligned Movement expressed support for Libya, the ICO  [Islamic Conference Organization] expressed support for Libya.  The Arab League expressed support for Libya. The OAU adopted  the Arab League resolution, in addition to the peoples, groups,  parties, and organizations throughout the whole world. Despite  all this, should we listen to them tomorrow, we will hear the  same broken record: Libya is defying the will of the  international community. In fact, they are the ones who are  isolated. They are the ones who are isolated by the will of the  international community. This will is now on the Libyan side.  The international community is now expressing full support and  sympathy for Libya, and condemns the three Western countries.    Despite all this, we can still hear insolent statements full  of disdain to the international community. This is the stubborn  mentality that we are facing.    We recently heard that a Palestinian person admitted  responsibility for causing the explosion of the Pan Am aircraft.  He made this confession before a court. The day after, the  West denied this confession. The world was shocked. How could  this happen? Yesterday, we were looking for whoever was behind  the Pan Am explosion.    We say to the world: Do not be surprised, for the reason is  very simple. This Palestinian is poor. He does not have  millions to compensate the families of the victims. Therefore,  how could one charge him for this act? Libya, however, is rich.  It can pay damages. So, one must accuse it.    This is the reason the world has been laughing at this: How  can one admit [responsibility for this act] only to hear the  West tell him: No, no, it is not you.    As long as the issue is one of compensation, and so that  Libya rids the world of this problem and prevents respectable  presidents coming all the way from their countries to Libya on  foot [as heard], because of this unjust resolution....[pauses]    The world is tired of all the fuss made about Libya. The  embargo on Libya has ruined many countries and even the West has  lost out because it is stupid. In order to rid the world of  this problem, since the issue is about compensation, Libya does  not object to the creation of a compensation fund, for this  would be a humanitarian action. This fund would be used to  compensate the victims' families, including those of Lockerbie,  just for the sake of the world and in order to rid the world of  this tension. There are families of Libyan victims who were  killed by America and Britain. However, the Libyans are perhaps  rich and may not need any compensation. There are also Iranian  families whose relatives were killed by America when the U.S.  Navy shot down the civilian aircraft aboard which they were  flying. It could be that Iran is rich and would not want any  compensation.    There are also the victims of the Italian airliner shot down  by the U.S. fleet over Ustica. There are the Lockerbie victims  and maybe the Americans and the British are poor and would like  damages. We do not object to the creation of a compensation  fund; and let us erase the confessions of that Palestinian and  let us tell him: Keep quiet, we know that you carried out the  Pan Am operation but you have not got any money. This is a good  solution.    The Libyan people are once again, I believe, doubly happy.  Once because their efforts with the neighboring and sister  states would not have been wasted. Nationalist regimes were  established in Egypt [as heard], Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, and  Tunisia. Nationalist regimes and popular regimes dear to Libya  were established in these countries. These efforts were  considered as aimed at destabilizing Africa and were regarded as  terrorism, but the result was the triumph of the nationalist  regimes.    When we were working against the lackey regimes they told  us:  You were destabilizing Africa. Now we have united with  nationalist regimes they tell us: This is unity, you have  imperial ambitions. They have been stubbornly against us in both  cases. [passage omitted]    I have one remark to make before I conclude my speech, it is  about our sisterly Rwanda. I would like to draw your attention  to the fact that this is not the first catastrophe that has  shaken Rwanda. We still remember with sadness and bitterness  the tragic massacres of 1959 and 1973. Today we are witnessing  fresh massacres. I am afraid that such ugly massacres will be  repeated. We should, therefore, accept the bad in order to avoid  the worse.    We are aware that the Tutsi tribes immigrated to this region  hundreds of years ago. They might have come from Arab  countries. Problems began to emerge between the original people  and those coming from outside. Like between Palestinians and  Israelis and whites and blacks in South Africa. The situation  in Rwanda is, however, a particular one and should not be taken  as an example for other countries.    Regrettably, the solution I am about to propose is a bad  one,  but it is better than the worse. If we want to stop the  massacres and prevent their recurrence forever, we must separate  the two races, the Tutsi and the Hutu.    What is now called the National Front is in fact the  frontier  of the Tutsis, and the so-called government is for the Hutus.  International forces should now separate the two sides. The  separation should be final between them. In fact, this is the  only solution to prevent these tragedies from recurring.    Dear brothers, I thank you for this visit and this meeting  that provided us with an opportunity to talk about these  important issues, which we discussed today and yesterday.    I once more welcome you in your country and among your  kinsfolk. We are your natural ally, and you can rely on this  ally which will never disappoint you. The struggle continues.     "
0,FT923-14112 ,"FT923-14112 _AN-CGIA7AD4FT 920709   FT  09 JUL 92 / Health reforms target killer diseases      By ALAN PIKE and DAVID OWEN   THE government announced plans yesterday to set and monitor targets to reduce the toll of killer diseases and to improve overall health standards. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the white-paper proposals paper marked the 'next logical step in the process of health reform'. The health plans will target five areas: coronary heart disease and strokes; cancers; mental illness; sexual health; and accidents. A range of other targets has been adopted by the government within the main headings - there will be attempts to reduce the proportion of smokers in the population from a third to a fifth by the year 2000, with similar efforts to reduce alcohol consumption. Mrs Bottomley said: 'No responsible government can be a disinterested observer of an unhealthy nation.' She added that avoidable illness had an enormous cost in terms of working days lost and expensive treatment. Health standards in Britain are relatively poor in international terms. Some of the targets in the white paper are likely to be achieved provided existing trends continue but others - notably an attempt to halve pregnancies among girls under 16 by 2000 - will be difficult. The government was criticised by opposition parties and health promotion specialists for not including the links between ill health and poverty in the white paper's priorities, and for failing to announce support for a ban on tobacco advertising. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, said the white paper had got the right diagnosis but not the right prescription. He added: 'A white paper that does not propose a single measure to combat poverty, homelessness or unemployment is not a white paper that offers better health to all.' Mr Bryan Davies, Labour MP for Oldham Central  Royton, suggested the paper should have been called The Health of Two Nations. Mrs Bottomley shied away from making a direct connection between poverty and ill health, saying there was a link between health and 'a great number of social factors'. She offered breast cancer as an example of inverse correlation between incidence and poverty. Editorial comment, Page 20  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

In a report on Kenya*, Africa Watch accuses the government of instigating tribal clashes in which 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes since the advent of the multi-party system in 1991. 'There is clear evidence that the government was involved in provoking this ethnic violence for political purposes and has taken no adequate steps to prevent it from spiralling out of control,' the report says. 'The conflict has been deliberately manipulated and instigated by President Moi and his inner circle and has undermined attempts to create an atmosphere conducive to political pluralism in Kenya.' 'The culture of violence that is taking root has made real the alarming possibility of civil war in Kenya,' the report says. The majority of the victims of the ethnic clashes are peasant farmers of the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are distrusted by President Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority tribes. The report comes at an embarrassing time for Kenya, which is due to meet donors next week to discuss the restoration of financial aid. Although President Moi recently announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) programme to resettle displaced victims, co-sponsored by the UN Development Programme, Africa Watch urges Kenya's donors to continue withholding aid until the government takes effective steps to curb the violence. 'These steps should include, at a minimum, the full and public investigation of allegations of the involvement of government officials in the violence, and the bringing of charges where there is evidence of wrongdoing,' it says. *Divide and Rule: state-sponsored ethnic violence in Kenya, published by Africa Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10017-6104, tel: 1 212 972 8400.

In ""The Negro Family: The Case for National  Action,"" he described the legacy of three centuries of degradation, poverty and  injustice: slums filled with poor black Americans who knew only ""a cycle of no  jobs, bad education and bad housing.""    Back then, Moynihan recommended a national policy emphasizing education and  employment to stem the decline of the black family. But black leaders -- stung  by decades of criticisms that blamed the victim -- branded the assessment as  ""racist."" The controversy stalled the recommendations. The misery multiplied.    As the statistics worsen, enlightened self-interest and pragmatism must inspire  solutions. America cannot afford to write off a generation of poor young black  men. As the number of white males declines to 20% of the market, employers will  need young black men.    Government must also put forward initiatives. The Bush Administration this year  decided against proposing major new programs to reduce poverty because the  ambitious strategies were too controversial or too expensive. Given the gloomy  economic forecast, looming deficits and the threat of war, government alone  cannot meet the massive challenges. But inaction also has its price: An example  is the spiraling billions spent on prisons and the criminal justice system,  which are disproportionately filled with black men.    The Administration's Health and Human Services secretary, Dr. Louis W.  Sullivan, regards the crisis as a national public health problem and a criminal  justice problem. He advocates prevention programs such as Head Start, which was  expanded significantly this year, and a curriculum that teaches students to  resolve conflicts nonviolently.    Black organizations, most notably the Urban League, the Nation of Islam and the  NAACP have taken the lead with their advocacy of parenting classes, black male  teachers, school-based clinics, preventive medicine, tutoring, mentoring and  job-training programs.    The NAACP recently organized nearly 100 black organizations representing  various professionals and churchgoers to encourage greater self-help. The newly  formed National Assn.of Black Organizations represents more than 1 million.    Massive help must come from successful black Americans, who, like J. Clay  Smith, a law professor at Howard University, believe they must lift as they  climb. Smith tutors homeless children through a program set up by 100 Black  Men, a national organization that nurtures young black scholars, finances  scholarships, provides mentors and funds other services.    Finally, deep problems sometimes call for radical solutions. Dr. Franklyn  Jenifer, president of Howard University, calls for the establishment of urban  residential schools, similar to prep schools, within the black community, where  young African-Americans would be educated not only in the ways of the academic  world, but in the ways of community leaders.

In ""The Negro Family: The Case for National  Action,"" he described the legacy of three centuries of degradation, poverty and  injustice: slums filled with poor black Americans who knew only ""a cycle of no  jobs, bad education and bad housing.""    Back then, Moynihan recommended a national policy emphasizing education and  employment to stem the decline of the black family. But black leaders -- stung  by decades of criticisms that blamed the victim -- branded the assessment as  ""racist."" The controversy stalled the recommendations. The misery multiplied.    As the statistics worsen, enlightened self-interest and pragmatism must inspire  solutions. America cannot afford to write off a generation of poor young black  men. As the number of white males declines to 20% of the market, employers will  need young black men.    Government must also put forward initiatives. The Bush Administration this year  decided against proposing major new programs to reduce poverty because the  ambitious strategies were too controversial or too expensive. Given the gloomy  economic forecast, looming deficits and the threat of war, government alone  cannot meet the massive challenges. But inaction also has its price: An example  is the spiraling billions spent on prisons and the criminal justice system,  which are disproportionately filled with black men.    The Administration's Health and Human Services secretary, Dr. Louis W.  Sullivan, regards the crisis as a national public health problem and a criminal  justice problem. He advocates prevention programs such as Head Start, which was  expanded significantly this year, and a curriculum that teaches students to  resolve conflicts nonviolently.    Black organizations, most notably the Urban League, the Nation of Islam and the  NAACP have taken the lead with their advocacy of parenting classes, black male  teachers, school-based clinics, preventive medicine, tutoring, mentoring and  job-training programs.    The NAACP recently organized nearly 100 black organizations representing  various professionals and churchgoers to encourage greater self-help. The newly  formed National Assn.of Black Organizations represents more than 1 million.    Massive help must come from successful black Americans, who, like J. Clay  Smith, a law professor at Howard University, believe they must lift as they  climb. Smith tutors homeless children through a program set up by 100 Black  Men, a national organization that nurtures young black scholars, finances  scholarships, provides mentors and funds other services.    Finally, deep problems sometimes call for radical solutions. Dr. Franklyn  Jenifer, president of Howard University, calls for the establishment of urban  residential schools, similar to prep schools, within the black community, where  young African-Americans would be educated not only in the ways of the academic  world, but in the ways of community leaders.    It is in the interest of every thinking person in America to care and act on  the plight facing many of the nation's poor young black men. Walls and fences  and oceans and freeways can keep the problems of others only so far away. Their  vulnerabilities are those of this nation.      Editorial; Series    "
0,FT943-17084 ,"FT943-17084 _AN-EGAEGAA6FT 940701   FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan set for Dollars 1.3bn South Africa package - Aid and trade deal will pave way for reinvestment      By GERARD BAKER and GORDON CRAMB   When he takes his seat at the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations in Naples next week Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, will not come entirely empty-handed to the table. One particular offering that Japanese officials have been preparing for their premier to bring - an aid and trade package worth as much as Dollars 1.3bn for South Africa's new democratic government - may assume added significance as a signal of Japan's desire to be a good world citizen in spite of the country's internal political upheavals. This will focus on investment projects linked to the reconstruction and development programme set out by the all-race Pretoria government in sectors such as telecommunications, medical and educational facilities. It will pave the way for Japanese companies to reinvest in South Africa at a time when their funds will be welcomed as an indicator of confidence. Last week an official Japanese mission flew to Johannesburg to seek out aid targets. The Tokyo foreign ministry yesterday declined to confirm the figures, but if the package is on the lines of that planned by the previous government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, it could comprise some Dollars 300m in official development assistance, up to Dollars 500m in Eximbank loans and a further Dollars 500m in trade and investment insurance cover over the next two years. The Japanese corporate sector rapidly reined back when the ministry of international trade and industry had to confess at the height of the sanctions era in the late 1980s that Japan had suddenly emerged as white-run South Africa's leading trading partner - ahead of countries such as Germany which had previously headed the rankings. In the same way, private enterprise may now follow the Tokyo government's lead in rebuilding ties with the country under President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress-led government of national unity. Part of the new aid will anyway be tied to trade with Japanese companies. Japan is currently South Africa's fourth largest trading partner as the high value of the yen has continued to push Japanese multinationals towards production abroad, but there have so far been few signs that Japanese companies are ready to invest heavily in South Africa. Licensing agreements largely maintained a Japanese presence in South Africa through the sanctions era and in some cases for many years before. The question now is whether Japanese companies, which until now have been content to provide parts and brand names to local manufacturing units in which they have no equity stake, are willing to contemplate closer operational or shareholding links. No big rush looks likely. One prime example is Toyota South Africa, the country's biggest car maker, a family-controlled company quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in which Toyota of Japan has no direct holding. It obtained franchise rights to use the Toyota name as far back as 1961 and has imported components ever since - currently representing some 35 per cent by value of vehicles produced. In the same way, Mazda vehicles are produced by Samcor, controlled by Anglo-American, the country's leading conglomerate. The automotive sector is overcrowded and Mr Peter Arthur, a partner at Webber Wentzel, a Johannesburg law firm which has recently acted for several multinationals investing in the country, says that 'we are not seeing new motor manufacturers coming in'. Toyota of Japan said yesterday it had no plans to take a stake in Toyota South Africa which 'is and will remain a completely independent local company'. But in Johannesburg recently Mr Brand Pretorius, managing director of the local operation, said it was 'essential for our company to become part of the global Toyota network'. What a South African manufacturing base can offer, as never before, is a bridgehead into the African market as a whole, and to others beyond. As Japanese companies seek out lower-cost manufacturing sites to escape the high yen, they are also able further to refine their markets and target the developing world, where reliable brands carry a similar cachet but pricing needs to be keener and the product can be more basic. South Africa's high tariff regime will be eroded only gradually as a result of the phased accord the outgoing government struck with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Partly because of a lack of previous capital investment under sanctions, a lag in relative productivity also serves as a disincentive to inward investment. Japanese investments so far have centred on exploiting the country's mineral wealth. In May Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading houses, became the first Japanese company to invest in South Africa since Mr Mandela's election when it bought a modest 1 per cent stake in Associate Manganese Mines. Last year the rival Mitsubishi Corporation advanced a Dollars 28m loan to Western Platinum for mining development and Nippon Denko, an offshoot of Nippon Steel, linked with the local NST Ferrochrome to produce high-carbon alloys for the Japanese market. Beyond the mining sector, Marubeni Corporation established a joint telecoms venture with the British-linked Plessey Tellumat. But in all, just 30 Japanese companies have offices in South Africa compared with 130 US groups. And most show no immediate desire to expand. As a Sumitomo official in Tokyo puts it, 'South Africa is a very distant, very unfamiliar country, not just for us but for most Japanese companies. We remain very cautious about major commitments.'

The police were leashed. And for the first time in the history of South Africa  the head of state was doing what the majority told him.    Throughout the country, in cities and in small villages, other peaceful marches  followed. At one, the police gave flowers to demonstrators.    Perhaps De Klerk has suffered an overnight conversion. Perhaps he is trying to  wipe out election pictures of police whipping civilians, of a mother weeping  for her baby, shot at point-blank range. For months, the international  community has warned that ostracism and economic decline will persist unless  South Africa breaks the cycle of violence.    De Klerk has a better TV image now. In another first for the country, he met  face-to-face with church leaders who speak for the majority and won pictures of  himself with Tutu and the Revs. Allan Boesak and Frank Chikane.

There may be some substance behind the public relations. Members of the  Afrikaner Establishment are talking with the imprisoned Nelson Mandela and  other leaders of the African National Congress. What more can the world want?    What more can the churchmen want? De Klerk sounds plaintively surprised that  the churchmen expressed distrust. Hasn't he shown his good intentions?    They have said what they want. Justice and peace. No substitutes. Perhaps he  finds these demands extreme. Revolutionary. Perhaps he is taking the first  steps. He offered vague promises.    The churchmen are wary, and with good reason. The last few weeks have suggested  a new course in South Africa's history. They show that the minority government  cannot silence the majority and has had to restrain the key resource of  illegitimate rule, brute force. International opinion will not support more  visible repression. Internally, a police officer broke ranks on election night  to protest fellow police acting like wild dogs. Hundreds of men refused service  in the apartheid army. These events suggest historic turning points, such as  the opening of the Bastille, the Allied landing in Normandy.    After such turning points, events move quickly. De Klerk seems to hope they  will move slowly and that he will control the timetable. He may not be able to.    For years, the daily practice of apartheid has been eroding. Integration is  breaking out all over, in schools, universities, residential areas, work. White  and black have been fraternizing. And the intransigent ruling minority is  fragmenting.    Where will De Klerk turn? South Africa has a lavish tradition of government  treachery and duplicity, of smiling words and cruel actions. During the last  decade, while proclaiming that apartheid is dead and promising reform, the  government has used ever more guns, whips, prisons, nooses.    Speaking English, De Klerk promises, smiling at the cameras, that in five years  or so, there will be equal rights for each racial group, sort of. He can't  really promise equal rights for individuals. Speaking Afrikaans, he reassures  his internal constituency that there's nothing to be afraid of, really.    But Tutu and other South Africans understand Afrikaans. They know that many  anti-apartheid leaders remain in prison, gagged and exiled. Apartheid lives --  off camera.    Some will give De Klerk a few months to show what his promises mean. If he  balks at real change, there will be renewed violence. Apartheid cannot be  maintained with white gloves and smiles.    Even if he is sincere, the course ahead is fraught with danger.    South Africa has created people, black as well as white, with vested interests  in apartheid. For the bureaucracy, the ""independent"" homelands, the military  and the police, apartheid means security, jobs, status. Some will rally to save  the old order. They have implacable supporters who would rather die than yield.  Would rather kill than negotiate. They are armed, dangerous and undisciplined.  They will add to the hazards of the difficult transition that must be made.    Those demanding a new order may also prove dangerous. Apartheid has created  millions of embittered, impoverished and reckless people unwilling to wait and  suffer. It has kept them in ignorance, and they are impatient.    If peaceful protest has no effect, they may resort to other ways to take  rights, restitution or revenge. The reign of love and flowers may give way to a  reign of terror. This is what peaceful leaders in South Africa seek to avoid.    They need support in maintaining peace. They need the skills of respected  leaders now in prison.

The general public  calls unemployment the greatest problem facing the nation today  and is looking for a leader with solutions, according to PE.  Apoyo-owned PE speculated that unemployment ranks higher than  poverty because the solution to poverty is associated in the  public mind with social welfare programs. Peruvians today  ""prefer a job with which to resolve the economic problems rather  than a handout."" In addition to the primary focus on  unemployment, the composition of the presidential ticket will be  ""much more important"" than in the past. (In 1990 outsider  candidate Alberto Fujimori won the presidency on the strength of  his antipolitics stance and his commitment to restore civil  order by defeating the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement.) PERU ECONOMICO predicted that the  candidates will run short campaigns ""in order to avoid  overexposure.""    Stymied Jobs Creation    The labor reforms of recent years, which were intended to  improve competitiveness by reducing wage regulations and doing  away with collective bargaining have not led to any noticeable  increase in jobs. The reforms also caused a drastic downsizing  in the public sector: from 633,349 government employees in 1990  to 338,428 in 1993. Nor is the export sector expected to  generate any significant increase in jobs or wages in the  future, according to the April PERU ECONOMICO. The situation is  further exacerbated by the very large numbers of young people  entering the job market each year.    The labor unions have lost much of their clout and many of  their members as the reforms have encouraged individual  contracting, short-term employment, and modifications in wage  regulations with a system for compulsory saving.    The establishment of various mechanisms to reduce the cost  of  opening up new jobs, such as private pension funds and wage  reform, has not gone smoothly and the program to finance housing  (FOVI) has been suspended. Nor is there a timetable for starting  up private health organizations.       Two Markets    According to the same issue of PERU ECONOMICO, creating more  flexible employer/employee relations and other ""modernization""  attempts are only a partial solution to unemployment and lack of  competitiveness because the market has become divided into two  disparate segments: a formal market where the workers are  protected by labor laws and an informal market with no  protection. There are great differences in qualifications,  productivity, and wages in the two markets. In the informal  market there is not much chance of full-time employment or  upward mobility, nor is there any investment in human resources.    An expert consulted by PERU ECON0MICO is quoted as saying  that the government's strategy to modernize the labor market  will only affect the workers in ""the most modern sector."" They  would benefit from compulsory savings programs which will in  turn give them access to investment and credit. In the  traditional market, improvements could only occur through  increased foreign and domestic capital. The current reform does  not ensure that the unemployed or those in low-paying jobs will  benefit from economic growth. For that to happen there would  have to be a skills-training policy and incentives to invest in  human resources.    Employment Numbers    PERU ECONOMTCO estimates that in metropolitan Lima the  underemployed (earning $135 per month) constitute 53 percent,  and those adequately employed ($341 per month) constitute 38  percent of the economically active population. The Lima sectors  with the greatest unemployment were mining (16 percent) and  construction (13 percent). Sectors providing the most adequate  employment were ""nonpersonal services"" (15 percent) and commerce  (14 percent). Age did not appear to be a factor.    Poverty Rising    The monthly PERUPAZ in its April issue decries the Fujimori  government's failure to address the serious problem of poverty  and says that in spite of the economic successes the government  claims, its economic policy impedes any improvement in the  quality of life for most Peruvians. There is a disconnect, the  monthly contends, between Fujimori's economic policy and the  country's social needs. In 1992 the GNP dropped by 5 percent  from the preceding year to its lowest level in 15 years.    Studies by the Institute for Statistics and Data [INEI] show  ""critical poverty"" to have reached 53 percent of the population  by 1991, while ""extreme poverty"" rose to 21 percent.    Urban Poverty    PERUPAZ says that ""contrary to earlier decades,"" poverty now  exists also in the urban areas, and in particular in Lima, where  a full one-third of those in critical poverty live.    Thirty-three percent of the economically active population  of  Peru live in Lima. In 1989-1990 salaries and wages shrank by 13  and 16.8 percent respectively. The downhill trend continued for  the period 1990-1992: The number of underemployed went from 86.4  to 88.1 percent of the population and the number of unemployed  from 8.3 to 10 percent.    Nationally, underemployment decreased slightly--from 79 to  76  percent in 1991-1992, while unemployment went from 5.9 to 9.9  percent.    Rural Poverty    The majority of the poor live in the rural and mountain  areas  of the country where income is extremely low and there is rarely  any access to basic health services, education, adequate  nutrition, and sanitation.    The INEI study of 1991 showed that in the rural areas of the  Sierra only 43 percent of the homes had drinking water (inside  or outside), and only 14 percent had sewage. Thirty-one percent  of the homes had electricity.    Diseases    Diseases previously considered under control have reemerged:  malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, facial ulcers. Mortality rates  for children under the age of five did decline from 97 per  thousand in 1978 to 76 per thousand in 1991 according to INEI,  but Peru continues to have one of the highest infant mortality  rates in South America.    Governability Questioned    PERUPAZ concludes that the government has failed to address  the problems of the poor, ""who have become the majority."" The  periodical calls for a vigorous social policy and an economic  policy congruent with the social necessities, saying that a key  factor will be stimulating agricultural production. PERUPAZ  warns that if the social issue is not addressed, it is ""not  optimistic about the outlook for governable conditions in Peru.""    Steady Trend    Opinion polls over the past several months done by Apoyo,  Imasen, etc., have consistently shown former UN Secretary  General Javier Perez de Cuellar leading President Alberto  Fujimori in a two-way race, with the former enjoying greater  support in the country's interior. The polls also consistently  show that Fujimori would have a clear lead over the other  frequently mentioned potential candidates, Lima Mayor Ricardo  Belmont, former President Fernando Belaunde Terry, and former  Arequipa Mayor Luis Caceres (to date, only Belmont has declared  his candidacy).    Vice Presidential Factor    In its April issue PERU ECONOMICO says the vice presidential  candidates will be a significant factor: National Police  Inspector General Antonio Ketin Vidal ""could bring a lot of  votes."" (Vidal is credited with the October 1992 capture of SL  founder and leader Abimael Guzman.) PE does not rule out a  surprise candidate, much like Fujimori in 1990, and notes that  there are other potential candidates, waiting for a ""propitious  opportunity,"" prominent among them former Prime Minister Juan  Carlos Hurtado Miller.    Fujimori Versus de Cuellar    PERU ECONOMICO concurs with the widely held view that Perez  de Cuellar's strength is his international stature and his  weakness is his decades-long absence from Peru. PE quotes an  unnamed ""leading"" politician with ""many victories"" as saying  ""this product [de Cuellar] is not particularly marketable in the  sierra.""    Fujimori's strength, successfully controlling subversion and  inflation, puts him in a ""paradoxical situation"" in that the  public sees him as a successful president, but not as a good  candidate. The country today has a sense of order; two years ago  ""no one would have predicted that Shining Path would today be in  the process of disappearing,"" PE asserts.    Fujimori projects an authoritarian image and is perceived as  lacking any vision ""beyond establishing order,"" according to PE,  which adds that the ""general requirement"" for more peaceful  times will be a leader who carries on a dialogue and is a  consensus builder. According to a poll published in the  Apoyo-owned weekly 24 April SEMANA ECONOMICA, 64 percent of the  interviewees believe the next president should be a consensus  builder and only 29 percent want an authoritarian president. The  number of respondents in the poll, conducted in Lima and ""eight  other cities"" was not given.    April Apoyo Polls    The April Apoyo polls published in PERU ECONOMICO showed  that  a majority thought Fujimori's ""self-coup"" of April 1992 had led  to an improvement in the areas of terrorism, inflation,  corruption, and narcotics trafficking. A majority believed that  the nation's main problems are unemployment, poverty, nutrition,  education, and cost of living. The poll was conducted in Lima  and eight provincial capitals across socioeconomic groups. The  number of respondents was not given.    Intelligence Service Poll    According to the weekly Sl [2-8 May] citing unnamed  ""sources,"" President Fujimori ordered the National Intelligence  Service [SIN] to conduct a poll to check whether the  private-sector opinion pollsters' figures on the president's  reelectability were correct.    The findings of the SIN: Fujimori enjoyed a 72-percent  popularity rate (""6-8 percent more"" than in the other polls); in  a two-way race, Fujimori would get 55 percent over de Cuellar's  35 percent; in a two-way race against Belmont, Fujimori would  get 52 percent to Belmont's 38. If the two vice presidential  candidates were Congressional President Jaime Yoshiyama and  Congressional Vice President Victor Joy Way (both of Asian  descent) only 3 percent would vote for the three-person ticket  while 90 percent would not, reputedly saying ""that's a lot of  Chinamen."" Asked if there should be a woman on the ticket, 77  percent said yes, 10 percent no. The majority wanted to see the  female candidate in the slot of second vice president.    SI reports that Fujimori is now looking at former Prime  Minister Hurtado Miller and National Police Inspector General  Ketin Vidal as vice presidential mates, but is also considering  Congresswomen Martha Chavez and Luz Salgado, both of New  Majority-Change `90.    According to the sources, 25 SIN officers were sent out to  ""all parts of Lima"" to interview 1,200 people, ranging in age  from 22 to 50.     "

In the first speech by a secretary of state exclusively devoted to Africa policy since the end of the cold war, Mr Warren Christopher said the US-led effort, in which it expected co-operation from others in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, would begin once a transitional executive council has been put in place and a firm date for elections set. Before that, Mr Christopher went on: 'We have urged the World Bank and the parties in South Africa to begin planning now the projects that will lead to economic growth.' He hoped US businesses would be in the vanguard of investment in South Africa. He had special praise for both Mr Nelson Mandela and President F W de Klerk for the 'monumental achievement' of making free and fair elections possible. 'That election will echo around the African continent and across the world as a roaring triumph of human rights,' he said. Mr Christopher placed his commitment to assist the South African economy firmly in the context of the promotion of democracy throughout the continent. 'That is why President Clinton chose to invite the first president of a democratic Namibia, Sam Nujoma, as the first African head of state to be recognised at his White House.' Elsewhere in his speech, he bluntly referred to President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as an example of 'corrupt dictators' but he singled out no other African autocrat, preferring instead to praise unnamed 'courageous democrats' from Senegal to Benin and Madagascar to Mali, and to warn that 'the US will take human rights into account as we determine how to allocate our scarce resources for foreign assistance'. The Christopher speech, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Africa-America Institute, was to have been the stage for announcing US recognition of the former Marxist government of Angola. That, however, was pre-empted by Mr Clinton earlier last week.  ANC leader Nelson Mandela ended a two-day visit to Natal province yesterday, urging an end to conflict between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, Reuter reports. At least 8,000 people have been killed in clashes between the groups in Natal since 1986. Mr Mandela's plea came a day after at least 13 people were killed in clashes between ANC supporters, Inkatha hostel dwellers and police in Thokoza township, east of Johannesburg. The ANC and Inkatha both demanded a judicial inquest into the killings. Mr Mandela also said the date for the first all-race elections would be announced before the end of this month. The 26 parties to multi-party talks have already agreed the poll will take place no later than April next year and have been debating a precise date. ANC activists devised a plan to rescue Mr Mandela from Robben Island prison in 1981 in a basket dangling from a helicopter, but the attempt was called off by ANC leaders in exile because it was too risky, Reuter reports. Mr Mandela was freed in February 1990 after 27 years' detention.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     USZ  United States of America.

0,FT921-4091 ,"FT921-4091 _AN-CCKB6AEEFT 920311   FT  11 MAR 92 / South African business swings behind a 'yes' vote      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICANS are wild about cricket, and ecstatic about their team's recent triumphs in the World Cup. But instead of hailing victory, yesterday's South African newspapers carried an advert picturing an overgrown cricket field with broken wickets and a torn ball. The message: a 'no' vote in next week's referendum will mean that South Africa will again be shut out of international sport. 'Without reform, South Africa hasn't got a sporting chance.' The full-page advert was funded, not by the ruling National party, but by South African business which is spending R3.4m (Pounds 680,000) to campaign for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on political reform next Tuesday. Some two thirds of the 'yes' camp's total advertising budget is coming from businessmen who fear that their chance of returning to world markets will be sabotaged, yet again, by politics. The political liberalisation of the past two years has already made a huge difference to the lives of most white businessmen. They have been welcomed abroad, where before they were shunned; they have glimpsed a light at the end of the 40-year tunnel of apartheid isolation. Now they are terrified that a vote in favour of reintroducing apartheid will provoke unprecedented international retribution. 'A 'no' vote would be a guarantee for disaster,' says Mr P F Retief, chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, one of the largest mining houses. He has written to white employees to urge a 'yes' vote. 'If we cannot sell our production because of re-imposed sanctions, both your job and my job will be threatened. If money flees the country, interest rates will be raised even higher and the recession will deepen. Unemployment will rise further with all its consequences ..like the crime and violence we are already experiencing and this will certainly worsen,' he argues in his letter. Mr Peter Mackenzie, director of the Private Sector Referendum Fund, insists the campaign is 'non party-political'. It was launched by one of the country's largest media groups, Times Media, and has had contributions from across the white bus-iness spectrum, not to mention offers of help from black business as well. Residual suspicion of white South Africa has hampered the fund's international campaign - the Toronto Globe and Mail refused to print an advert urging expatriate South Africans in Canada to vote 'yes'. The fund also bought billboards at the World Cup cricket grounds - matches are widely televised in South Africa - and distributed pro-reform T-shirts to fans. But the billboards were withdrawn when a rival group tried to purchase advertising for the 'no' camp. Mr Mackenzie says the campaign's adverts are about to become 'more dramatic and blunt'. The toughest advert so far had an ironic twist to it, though: it showed an operating table littered with used gauze and broken needles, and the message 'without reform, South Africa won't get better'. For many whites, those are the images associated with health care in independent African countries. Many believe they can avoid such a fate by reaffirming apartheid - not by voting 'yes' for reform.

Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank president, is to visit South Africa next week, his first trip to Africa since he took up the job last September. For months, World Bank officials have pursued informal contacts with the various political parties and groups in South Africa. Several teams have been to research an economy which has been virtually unknown to the Bank since lending was suspended for political reasons in 1967. Now, relations seem set to assume a higher profile. Immediate access to Bank funding is not in prospect, however. The Bank is expected to resume lending only when a multi-party interim government is in place. Even then, there will be room for disputes within the Bank's board over what constitutes an interim government. Would a multi-racial executive with only limited powers (one option) qualify for renewed access, or will the board demand more fundamental change? In practice, it seems likely that the board will follow the advice of the African National Congress on the issue. Once formal relations are restored, debate will begin in earnest over whether South Africa should qualify for heavily subsidised loans from the International Development Association (the Bank's soft loan agency which lends to the world's poorest countries), or only for the mildly concessional loans available to middle-income countries. Income per capita in South Africa, at Dollars 2,520 a year in 1990, far exceeds the limit of Dollars 740 normally imposed on IDA recipients. However the grossly unequal distribution of income between whites and blacks might mean that South Africa could be treated as a special case for soft loans. But with the IDA's funding already under serious pressure from claimants worldwide, officials in Pretoria seem resigned to doing without heavily subsidised finance. The size of any World Bank programme for South Africa would thus be determined by demand from Pretoria: how much would a new government wish to borrow, given that the terms are only mildly concessional? South Africa could benefit indirectly from IDA finance by participating in regional projects aimed at low income countries such as neighbouring Mozambique. South Africa's electricity utility, Eskom, is keen to develop a regional electricity grid and various energy projects involving South African companies are under discussion. But the recipient government in such cases would be Mozambique, not South Africa. Government officials say no project plans have yet been drawn up for South Africa itself, nor have amounts been discussed. But World Bank lending is likely to focus on education and urban development, the two areas already researched by Bank officials. With 7m people living in informal settlements countrywide - including millions in squatter shacks - urban development will be a high priority for the new government. Education, too, is in crisis, with black schools desperately overcrowded, facilities poor and teachers poorly qualified. Already, the Bank is ready to provide informal technical assistance to black South Africans, with plans afoot to train those who might be officials of a future government through the Bank's Economic Development Institute. The ANC, for its part, remains deeply suspicious of international financial institutions such as the Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with some officials adopting the rhetoric of the 1960s to condemn them as neo-imperialist organisations. But ANC officials have met previous World Bank teams, and two of the movement's senior leaders are to see Mr Preston during his visit. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), another World Bank finance affiliate, is likely to be active in the South African private sector. Once lending resumes, the IFC is expected to focus its efforts on helping non-white entrepreneurs, selling management consultancy services and setting up an 'enterprise fund' aimed at small businesses, as it has done elsewhere in Africa. Eventually, the IFC could become involved in project finance in areas such as mining and chemicals.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

'African economies have been typified by low skill levels, inferior infrastructure, wasteful public expenditure and ineffective institutions,' the report says. As a result, the ODA has moved the balance of British aid to Africa towards supporting economic reform programmes 'designed to improve the policy and institutional environment,' the report says. In an separate assessment of more than 200 completed projects from 1966 to 1989, the ODA also reveals that 45 per cent of the projects were either failures, or only partially successful. Evaluation reports 'highlighted the difficulty of succeeding at the project level if the policies of the developing country at sector and national level are unsatisfactory.' The ODA identifies a stark contrast with Asia, where significant problems are confronted in just 10 per cent of projects. When the value rather than the number of the problematical projects is measured, the problem is even worse. In Africa, which accounted for projects worth Pounds 324m assessed in 1989-90 and 1990-91, overruns and other 'major' problems affected projects worth about Pounds 140m - or about 42 per cent. In contrast, Asia attracted funding worth Pounds 100m, but ran into complications in just 10 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT942-12077 ,"FT942-12077 _AN-EECCXAA7FT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Next chapter unclear after fairy-tale start      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   South Africa has emerged triumphant from the most perilous stage of a revolution without precedent, and its citizens seem bemused by their achievement. After more than three hundred years of supremacy, the white minority last week finally, irrevocably and peacefully surrendered power at the ballot box to the country's black majority. The full details of this astonishing - some say miraculous - event are not yet known, for the election commission is still grappling with mountains of ballot papers. And one major obstacle which could jeopardise the prospects of a stable South Africa may yet emerge: the outcome of voting in KwaZulu/Natal, stronghold of the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Nor, at this stage, is it clear what may be the next step of the white right, whose extremists could yet destabilise South Africa with an assassin's bullet. But, as an exuberant president in the waiting, Mr Nelson Mandela celebrated the ANC's achievement at last night's victory party, taking satisfaction in a fairy-tale start to the new South Africa. And, as he pressed ahead with the critical process of reconciliation, South Africa's remarkable political metamorphosis continued. In the television studios and televised press conferences, on radio and on newspaper front-pages, one leader began assuming the mantle of power, and the other, incumbent President FW de Klerk, began shedding it. Before its eyes, South Africa watched a process unfold which has neither precedent nor parallel in Africa, and perhaps the world. Mr Mandela, never less than a monumental personality, seemed to gain further stature as the results trickled in; almost perceptibly, the aura that comes with office seemed to desert Mr de Klerk. Nothing so became the two men, and the country in their charge, than this transfer of power, which is due to to be made formal at next week's inauguration in Pretoria. 'For the first time I envy South Africans, for the first time I wish I could call myself South African,' said one hard-bitten observer of many years standing last week. He had been moved almost to tears as he watched black and white embrace at a moving ceremony that took place at midnight on Tuesday. Seldom, if ever, can the advent of democracy have been the instrument of catharthis so profound, so liberating, for rulers and ruled alike, as South Africa's unforgettable and moving experience last week. Millions suffered under apartheid. But apartheid's victims extended beyond its borders. Hundreds of thousands died in Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the front-line states in the proxy battles to defend white rule. But last week, for a precious few days, the pain of the past seems to have been eased, even thrust briefly out of mind. A truce, undeclared and unspoken, in the political fighting that has cost more than 14,000 lives over the past 10 years was broken but not spoilt by the bombs of the extreme right. In the 24 hours that ended yesterday morning, police reported that there had not been a single death from political violence. Joyous as the election was for blacks, it also became liberating for whites. As they cast their votes, many spoke of having the sense of casting off the burden of apartheid, whether or not they had supported the policy. Many were taken aback by the simple - though unprecedented  - experience of going to the polling booths, black, coloured and white, as equals, to chose a government that for the first time will reflect the will of the majority. The orange, white and blue flag of the old South Africa was lowered at centres across the land, and the new one raised while choirs sang the region's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of the official anthems of post-apartheid South Africa: Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika (God bless Africa). For black South Africans in particular it was a proud moment, but for many Afrikaners it must have been a poignant, painful one. As that flag entered the history books, the other official anthem carried across the night air, sung in Afrikaans, and no doubt giving comfort to those fearful of what the future holds: Die Stem von Suid-Afrika (At thy call we shall not falter, firm and steadfast we shall stand. At thy will to live or perish, O South Africa, dear land). Over the past week at least, most white South Africans overcame their apprehensions. And whatever may happen in the future, for a few days, South Africa has basked in the glow of pride asserted, and pride recovered.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The continuing bad policies of the  Surinamese Government are the cause of the country's deplorable  state, the minister said on Sunday [6 March] on the ""Meer op  Zondag"" NOS [Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation] television  program.    The time has come to review the entire development  relationship with Suriname, Pronk said. Aid should be directed  to a far greater degree toward combating poverty via private  organizations, he said.    Direct support to the Surinamese Government has proved  ineffective, Pronk said in a frank examination of Surinamese  politics. He said he was aware that there were still  innumerable politicians and civil servants with good will in the  country, ""but they simply cannot get through.""    The development relationship which Pronk wants would bypass  the Surinamese Government for a large part of the aid, the  minister said. However, the current development treaty between  the Netherlands and Suriname does not allow that. The minister  wants to spend part of the money to which Suriname is entitled  under the development treaty via nongovernmental organizations  (NGO's, like the Novib [Netherlands Organization for  International Development Cooperation] and its foreign partners).    ""Private organizations do not carry out the most work,""  Pronk  said. ""But they do the best work when it comes to combating  poverty, providing health care, organizing activities for women,  etc.""    ""When we drew up the development treaty we said: You have  many good groups who could do this work,"" Pronk said. ""But it  was pulled into the political field. The organization's  political and ethnic background was examined, and that means  sometimes waiting for years. That is not necessary, because in  Suriname there is a structure which is separate from politics.""    Very recently the minister was far more positive about the  resumption of aid to the Surinamese Government. Last November  Pronk visited Paramaribo to discuss the matter with the  Venetiaan government. The talks took place ""in such an open and  constructive atmosphere that I am optimistic about the  possibility of finding a solution in the foreseeable future,"" he  told Parliament three months ago.    Pronk made it clear on Sunday that he no longer feels such  optimism. ""Suriname had a fantastic opportunity, but has made  little of it,"" he said. ""There has been a democratic regime for  a substantial number of years now, there is a lot of support,  but there are bad policies.""    Suriname could receive more emergency aid if the government  carried out reform policies, Pronk repeated. ""People know that,  but nothing ever comes of it,"" he said. ""Every time there is a  new reason to not begin proper policies.""    The minister now regards the poverty problem in Suriname  partly as a problem of distribution in Suriname itself.  ""Enormous wealth has grown up in parts of the population due to  corruption and drug dealing,"" he said. ""People do not want to  abandon such self-interest.""     "
0,FT923-289 ,"FT923-289 _AN-CI2B1ADDFT 920929   FT  29 SEP 92 / Anxiety mounts as poverty traps more victims: Fears over possible cuts to the social security budget      By ALAN PIKE   ANTI-POVERTY campaigners are facing the coming tight public spending round with at least as much anxiety as ministers. In the most difficult public spending climate for years, there are mounting fears that the Pounds 70bn social security budget - by far the biggest single area of government expenditure - will not escape cost-containment scrutiny. Anti-poverty groups are rallying to the cause of Britain's low-income families with a spate of reports designed to demonstrate that the poor deserve greater support. The Low Pay Unit said yesterday that the pay gap is wider now that at any time since official figures were first collected in 1886. In another report published today the Child Poverty Action Group argues that some unemployed families have suffered cuts of more than 40 per cent in the real value of unemployment benefit since 1979. The latest official figures on poverty were published by the government just before parliament rose for the summer recess. They give ammunition to those who contend that the relative position of the poor declined during the 1980s. Even so, suggests Professor Peter Townsend of Bristol University, one of Britain's foremost academic specialists on poverty, the true position may be worse. 'The government's procedures for gathering the figures are highly technical and bizarre, and I have a fair amount of suspicion that they try to choose data which put the poor in the best possible light.' Poverty statistics are rarely open to value-free interpretation. There is as much argument over definitions of poverty as there was this summer over whether it causes urban disturbances such as those on the Hartcliffe Estate in Bristol. The government's figures for 'households below average income' show beyond reasonable doubt, however, that some of Britain's poorest people became ever poorer in the 1980s. Incomes of the poorest 10 per cent of the population after housing costs were 6 per cent lower in 1988-89 than in 1979, while their share of total income declined and the proportion of people living on less than half average income rose from 9 per cent to 22 per cent after housing costs. One of the government's intentions in its reform of social security in the late 1980s was to target support on groups, such as families with children, whom ministers believe are in most need. Figures published in a written answer a few days before parliament rose show the effect this policy is having on groups considered to have a lower priority. The annual income support entitlement for a single unemployed adult declined, at 1989 prices, from Pounds 1,725 in 1986-87 to Pounds 1,394 in 1989-90 - lower than in 1979-80, when it was Pounds 1,542. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has emphasised that the statistics for households below average income show a growth in ownership of consumer durables among the poorest section of the population. Prof Townsend dismisses this point as 'really rather absurd', saying changes in material circumstances have occured throughout history and that definitions of poverty must take this into account. The issues which concern Prof Townsend and his colleagues at Bristol university are debated with equal intensity at the Single Parent Action Network in Eastville, a voluntary project in an inner-city district a few miles away. Poverty is not only a political or an academic issue here, it is a practical one. Maria, a single parent, brings up two daughters aged one and eight on social security support of between Pounds 60 and Pounds 70 per week plus housing benefit. She says she would prefer to work but that the high cost of childcare makes this economically impossible. Ms Sue Cohen, the project co-ordinator, says examples of single parents going without proper nourishment to feed their children are not unusual. Prof Townsend believes a mechanism to tackle 'extreme inequalities in the wage structure' would have to form part of a successful attack on poverty. He says: 'Politicians on all sides shrink from this, but the fact is that pay developments have got out of social control. Extremes of inequality in the wage structure have social outcomes which have enormous costs to the quality of our lives. It is all very well trying to justify low pay and unemployment as the necessary ingredients for competition, but I believe we are losing some of the possibilities of being competitive by allowing inequalities in the wage structure to become so extreme.' Women at the Single Parent Action Network say an attack on poverty would require strong, positive government policies to support the family - recognising that families often contain only one parent. They regard the government's plans to pursue absent fathers who fail to support their families as a blind-alley approach which will increase pressures on some mothers. 'Many women who come to the network display tremendous potential. But they have little chance of realising it without adequate childcare and training provision aimed at the particular needs of single parents,' says Ms Cohen. 'People very quickly get drawn into the culture of poverty. And the really alarming thing is how quickly their children get drawn into it as well.'  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Their wait to enter the polling booths was lightened by cheers and chanting as anti-apartheid luminaries arrived, and by a dose of spring sunshine which would not have been felt amiss in the Cape. The line, one of dozens in cities around the world yesterday, comprised visitors to London and expatriates. The all-race poll was the final step in eradicating that bleak and previously numerous third category: no one needed any longer to call themselves exiles. Although the embassy was only one of seven polling stations in the UK, nearly 8,000 voters were thought to have passed through its doors alone. One of their number was Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who pronounced the election 'a miracle - I truly believe it has been miraculous.' Afterwards, in an embassy library with walls bearing the coats of arms of colonists Dutch and British, and shelves of bound records of the white parliament since union in 1910, the 80-year-old archbishop said he would 'never ever forgive the evil of apartheid'. While branding as 'traitors' those whites who opposed change, he said a new administration, led by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, for which he had voted, 'must be a government of all South Africans.' The first South African to cast a vote yesterday, in Wellington, New Zealand, was Ms Nomaza Paintin, a niece of Mr Mandela. South Africans form one of the largest immigrant groups in New Zealand. There was an upsurge of last-minute interest among the South African community in Australia, which at some 60,000 ranks alongside that of the UK. Local newspapers there and in other countries had run advertisements on behalf of the Independent Electoral Commission publicising the poll. The 700 or so South Africans in Hong Kong turned out in such force that the consulate ran out of ballot papers. Among those who managed to vote was Ms Elizabeth Dikgale, a domestic helper who is the only Zulu resident in the colony. 'South Africa is a golden country, and now we can get back to golden times,' she said. The 20,000 or so Jewish South Africans who have emigrated to Israel find themselves caught between two peace processes, each of which has taken a heavy toll in violence. But as one in the long queue to vote at Tel Aviv Show Grounds put it: 'If the whites and blacks in South Africa can get it together, we should be able to do it here too.' Pockets of South Africans elsewhere in Africa were also able to vote, even though full diplomatic relations with much of the continent do not yet exist. The polling station for Kenya was a sports club in the outskirts of Nairobi where Mrs Nomtha Nkolombe, a 62-year-old physiotherapist who left Cape Town 30 years ago, said: 'It is an opportunity both my parents missed.' In New York, two polling stations were set up in tents on a lawn outside the United Nations building. One white voter maintained: 'Every South African I know will be voting today. This is one hell of a vote.' That much is indisputable. It was taking two to three hours in the Trafalgar Square queue yesterday to get to vote. Some, however, had been waiting all their lives.

Others see Africa as a special case to which the principles of economics do not apply. I reject such views. It is our approach that has failed. Africa has not . . . We need to bear in mind that Afro-pessimism is widespread in the world outside. We face a challenge. We must overcome the pessimists. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, December 1992 FOR THOSE who seek culprits to blame for Africa's deepening economic crisis, there are many candidates: the lingering legacy of the colonial era, the harsh dictates of World Bank structural adjustment programmes, the miserly aid and restrictive trade policies of developed country governments and the kleptocratic tendencies of Africa's own governing elite. So-called 'Afro-pessimists' and their gloomy appraisals make an easier target for those who are reluctant to confront the true dimensions of Africa's crisis. Yet the facts tell their own story. After a dozen years of structural adjustment and more than Dollars 170bn in net development assistance, the sub-Saharan economy is still falling behind. Incomes per head fell by an average 1.1 per cent a year between 1982 and 1992 compared to an average rise of 0.8 per cent a year in all developing countries and 6.4 per cent in the east Asia developing countries. The outlook is far from encouraging, as the accompanying articles demonstrate throughout this survey. Institutional and infrastructural decline is accelerating, the number of countries facing political disintegration is growing and the Aids crisis is deepening. The aid keeps flowing, although sub-Saharan Africa cannot be sure that its share of global aid - up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970 - will continue to rise. But Africa is increasingly cut off from the rest of the world economy - there is little evidence to suggest that either returning flight capital or foreign investment can fill the gap between Africa's capital needs and its ability to generate domestic savings. The combination of half-hearted policy reform, some debt relief, and substantial aid is expected to continue to slow the pace, rather than reverse the direction, of this relative and absolute decline. The World Bank expects African real incomes per head to rise by 0.6 per cent a year over the next decade compared to 2.9 per cent for all developing countries and 5.9 per cent in east Asia. Still, as the World Bank rightly says, the gloom can be overdone. Across the continent, human development indicators have improved over the past two decades. Infant mortality has fallen from 137 per 1,000 live births in 1973 to 107 in 1991, while life expectancy has risen from 45 years to 51 years over the same period. Progress on these social measures of quality of life was made in the 1980s despite adverse shifts in Africa's terms of trade, volatile commodity prices, persisting protectionism in OECD countries, and the doubling over 10 years in the the share of Africa's export earnings which go to service debts. Moreover, the World Bank can correctly claim that the nature of the obstacles to economic progress in Africa is now better understood. Ten years ago, African governments defended to the death fixed exchange rates, administered prices, state ownership of industry, subsidies to parastatals, cheap food for urban workers and negative real interest rates while the private sector was regarded with suspicion. Now most governments accept, at least in principle, that establishing macro-economic stability through structural adjustment policies - cutting budget deficits, slowing inflation and monetary growth, establishing a competitive exchange rate and eliminating obstacles to exports - is necessary if their economies are to achieve self-sustaining economic growth. The World Bank can point to signs of success in the handful of countries which has taken the structural adjustment advice to heart - most notably Ghana but also Uganda, Burkina Faso and until recently, Malawi - as evidence that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for progress. Since Ghana's adjustment programme began, its gross domestic product has grown by an average of 4.9 per cent a year, over twice the sub-Saharan average of 2.1 per cent. Equally powerfully, the Bank can point to the deepening recessions in the member countries of the French African Community (CFA) zone to demonstrate that governments cannot pick and mix items from the adjustment agenda. Between 1986 and 1991, cumulative losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average of 0.2 per cent a year. GDP in the other 16 African countries which the Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an average 4.5 per cent a year over the same period, compared to a fall of 0.2 per cent annually in the first half of the decade. WHY DO the economies of sub-Saharan Africa continue to perform so poorly? There are two broad explanations. First, most African governments have not been willing to pay more than lip-service to the need for structural adjustment. Second, the experience of those countries which have tried to keep to the spirit, as well as the letter, of World Bank programmes suggests that structural adjustment is far from sufficient to deliver sustainable economic growth. In country after country the political commitment to economic reform has not been maintained. Of 26 adjusting countries, in 1990-91 only one  - Ghana - was judged by the World Bank research department to have an adequate macro-economic policy stance. In another 14 the stance was found to be fair, while in the remaining 11 it was rated either poor or very poor. One reason that adjustment is hard to sustain is that it takes many years to deliver results, much longer than the World Bank and the IMF were originally prepared to admit. But the deeper problem is that economic reform invariably runs counter to the interests of the urban elites who dominate government in Africa. Many African rulers are politically dependent on the patronage and corruption which regulations and secrecy conceal and which reforms are designed to root out. Kenya and Nigeria are prime examples of countries whose governments, in spite of the glaring need for adjustment, have never been able to maintain the reform momentum for long - too many powerful Nigerians benefit from the rewards that a distorted foreign exchange market deliver to those with a banking licence. Ghana, by contrast, has sustained adjustment, in part because its military government consistently aligned its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite which probably stands to lose more from adjustment in the early stages. The rural vote secured the election of Flight Lt Jerry Rawlings as president last December. The donors have, rightly, come under fire for their willingness to conceal what they know of the activities of African governments. For all its talk of 'good governance', the World Bank has never been willing to require that its client governments observe minimum levels of transparency, accountability and access to information, or apply these tests to its own dealings with African governments. The Bank often finds itself standing between unsuccessful governments and their electorates and withholding vital information on the state of the economy, and presenting overly optimistic progress reports that do no service to the reform cause. In Nigeria, the World Bank remains willing to conceal the extent to which the government siphons off an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day for its own off-budget purposes. In Zimbabwe, Bank officials recently submitted wildly optimistic export and growth numbers to their executive board to support a loan application. But the shortcomings of African governments, and the unwillingness of Bank officials to disclose unpalatable facts, are only part of the story. The absence of political instability and corruption, and the adoption of the full adjustment agenda is not, it seems, enough to deliver a significant growth take-off. In a handful of cases, there has been an impressive supply-side response. The Mauritian miracle is the most convincing, but the response of farmers and textile manufacturers in Nigeria, of clothing exporters in Zimbabwe and tourist operators in Kenya and Tanzania, all reflect only partial success. One reason is that the non-farm private sector is too small to exploit the new opportunities. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990 compared to 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in rapidly growing Thailand. Across Africa, the private sector is dominated by a handful of multinationals and hundreds of small-scale enterprises. Those medium-sized companies which do exist are primarily service-orientated and often dependent on the regulations and tariff walls that adjustment policies dismantle. Meanwhile, global companies have been slow to return. The post-1970 deterioration in commodity prices, the increasing need for skilled rather than merely plentiful and cheap labour, and the increased emphasis on short lead times and quality over cost, all make it harder for Africa to sell itself as a location for foreign direct investment. Even successful adjusters have not shed the reputation of being high-risk, low-return locations. Africa does not have the social and physical infrastructure requirements that multinationals increasingly demand. Standards of literacy lag behind those of the east Asian developing economies, while the public infrastructure, education and health systems have deteriorated across the continent. Even when governments are getting macroeconomic policies right, implementation on the ground - in the central bank, at the tax office, at the customs desk - is proving much more difficult. The reason acknowledged in a recent speech by the Bank's vice-president for Africa, Mr Kim Jaycox, is the region's deteriorating institutional capacity. The Bank group lends Dollars 4bn a year to sub-Saharan Africa but has Dollars 14bn waiting to be dispersed. The World Bank now concedes that some of its performance yardsticks - a reduction in the number of public servants on the payroll - are not meaningful indicators of policy reform. Laying off road-workers makes little impact on the wage bill, has no impact at all on administrative efficiency and invariably means increased road maintenance charges later. Reducing the role of the state has left a vacuum - filled in many instances by the donors and non-governmental organisations. In reality, the shift of control in Africa is not from the state to the private sector or to the market but to the donors. Aid dependence has become aid addiction. Mr Jaycox argues that by substituting expatriate management for domestic skills, donors are 'systematically destroying capacity that does exist'. This is much worse than it sounds given the long lead time necessary to rebuild that capacity. The result is a disturbing contradiction between the desire for private sector and market-oriented development and the intrusive role the agencies frequently play in project decision-making. An alarmingly high proportion of the region's investment decisions are made by aid workers rather than the private sector. AFRICA can move from crisis to recovery. Given a healthier global environment, a more robust OECD growth performance, adoption of the Uruguay Round proposals, firmer commodity prices, fewer droughts and an end to war and civil unrest, an acceleration in the sub-Saharan growth towards 5 per cent a year, from 2 per cent over the past decade, is within reach. Whether the majority of African countries can achieve even this modest growth rate will depend on the willingness of African governments to pursue the right policies, and on the incentives that the developed country donors can offer to persuade governments to put long-term development before political short-termism. The failures of the 1980s suggest that the west, in seeking ways to speed, rather than impede, development, must make a much clearer and public distinction between those governments which truly embrace reform and those which merely pay lip-service. That means offering greater rewards to those countries - such as Ghana, Uganda and Zambia - which are demonstrating a sustained commitment to reform, while taking a tougher stance towards those countries - such as Kenya and Nigeria - which continue to evade responsibility for their failures. Lessons must be learned from Somalia: humanitarian intervention without a political and economic framework for recovery is, at best, short-term relief and, at worst, compounds the disaster. Trade, aid and debt relief are the best ways to encourage success. Ghana's ability to sustain reform over the past decade is due, in large part, to the fact that annual gross aid flows, averaging 8 per cent of GDP, were available almost from the moment that reform began. But it is absurd that Ghana should, at the same time, be paying a third of its annual export earnings in debt service to bilateral and multilateral donors. The Ghanaian government will not request debt relief, even though it clearly qualifies for debt reduction, for fear that these aid flows will dry up. But the donors should be offering, to Ghana, and other successful adjusters, much more generous packages of aid and debt relief. The international aid community must also think hard about the ways their activities help and hinder development in successful adjusters. The slow pace of indigenous capacity-building means that the need for external institutional support will remain for decades. There is a strong case for more burden-sharing between the donors and agencies, starting with a greater and more formalised role for non-government organisations (NGOs), working with local communities in areas such as primary health and education which are so important if sustainable growth is to be achieved. But the World Bank and the donors need, radically, to re-assess their approach to the numerous African governments who merely flirt with economic reform. The 1980s evidence suggests that trying to force adjustment measures on unwilling and corrupt regimes is counter-productive. First, the World Bank resident representative and visiting firemen tend to become the regime's apologist, increasingly willing to answer local critics and justify and defend ill-designed adjustment policies on the government's behalf. Then the Bank and the IMF become useful scapegoats when flawed and partially implemented policies do not deliver results, a tactic that President Moi of Kenya and ex-Presidents Kaunda of Zambia and Nyerere of Tanzania have all exploited. To avoid this trap, the Bank must insist that reform programmes are home-grown rather than imposed from outside, something which Ghana's achievements show is difficult but possible. The donors must, meanwhile, be prepared to put political reform at the top of the agenda. What is needed is not necessarily a change in government but rather a change in the style of government towards more open and accountable policy formulation and debate. Enforcing good governance requirements is much more demanding, and arguably far more important, than requiring multi-party elections as a pre-condition for aid. Sometimes elections help: without the defeat of Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections, Zambia would probably not have become the country with one of the best macro-economic records in the region. But Ghana's successful transition to civilian rule occurred, in part, because the military government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10-year period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result. But there is nothing democratic or economically progressive about multi-party elections unless minimum standards of good governance are already achieved. Last year's elections did not persuade President arap Moi of Kenya to put past patronage policies aside and embrace accountability and transparency. Nigeria's disastrous and flawed transition to civilian rule shows how multi-party elections can become an excuse for not taking tough economic decisions. Africa's debt burden further complicates the strategy, as the Nigerian experience again illustrates. Without debt relief, Africa's most populous country has little hope of progress, a point that World Bank officials make with great force. But the Paris Club creditors remain unwilling to offer further relief to a government which consistently misuses the resources it does control. Across Africa, the carrot of debt relief has not been enough to persuade half-hearted adjusters to accelerate reform - the World Bank is right to argue that a substantial write-off of Africa's remaining debts, on more generous terms than are currently envisaged, and taking account of differing debt structures, is now inevitable and should occur across the board. But debt relief should be combined with a public statement from the Bank and the donors that, for Africa, the rules of the aid game have changed. The Bank, and the donors, should refuse to engage in policy-based lending with any government which does not meet minimum standards of transparency and public access to information, including the Bank's own reports. They must be much tougher about policing and enforcing the conditions upon which future lending is based, including much more rigorous and rapid internal auditing of Bank and IMF lending. If governments are not willing to embrace the full structural adjustment agenda and good governance requirements, then the donors should only finance humanitarian projects. The World Bank, and the donor community, must speak out about the true state of Africa. Telling things as they are means being more realistic about what adjustment programmes can achieve. It means acknowledging that deregulation and liberalisation are only a beginning, that five-year programmes are implausibly short and that it will take many years of investment in human and physical infrastructure before the region's institutional base is rehabilitated. Afro-realism means resisting the temptation to declare victory in Ghana or Uganda or to make excuses for the shortcomings of governments in Nigeria and Kenya. For those countries which take the structural adjustment medicine, recovery will be long and hard. For those that do not, the chances of progress are slim and the future looks bleak.  -------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH  --------------------------------------------------------------                        1965-89    1982-92    1992-02  -------------------------------------------------------------- GDP All LDCs                 4.7        2.7        4.7  East Asia               7.2        8.0        7.3  Latin America           4.3        1.9        3.9  Sub-Saharan Africa      3.2        2.0        3.7 GDP per head All LDCs                 2.5        0.8        2.9  East Asia               5.2        6.4        5.9  Latin America           1.8       -0.2        2.1  Sub-Saharan Africa      0.4       -1.1        0.6  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank, Global Economic Prospects 1991 and 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Then Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was very mad at you for  this.    [Beilin] Well, yes, but he has changed his mind since.  Also, there were sanctions against South Africa, and Israel was  not too enthusiastic about taking steps against South Africa.  Eventually, in March 1987 we joined the international club that  imposed the sanctions, and I was very happy with this. I  believe this is one of the reasons that today we are able to  hold a dialogue, as we do, with Nelson Mandela, who was then  still in prison, and with the ANC.    [Rosen] Do you believe that over the past two or three years  we corrected the mistakes made over the past decades?    [Beilin] I believe so because up to 1987, Israel was, in  fact, the only country to openly admit that it disregarded the  sanctions the United Nations imposed on South Africa in 1977.  This created a very negative sentiment against Israel among the  black South Africans. They seriously supported the  Palestinians, hence, their unbalanced attitude toward the PLO  all these years. It was very difficult for us to make the  change, and I cannot say that today they are completely balanced  and that we will continue our passionate love affair with South  Africa. The new regime will certainly be different from the  previous, very pro-Israel, white regime.    [Rosen] We had very good defense relations. Was this  eliminated?    [Beilin] In 1987 we decided not to renew defense contracts.  That meant that existing contracts which still were in effect  were followed through to the date set for their termination. No  new contracts were signed. Therefore, the defense relations  between us have completely decayed.    [Rosen] Are there other areas of cooperation which will  continue? Are there contacts now with Mandela's men on this?    [Beilin] Primarily, there is trade between the two  countries. We import coal and other raw materials, and we export  there. We naturally have very close ties with the Jewish  community there. Also, there are contacts, established about a  year ago or so, with the ANC, which is a very broad coalition,  and with Mandela. He was due to visit Israel some time ago, and  he postponed it and will probably visit here in the future.  Hence, certainly we have the beginning of a very interesting  dialogue, which carries many opportunities, with the new South  African leadership.    [Rosen] Is there a possibility of an Israeli-South African  cooperation regarding black Africa in general?    [Beilin] We have asked ourselves this very question, though  I doubt it is possible. There is a big question: What kind of  country will South African become? So far, it has been a  Western country with a black population that could not even  vote. Today, it will be very different. Will it become another  Third World country with the symptoms of such countries,  including the big disappointment with past African leaders; or  will it be a very different country, which uses the enormous  wealth at its disposal? There is a chance the latter will be the  case, but I find it hard to believe it will have the time or the  ability to even consider cooperating with a country such as  Israel in other Third World countries or black Africa. We will  continue our efforts in Africa. We are in the midst of a very  intensive campaign of economic cooperation with African  countries. If the new South African regime would be willing to  cooperate with us, we would certainly welcome this. I, however,  doubt this is a realistic option at this time. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT924-11314 ,"FT924-11314 _AN-CJ0BMAASFT 921027   FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (10): Tackling poverty - Janasaviya programme      By WILLIAM KEELING   MR Susil Sirivardana, commissioner of the Janasaviya (Poverty Alleviation) Programme, laughed at the suggestion that he was a frustrated revolutionary. After two hours discussing the plight of Sri Lanka's poor and the inequities of its elite, this was a rare moment of light relief. The Janasaviya programme, with a 1992 budget of SLRs4.9bn, was developed by government in response to the 1987-89 People's Liberation Front (JVP) left-wing insurgency. 'The JVP comes from the frustrated, polarised, educated, rural youth,' explains Mr Sirivardana, who says that 15 years of liberal economic policy has 'produced a polarisation of society and a decline in human development'. In the 1988 election, President Ranasinghe Premadasa ran on a platform of poverty alleviation which promised to 'put people first, especially the poor and the poorest of the poor'. Janasaviya is the fulfilment of that promise and in Mr Sirivardana - who participated and was jailed for his part in a JVP-inspired insurrection in 1971 - Mr Premadasa has chosen an emotionally committed administrator. 'With Janasaviya we told the poor 'This is not the old politicised, corrupt, crooked, deal you are revolting against. If you are revolting against social injustice, here you can create justice',' says Mr Sirivardana. The programme involves almost 350,000 families and provides two forms of government support. The families receive a a monthly entitlement of SLRs1,458 with which to purchase specified consumer goods, such as food and clothing, from co-operatives. In return, each family is asked to put in 20 days of community-related work. Then, after two years on the programme, families become entitled to a SLRs25,000 Janasaviya Entitlement Certificate. While this is not available as cash, it pays interest of SLRs250 a month and can be pledged to a bank as collateral for a loan. In 1989, its first year of operation, the programme attracted the ire of the World Bank. In its latest Sri Lanka report, the bank said Janasaviya initially suffered 'two major shortcomings. . . First, it was not well targeted to the poor. . . Second, the supposed production-orientation of the programme was missing'. Janasaviya has since been restructured. The screening process for deserving families has been improved and the Janasaviya Trust, funded by donors including the World Bank, has been set up to identify civil works projects. These range from crop cultivation to local infrastructure projects. According to the bank's report, the trust should ensure that 'those refusing to participate in a productive activity would be dropped from the programme immediately'. Mr Sirivardana recognises that the World Bank views some of the programme's components as welfare and subsidy. 'It's not that for us', he says. He argues that Sri Lanka has suffered adverse domestic effects - a worsening incidence of poverty and a deterioration in health and education services - in its effort to become internationally competitive. 'I see it definitely as a policy failure and preventable,' he says. The criticism,which is not new of World Bank-sponsored economic adjustment programmes, is supported by the facts. Between 1981 and 1985, the share of national household income of the poorest third of the population dropped from 15 per cent to 11 per cent, while the richest third grew from 52 per cent to 62 per cent. In the same period, economists estimate the purchasing power of the poorest third of the population declined by about 10 per cent. In terms of minimum calory requirements, a quarter of Sri Lanka's population remains below the poverty line. This is despite Sri Lanka's notable achievements in the sectors of health and education. The nation retains probably the highest literacy rate of all developing countries, with about 90 per cent of the population above the age of 10 years officially literate. Sri Lanka also has an impressive health record with an infant mortality rate of just 19 in 1,000 live births. Almost 90 per cent of children receive standard immunisation. In part, this is the legacy of the 1950-70 period when, for example, government expenditure on education averaged 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). By the early 1980s it had dropped to 2.3 per cent of GDP. During the last JVP insurgency, the universities were closed for two years and schools and hospitals were severely disrupted. Mr M. D. Pieris, secretary of the Ministry of Health, explains: 'The JVP could, just by rumour or anonymous letter, shut down whole institutions'. The government has since taken steps to reverse the decline and the education budget is currently 3 per cent of GDP. Mr Pieris says the government would spend more if the continuing Tamil conflict were solved and the defence budget reduced. But the most important element of the government's social initiative is the Janasaviya programme, providing a safety net for the country's most disadvantaged. Janasaviya officials query, however, whether the programme is a short-term holding effort - a political response to the JVP exigency - or if it can become a comprehensive effort to, in Mr Sirivardana's words, 'change the social order; empower the poor'. Despite his energy and conviction, Mr Sirivardana concedes that the future for Sri Lanka's poor remains dim. He reluctantly accepts that 'investment by the poor in itself is insufficient to take them out of the poverty trap. 'You've got to have an active support system' including an effective agricultural extension service, he says. This, he notes, is not in place. The World Bank's assessment in its report is blunt: 'No matter how much emphasis the government puts. . . in its Janasaviya programme and other policy areas, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty altogether'. The Janasaviya programme, Mr Sirivardana insists, has had important benefits by 'generating a great deal of hope among the poor and those who care for them'. But the question he asks - 'Are we as a country prepared to live with so many poor?' - remains unanswered.  The Financial Times   London Page VI  "

Generally speaking, as relatively close attention  has been paid to the work of assisting the poor and developing  the poverty-stricken areas, the work has been performed very  well. Thanks to the intensified leadership of party committees  and governments at all levels, the enthusiastic support of  various departments and people from all walks of life, and the  assiduous work of the vast numbers of cadres and masses, the  population of poor people living in rural areas across the  country who have not totally and steadily settled the problem of  having adequate food and clothing has been reduced to 80 million  at present. This is a tremendous, historic achievement.    In attaining this achievement, we have gained rich  experiences, the most important of which, in my opinion, is that  we have defined a new working principle under which the original  pattern of assisting the poor by providing relief has been  changed to giving assistance by way of development. Practice  has proved that as the new principle is oriented to market  demands and aimed at developing and utilizing local resources to  boost commodity production through the application of scientific  and technological advances, it will not only resolve the problem  of providing people with adequate food and clothing, but enable  people to get rid of poverty and become prosperous. In this  way, very good results have been achieved in the production and  development of the impoverished areas by integrating the  assistance and support of the state with the self-reliance and  hard work of the cadres and masses in light of actual local  conditions. Just as many comrades have said: ""The practice of  assisting the poor by way of development has made people  diligent, and the more diligent they are, the richer they  become."" I have been to Yanan Prefecture in Northern Shaanxi.  People there built terraced fields to grow grain and resolved  the problem of having enough food to eat. They also developed  four major backbone industries -- tobacco, fruit, sheep, and  potatoes, and resolved the problem of having money to spend.  The apples produced there are very nice and have reached the  export level. The principle of assisting the poor by way of  development is a fundamental change as well as a momentous  creation in this work, so it must be upheld for a long time to  come.    The tasks faced by the work to assist the poor are still  very  arduous because 80 million people is not a small figure.  Moreover, the areas which have extricated themselves from  poverty over the past few years are those which have relatively  less difficulty, and the remaining areas are some hard nuts to  crack, as you have put it. In order to resolve the problem of  having adequate food and clothing for these 80 million people in  the next seven years, the State Council has formulated a ""State  Plan for Storming the Fortified Positions During the Eighth  Five-Year Plan."" This is a good and encouraging plan, but the  key to its success lies in whether or not we have the spirit of  assaulting fortifications. When we resolve the problem of  having adequate food and clothing for the 80 million people by  the end of this century, the right to subsistence -- the biggest  and most fundamental issue of human rights -- of the Chinese  people, who account for one-fourth of the world population, will  be resolved once and for all from then on. This is not only a  great event in the history of the Chinese nation, but a  magnificent feat in the history of human development.    Taken as a whole, the work to assist the poor has reaped  remarkable results, but we are still facing very arduous tasks.  Therefore, we must continue with the work conscientiously,  unswervingly, and perseveringly for a long period of time.    1. We Must Further Our Understanding of the Arduousness and  Importance of the Work To Assist the Poor by Way of Development  in Order To Continue It for a Long Time    The arduousness of the work to assist the poor by way of  development can be understood from the following two aspects:  1) It is very difficult to fulfill the tasks set in the plan of  storming the fortified positions during the Eighth Five-Year  Plan, so great efforts are necessary; and 2) even if we fulfill  the tasks set in the above-mentioned plan, we will only resolve  the problem of absolute poverty, so we must continue to resolve  the problem of relative poverty. As our burden is heavy and the  road is long, we have to work hard for a long time. Today,  although the average income in some developed countries is very  high, some people still receive low pay and their problem of  being relatively poor has not been resolved. Ours is a  socialist country, and our goal is to achieve common prosperity  for the entire people. Hence, our work to assist the poor is  not an expedient measure but must be continued in for a long  time.    Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the  intrinsic requirements of socialism, which also reflects the  superiority of the socialist system. Our party has been leading  the people to make revolution and build socialism for the  purpose of liberating and developing the productive forces and  enabling people to become prosperous. Since reform and opening  up, we have allowed and encouraged some people and localities to  get rich first in the hope that they will contribute to helping  other people and localities become rich too. In this way, we  can more effectively reach the goal of achieving common  prosperity. In developing the socialist market economic  structure, we should pursue the goal of allocating resources  efficiently, and at the same time give consideration to the  principle of fairness. We should adopt feasible policies to  foster development in the impoverished areas.    Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the  requirements of reform and development as well as the essential  conditions for maintaining stability. Development in various  localities is uneven. It is quicker in some localities and  relatively slower in others. This is inevitable. In this  process, however, constant attention should be paid to the  economic development in the impoverished areas. If these areas  are always in a state of poverty, they will affect not only the  realization of the objectives of our socialist modernization,  but also the stability of the entire country. If people in some  places are very rich and in other places are very poor for a  long time, there will be latent unstable factors. At present, a  considerable number of impoverished areas in China are mainly in  the border regions and the regions where minority nationalities  live in compact communities. Helping these areas rid themselves  of poverty as quickly as possible and achieve common development  is an economic issue as well as a major political issue that has  a bearing on national unity, unification of the motherland, and  consolidation of frontier defense. Moreover, some old liberated  areas are still poverty-stricken. The people in the old  liberated areas made tremendous contributions to the Chinese  revolution in the war years, so it is our bounden duty to do a  good job of assisting the poor in these areas in order to  gradually improve the people's lives there. In short, the  development of the old liberated areas, ethnic minority areas,  border areas, impoverished areas, and western areas is an  important issue that has an impact on the maintenance of a  lasting good order in the country.    2. To Continue the Work for a Long Time, the Key Lies in  the Intensification of Party and Government Leadership at All  Levels    The work to assist the poor is not purely economic work, but  work engaged in by the masses with distinct political content  covering the building of material and spiritual civilizations.  Party committees and governments at all levels should, as  always, make further efforts to intensify leadership in this  work.    The principal leaders of party committees and governments at  all levels must concern themselves with the work to assist the  poor, take up the matter personally, and regard it as a major  activity to show concern for the sufferings of the masses and  cement close ties with them. Meanwhile, they must rely on the  masses, consider everything in their interests, and work  sincerely for their well-being. This is the fundamental aim of  our party. In the areas where the economy has developed  relatively slowly and the masses' lives have been relatively  difficult, it is all the more necessary for party committees and  governments at all levels to show special concern for them.  Whether or not a party committee or government in a region has  been divorced from the masses, and stability and unity have been  maintained there, will primarily be judged by whether or not it  has properly performed the work for the masses whose lives and  production are comparatively difficult. The principal leaders  of party committees and governments at all levels must take  account of the overall situation, focus their work on the weak  links, and go often to the impoverished areas and ethnic  minority regions to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses,  conduct investigation and study, and personally help the cadres  and masses resolve practical problems. Recently, the idea has  occurred to me that, since people in large and medium-sized  cities and economically developed regions have comparatively  ampler clothes and quilts, while those in impoverished areas are  short of clothing and covering to ward off the cold, can we not  mobilize government functionaries and urban residents, in the  spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance, to donate  their surplus clothes and quilts to the masses in the  impoverished areas before the arrival of the coming winter?    We should persist in selecting and sending cadres to work in  the impoverished areas by stages and in groups. Our experience  in practice has fully proved that this is an indispensable  organizational measure to strengthen leadership in the work to  assist the poor by way of development, because the more  impoverished an area is, the greater its necessity for obtaining  assistance and guidance from its higher authority. Therefore,  we should transfer a number of cadres from provincial,  prefectural, and county organs to stay in poverty-hit townships  and villages and conduct propaganda on party policies in a bid  to help them set up powerful leading bodies, discover a correct  path for shaking off poverty to become prosperous, import talent  and technology, and enlist the masses in their production and  development. If competent cadres cannot be found in some poor  villages for the moment, we may try to transfer some cadres from  the county organs to work there. The practice of constantly  sending cadres to stay and work in poor villages is also of  great benefit to tempering cadres, training talented personnel,  and changing the work style in the leading bodies of party  organizations and governments. We should take the achievements  in changing the backward appearance of poverty-hit townships and  villages as a major aspect in the appraisal and promotion of  leading cadres at township and county levels.    Party committees and governments at all levels should be  adept in mobilizing and enlisting forces from various quarters  to initiate a new situation of assisting the poor and succoring  the distressed in the entire society, which is also an important  substance of intensifying leadership in the work. The Chinese  nation always has a traditional virtue of assisting the poor and  succoring the distressed. Today, in establishing a socialist  market economy, it is particularly necessary to develop this  traditional virtue. All units, including government organs, the  People's Liberation Army, democratic parties, mass  organizations, enterprises, and institutions, where conditions  exist, should exert themselves to the utmost to give positive  support to and participate in the work to assist the poor as  they have done before. A certain financial input is necessary  for the work, so financial, banking, and other departments  should extend their support by providing funds and preferential  treatment for this endeavor. We should also encourage the more  economically developed areas to give assistance to the backward  areas and, through mutually beneficial and reciprocal support,  achieve common development and prosperity. I hope that the  three municipalities, comprising Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai,  as well as various coastal provinces will put in a bit more  effort in this. The central authorities are of the opinion that  the relatively developed coastal provinces and cities should  assist the impoverished areas in their localities with their own  money, while funds for this purpose in the hands of the central  authorities should chiefly be used in helping the central and  western regions, which are in greater financial difficulty. In  the meantime, we call on you to help support the impoverished  areas in the central and western regions through such forms as  economic cooperation, technological transfers, cadre exchange,  and so on. Local party committees at all levels should  positively launch activities in their own localities, through  which rich counties offer help to poor counties, rich townships  help poor townships, rich villages help poor villages, and rich  households help poor households, so that they are formed into  pairs for mutual assistance.    3. It Is Necessary for the Cadres and Masses in the  Impoverished Areas To Fully Develop the Spirit of Self-Reliance  and Hard Struggle for Pioneering a Cause In Order To Persist in  the Work for a Long Time    It is absolutely necessary for the state to give certain  assistance to the impoverished areas and for the people from all  walks of life in society to conduct activities of assisting the  poor and succoring the distressed. However, settling the  problem of having adequate food and clothing in impoverished  areas and proceeding to shake off poverty and become prosperous  should, after all, depend on their own efforts. This calls for  the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the impoverished areas  to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to  combat nature and boost economy. With this spirit of working  hard to pioneer a cause, it will be easier to surmount any  difficulty. This is a fine tradition of our party as well as  the basic experience of our endeavor to shake off poverty and  become prosperous. I went to inspect work in Shanxi Province  during the Spring Festival last year. In Qiaoli Village, Linfen  City, the people there have changed the appearance of a poor  village precisely on the strength of pioneering a cause with  hard work. Although the villagers have become wealthy now, the  party branch still stands together with the masses through storm  and stress, and shares weal and woe with them. I hope that all  the people in impoverished areas will emulate and develop this  spirit.    To persist in self-reliance and hard struggle, we must bring  forth new ideas of assisting the poor through development. We  must extricate ourselves from the shackles of traditional  concepts and force of habit so that we will carry out reform,  open to the outside world, and invigorate the economy in a  practical manner, for which the crux lies in emancipating the  mind and discovering a correct path. Quite a few impoverished  areas are at a disadvantage because they failed to emancipate  their minds, so that their path of economic development was too  narrow. On the one hand, the barren hills and slopes were left  uncultivated and the deserted shoals and water resources lay  waste and, on the other, large numbers of the labor force  remained idle. We must regard the labor force as our wealth  rather than our burden. In many localities, the labor force was  enlisted to reclaim land, build fields, construct bridges and  roads, develop small irrigation works, and plant trees all the  year round, so that remarkable results have been scored.  Likewise, satisfactory results have also been reaped over the  past few years in carrying out the policy of providing relief  with grain and manufactured goods in exchange for the work of  creating land and building roads, which has proved to be  successful and should continue persistently. As farmland is  limited but barren hills are numerous in the impoverished areas,  forestry, animal husbandry, fruit, and cash crops should be  developed in line with local conditions. ""With animal husbandry  developed here and forestry boosted there, the labor force was  well utilized and economic results were instantly produced.""  This is also experience gained in the impoverished areas. The  export of labor is, in essence, personnel training and  intellectual development, because laborers will broaden their  horizons and increase their knowledge after a few years of work  in other places, and they will become talented people when they  return. The current issue regarding the export of labor is: In  face of the increasingly larger scale of ""waves of migrant  workers,"" we must intensify leadership and management of them to  reduce the spontaneous blind flow as quickly as possible, while  vigorously encouraging the export of labor in an organized and  planned fashion. Party committees and governments at all  levels, particularly those in the impoverished areas, should pay  serious attention to this and sum up experience conscientiously.  Otherwise, it will adversely affect the export of labor and  bring about serious social consequences as well.    The key to persisting in self-reliance and hard struggle  rests with the proper training of qualified personnel. To  transform the pioneering spirit into a material force, we must  ultimately depend on the intelligence and wisdom of the  laborers. Therefore, we must place the work of assisting the  poor through the development of science, education, and  intellect in a primary position. The Eighth Five-Year Plan  stresses the need to make elementary education universal,  positively eliminate illiteracy, conduct vocational and  technical education among young and middle-aged people, prevent  and cure endemic diseases, and take firm control of family  planning work. All this is very good, so I am all for it. In  impoverished areas, we should stabilize the existing qualified  personnel on the one hand, and bring up new talents on the  other. Practice in many places shows that by using an excellent  talent, a number of people will be motivated, and this locality  will prosper. We should extend assistance to the rural party  organizations politically, show concern for them, and unite and  encourage them to lead the masses in changing the appearance of  their hometowns and shaking off poverty to become rich.    Whether or not the spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle,  and pioneering a cause will be brought into full play depends,  to a considerable extent, on whether or not the leading bodies  in the impoverished areas are really up to the mark and the  grass-roots organizations are staunch. There are two focal  points here: 1) We should enhance the work in impoverished  counties and, in light of the requirement for assisting the poor  by way of development, select and assign competent leading  cadres at county level. In particular, we should select fine  cadres who are capable in work, able to bear hardships and stand  hard work, and have close ties with the masses to take up the  posts of county party committee secretaries and county chiefs,  and to remain in these positions for relatively long periods.  2) We should reinforce the building of party branches in  impoverished villages. ""We give money and things to them all  for the purpose of building up good party branches,"" which is  another good experience we have gained in the work to assist the  poor. In order to build good leading bodies in party branches,  we must select fine party members who are active, capable,  honest, fair, and able to cement close ties with the masses to  take up the leading posts.    In short, with the necessary support from the state and the  help from various sectors in society, so long as our leading  cadres at all levels always have the impoverished areas in mind,  share joys and sorrows with the masses, stick to Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, base themselves in  reality, persist in the struggle, and stress actual results in  their endeavor to assist the poor by way of development, the  backward appearance of the impoverished areas will certainly be  changed before the turn of this century.

Neither is politically tolerant by nature: throughout history, both have proved themselves excellent autocrats, corrupt and terrible tyrants. But now Moscow and Pretoria, bitterest enemies for decades, have become strange comrades in battle: falteringly, they fight the tide of culture and history to pursue a liberal democratic goal which seems to recede as often as it draws nearer. Neither is likely to follow a straight path to democracy - if indeed, they ever get there. But both are committed to ruling by consent and not coercion; and a return to either totalitarianism or apartheid is out of the question. Both must therefore search for a more or less democratic form of government which can hold anarchy at bay while protecting the minimum of civil liberties. So far the move to democracy has fostered chaos, crime and violence in both countries. Many already yearn for a strong man to restore order. In South Africa, a prominent mixed race politician complains (only half in jest) 'I miss apartheid'; and most Russians would probably understand this nostalgia for authoritarian certainty. But in the longer term, a betting man would probably conclude that Russia will stay the course to full democracy - however circuitous - and that South Africa will not. Both face formidable obstacles to democratisation, chief among them problems of ethnicity and economic hardship. But South Africa has a further overwhelming disadvantage: the rigid correlation between wealth and race decreed by apartheid. For democracy is scarcely the obvious solution for a country where the majority is poor, black and impatient and the minority white, rich and powerful: democracy invites the individual to use his vote to obtain a fairer share of wealth; but any government which indulges the urge to redistribute wealth will alienate white skills and capital, and jeopardise economic growth. Either way, the incumbent government would suffer at the ballot box - and would probably soon decide to dispense with democratic elections. As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out more than 150 years ago: 'When the people rule, they must be rendered happy or they will overturn the state.' But in South Africa, the 'state' would not give up without a fight; a new government may well be tempted to impose its will - in the national interest, of course - rather than hand over to the opposition. Not surprisingly, most South Africans reject this scenario: indeed, they find cheer in the midst of political upheaval by counting their considerable blessings in comparison with Russia. South African democrats will inherit intact the one most necessary condition for democracy: a market economy. That economy may have been damaged by 40 years of 'Afrikaner socialism', which used state capital to set up nationalised industries dominated by the 'white tribe of Africa'. But repairing its flaws is a small task compared with that facing Russia's economic reformers. From nothing, they must create financial markets, draw up a detailed body of company law and construct all the institutional supports necessary to capitalism. South Africa inherits these things from the apartheid state; and before the African National Congress decides to tamper with this inheritance, it should reflect on the ways in which capitalism underpins the democratic system which the ANC professes as its goal. In developed democracies, the private sector functions as an important check on the power of governmental authority; and the market economy holds out the best hope of a prosperity which is essential to bolster democracy from below. Paradoxically, South Africans will also inherit from apartheid - a most undemocratic ideology - the infrastructure of a thriving political democracy which Russia struggles so painfully to build. South Africa has political parties, independent courts, lobby groups and all the paraphernalia of parliamentary democracy, which can surely be adapted for a multi-racial future. But in Russia the Communist Party, which invaded every aspect of personal and public life, has deeply discredited the very notion of 'party'; indeed, there are few coherent party alternatives to President Boris Yeltsin, himself something of a one-man band. Progress towards the establishment of an independent judiciary in Russia is perhaps more advanced: the new Constitutional Court represents a milestone on the path to democracy. But Russia has no tradition of challenging state power through the courts - certainly not under communism, when challenging party decisions was effectively forbidden - and it lacks the institutional depth (the courts, the judges, the independent lawyers) present in South Africa. Even in the worst days of apartheid abuse, South Africa's courts managed to preserve much of their independence. But democracy requires more than political parties, elections and courts: a vigorous civil society (everything from trades unions to churches, women's groups to chambers of commerce) is necessary to frustrate the would-be tyrant. Such civil infrastructure is well developed in both black and white South Africa - and almost non-existent in Russia. Organised business and labour in South Africa could counter-balance government power; civic associations in black townships could prove a further check on central government; and with three-quarters of the population actively religious, the churches will remain a major political force. What is more, South Africa will inherit a state machine which actually works; in Russia, where party and state were practically indivisible, the collapse of the one has destroyed the other. No new South African government is likely to face the crisis of executive power which currently assails Moscow. So that is the triple challenge facing Russia: to create a modern state, a modern market economy and democratic political institutions, and to do so simultaneously under conditions of great economic hardship. But however daunting the immediate crisis, Russia will probably muddle through in the end to democracy and prosperity. And South Africa, whatever its early advantages, may not. Western democracies will continue to provide moral support to Russian democrats (however unreliable their financial backing), while South Africa will rapidly be left to itself on the remote tip of a forgotten continent. And over time, the gross inequalities of South African society could prove too much for a fledgling democracy. Both face problems of ethnicity and economic deprivation which threaten democracy; but in South Africa, crucially, they are linked. While Russians struggle (more or less) equally to survive, race determines the degree of hardship experienced by each South African. As long as that is so palpably true, it is hard to see how democracy can take root. But even if South Africa - perhaps Russia too - reverts temporarily to authoritarian rule, there can be no returning to the specific abominations of the past. Totalitarian communism and apartheid are ruled out forever. The future can scarcely be worse.

President arap Moi expressed welcome to Qian Qichen, saying  that Qian's visit will further promote development of the  friendly relations and cooperation between Kenya [words  indistinct].    Qian Qichen conveyed greetings to President arap Moi from  Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. He said the  Chinese president is expecting President arap Moi's visit to  China.    During the meeting both sides expressed satisfaction over  the  smooth development of relations between the two countries in  recent years. Qian appreciated the important role played by  President arap Moi and the Kenyan Government in promoting  Sino-Kenyan relations, maintaining regional peace and stability  and in promoting development in the region.    Qian said that there are potentialities for cooperation  between China and Kenya though conditions in the two countries  are not all same.

Arap Moi said that the friendship between the Kenyan and  Chinese peoples traces back to ancient times, adding that their  relations at present are good and the economic cooperation  between them is making new progresses. He said that the two  countries can cooperate in world affairs as they have similar  views on developments in Africa and the rest of the world. He  hoped the cooperation in various fields between the two  countries would be further strengthened.    Arap Moi briefed Qian on the regional situation, the  developments in Somalia and Kenya's efforts in mediating the  conflicts in Somalia and maintaining regional peace.

Soon after he arrived, Mr.  Roussin went to meet the country's authorities, particularly  President Ange-Felix Patasse, who granted him a very lengthy  audience late this morning. At the end of the audience, the  French minister expressed satisfaction with the resumption of  school activities and work in the public sector. He also  reiterated his country's stand towards Africa by stating that  France is not abandoning Africa. He redefined the orientation  of French aid, and referred to the 30-billion French franc  package allocated to banks in the franc zone. Here is Mr.  Roussin responding to questions from the press.    [Begin recording] [Roussin] Whenever France makes  commitments it honors them. When Africa makes certain decisions  France remains loyal to it. When it is said here and there that  France is ditching Africa, France is abandoning its friends, and  that a new page has been turned -- that is all baseless. You  are not abandoning your friends when you give 30 billion francs  to help them go through a delicate transition for the  relaunching of real growth and development. That is not true.  So, indeed, not only have we taken considerable measures --  during a difficult period for us -- to support this courageous  decision from the African countries -- and it will be seen  within a few months that all of us within the franc zone made a  good decision -- but even the backup measures have to be  negotiated between the various parties.    We have also put strong pressure on international  institutions so that everybody, taking into account the efforts  made by Africa, in turn, comes to Africa's aid. On 22 February,  I will be going to Brussels to see EC chief Jacques Delors and,  there too, champion Africa's cause and explain the efforts that  have been made, so that Europe can also participate in assisting  Africa. You talked about the backup measures [words indistinct]  minister with whom we met this morning, well, France will make  additional efforts. You know, in addition, we have constituted  a special fund to help -- in countries where this will be  necessary -- the most underprivileged people during this  transition period following the devaluation decision, until the  point arrives where economies start picking up again under the  new conditions.    [Unidentified correspondent] You talked about 30 billion  francs, how will these funds be distributed among the various  countries?    [Roussin] These 30 billion francs represent general aid from  France. In effect, it constitutes the cancellation of Africa's  debt. Africa owed France 25 billion francs, and we are  canceling that debt. There is 5 billion in project assistance  -- France wants to keep this rate up in cooperation efforts,  efforts made by the government and which are accepted by the  National Assembly and the Senate -- which is continuing. In  addition, we have this special social assistance fund. [passage  omitted] Therefore, France does not intend to ditch Africa.  France without Africa would not be the same. We are bound, we  are united. The success of these current operations will be the  success of Africa, it will be that of the Central African  Republic, and also that of France. We are closely bound within  the franc zone family and nobody can [words indistinct].  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage indistinct]    [Roussin] I know that on 15 February an agreement was signed  between the appropriate minister and the head of mission. I  myself have signed other agreements that [words indistinct] were  very considerable and that apparently have been disbursed. The  French Cooperation Fund has been given very specific directives.  The Cooperation Mission has been given very specific  directives. The IMF has committed itself. The World Bank has  committed itself -- the first disbursements of the World Bank  for some countries are already under way -- and we have never  joined hands as much as now in order to manage a problem of such  dimensions.

0,FT933-5761 ,"FT933-5761 _AN-DIAB3AGJFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (11): In search of a kick-start - Private sector      By TONY HAWKINS   ONE of the most important challenges facing Africa in the 1990s is that of kickstarting the private sector. But as Sir William Ryrie, retiring executive vice-president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), says, Africa is the only region in the developing world where public sector investment exceeds that of private enterprise. More than half the region's investment is funded from aid. This low level of private investment cannot be attributed to a shortage of entrepreneurship, says Sir William, noting that since the African Project Development Facility was launched in 1986, over 2,000 entrepreneurs have sought its assistance, The IFC - the World Bank group's private sector arm - has launched four main initiatives in the region: More than 23 governments have been advised by the IFC's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) on how to attract direct investment from abroad. The IFC itself has invested in large energy sector projects in Cameroon and Nigeria and in the Ashanti Gold Mine in Ghana. Much is expected from small enterprise development programmes, seen as a partial solution to the region's escalating unemployment problem and also as an area where Africa has comparative advantage. In Ghana, for example, small enterprise accounts for more than 80 per cent of manufacturing employment. Access to finance is probably the main constraint on small firm expansion and the IFC's African Enterprise Fund targets its lending and investment activities on small businesses, funding some 58 projects in 18 countries since its inception. The IFC has assisted 10 countries in privatisation programmes, though progress has been slow. The fourth initiative is fostering capital market development. The World Bank's private sector programme has a broadly similar focus. Initially, its support for private sector development targeted infrastructural investment to complement industrial and agricultural projects. This changed in the 1980s as the Bank focused on specific obstacles to private sector growth, launching its Private Sector Development Programme in 1989, with three main objectives - creating an enabling business environment, restructuring the public sector and promoting financial sector development. In the 18 months to mid-1992, it financed 42 projects in 24 sub-Saharan countries. In addition to its support of privatisation, the Bank is working to strengthen the role of the state through capacity-building and institution-building investments. In the financial sector, its main task has been regulatory reform, including liberalising interest rates, allied with institutional reform including restructuring ailing banks, and establishing appropriate systems for prudential regulation and bank supervision. Yet there remain formidable obstacles. In Kenya, for example, a study found that the average company needs 15 licences a year to operate, taking some 223 staff hours to acquire. Backhanders add 66 per cent to legal fees while total costs including 'irregular charges' amounted to more than a fifth of incremental profits. Given the scepticism over an early return of foreign investment, the donors are right to bang the small enterprise drum. But in a world where retailers and consumers want increasingly sophisticated quality products, and where modern technology and scale economies demand heavy investment, it is difficult to see small business playing more than a residual role.

""But does that mean I don't care?"" Bush went on. ""No. It doesn't.""    In 18 months as President, Bush has kept steadfastly to that theme and image:  He is a caring President hamstrung by his budget. For the most part, he has  delivered a moderate message outlining the dimensions of many of the problems  generated by the crisis of poverty. But his words have not matched federal  action.    There have been some exceptions. He has increased the federal budget  substantially in the war on drugs, for example, and he has proposed a  significant increase in the funding of the popular Head Start program. But his  critics insist that his drug funds are misdirected -- more for the hunt of  criminals than the treatment of addicts -- and that his Head Start increase,  though welcome, is far less than needed.    Bush has recognized the existence of a gap between what is needed and what his  government will spend but has contended that this gap can be filled by private  Americans who offer their time and money to the needy -- the ""thousand points  of light"" of his electoral campaign. The President describes his role as mainly  one of encouragement.    ""We are deeply moved by the plight of those who lack the skills that most of us  . . . simply take for granted,"" he told the National Federation of Republican  Women in Baltimore last October. ""And rest assured, we're going to continue to  work with you, those of you out there on the cutting edge, to promote literacy  skills.""    Here are some of the President's views about poverty and homelessness in  America:     ""My problem is that the best answer to poverty is a job, and the best way you  have a job is to have a strong economy. And so you have to get the deficit  down, and that's where, under the law, I'm required to do it. So I'll keep  fighting for that.""     -- In reply to questions at John F. Kennedy High School, Denver, Dec. 8, 1989.    ""The best poverty program is a job in the private sector, where a family can  hold their heads up high with a certain dignity. . . .    ""When these mandated benefits (bills) come down here, they have good titles on  them, they have things we're concerned about: parental leave or child care,  whatever it is. And I am sympathetic with many of the objectives. But as I  weigh them, I have a responsibility to say what kind of an effect are they  going to have on this best antidote to poverty and that's a job. And so, we've  got to resist some of the call for these good things that have good titles if  they undermine the fundamental thing, which is our ability to create jobs.""     -- Talk with visitors to the White House, April 4, 1989.     ""The truth is there is no better housing policy than a growing economy. And  we've got one, one that provides jobs and wages and opportunities for  advancement, long-term interest rates that open ownership opportunities to  hundreds of thousands of first-time home-buyers. . . .    ""No child in America should have to grow up in the streets, and every family in  America should have a roof over its head. We've got to do better. . . .    ""But the real answer for the homeless, those with mental problems or dependent  on drugs or alcohol, is shelter plus care. Shelter, supplemented by the  necessary support services to get these people the help they need to live in  dignity. And that means a partnership, a combined federal, state and local  effort to supply the funding and other resources that constitute a  comprehensive solution for the hard-core homeless.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of Realtors, Nov. 10, 1989.    ""Speaking of tenants in public housing, they deserve something else: a safe  place to raise their children and live their lives. And so, I ordered an  additional $50 million to HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) the  other day to evict the drug dealers from public housing. Let's give these kids  a fighting chance.""     -- Remarks to visitors at the White House, Sept. 8, 1990.    ""One thing we can't afford is to fall behind the competition when it comes to  training the educated work force that future challenges will require.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges,  Nov. 21, 1989.    ""The fact is that we spend more per capita than many of our toughest  competitors. And as a nation, we devote more than $300 billion a year to  educating our children.

""But does that mean I don't care?"" Bush went on. ""No. It doesn't.""    In 18 months as President, Bush has kept steadfastly to that theme and image:  He is a caring President hamstrung by his budget. For the most part, he has  delivered a moderate message outlining the dimensions of many of the problems  generated by the crisis of poverty. But his words have not matched federal  action.    There have been some exceptions. He has increased the federal budget  substantially in the war on drugs, for example, and he has proposed a  significant increase in the funding of the popular Head Start program. But his  critics insist that his drug funds are misdirected -- more for the hunt of  criminals than the treatment of addicts -- and that his Head Start increase,  though welcome, is far less than needed.    Bush has recognized the existence of a gap between what is needed and what his  government will spend but has contended that this gap can be filled by private  Americans who offer their time and money to the needy -- the ""thousand points  of light"" of his electoral campaign. The President describes his role as mainly  one of encouragement.    ""We are deeply moved by the plight of those who lack the skills that most of us  . . . simply take for granted,"" he told the National Federation of Republican  Women in Baltimore last October. ""And rest assured, we're going to continue to  work with you, those of you out there on the cutting edge, to promote literacy  skills.""    Here are some of the President's views about poverty and homelessness in  America:     ""My problem is that the best answer to poverty is a job, and the best way you  have a job is to have a strong economy. And so you have to get the deficit  down, and that's where, under the law, I'm required to do it. So I'll keep  fighting for that.""     -- In reply to questions at John F. Kennedy High School, Denver, Dec. 8, 1989.    ""The best poverty program is a job in the private sector, where a family can  hold their heads up high with a certain dignity. . . .    ""When these mandated benefits (bills) come down here, they have good titles on  them, they have things we're concerned about: parental leave or child care,  whatever it is. And I am sympathetic with many of the objectives. But as I  weigh them, I have a responsibility to say what kind of an effect are they  going to have on this best antidote to poverty and that's a job. And so, we've  got to resist some of the call for these good things that have good titles if  they undermine the fundamental thing, which is our ability to create jobs.""     -- Talk with visitors to the White House, April 4, 1989.     ""The truth is there is no better housing policy than a growing economy. And  we've got one, one that provides jobs and wages and opportunities for  advancement, long-term interest rates that open ownership opportunities to  hundreds of thousands of first-time home-buyers. . . .    ""No child in America should have to grow up in the streets, and every family in  America should have a roof over its head. We've got to do better. . . .    ""But the real answer for the homeless, those with mental problems or dependent  on drugs or alcohol, is shelter plus care. Shelter, supplemented by the  necessary support services to get these people the help they need to live in  dignity. And that means a partnership, a combined federal, state and local  effort to supply the funding and other resources that constitute a  comprehensive solution for the hard-core homeless.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of Realtors, Nov. 10, 1989.    ""Speaking of tenants in public housing, they deserve something else: a safe  place to raise their children and live their lives. And so, I ordered an  additional $50 million to HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) the  other day to evict the drug dealers from public housing. Let's give these kids  a fighting chance.""     -- Remarks to visitors at the White House, Sept. 8, 1990.

0,FT921-2391 ,"FT921-2391 _AN-CCSBEAFKFT 920319   FT  19 MAR 92 / Financial markets cheered but remain cautious      By Foreign and Financial Staff   CLOSER trade, investment, and financial links with South Africa were predicted in the financial and business community yesterday following the referendum, although there was caution about the future. Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest commercial banks, said it would proceed with a bond issue for Escom, the electricity utility, which had been postponed during the referendum. It will lead an international consortium for the issue. German banks have already paved the way for South Africa's return to the international capital markets after a six-year absence. Deutsche Bank, the country's biggest bank, was the lead manager in a DM400m (Pounds 139m) issue for the republic last September, increased from DM300m because of strong investor demand. Deutsche Bank yesterday welcomed the outcome, as did Mercedes-Benz, one of Germany's largest corporate investors in South Africa. Mercedes said the vote was a vindication of its decision to stay in South Africa  - where it employs nearly 5,000 people. Corporate America's initial reaction was muted. A handful of companies and banks surveyed said it was too early to plunge back into major investment in South Africa. Ms Jennifer Kibbe, an official at the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre, which tracks US investment in South Africa, said US companies regarded the referendum vote 'as a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for them to go back in.' Citicorp, the biggest US bank, bank indicated it would need to see what type of interim government came to power before it could consider changing its position. Citicorp which closed its office in South Africa in 1987, does have a limited business in South African ADRs (American depository receipts), but it is unlikely to expand that business immediately. After sanctions were lifted Citicorp said it had no plans to resume lending and that position has not changed. The Ford motor company, which withdrew in 1988, said it would conduct a full review before changing its position. Among British companies, Barclays Bank, which pulled out of South Africa in 1986 in response to student protests, said it was a positive result but that it would wait to see how the situation developed. 'As the political situation and economic climate becomes clearer .. it is possible that in the future Barclays may establish some representation in South Africa to look after large corporate business in that country and to service the bank's global clients,' the bank said. RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said it was 'delighted'. It saw 'nothing but good coming out of the complete integration of southern Africa.' On the international bond market, the result was widely seen as likely to bring forward further bond issues from the republic. Bankers said further political headway would have to be made before there was fresh fund-raising. South Africa has launched three international bond issues since last summer, two in the name of the republic and one in the name of the Development Bank of South Africa. All have been sold mainly to German private investors, rather than institutions. Concern about political risk, and ethical or legal obstacles, still loom large. The republic's Ecu250m (Pounds 178m) of bonds, launched in January, were trading at a yield of 10.63 per cent, 0.2 of a percentage point above offer price  - a reflection that demand for the bonds, though reported to have picked up yesterday, has yet to affect the price.

The documents --  transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force  officer and from the government's classified submissions to the  International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) -- show that much  vital information has been kept from the public. They also show  that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to parliament on 23  March 1993 that the government had built then destroyed just six  crude nuclear devices fell far short of the whole truth.    The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in  the 1970's and 1980's was grotesquely at odds with the disarray  and venality among the government officials involved in the  project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force  Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in  Capetown makes clear.    Classified documents from the trial obtained by Africa  Confidential trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with  Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to  make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of  Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had  promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South  Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear  programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but  said that Blaauw ad threatened to make public details about the  nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it. By  the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred substantial  debts and had his assets sequestrated following his resignation  from ministerial office and parliament on 15 November 1983 after  some highly critical press reports.    In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on  charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and  possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power  reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he  is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining  concessions through the civil courts.    Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in  World  War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine,  the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement  from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of  Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel.    It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the  mining  portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the  tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's  work on the nuclear programme with Israel.    In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that  Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet  meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a  mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found  to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk  to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme  and sources close to the highest levels of government have told  Africa Confidential that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry  as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980's, De Klerk was  said to be unable ""to come to terms philosophically"" with the  securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose  primary target would be African civilians.    However, De Klerk's apparent ""road to Damascus"" on the  nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full  admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme.  This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns  senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time  when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the  loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear  uncertain.    Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is  significant:  Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons  creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information  submitted to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency],  which monitors compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations, the government admitted  that its weapons programme had involved lithium-6 separation, a  means of producing tritium. So sensitive is this information  that senior African National Congress (ANC) officials, some of  whom will be holding ministerial office after the April  elections, have been refused access to it.    According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by  Africa Confidential, the programme had also progressed by the  early 1980's to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of  producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have  been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the  basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work  on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986,  according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy  Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy  coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons  programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the  following year.    In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that ""at  no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another  country."" Apart from United States intelligence reports  attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration,  additional information would have been available to De Klerk,  during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that  tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated  technology, one which South Africa had not mastered.    At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the  supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600  tonnes of ""yellowcake"" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake  exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by  William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem.  Footnote    ""Critical Mass"" by William Burrows and Robert Windrem (Simon  and Schuster) 1994). They write that the sensitive arrangements  were jointly overseen by South Africa's then intelligence  agency, the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli  intelligence division Lish Ka le-Kishrei (Lakam) which  specialised in nuclear and technological procurement and came to  public attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard  spy scandal in the USA in 1985.    Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South  Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had  emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make  high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men  arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for  Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war.    Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in  Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and  Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial  documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one  ""Benjamine"" of Lakam (almost certainly Benjamin Blumberg, chief  of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would  sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for  nuclear weapons or power reactors.    Through his service in South African military liaison during  the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert  activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between  white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and  South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a  confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the  security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told  the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's  request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from  John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a  comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts.    According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South  African officials, including director of Lakam Benjamin Blumberg  and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled  as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium --  2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity  was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks.    Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake  deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster  reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was  known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made  for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in  preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw  said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied  him to Israel.    Botha was a hit with the Israelis. ""Look after Fanie Botha,""  Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court  that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the  yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager  for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more  cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time.    Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie  Botha  from a US$1 million ""gift"" he had received from Israel. The  objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to  keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting  personal debt.    Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van  Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed  all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw  provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were  channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the  source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks  from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw.  Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to  Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of  mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the  West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which  precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty  to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was  sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before  Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining  leases because those areas had already been promised to others.    As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo-  American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the  presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry  Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983)  was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist  Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh,  the editor of the Sunday Times, as a result of which no  information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published  in that newspaper [sentence as published].    However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with  Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told  Africa Confidential on 2 February 1994 that although he had no  control over what was published in the English press in South  Africa he had ""said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had  told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his  conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he  intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's  affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding  Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated  by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh  undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's  financial position."" According to Oppenheimer, nothing was  published about Botha at that time for fear of libel.    The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie  Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the  applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5.  Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson  about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie  Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw  in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw ""advised  De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the  Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging  applications for rights to prospect for diamonds."" De Beers  subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the  forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he  met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions  for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1  highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining  rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the  Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: ""No payment was asked for or  made by De Beers to any person in connection with these  applications.""    The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial  Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and  sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers:  Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together  in a joint venture.    In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by  legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha,  who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had  begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents,  Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during  the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978  information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the  succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones  and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister  Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A.  P. Treurnicht.    Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that  Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party  MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in  the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in  Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made  its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a  harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court  entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw  testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by  senior officials in the government. The document passed through  the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for  what purpose.    When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha  called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and  meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he  had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman  that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw.    Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced  that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979.  It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document  concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because  he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the  Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the  reactor.

0,FT943-8321 ,"FT943-8321 _AN-EHRD3AAZFT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / Fertility rates are down but not enough      By BRONWEN MADDOX   The UN's population report tells of a dramatic drop in fertility rates in the past 40 years, even in some of the world's poorest countries, Bronwen Maddox reports. In Asia and Latin America the fertility rate has nearly halved from 5.9 to about 3 children per woman in that period, although Africa (including northern African states) has showed a smaller decline from 6.6 to 5.8. Even in developed countries, rates have fallen from 2.8 to 1.7 over that period. These patterns have forced demographers to modify the old assumption of a link between low birth rates and economic wealth in favour of a more complex picture. Some countries, such as Bangladesh, have achieved steep falls in fertility rates despite relative lack of economic growth. Others, notably Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, continue to have large average family sizes despite relatively high levels of economic prosperity. The UNFPA draws a close connection between low fertility rates and the availability of contraception, even where gross domestic product per head has not risen greatly. It attributes roughly half of the fall in worldwide fertility rates to improved distribution of contraceptives. The other half, it says, is due simply to the determination of parents to have fewer children, even when contraception is not available. Even the poorest families, UNFPA officials say, work out that they can spend more on each child if they have fewer children. Demographers have long agreed that improving women's education plays an important part in reducing family sizes. But the UN report suggests that newer pressures are also providing powerful motivation. When workers move to towns from the countryside they tend to delay having children and to have fewer. Anecdotal evidence from west African countries also suggests that looming land shortages are curbing the size of rural families. These new factors may be helping to push down fertility rates even in Africa and central America, the regions which have persistently had the highest rates, Mr Alex Marshall of UNFPA suggests. Since the first half of the 1980s, Tanzania has seen fertility rates drop from 6.7 to 5.9 children per woman, Namibia from 5.8 to 5.3 and South Africa from 4.8 to 4.1.   Countries:-  XOZ  Asia.

After four successive years of economic growth, Latin America has come to be regarded as a success story for the market-oriented policies urged by Washington-based organisations. But, in yesterday's report, Oxfam said Latin America's free-market revolution has only widened already extreme income inequalities and worsened poverty. Oxfam welcomes the World Bank's recent commitment to poverty reduction 'but remains concerned that the strategy adopted is essentially a repackaging of the IMF and World Bank's policies, with social investment and safety nets added on'. According to the charity, the new policies' main flaws are that they fail to introduce policies for wealth distribution, and do nothing to protect what it calls basic rights, a lack of which has resulted in low-wage precarious jobs, unequal land distribution, restricted access to capital, and inadequate health and education. It says IMF stabilisation policies and World Bank insistence on market deregulation, import liberalisation and export growth have undermined any anti-poverty strategy. Growth was also based on the dismantling of workers' rights and the erosion of wages, which would further worsen economic insecurity. Its central recommendation is for the two institutions to replace their current single policy blueprint with a country-by-country reform strategy based on dialogue with local civil organisations, governments and relevant UN agencies. It favours selective trade protection and 'carefully targeted' subsidies for key industries, as well as low real interest rates. It also calls for social clauses in international trade and investment agreements 'to reverse the current trend towards low-wage export strategies'. Land reform should be a central element of the World Bank's poverty reduction strategy. Further, it says foreign debt is still draining many Latin American countries of resources. The Brady plan, though welcome, had been biased towards big debtors, and had failed to restore their long-term financial stability. Meanwhile debt to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank has become an increasing part of the problem, rising from 5 per cent of the regional debt stock in 1980 to 28 per cent in 1992. It urges quick implementation of the British government's proposal to use IMF gold stocks for debt relief for very poor countries, and says debt relief should be separated from IMF reform packages. The World Bank, it argues, should use its Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in reserves for selective debt relief; efforts to reduce countries' commercial debts should be renewed.

Speaking before the United Nations in 1993, former Chilean  President Patricio Aylwin proposed a social summit to undertake  a global effort to eradicate poverty, which affects millions of  people around the world.    During a meeting today with foreign correspondents, Frei  stressed the importance of the Cartagena summit. He said he  will use the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with  presidents from neighboring countries, with Spanish King Juan  Carlos, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Venezuelan  President Rafael Caldera, and Cuban President Fidel Castro.    Regarding Cuba, with which Chile maintains ties at the  consular level, Frei noted the appointment of Ambassador  Patricio Pozo, the former Chilean representative to Costa Rica,  as Chilean consul to Cuba. He also mentioned Chilean-Cuban  commercial and tourism ties. Frei commented on the credit line  granted to Cuba for the purchase of foodstuffs from Chile, as  well as Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming visit.  Frei said that during his talk with Castro, we will continue to  discuss the strengthening of bilateral ties seeking to  consolidate democracy and uphold human rights.    Frei reasserted his opposition to a unilateral armed action  against Haiti, but hastily condemned the serious situation in  that country. He said: ""We do not favor unilateral solutions  and will support all multilateral measures adopted by the  international community that seek to restore democracy in Haiti.""    Open regionalism will be one of the priority proposals to be  made by Frei at the Cartagena Summit. Frei stated: ""In an  integrated world, in which large economic blocs like the EU,  NAFTA (among the United States, Mexico and Canada), and APEC  (Asian-Pacific Economic Corporation) are being consolidated we,  as Latin Americans, must also be present. A Latin American  union should not be a closed association, it should help us to  open these markets.""    Development with equity, the fight against poverty and  crime,  and drug enforcement are also included in the Chilean proposal.  Frei said: ""Particularly, a clear political idea to achieve  progress regarding integration.""    He stressed the Chilean decision to join the Common Market  of  the South (Mercosur) which originally comprised Argentina,  Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.    The Cartagena Summit will be the first international  conference to be attended by President Eduardo Frei since he  assumed power on 11 March.    Frei will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Washington  on 28 June. He will attend the Rio Summit in September, and  attend the APEC Summit meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, in  November. During this meeting Chile will be accepted as a  member country.    On 9 and 10 December, Frei will attend the presidential  summit in Miami called by President Clinton. Speaking about the  possible duplication as a result of the Ibero-American summit in  Cartagena and the Summit of the Americas in Miami, Frei said he  believes all efforts to increase the number of meetings of Latin  American presidents or European leaders are positive.

Andre Jordan spoke to South Africa's [RSA]  ambassador Maseru, Gerhard Visser, and asked him whether it  would be correct to describe yesterday's events as a coup  attempt.    [Begin recording] [Visser] It is difficult for me to say so,  I have also heard that the prime minister said that it could  have been a coup. It phased out last night with the release of  the four ministers, but the fact that the deputy prime minister  was killed, it's difficult to place it in the category of a  coup, because there was no follow-through. But as I've already  mentioned, and also that it is the policy of the South African  Government, as well as the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  that South Africa will not recognize any other government in  Lesotho, but the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] which was  democratically elected in April 1993.    [Jordan] Do you think a statement from our Department of  Foreign Affairs yesterday reiterating that position could have  had any effect in dampening what might have been a developing  coup?    [Visser] This is not the first time that we've made this  statement, Foreign Minister Botha visited Lesotho on the 15th of  January this year, where he made it very clear on television, on  radio, and in public that South Africa will not support any  military coup in Lesotho, or for that matter, any group or  persons who try to overthrow the BCP government by violent  means. It will not be recognized by South Africa, and will  receive no support whatsoever from the outside world.    [Jordan] Is there any indication of just what faction or who  in the army might have been behind yesterday's events?    [Visser] No, all I can tell you is that it is the RLDF, the  Royal Lesotho Defense Force, the soldiers were from the  Makoanyane Barracks, as far as I could gather, and that the four  ministers who were detained were also detained at the Makoanyane  Barracks.    [Jordan] The soldiers at the other barracks on the opposite  side of town, are they likely to take any action. Are they  loyal to the government. Do we see an army split into two  factions, pro and anti-government?    [Visser] That's also a tough question for me to ask as a  diplomat. Yes, I would think the army was split into two  factions in the February and March problems, but it seems to me,  as far as I could gather, and news is difficult to come by in  Maseru, that this time it was the Makoanyane Barracks, and not  the headquarters people that apprehended and detained the  ministers. But I would not say there are two factions in the  RLDF at the moment.    [Jordan] But you say we're not looking at the likelihood of  clashes as happened earlier in the year?    [Visser] It's very difficult to say. I hope not, let me put  it like that, I hope not. I think it's time for the soldiers now  to accept the present government, to discuss their problems with  the present government, and to look at the future of Lesotho per  se. You know these actions by soldiers or individuals or groups  cause tremendous harm to the economy of Lesotho and also to  tourism, etcetera, etcetera. The fact that Foreign Minister  Botha has already told South Africans not to travel to Lesotho  will have an adverse effect on the economy and tourism.    [Jordan] And yet the situation today looks quite normal?    [Visser] It's always been, it's always been very difficult  to  describe to people who have never been to Maseru how it looks  here. I mean even at the heights of the shooting of the 23d of  January this year, well, the soldiers were shooting at each  other on the surrounding hills, the man in the street just went,  more or less, on with his daily life.

General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with extravagant praise during his visit, the first by a white South African leader to Nigeria. At a state banquet on Thursday night, he declared that Mr de Klerk deserved a place among the most famous black South African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric. These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian given the open hostility which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades. But Gen Babangida went beyond mere rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation. Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in South Africa, likely within months. Reconciliation with South Africa is likely to prove the largest foreign affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a civilian government at the year end. Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis which they hope will give the continent new clout in international relations. There were frequent protestations of African brotherhood from both sides, with each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two regional superpowers. The leaders of South Africa's three largest business organisations accompanied Mr de Klerk to Nigeria, where they met Nigerian business leaders to discuss renewing trade ties. They said clandestine trade with Nigeria had carried on throughout the sanctions period but could be much increased, perhaps to more than R200m (Pounds 40.2m) a year. Nigerian crude oil is not suitable for South African refineries, but Nigerian manufacturers are keen to import South African steel and industrial chemicals.  The Financial Times   London Page 32  "
0,FT931-1041 ,"FT931-1041 _AN-DCZBZAF4FT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Brazil: 'the problem is lack of shame, not lack of money'      By CHRISTINA LAMB      RIO DE JANEIRO   GERALDO MARINHO lives on a hill with one of the most spectacular views in the world. Spread out below is the palm-fringed crescent of Rio's Sao Conrado beach, lined with luxury apartments blocks, their rooftop swimming pools glimmering in the sun. Unlike those he looks down upon, Mr Marinho lives with his seven-member family in a crumbling two-roomed shack in Rocinha, one of the many favelas, or slums, clinging to the hills of Rio, and the largest in Latin America. Mr Marinho's home is reached through a labyrinth of narrow passageways, crowded with similar shacks. No door can shut out the fetid smell from the black stream of sewage and litter gushing alongside with its constant threat of diseases such as cholera. Mr Marinho is one of 43m Brazilians living in poverty. Brazil has one of the world's biggest gaps between rich and poor. The richest 20 per cent earn more than 26 times the poorest. Despite being the richest economy in Latin America and the ninth largest in the world, Brazil's infant mortality and illiteracy rates rank along with Bolivia and Guatemala as the worst in the continent. The world's second largest food exporter, Brazil has scenes of hunger comparable to famine-struck Africa. Mr Jutahy Magalhaes, minister for Social Well-being, sums up: 'We are simultaneously the most developed and the poorest country in Latin America. We export technology and manufacture satellites yet we have not erased diseases of the middle ages.' Long ignored by politicians, Brazil's 'social apartheid' is now provoking hot debate. The army minister has warned of social unrest and President Itamar Franco has called for his ministers to devise poverty eradication programmes after receiving a 'hunger map' showing 32m Brazilians suffering chronic malnutrition. Those in Rocinha are sceptical. 'Governments are just for the rich,' says Mr Jose Carlos de Souza from the Favela Association. The rapid industrialisation which transformed Brazil from a sleepy coffee economy to an industrial power and saw an annual growth rate of 7 per cent between 1940 and 1980 served largely to strengthen the grip of the elites. Today's real minimum wage of Dollars 64 (Pounds 45) per month for example is two-thirds of its 1940 level. The recession of the past three years has worsened the situation, with higher unemployment and inflation. Brazil's poverty has been made more visible by the rural migration which accompanied industrialisation. Since 1960 the proportion of the population living in cities has risen from 40 to 75 per cent. Official figures show the number of favelas in Rio has increased from 373 to 570 in the past 10 years; in the city of Recife they are home to 44 per cent of the population. According to Mr Jutahy, Brazil's housing deficit is 10m and rising. Most poverty is concentrated in the north-east. The area suffers blistering yearly droughts because of the lack of infrastructure to harness the country's rainfall. Despite the government's current cash crisis, Brazil's social problems do not emanate from a lack of funds. Rather than tackle the real causes, politicians have offered short-term solutions such as emergency food-baskets, usually around election time. Much of the money allocated to social programmes is lost through waste and corruption. Mr Jutahy estimates as little as 15 per cent of federal funds reach their intended destinations. A World Bank official says: 'This wouldn't be so bad if what was left was spent usefully, but it's not.' This has discouraged action by international agencies. Mr Agop Kayayan, Unicef representative in Brazil, says: 'I feel like Don Quixote tilting at windmills.' The fact that the problems can be tackled is demonstrated by the recent experience of Ceara, Brazil's third poorest state. Despite inheriting a bankrupt administration on becoming governor in 1986, Mr Tasso Jereissati managed to reduce infant mortality by a third. He says: 'The problem in Brazil is far more lack of shame than lack of money.' The Jereissatis in Brazil are few; people are losing hope in the future and all faith in the political system. 'We are heading towards an explosive situation,' says Mr Jutahy. Brazil is the world's second largest market for private jets, yet 52 per cent of the working population earn less than Dollars 120 a month. Shocked by the contrast between Brazil's haves and have-nots, particularly visible in Rio, visitors often ask why there is no revolution. In fact, groups from the favelas have taken to attacking supermarkets and emptying them of produce. One can be shot for a pair of sneakers or have one's hair hacked off at knifepoint. In some ways the revolution has already started.   Countries:-  BRZ  Brazil, South America.   Industries:-  P9441 Administration of Social and Manpower Programs.     P9531 Housing Programs.

Yet a two-day White House conference addressed by President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, not to mention secretary of state Warren Christopher and national security adviser Anthony Lake, has accomplished the remarkable feat of irritating even Africa's most devoted advocates. Several experts who had been told they would be asked did not receive invitations, and most members of the congressional black caucus stayed away, partly in protest at the administration's policy towards Haiti, and partly because they felt they had been asked as an afterthought. The conference, due to be addressed late yesterday by Mr Clinton, was billed by the White House as an attempt to refocus attention on issues such as sustainable development, responses to internal conflicts, support for democracy and human rights, and enhancing bilateral trade and investment ties. But the idea of an occasional gathering of the great and the good has drawn criticism as being no substitute for continuous attention to the continent's problems. 'It is the typical Clinton method: you get 150 of the brightest minds you can find into the same room, and come up with the lowest common denominator,' sniffed one Washington diplomat. And while Mr Mandela, in a videotaped message, called on the US to become 'the leading partner in the most novel and challenging project since the Marshall Plan', Mr Lake warned the US's willingness to get involved was constrained by lack of budget resources and by the US public's doubts about overseas intervention. Although Mr Lake acknowledged that genocide had taken place in Rwanda - a question on which the State Department has equivocated, to the outrage of human rights groups - he offered little prospect of future US action. With the end of the cold war and South Africa's transition to democracy, as well as the unhappy experience of humanitarian intervention in Somalia, the US has been pulling back from Africa. The Central Intelligence Agency, for example, plans to close 15 stations in Africa, which it says existed not to gather information about Africa but to monitor and recruit eastern bloc officials.

In a strongly-worded attack on the World Bank's latest report on the region, Oxfam said that bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to 'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty'. The charity, which is heavily involved in Africa, declared that adjustment programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets. 'Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures' had 'exposed potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from imports' Oxfam said in its statement. The British charity accused the bank of 'complacency' in the face of what it called Africa's 'deepening development crisis'. The charity also attacked the bank's classification in its report of Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as 'bordering on outright deception'. Zimbabwe's adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991, says Oxfam: 'Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or export growth'.

The stigma of doing business with South Africa will at last have been removed. Yet this signal, for which investors have waited years, risks being being undermined by a damaging dispute between the government and the ANC over cellular telephone licences. The issue has become so serious that Mr Mandela and President F W de Klerk this month held a meeting purely on this subject. The cabinet was yesterday preparing to authorise the issue of the two licences which on Tuesday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, warned would be reviewed and possibly revoked by a new government. Vodafone of the UK has a 35 per cent stake in Vodacom, one consortium expected to win a licence. The public utility Telkom has a 50 per cent stake and Rembrandt 15 per cent. The other consortium likely to be successful includes Cable  Wireless. The two winners will run competing services. Although the ANC says it is not opposed to cellular telephone networks, it has raised numerous objections to the way in which the government is issuing the licences. The ANC maintains the government is proceeding with 'unilateral restructuring' of the economy, that is trying to privatise the telecommunications network, and that the technology chosen is too expensive and unsuitable for South Africa. Within the government and the business community these reasons are widely dismissed as a fig-leaf for objections that are purely political  - that government money should no longer be spent without the ANC's agreement. There is also a more insidious suspicion that the ANC is trying to delay the issue of the licences in order to allow various US and Scandinavian companies to participate when sanctions in those countries are lifted. There have even been unsubstantiated suggestions that the ANC expects financial contributions from successful bidders. On the ideological level, the ANC believes cellular phones should be run by the state - and subsidised if need be - while the government sees them as a means of introducing competition into the telecommunications sector. It also sees a cellular network as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most South Africans access to a telephone. The message to foreign investors will be clear and unpalatable: the ANC remains an organisation that favours state over market, and South Africa remains a country where political interference can be expected in business decisions. If the government presses ahead with awarding licences, there must be some doubt as to whether those chosen will proceed while the security of their investment remains in doubt. Each licence is expected to involve the investment of about R1bn (Pounds 193m), with an estimated R700m of this coming from abroad. In South Africa telephone penetration (fixed phones per 100 people) is only 9.6 (about 2.4 in the black community; ten times that among whites). This compares to only 1.5 for the rest of Africa but to an average of about 50 for developed countries. The tender documents stressed that a criterion which would 'weigh heavily' was the extent to which the applicant was prepared to provide telephone services to the underdeveloped part of the community, almost certainly at subsidised tariffs. Vodacom's plans include introducing at least 22,000 subsidised card-operated community telephones to over 60 township and rural areas.

0,FT943-103 ,"FT943-103 _AN-EI3DUAF8FT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kenya to allow foreign bids in Firestone public share offer      By LESLIE CRAWFORD      NAIROBI   The Central Bank of Kenya is to allow foreign institutional investors to bid for shares in the public flotation of a Kenyan company for the first time in the history of the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). The owners of Firestone East Africa (1969), the only tyre manufacturer in Kenya, are offering 20 per cent of the company's shares for sale in the biggest initial public offering in Kenya to date. If the offer for sale is fully subscribed, it will raise Ks1.4bn (Dollars 27.9m) for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc of the US and Sameer Investments of Kenya, which own 19 per cent and 81 per cent of the local tyre manufacturer respectively. The offer has been priced at 10 times 1993 earnings, which is comparable with other manufacturing companies listed on the NSE. The Kenyan stock market is still officially closed to foreign participation regulations but Firestone East Africa obtained a special exemption due to the size of the share offer. 'We believe the government is using Firestone as a test case to assess the interest and the impact of overseas investors in our stock market,' said Mr Issa Timamy, group company secretary at Sameer Investments. With at least two local banks planning flotations before the end of the year, Mr Timamy believes the central bank will gradually relax the rules of foreign participation. The restrictions on foreign portfolio investment are virtually the last foreign exchange controls to remain following a year of steady deregulation. The Kenya shilling is fully convertible for all current account transactions. Exporters can retain proceeds in foreign currency and multinationals can remit profits and dividends. Nevertheless, the central bank is proceeding cautiously. Only 8m shares  - one-fifth of the offer - will be available to overseas bidders, who must be institutional investors. Underlying central bank concern is possible disruption caused by large flows of foreign funds on a small, illiquid stock market.

Sitting in the pulpit of Holman United Methodist Church on West Adams Boulevard  on Sunday, Tutu closed his eyes meditatively, and joined the choir in singing  ""Oh Freedom,"" an African-American spiritual heard often during the civil rights  movement of the 1960s:     ""And before I'd be a slave     I'd be buried in my grave     And go home to my Lord and be free.""     Tutu noted the links between the civil rights movement and the liberation  struggle in South Africa.    ""We thank you for the inspiration that we have received from your own civil  rights movement,"" he told the overflow crowd of more than 900 at the 11 a.m.  services. ""Thank you for Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you for those who were  his mentors such as James Lawson.""    Once an aide to King, Lawson, the church's pastor, was a key figure in the  civil rights movement. He is also Tutu's friend.    The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate had come to the church as part of a  10-day speaking and fund-raising tour in Southern California. While Tutu spoke  of the need to end apartheid, his message was also punctuated with his  characteristic humor.    ""When the missionaries came to our neck of the woods, we had the land and they  had the Bible,"" he said, describing the arrival of colonialism to the African  continent. ""They said, 'Let us pray,' and we foolishly closed our eyes. And  when we opened our eyes, we had the Bible and they had the land.""    The ebullient Tutu couldn't help laughing along with the congregation.    Despite his anecdote on colonialism, Tutu paid tribute to those who came to  Africa to build clinics and hospitals and to minister. The Bible, he said,  turned out to be an important tool for the oppressed people of South Africa.    ""If you wanted to oppress people, the last thing you should have made available  is the Bible because it is the most subversive -- the most revolutionary -- for  those who you would wish to be docile,"" he said.    ""You don't need a Marxist communist manifesto,"" he said. ""Nothing is more  radical (than the Bible). So we say thank you for bringing the Bible. We are  taking it seriously.""    Tutu likened black South Africans to people set free from bondage by God.    ""We are seeing our promised land in sight now,"" he said. ""We are seeing the  possibility of a new South Africa.""    He stretched out his arms, asking: ""When God is for us . . . "" -- here the  congregation joined in, reciting the Scripture with him -- ""who can be against  us?""

Outside, church members sold taped recordings of the archbishop's speech and  books on Southern Africa. Many at Sunday's services found a special message in  the sermon for African-Americans.

0,FT932-12217 ,"FT932-12217 _AN-DD2CUAEEFT 930429   FT  29 APR 93 / Leading Article: Diagnosing Africa's ills   WHEN OXFAM, one of Britain's leading aid agencies, warns that Africa's economic crisis has put the continent on a knife edge, the world should take note. From Ethiopia in the mid-1980s to Somalia in the 1990s, Oxfam and other non-government organisations have sounded alarm bells that have aroused public opinion and jolted western governments out of complacency or indifference. This time, says Oxfam, the continent, not just a country, is in jeopardy. If its fledgling democracies are to survive and fragile peace agreements are to hold, sub-Saharan Africa needs more help. Much of its external debt should be written off; aid flows must be increased; and structural adjustment programmes reformed, Oxfam argues in its recovery plan for the region. Oxfam's proposals would be enhanced by a more detached and comprehensive examination of the causes of Africa's crisis. It puts most of the blame on external villains: the IMF and the World Bank; the banks that lent money to Africa in the 1970s; western governments which spend too much on defence and too little on aid; industrialised nations which defend protectionist trade regimes. A markedly more cautious and inhibited approach characterises Oxfam's analysis of Africa's shortcomings, past and present. Zaire's Mobutu and Malawi's Banda are roundly and rightly condemned; but there is no appraisal, for example, of ex-president Julius Nyerere's disastrous pursuit of African socialism in Tanzania. Harmful omissions The report is right to note that the slump in world commodity prices has cost Africa dearly. But it overlooks the fact that domestic policy failures caused Africa's share of the market to fall. Western defence budgets may be too high; but Africa's own military spending is still excessive. These omissions undermine Oxfam's assertion that the structural adjustment policies urged on Africa by the World Bank and the IMF have not halted the continent's decline. Its analysis suggests that this 'failure' is almost entirely the fault of the doctor and has little to do with the behaviour of the patient. Yet in Nigeria and Kenya, World Bank-supported reforms have been undermined by vested interests and endemic corruption. Oxfam barely touches on Africa's compelling need to attract foreign investment. The rate of return on foreign investment dropped from around 30 per cent in the 1960s to 2.5 per cent in the 1980s. Today, Africa's share of global foreign direct investment is 0.6 per cent. Alarming symptoms Whatever the dispute about the cure, however, the symptoms of the disease are alarming. The external debt crisis is getting worse not better, while rescheduling has done little more than prolong the agony. Africa's debt was Dollars 56bn in 1980, 29 per cent of GNP. Twelve years later, further enervated by war and drought, it owes Dollars 180bn, over 100 per cent of annual gross national product. The IMF and the Bank are hard-pressed to find an African country where structural adjustment has led to a sustained recovery that has not been supported by continuing aid. Recovery is made all the more difficult by trade hurdles. The average tariff on cocoa beans, an important African export, is only 2.6 per cent, on chocolate nearly 12. Such tariff escalation reinforces Africa's dependence on primary commodities by discouraging investment in local processing. However serious the constraints imposed by an unfavourable external environment, there can be no excuse for the way that Oxfam underplays domestic shortcomings. This may have something to do with the fact that it has to live with the governments it criticises. But the report's inhibited treatment of Africa's faults suggests some members of Oxfam are still fighting under the banner of a discredited ideology, reluctant to surrender a vision that harks back to the heyday of African socialism. Oxfam weakens its own case. Its warning that Africa is in peril is timely. But to the extent that its assessment of structural adjustment is inadequate, the alternatives it proposes lose credibility. If Oxfam allows erring African governments to avoid shouldering their share of the blame for the continent's crisis, it does a disservice to Africa's citizens.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT934-7737 ,"FT934-7737 _AN-DKRC7AGRFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (13): A quantum leap - Johannesburg Stock Exchange      By PHILIP GAWITH   BACK in 1986 when sanctions began in earnest, the US sold and Europe bought. Now, at least as far as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is concerned, the positions are reversed. Europe is cautious, the US euphoric. Down on Diagonal Street, home of the JSE, brokers groan pleasurably at the stampede of US investors knocking on their door - a veritable Wall Street who's who. Of course, the US presence on the JSE has already been highly visible in 1993, being largely responsible for driving the bull markets in bonds and gold shares. But since ANC president Nelson Mandela called for the lifting of economic sanctions in September, interest has soared. Once limited to speculators, hedge funds and specialists, especially on the gold board, the heavy artillery is massing just over the brow. It will be some time yet before the debris of US state and municipal sanctions is finally cleared, and fund managers who are responsible to trustees will keep a watchful eye on political developments before making any significant decisions. The view on Diagonal Street, however, is that it is now a question of when, rather than if, funds flow. A broker comments: 'If you aggregate the figures we've heard, there'll be a lot of sheep trying to get through a very narrow gate.' One Hong Kong fund manager visitingJohannesburg said he was convinced investors would drive the price/earnings ratio of the JSE from 15 to 25, as they have with other emerging markets. As JSE-watchers point out, it is hardly a typical emerging market - more than 100 years old and with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 145bn (at the financial rand exchange rate of R4.30/Dollars 1), it is one of the 10 largest in the world. There are about 80 stocks with a market capitalisation of more than Dollars 200m, the cut-off point often used by international fund managers to identify stocks they are prepared to hold. Hence the preference among analysts for describing the JSE as a 're-emerging' market. Two caveats need to be entered about the bull scenario for the JSE. First, if the main international stock markets crack, the Dow Jones industrial index in particular, then the JSE is sure to follow. Second, South Africa must achieve a relatively stable political transition. Assuming these hurdles are cleared, then the case for the JSE is easily developed. US investors and fund managers are looking to invest an increasing portion of their assets outside the US to improve returns. Given the JSE accounts for about 0.9 per cent of total world stock market capitalisation, and most US fund managers hold little if any SA stock, it is reasonable to assume a flow of funds. Until recently, virtually no US analysts followed South African stocks. As they start to cover them, so funds are likely to follow. A recent study of 47 global emerging market funds (mostly UK and US) by the UK group Micropal shows that as at June 30, 1993, only 0.07 per cent of their Dollars 8bn assets were invested in South Africa. This process will gather impetus when Morgan Stanley develops a South Africa index for inclusion in its world index, and should the International Finance Corporation grant the JSE emerging market status. (SA stocks qualify because domestic per capita income is below the Dollars 7,910 cut-off). The case for the JSE is considerably hardened by fairly reliable talk of six to seven South (or southern) Africa country funds being established. Alliance Capital Management Corporation, one of the largest investment management funds in the US with about Dollars 110bn of funds under management, and backed by Merrill Lynch, has already lodged a prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch The Southern Africa Fund - a closed end investment company. These funds could easily raise Dollars 500m. Dollars 500m The chief concern about any large inflow of funds is whether the JSE, with its notoriously poor tradeability, can manage them. Latest JSE figures show annualised liquidity at about 7 per cent, but in recent years this has been closer to 4 per cent. Figures from Johannesburg brokers Ivor Jones, Roy  Co show the most liquid domestic industrial stock, SA Breweries, has a monthly turnover of only Dollars 12m. The most liquid stock, by a long margin, is De Beers, with a monthly turnover of about Dollars 57m. The main cause of the low liquidity is exchange control. South Africa's large institutional cash flows - about R40bn per annum, of which at least a quarter will make its way into equities - are forced to chase a small pool of domestic quality scrip. Understandably, the good stock they get they are inclined to hold. If strong buying pressures do materialise, then the upward trend of prices will help loosen stock. The yield-driven, short-term focus of some of the speculative funds already in the JSE will make it more volatile, and also boost liquidity. South African bonds will also attract attention. Real yields on long bonds of around 8 per cent for foreign investors compare favourably with the returns available in industrial countries. South Africa is a good risk not to default, the market is well organised and liquid, with more than Dollars 1bn daily trading volume common, the bonds offer prospective capital gains from the fall in inflation, and there is the possibility of currency gains from the appreciation of the financial rand. Investments on the JSE are done through the volatile financial rand, whose movements are capable of wiping out gains in the underlying investments. For investors coming into the bond market in particular, where volumes are quite large, they have to buy the currency before the bond. As one broker commented: 'The currency leg is the narrow gate, not the bond.' Political stability will help stabilise this market, but investors should treat it with caution.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICA: COMPARABLE EQUITY MARKETS*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                  Market             Turnover                             cap                (% of                  (USDollars bn)              mkt cap                                              traded)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong                   231                   23 South Africa                189                    4 Australia                   153                   19 Brazil                      144                   11 Mexico                      130                   15 Taiwan                      121                  155 Korea                       119                   91 Malaysia                    111                   36 Thailand                     62                   39 Singapore                    60                   38 Chile                        34                    3 Argentina                    27                   19 New Zealand                  18                   11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Markets ranked by market capitalisation, 1993 data Source: SG Warburg Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN TRADING ON THE JSE EQUITIES MARKET (Rm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993* Purchases      2,970    8,498   10,471    6,644    4,808    8,606 Sales          2,909    5,116    5,999    2,544    4,801    6,636 Net purchases     61    3,382    4,472    4,100        7    1,970  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Up to October 31 Source: Johannesburg Stock Exchange  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0," LA011889-0088   6914    January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition      Sports; Part 3; Page 11; Column 4; Sports Desk      453 words      TAC WILL HOLD ANOTHER MEETING ON SOUTH AFRICA      By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer      SAN JOSE      The third and last hearing for track and field athletes and coaches who  competed in a series of meets in South Africa last fall will be held here  today, with the participants facing indefinite suspensions.    A panel for The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and  field, may also decide the length of the suspensions for all the individuals  who participated. The length has yet to be specified.    Among the athletes requested to attend today's hearing are Carol Cady, the U.S.  record-holder in the discus; John Powell, bronze medalist in the discus at the  1976 and 1984 Olympics; Ruth Wysocki, a 1984 Olympian at 800 and 1,500 meters,  and James Robinson, the 1979 Pan American Games champion at 800 meters. The  case of Skip Robinson, track coach at Pasadena City College, also will be  heard.    In addition, two athletes who were suspended at the first hearing, in Chicago  Nov. 18, will have their cases heard today. Neither long jumper Tyrus Jefferson  nor pole vaulter Tom Hintnaus was able to attend the Chicago hearing.    Eleven athletes and coaches have been suspended indefinitely for participating  in the tour, which went to three South African cities last October. Track and  field athletes are prohibited from competing in South Africa because the  country is not a member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the  sport's world governing body. South Africa was suspended from the organization  in 1976 because of its official policy of racial separation.    According to Rich Nichols, a panel member, the case of Ted Banks, track coach  at Riverside City College, may also be heard. Banks' case was deferred from a  Dec. 15 hearing in Covina after a legal disagreement about TAC's jurisdiction  over a college coach.    Four athletes from Riverside competed on the tour, and Banks is under fire from  student groups at the school for his role as a tour organizer.    The fallout continues for Banks. This week, a prominent African athlete, under  pressure from his government, withdrew from Riverside City College. Julius  Kariuki of Kenya, the Olympic gold medalist in the steeplechase at Seoul, was  reportedly told that because of Banks' participation in the South African tour,  Kariuki could no longer compete for the school. Kariuki set several national  junior college records at Riverside last season.    Nichols said that if time permitted, the panel would set forth the specific  penalties for each participant. The sanctions are expected to vary according to  the extent of the individual's participation and his knowledge of the  ramifications of going to South Africa.

A panel for The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and  field, may also decide the length of the suspensions for all the individuals  who participated. The length has yet to be specified.    Among the athletes requested to attend today's hearing are Carol Cady, the U.S.  record-holder in the discus; John Powell, bronze medalist in the discus at the  1976 and 1984 Olympics; Ruth Wysocki, a 1984 Olympian at 800 and 1,500 meters,  and James Robinson, the 1979 Pan American Games champion at 800 meters. The  case of Skip Robinson, track coach at Pasadena City College, also will be  heard.    In addition, two athletes who were suspended at the first hearing, in Chicago  Nov. 18, will have their cases heard today. Neither long jumper Tyrus Jefferson  nor pole vaulter Tom Hintnaus was able to attend the Chicago hearing.    Eleven athletes and coaches have been suspended indefinitely for participating  in the tour, which went to three South African cities last October. Track and  field athletes are prohibited from competing in South Africa because the  country is not a member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the  sport's world governing body. South Africa was suspended from the organization  in 1976 because of its official policy of racial separation.    According to Rich Nichols, a panel member, the case of Ted Banks, track coach  at Riverside City College, may also be heard. Banks' case was deferred from a  Dec. 15 hearing in Covina after a legal disagreement about TAC's jurisdiction  over a college coach.

0,FT932-14415 ,"FT932-14415 _AN-DDSCSADTFT 930419   FT  19 APR 93 / Conspiracy fears mounton eve of Hani funeral: 15 are shot dead as tension rises in South Africa      By PATTI WALDMEIR   FIFTEEN people, including three children, were killed and 12 wounded in shootings in a black township near Johannesburg last night, as tension in South Africa rose on the eve of today's funeral of the assassinated activist Mr Chris Hani. Tens of thousands of grieving blacks yesterday paid their last respects to Mr Hani, whose body lay in state near Soweto. His funeral, one of the largest political events ever in South Africa, comes as evidence is emerging that his death may have been part of a right-wing conspiracy to destabilise democracy talks. In last night's shootings, black gunmen opened fire on people in the township of Sebokeng. Police said the shootings started when the men killed two people and stole their car, which was later found burnt out. A motive for the attacks was not known. The shootings heightened the atmosphere of emotion and turmoil as South Africa prepared for Mr Hani's funeral, to be held in the mainly white, working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot by a white assassin on April 10. Boksburg residents have been barricading their homes and putting up razor wire for fear of clashes between black mourners and local whites. A crowd of 30,000 gathered to honour Mr Hani as his body lay in an open casket at a soccer stadium outside Soweto. They sang songs in praise of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National Congress military wing. ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who once commanded Umkhonto in exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in military fatigues and surrounded by flowers. Police meanwhile interrogated a prominent right-wing white, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect in Mr Hani's assassination. Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council, part of the government's executive branch. He regularly made news headlines for racist comments, including an incident in 1989 when he commented 'what a pity' on hearing that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the runway at Johannesburg airport. His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy extending beyond the lunatic white fringe to the top of the right-wing establishment. The other suspect, Mr Janusz Walus, is a member of the ultra-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Political analysts say involvement of the Conservative party, which polled 800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, would be far more worrying than that of the AWB, a militarist organisation which has vowed to carry out a 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr Derby-Lewis, police held a second right-wing supporter, who shot two black protesters on Saturday. The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right. The resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the ruling National party, and the ultra-right has lost its image of inactivity.

WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO NOURISH AND ENCOURAGE IT.      By HERMAN J. COHEN, Herman J. Cohen is assistant secretary of state for African  affairs.      Although overshadowed by events in Eastern Europe, the political climate in  South Africa, too, is undergoing significant change. South Africans, black and  white, are shaking off old assumptions and rigidities and contemplating fresh  approaches to differences that seemed irreconcilable even a year ago. The  evolving process is still fragile and uncertain, but there is new hope on all  sides that it may yet prove possible to reach agreement on a peaceful  transition to a non-racial, democratic society in South Africa.    Last summer's meeting between then-President Pieter W. Botha and Nelson  Mandela, imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, was a signal of  the South African government's recognition that the country's future cannot be  settled unless there is dialogue with credible opposition leaders. Internal and  external pressures, among which sanctions are only one element, have helped  persuade South African leaders that the well-being of the white minority cannot  be sustained without a negotiated political settlement that results in  political equality for all South Africans.    Claiming a mandate for change after last fall's elections, President Frederik  W. de Klerk has taken a number of encouraging steps to get this process under  way. He has permitted peaceful anti-apartheid demonstrations and rallies, freed  leading political prisoners, announced plans to discard the Separate Amenities  Act, scaled down the state security apparatus and met with credible black  leaders, including Mandela. It is premature to predict whether these steps will  lead to a continuing dialogue, but they constitute tangible evidence that  things are changing, and they offer reason for hope.    The United States has long regarded dialogue among all South Africans as the  most important first step in the process of change. Moves that would further  enhance prospects for dialogue include: an end to violence on all sides; the  release of all political prisoners, including Mandela; the lifting of the state  of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity and freedom of  association for the black opposition, and the unbanning of all political  organizations, including the African National Congress.    U.S. policy toward South Africa is guided by five basic principles:     -- Unequivocal opposition to apartheid;     -- Commitment to building a post-apartheid democratic South Africa through  assistance to black South Africans;     -- Active U.S. diplomacy to resolve conflicts and support economic development  throughout southern Africa;     -- Cooperation with our allies and other concerned nations in a multilateral  approach to South Africa;     -- Maintenance of a bipartisan consensus with Congress on our general approach  to the region.    For its part, the anti-apartheid movement must look beyond the rhetoric of the  past to find creative ways of responding to the unexpected opportunities that  may now be arising. Anti-apartheid activists should work to achieve consensus  among diverse and often hostile opposition elements, and to formulate  constructive principles for the negotiating process that may be emerging. There  are signs that such an effort, with the support of the international community,  is already beginning.    The ANC has indicated that it is taking the possibility of dialogue seriously.  Its expressed preference for the path of negotiated and peaceful settlement was  endorsed in 1989 by the Organization of African Unity. The consensus  declaration adopted at the conclusion of the United Nations special session on  apartheid Dec. 14 not only urged the people of South Africa to join together to  negotiate an end to apartheid; it also postulated fundamental principles that  could constitute the basis for an internationally acceptable solution in South  Africa.    Clearly, a non-racial, democratic South Africa is not yet at hand. While their  overall numbers have diminished, political detainees, including Nelson Mandela,  are still in custody, the state of emergency remains in effect and  black-on-black violence has not abated. But there is a growing sense that the  majority of South Africans of all races may be ready to seize this opportunity  to break out of the isolation imposed by apartheid and rejoin the international  community of free nations.    The United States stands ready, through contact with all parties, to do  everything possible to promote this process. And we hope that negotiations and  peaceful change, as called for in the recent U.N. declaration, will become the  norm for the international community's approach to South Africa.

Castro made the remark as he boarded an airplane in Accra,  the capital of Ghana, after a 12-hour stopover en route to  Pretoria, where the first black president in South African  history will take office on 10 May.    ""I am very pleased to have stopped over in Ghana and to have  met with the Ghanaian people,"" said the Cuban leader, whom  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings welcomed last night at  Katoka Airport.    Concerning his meeting with Rawlings, a longtime friend,  Castro said he was very pleased, although the meeting was very  brief, because Rawlings was also traveling to South Africa.    Castro's trip to South Africa is an important, historic  event. Mandela was in jail just five years ago for trying to  eliminate the system of apartheid and when Cuban troops were  fighting in southern Angola against the South African Army.     "

In an emotional ceremony held just after dawn at the Ohlange High School in the black township of Inanda outside Durban, Mr Mandela repeated the eloquent words with which he addressed the court which in 1964 sentenced him to what were to be 27 years in prison: 'I have fought very firmly throughout my life against white domination and I have fought very firmly against black domination . . . I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all South Africans are equal and where all South Africans work together to bring about security, peace and democracy.' The stately Mr Mandela, dressed in a simple beige shirt buttoned tight at the neck and casual trousers, flashed his radiant smile for the cameras as he held his ballot poised above the polling box for several seconds before dropping it in with the cry, 'Going, going, gone.' Nonetheless, the grey-haired African National Congress leader appeared visibly strained by the three-month election campaign. Surrounded by at least 20 security guards, he looked tired and drained, and every bit his age. 'This is for all South Africans an unforgettable occasion. It is the realisation of the hopes and dreams we have cherished over the decades: the dream of a South Africa that represents all South Africans. It is the beginning of a new era,' he said afterwards. Speaking outside in the school yard, Mr Mandela repeated the message he stressed incessantly in the final days of campaigning. 'We are very concerned about minorities, especially about the white minority,' he said, adding in a radio interview only seconds after his vote: 'We would like the white community to realise that we cannot build this country without them. We are appealing to them to regard themselves as an essential part of the transition' to democracy. It was a good start towards the goal of a non-racial nation. There is a hard road ahead.

Mr Nelson Mandela, glowing with the energy that comes from victory, led the joyous high-stepping celebration of black South Africa's emancipation from apartheid. It began in the ballroom of a Johannesburg city hotel bedecked with bunting and balloons in the black, green and gold of the African National Congress. By mid-evening it had spread through the exuberant black townships. 'Free at last, free at last, thank God free at last,' declared South Africa's next president, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King. The famous phrase rang across South Africa and around the world as the 75-year-old Mr Mandela reached the final, triumphal summit of a journey that began when he was a young advocate, and has taken him via Robben Island's cells to leadership of his country. Mr Mandela's declaration of victory included graceful acceptance of departing President F. W. de Klerk's declaration of defeat but had a steely undertone of single-minded dedication to his goal. 'I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of love for all of you,' he said. 'Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I will be back at our desks, rolling up our sleeves to begin tackling the problems our country faces . . . let's get South Africa working. This means creating jobs, building houses, providing education and bringing peace and security for all.' Behind Mr Mandela the ranks of the ANC choir broke into song, the packed audience joined in and the dancing began. Mr Mandela's elbows sawed the air. The former boxer, moving like a cross between Mohammed Ali and Michael Jackson, led the dancing of a night to remember. From the stage came the resonant baritone of ex-president Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, whose country paid such a high price for its role as ANC headquarters and who was an honoured guest. On the dance floor the audience contained almost as many whites, coloureds and Indians as blacks. Groups in the hall began the toyi-toyi, the universal dance of black South Africa - knees raised high, a sort of dancing on the spot, once performed at the barricades of Soweto and black townships around the land but last night an exuberant celebration of the new South Africa.

0,FT941-11128 ,"FT941-11128 _AN-EBFAAAD9FT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Shelling out on growth - Partners faced with losing Pounds 1m find their fortune in the garden      By DAVID SPARK   When Derek Spice and Jane Hanckel moved to Afton Manor on the Isle of Wight in 1988, they needed to make money. They were in the process of losing more than Pounds 1m - Pounds 200,000 on their former home in Virginia Water, Pounds 500,000 at Lloyd's where Spice was a Name, and Pounds 500,000 in shares in a motor-accessories company from which he resigned when it went public in 1986. It went into liquidation in 1991. At Afton Manor they offered bed and breakfast, opened a camp site and imported a lorryload of cocoa shell as a mulch for their own and other gardens. B  B meant breakfasts at 7am, and campers kept turning up at any time, including weekends. This experience focused their minds: 'We decided that the business with the least aggro and most potential was cocoa shell,' said Hanckel. They called the shell Sunshine of Africa and it has proved a winner: it was made a 'best buy' in a Which? survey which compared it with garden mulches based on tree bark, and it was used last February in a BBC gardening programme. The partners expect to sell more than Pounds 1m-worth in their current year. The shells used are stripped from cocoa beans during the cocoa-making process. When applied to the garden, they preserve moisture in the soil and, when they break down, supply plant nutrients. Cocoa makers normally sell the shell ground up for cattle food but gardens need it to be as undamaged as possible. Unbroken shell takes up four times the volume and so needs more lorries to move it - and it can require cocoa factories to amend their manufacturing processes to avoid damage. Spice and Hanckel financed the business themselves by selling their Porsche and some life assurance policies. A picture of the Porsche hangs nostalgically in their office. The pair moved to the Isle of Wight because they liked the sense of community: 'People were here because they wanted to be here. We had been living near the M25 where, not surprisingly, we had the feeling people were just going round in circles,' said Spice. He had always used cocoa shell on his own garden, following the advice of his father, a former managing director of Gill and Duffus, commodity traders. After leaving Gill and Duffus, Spice's father had set up WG Spice and Co, a cocoa processor at Hook in Hampshire, and Spice worked there for a while. And so Spice initially went to Hook for cocoa shell supplies. In February 1989 he and Hanckel advertised their produce, offering a minimum of two 140-litre bags at Pounds 5 a bag and the Isle of Wight proved an ideal test market. Gardeners used it and then their neighbours wanted it too. Soon, Ventnor Botanic Gardens and the horticultural department at the island's college became customers. In a year, the partners sold 1,500 bags, five lorryloads. Articulated lorries visited Afton Manor and unloaded the shell on the tennis court where the gardener and two helpers shovelled it into sacks. The next step was to sell Sunshine of Africa through garden centres. They designed their own waterproof bags and a display stand, which helped Spice to persuade four garden centres to order 150 bags on his first day of selling. They soon had deals with garden centres in all the main urban areas and by March 1992 were advertising Sunshine of Africa nationally. One difficulty was to match sales to the supply of cocoa shell: garden centres like to place orders in September and take delivery and make payment the following spring. The company now takes out bank loans, secured against business assets, to help bridge this gap. Spice and Hanckel lost an important supplier when the WG Spice plant at Hook ceased production. A replacement supply was found when Nestle, the food and drink group, agreed to sell the shell from a new processing unit at York. The company expects to sell Pounds 1.6m-worth of cocoa shell in the year to July, against Pounds 650,000 in the last year, and aims for a net profit of between 10 and 12 per cent. Shell prices have risen but the volume of business makes up for smaller margins. The price in a garden centre is currently Pounds 9.99 to Pounds 12.50 for a 120-litre bag. It is also sold in three smaller sizes. Other companies now supply shell for British gardens but Spice and Hanckel were prepared for this, which is why they have sold Sunshine of Africa as a brand, not cocoa shell as a commodity. With 90 per cent of the market, they also expect interest from the bigger companies whose mulches were beaten into second place in the Which? survey. Their next plan is to offer licences and know-how to other countries: quite a big step for a product that was test-marketed in the gardens of the Isle of Wight.

The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette  Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice  requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until  May 17 1995.    Returned exiles who re-entered South Africa and whose names  appeared in three government notices published in May 1993 and  February and March 1994 will be covered in the proclamation.

A FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS THE LAWYERS BACKED  CLINICS THAT 'PROMOTE ABORTION.'      By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SANTA BARBARA      The public interest law firm that successfully challenged Gov. George  Deukmejian's decision to slash funding to the state's family planning clinics  now faces a cut in its own funding, a move that the law firm contends is  ""political retaliation.""    California Rural Legal Assistance recently received a letter from a federal  agency announcing that it intends to reduce the poverty law firm's funding by  up to $450,000. The federal Legal Services Corp. said CRLA violated a ban  prohibiting federally funded law firms from using public funds in abortion  cases. CRLA contends that the issue was about family planning, not abortion.    The federal cut would force layoffs of nine of CRLA's 54 attorneys unless other  sources of funding are found, said Jose Padilla, CRLA's director.    CRLA filed suit last year against the state to restore $24 million in family  planning funds that Deukmejian had slashed in a budget veto. The family  planning clinics provide health care to thousands of poor women, and the loss  of funding created a statewide controversy.    The case particularly rankled the governor because the suit, which was under  appeal, was successful in the lower courts. In January, Deukmejian, bowing to  pressure from fellow Republicans, put an end to what had been an embarrassing  political issue by allowing a $20-million family planning bill to become law  without his signature.    But CRLA did not have long to savor its victory. The next day, Legal Services  faxed CRLA a letter announcing that it was sending four officials from  Washington to begin an investigation into whether the law firm was involved in  abortion litigation. The agency gave CRLA one business day's notice to prepare  for the investigation, said Joel Diringer, a CRLA staff attorney who filed the  lawsuit against the state.    ""If they can't punish poor women, they're going to punish their  representatives,"" Diringer said. ""Because of our success in defeating one  Republican administration, another Republican administration is now  retaliating.""    Terrance Wear, president of Legal Services, said he intends to cut CRLA's  funding because family planning clinics, which the firm represented, ""promote  abortions.""    Diringer said the funding cut is harassment by ""right-wing ideologues."" He said  family planning clinics are prohibited by state law from providing or promoting  abortions. They simply discuss all options with pregnant women, including  adoption, keeping the baby and abortion, he said.    Legal Services is a private, nonprofit organization established by Congress in  1974 to provide legal help to low-income people. But former President Ronald  Reagan appointed a board of directors with a majority that was remarkably  hostile toward its own agency. In 1988, the board hired two outside law firms  to lobby Congress to cut its own budget. And the next year, the board paid a  former Reagan Administration lawyer to draft a memorandum that contended the  federal agency was unconstitutional.    Many in Congress were outraged that while Legal Services was cutting funding to  law firms that represented the poor, it was paying high-priced lawyers to  dismantle its own agency.    Reagan and many in his Administration frequently criticized poverty lawyers and  claimed that they used government funds to promote a liberal agenda. In seven  out of eight budgets, Reagan recommended no funding for Legal Services.    President Bush appointed an entirely new board in January, but Wear, a holdover  from the Reagan era, will not be stepping down until next month. Wear, a former  staff member on a committee headed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), said it was  his decision to propose the funding reduction for CRLA.    Wear said his actions are motivated by ""federal law,"" not ideology, and  proposed the funding cut because the firm ""ran afoul of the statutes on  abortion.""    Wear proposed cutting CRLA's budget by up to 9.95%. A 10% reduction, he  acknowledged, would entitle CRLA, under Legal Services bylaws, to a full  hearing before the agency's board of directors.    The poverty law firm's only recourse is to respond in writing to the charges in  Wear's letter. CRLA officials said they plan to request a full hearing anyway  -- before an independent hearing examiner -- but if they are refused, they will  file suit against the agency.    CRLA, which has 15 field offices throughout the state, receives 80% of its  funding from Legal Services.    CRLA and the National Health Law Program filed suit last year against the state  on behalf of four plaintiffs: the Economic Opportunity Commission of San Luis  Obispo, which sponsors a family planning clinic, two patients at the clinic and  Dr. Dan Lickness, who works there as a volunteer.    The suit alleged that the $24 million cut from the state's 500 clinics violated  state welfare law that provides for family planning services to all women who  request it.    Lickness, who is a member of two anti-abortion organizations and is ""personally  opposed to abortion on demand,"" said he would not work at a clinic that  promotes abortion. Family planning clinics, he said, prevent abortions by  preventing unwanted pregnancies.    The family planning clinics throughout the state provide an array of services  for poor women, including birth control services, Pap smears to detect cervical  cancer, breast exams and tests for sexually transmitted diseases and the AIDS  virus.    Janice Wolf, program supervisor for the San Luis Obispo family planning clinic,  said her clinic gives pregnant women a sheet of paper listing all their  options.

This disparaging ditty appears in Rhodesians Never Die, a fascinating and learned analysis of the tribe to which I belong, albeit as a renegade member. Strong of arm, certainly. At one stage Rhodesia had enough cricketers in English county sides to have made up a decent Test XI. Not so thick in head. Those who have made their intellectual mark abroad include the former editor of The Economist, a senior member of the British government, and a host of businessmen, writers and academics. Not bad for Surbiton in Africa. Nevertheless the ditty could well serve, broadly speaking, as the conclusion to a demolition of the myths and delusions which sustained white Rhodesia in the 1970s. Also revealed is the skullduggery and rivalry in the ranks of the security forces during the last days of white rule. The remarkable transition to peace and independence in 1980 was closer to disaster than most people realised. Much of the tribe is now scattered around the world, a harmless post-colonial diaspora. A contact magazine offers nostalgia, army memorabilia, and the news that Jock and Hazel, ex-Fort Victoria, offer a bed and beer to 'Rhodies' passing through Vancouver. Yet for nearly 15 years Jock and Hazel and their like defied the world. Never more than 275,000 of them, and outnumbered 15 to 1 by blacks, they were eventually ground down by sanctions and a guerrilla war. Over 20,000 people died - 468 white and 7,790 black civilians, 1,361 members of the security forces (just under half of them white) and 10,450 guerrillas. By comparison South Africa is getting off lightly. Apartheid's death toll over the past decade is under 10,000. On a deaths-to-population ratio, South Africa would have to endure 120,000 fatalities before reaching a settlement. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 brought out the best and the worst of white Rhodesia, caught up in the myth of a frontier society of pioneer stock which defended Christian values. Most were not Rhodesian-born; the majority were immigrants, as Godwin and Hancock point out. But they kept Morris Minors on the road, and Viscounts in the air, longer than anyone thought possible. They broke sanctions with ingenuity, and either manufactured what they formerly imported, or managed without. The dark side is that white Rhodesia tortured its enemies, executed jailed guerrillas in secret and lacked the decency to tell next-of-kin, and compulsorily regrouped thousands of peasant families in 'protected villages' which became urban slums. All this was known. Other truly terrible deeds have since been revealed. Ken Flower, Smith's intelligence chief, recruited a black church minister to supply poisoned clothing to youngsters who thought they were joining the guerrillas. Hundreds died a horrible death; Flower had the minister assassinated to avoid exposure, but recounts the tale in his autobiography. As Donal Lamont, the deported Catholic bishop observed, white Rhodesians became moral pygmies, and Godwin and Hancock put them under the microscope. It was Flower and his colleagues who helped cultivate civil war in neighbouring Mozambique, one of the African battlefields so vividly and intimately covered by Jeremy Harding in Small Wars, Small Mercies. Rhodesia helped arm and train Renamo, retaliation for Mozambique's support for guerrillas. Harding picks up the story from later on, when Flower's work had been taken over by South Africa. Mozambique became part of the front-line in the battle against apartheid, as did Angola, also on Harding's itinerary. If one takes their death tolls into account, the cost of ending white rule in Southern Africa is measured in the hundreds of thousands. His account is not a catalogue of despair, however. Whether in Eritrea or southern Africa he finds an extraordinary resilience, 'people contriving to live beyond the wars, or in spite of them.' Harding draws on his own expertise, but one of the merits of his book is that he lets Africans do most of the talking. Small wars, millions dead: who cares? For a while Washington did. Patient, skilful diplomacy by Chester Crocker, the US assistant secretary of state for Africa for much of the 1980s, extricated South Africa and Cuba from their entanglement in south-western Africa. With the vital help of Moscow, the process secured independence for Namibia and also paved the way to what should have been a lasting peace in Angola. Crocker moved on in 1988 and began writing what is an engrossing and invaluable handbook on diplomacy in southern Africa. The tragedy is that the book came too late to instruct his successors under President Bush. The lessons it contains have been ignored. Washington bears as much of the blame for the disaster in Angola today as the hapless United Nations monitors.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     USZ  United States of America.

Following a decline in GDP of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter and a rise of only 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, the latest figures mean that the final growth rate for 1994 is likely to be about 2 per cent, only slightly up on last year's 1.1 per cent. The announcement is a blow for the government, which earlier in the year had been forecasting growth of 3-4 per cent for 1994. However labour unrest and political uncertainty surrounding the country's April elections appear to have dented growth in the first half of the year. The news, which came as the administration presented the latest version of its centrepiece economic plan, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), to parliament, may also make it difficult for the administration to meet its revenue targets for the year. The White Paper on the RDP is predicated on a 3 per cent annual growth rate for South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0,FT934-8916 ,"FT934-8916 _AN-DKLCNAGNFT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Out of the continent of need - An African is to head the UN's food agency      By JOHN MADELEY   FOOD deficit countries in Africa can expect a higher priority following the election of Mr Jacques Diouf, a 55-year-old Senegalese diplomat, as the next director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Chosen on Monday by FAO's 168-member countries, Mr Diouf takes over at the start of 1994 for a six-year term. But he is taking a 'wait and see' attitude to reforms in the UN's largest and probably most bloated agency. With a mandate to help increase food output, and an annual budget of about Dollars 7m a year, the FAO employs 6,200 people, about half of them at its Rome headquarters. The candidate who ran Mr Diouf a close second in this week's election, Mr Geoff Miller of Australia, wanted to get many of the Rome staff out into the field. Mr Diouf appears to have no such plans. 'I don't want at this stage to say what I will cut and what I will not cut; this would be completely irresponsible,' he said after his election. His first action would be 'to make sure I have all the facts - facts concerning the operations, programme, management, financial aspects, scientific quality and governance. Once I have all these elements, then I will be able to know what I should do and if reforms are needed.' FAO's management under its present director general, Mr Edouard Saouma, has come under strong criticism for an alleged dictatorial style and this has led some countries to withhold their contributions in the last few years. Mr Diouf will be the first African to hold the post and believes that the significance of his election is that the continent with the 'greatest need for a solution to the agricultural problem is Africa'. Over the last 10 years, worldwide food production has increased by 24 per cent and population by 20 per cent, he pointed out, while 'in Africa production per capita went down by 5 per cent. We have to correct that.' With degrees in tropical economy and agricultural economics, Mr Diouf is a former executive-secretary of the West Africa Rice Development Association which is trying to increase rice output in the region. FAO has to face challenges of food production, equity and justice, he says. 'We have 780m who do not have adequate access to food, 190m below the age of five who have protein deficiency, and we expect by the year 2000 to have a 90m tonne cereal deficit in Africa and Asia. We have to get the organisational, financial and human resources to face those challenges.' He discounted the idea that land set aside for farming in North America and Europe should be used to grow food for the third world. 'My main concern will be to ensure that food deficit countries manage to produce enough for their own security - that is the priority.' Solutions to food problems do exist, he stressed: 'There are grounds for hope and many countries are successful; if we can take the example of successful countries we can move forward.' Promising to eradicate any corruption he found within the FAO, Mr Diouf said the 'most important thing about this organisation is its credibility'. Its funds come from member nations, he said, who want to be assured that they are well used. FAO's new chief is likely to be given a honeymoon period by western countries that contribute most of its funds. The United States plans to clear off Dollars 80m of arrears to the FAO by the end of 1995. The daunting task facing Mr Diouf is to improve the efficiency of a cumbersome organisation to enable it to make a more substantial contribution to overcoming food shortages.

Five  Frenchmen and a Beninese were injured in the Togolese capital  last night when a grenade thrown into a restaurant in the Be  district exploded. The six victims are not in danger of death  and the Togolese police have declined at this stage of their  inquiry to speculate on the reasons behind the attack. The  targeted restaurant belongs to a Frenchman and is known to be  mostly patronized by Europeans.    Politically, problems are piling up in the country. Edem  Kodjo, the prime minister appointed by General Eyadema and who  is still finding it difficult to convince his opposition allies  to join him, hinted yesterday that he may resign if his allies  continue to refuse to take part in the government he plans to  form. From Lome, Olabire da Cruz reports for Africa No.1:    [Begin da Cruz recording] The negotiations begun a week ago  between the two parties of the Togolese parliamentary majority  have actually been disrupted following Mr. Agboyibor's Action  Committee for Renewal [CAR]'s restatement of its decision not to  participate in any government to be formed by Mr. Kodjo, a  decision reiterated in a communique issued by the CAR yesterday  evening. The communique stated that at the 3 May meeting  between delegations of the two majority parties, the Togolese  Union for Democracy [UTD] made it clear that if the CAR  maintains its decision, the alternative would be for Mr. Kodjo  to resign. UTD officials do not deny that such a decision is  possible should the CAR drive its ally to the wall, but they add  that they have never maintained that that is the only stand to  adopt. They further explain that the question is whether the  CAR has gauged the consequences of its action and is prepared to  assume responsibility for them.    So, as I said earlier, the CAR has reiterated its decision  to  stay out of Mr. Kodjo's government. Is Mr. Kodjo prepared for a  coalition or an alliance with the former single ruling party,  the Rally of the Togolese People? The UTD executive's answer is  no. In this case, the only way out for Mr. Kodjo -- assuming he  does not resign -- would be to form a government based on the  civil society or on possible deserters from the erstwhile ally,  a situation already experienced by the former prime minister in  forming his last two governments.    In another development, five Frenchmen and a Beninese were  injured last night following the explosion of a grenade thrown  into a restaurant where they happened to be at about 2100. It  is not yet known who committed the act, or their reasons for  their doing so. The injured persons are not in danger of death.  [end recording]     "

Findings in the report -- United Way's Environmental Scan 1990 -- show that 75%  of all births in the county are to minorities, an increase that will make  whites a minority in metropolitan Los Angeles in about three years. The report  also projected a county population increase from the 8.7 million recorded in  the 1980 census to 9.9 million by the year 2000.    ""The United Way has to be more receptive to the changes in our community,"" said  Maurice J. DeWald, chairman of United Way's Strategic Planning Committee.    Members of the task force that wrote the report said the study will be  instrumental in shaping policies of the United Way, which raises more than $80  million annually for more than 350 health and social welfare agencies.    Among other things, they said, the findings will force United Way of Los  Angeles to improve fund-raising efforts among foreign-owned concerns and small  businesses. The report says 95% of all companies in the county have fewer than  50 employees.    Mark Pisano, chairman of the task force, said many foreign-owned companies do  not donate to United Way because ""giving isn't necessarily part of those  companies.""    ""The study is an effort to understand the economic and social forces so that,  as the United Way plans and does work, they'll have a basis on which to plan,""  said Pisano.    He said the growing ethnic diversity in the region offers many advantages but  could create several problems for both government and the local United Way, the  second-largest United Way branch in the nation.    ""We're a mosaic of people, and that's a strength,"" said Pisano, whose task  force -- made up of business, government and community leaders -- initiated the  study 18 months ago to formulate more effective relief and fund-raising  policies.    ""But that strength could become a weakness. The community could grow apart.  Diversity could become divisiveness.""    Glaring signs of division already are evident, the report found.    Figures in the study show that a declining need for low-skilled laborers now  threatens to permanently trap many of the county's 1.3 million poor in a cycle  of poverty and crime. ""It means you have a maldistribution of income,"" said  Pisano.    He also noted that ""it's more difficult for workers to climb up from  low-paying, low-skilled jobs. They cannot scale the corporate ladder.""    Such findings parallel a recent report by UCLA which also shows a widening gap  between the rich and the poor.    In addition, the United Way study found that:    * The city's population is aging slower than in many other cities because of  the predominantly young ethnic residents.    * Two out of five households countywide have incomes of less than $20,000 a  year.    * Nearly 40% of all single-parent households in the county live below the  poverty level.    * Dropout levels at county high schools are lowest among Asian and white  students.

On 15 May, THE  SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson  Mandela, who has just been elected president, will ""resign from  the post of president of South Africa within two years,"" and  that this would ""cause a power struggle within the African  National Congress."" The next morning, the BBC broadcast a  so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together  various pieces to claim that ""China has 10 million prisoners in  labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation."" When these rumors  came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully  by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign  Ministry.    On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report,  Mandela issued a statement which said ""that the article is  totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create  instability in the first democratically elected government."" On  17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to  point out that the allegations by the BBC were ""sheer  fabrications.""    It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies  one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander  South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark  side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see  advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under  British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast  off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon  a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable  development of the country; China, implementing the policy of  reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social  stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the  historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some  people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but  they have no alternative, and although they have tried something  which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis  trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful  means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors  in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the  countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to  interfere in their internal affairs.    The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are  ""objective and just"" in their reporting.

The police say the bomb, of  between 70 and 90 kilograms, had apparently been planted in or  under a car parked at the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh  Streets.    Neighboring buildings were extensively damaged and numerous  windows were blown out. After the explosion people scattered in  all directions.

Mr Piet Welgemoed, South Africa's transport minister, will today announce the approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals, yesterday. The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the companies but both will be run on a commercial basis. The government should be able to phase out its subsidies, said Price Waterhouse. The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles about 12m passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport. Eight other airports will also be affected, including those at Cape Town and Durban. South Africa is an increasingly popular destination for air traffic: over the past year, 25 airlines which had not previously offered flights to the country applied for access rights. Legislation will have to be passed before the proposal can proceed. 'This could happen by the spring of next year,' said Mr John Wright, who is head of regulation and competition services at Price Waterhouse. A regulation committee will be established by the South African government for the two companies, but will not have authority to intervene in the everyday running of their affairs. Airports and air services are currently run as part of a government department. Mr Wright said that the move was not a prelude to any privatisation. The proposals to run them on a more commercial basis have been drawn up since June 1991.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "

A report by the State Planning Commission says that under  the  program some 6,800 km of roads and 7,855 bridges have been  built, and 82,000 km of roads upgraded in nearly 10,000 villages  in 18 impoverished regions in Shanxi, Shaanxi and other  provinces.    The program also supplied pure water to 27.72 million people  and 18 million heads of cattle, and increased the area of  irrigated farmland by 2.23 million ha [hectares] and hydropower  generating capacity by 330,000 kw, the report says.    The program, called ""relief in exchange for work"", differs  from the traditional poverty-relief programs in that the help  does not come in form of money, but in form of material input by  the state or consumer goods in exchange for farmers' labor.    In this way, the report says, the government can save the  cash it badly needs for construction while overstocked  industrial products can find consumers.    Since 1984 the Chinese Government has put into the program  20  billion yuan-worth of grain, textiles, consumer electric  products and household hardware. In return, farmers have put in  hundreds of millions of labor/days.    The report says the program marks a change in the  government's policy. Rather than providing aids in cash, the  new policy aims to improve the infrastructure of the  impoverished regions and implant the possibility of  self-development.    In Guizhou Province in southwest China the past few years  have witnessed the building of 7,200 km of roads and 525 bridges  under the program. The report says Guizhou is the greatest  benefiter of the program.    The province also gets one fifth of the one million tons of  grain provided annually by the government to the ethnic-minority  areas in the central and western parts of China. The grain is  used to pay farmers working to make new terraced farmlands or to  upgrade hilly land.    The report says some 76,000 ha of high-yield farmland has  been created in the province over the past two years. It  predicts that by the end of the century the province, now  suffering from a serious grain shortage, will be able to produce  enough grain to feed itself.    Since 1991, when massive floods caused tremendous losses to  east China, the government has launched a program to repair and  build water-conservancy projects on seven rivers and five lakes  in the region.    The projects, involving 10 billion yuan-worth of industrial  products in exchange for farmers' labor, will be completed by  1995.    The report says that the construction materials and tools  are  usually provided by local governments.    The report says China's poverty-relief program is highly  appreciated by international organizations including the World  Bank, which depicts the program in a report as good way to  create job opportunities in impoverished areas and to build  rural infrastructure facilities.    The report disclosed that, starting this year, the  government  will launch a new program codenamed the ""87 Poverty Relief  Project"", so-called as it will strive to pull 80 million people  from the poverty line over seven years. The project will  require the input of two billion yuan-worth of industrial  products a year.     "

Raising funds, however, may prove to be easier than putting them to efficient use, and if aid is seen as a substitute for investment the net benefit may prove marginal. If pledges are taken at their face value, South Africa can expect up to R10bn over the next five years, from a variety of bilateral and multilateral donors. Leading the field is Japan, which earlier this month unveiled what it called its largest aid package to a single country - Dollars 1.3bn over two years. Mr Katsumi Sezaki, Japan's ambassador to South Africa, said that almost all the aid was untied, bar a Dollars 100m export-import credit facility aimed at promoting trade between the two countries. But a further Dollars 400m worth of export-import bank loans were untied, he said. Of the balance, Dollars 250m would be in the form of soft loans - seven years' grace and a 25-year repayment period at 3 per cent interest. A further Dollars 500m in the package represented the amount of private investment and commercial credits the Japanese government was prepared to guarantee. Next on the list is the US which has offered R2bn over three years, while a host of other bilateral donors have chipped in including Australia (R700m over three years), the European Union is offering over R400m; the UK will provide R560m over three years. Meanwhile the African Development Bank says it can release between R720m and R1,200m of project-linked finance over five years. Past experience in Africa has shown that aid has mixed results and even allowing for South Africa's considerable pool of skills, handling resources on this scale will not be easy. The amount on offer, however, may not be as much as it seems. As is so often the case, assessing what may be termed the 'real money' - that is assistance that is readily available and which can be rapidly disbursed - is not straightforward. Although trade cover and investment guarantees can be put to good use, including them in the category of 'aid' can give a misleading impression of what is available for conventional aid projects - health, housing, education, and so on. Development packages almost invariably include aid tied to purchases from the donor country, which can prove expensive. A recent study by a British development charity calculated that the resulting lack of competition can add anything from 10 to 15 per cent to the price of the items ordered from the donor country. Another way of boosting bilateral aid figures in press releases is to include the contributions made by western governments to multilateral lending institutions, United Nations agencies, or money that would be channeled through European Union aid schemes. A further device used by some donors is to include estimates of the benefits for South African exporters from introducing favourable tariff changes made in the wake of President Mandela's inauguration. Given the competition between donors as to who will appear the most generous  -which in turn may influence the South African government when it comes to allocating contracts for state-backed or funded projects - the donors themselves are often reluctant to make clear the precise benefits and terms of their offers. In short, the arithmetic of aid is complex and South Africa, unused to being a recipient, may sometimes be too inclined to take promises at face value. Significantly, the World Bank, potentially South Africa's largest multilateral donor, is reluctant to put a figure to planned lending, although some officials have suggested a figure of about Dollars 1bn a year in the initial phase. Mr Isaac Sam, the Bank's resident representative in South Africa, says that foreign aid is 'rather crucial' in South Africa's development. What is more, fund raising 'has to be done fairly rapidly' in order to take advantage of the goodwill South Africa presently enjoys. But Mr Sam cautions that aid alone cannot deliver the economic growth that the country needs. While the Bank plans to provide substantial aid, foreign and domestic investment are the keys to post-apartheid growth: 'The real resources for South Africa are in the international capital market, not donors', says Mr Sam.

A successful deal could pave the way for a spate of financings by South Africa's underborrowed corporate sector; a flop could turn off the tap of international investment before the flow has really started. The deal, for the country's fourth largest company, was approved at cabinet level as a suitable trail-blazer for the return of corporate South Africa to the international capital markets following the first non-racial elections in May. In fact, Robert Fleming, which won the mandate to arrange the offering, did not offer the cheapest terms to the company. But the generous indicated pricing of a 6 to 6 1/2 per cent coupon and a 10 to 12 per cent cent conversion premium for 10-year bonds, non-callable for at least the first five years, was felt to be necessary to attract a broad range of foreign investors. First of all, bearish global market conditions have made international fund managers much more choosy. (In fact, Robert Fleming has indicated that the pricing can be adjusted if the current weakness in world markets worsens.) In addition, South African companies are a little known quantity. The company is doing its best to address this problem, fielding a visit from underwriters and fund managers to Johannesburg last week and hosting a series of roadshows in Asia, Europe and the US this week, when the book-building process begins. In practice, the decision on whether to buy the deal will for many investors be a decision on South Africa. The fiscal discipline of the new government's first budget, presented to parliament by finance minister Mr Derek Keys last week, encouraged investors and the imminent inclusion of the country in the IFC global emerging market index, at 13 per cent, is set to boost interest in South African shares generally. 'Liberty Life is a good proxy for South Africa, and the convertible structure gives it a defensive quality which appeals to more conservative investors,' said one fund manager on last week's trip. For investors viewing the company as proxy, there are several attractive features: its broad range of interests, such as brewing and property, mean that it stands to benefit from domestic economic growth. However, the deal also has a keep-well agreement which gives investors concerned about political risk the added security of Liberty's UK assets, which include Sun Life. Further, the large size of the transaction, which has made some underwriters nervous, is an added incentive for some investors. The South African stock market, with average daily volume this year of Dollars 63m, is not very liquid, and some investors expect the convertible bonds to be easier to trade than the stock. Some fund managers will not be able to buy the bonds even if they want to, because they are not rated. (South Africa itself has yet to be rated.) Further, in the US, where sanctions on South Africa were strongly enforced, some fund managers have not yet received approval to start re-investing. However, the reception of two straight equity offerings for South African companies following May's elections bodes well. A Dollars 67m offering for industrial and mining giant Anglovaal, priced late Thursday at Dollars 27.33, was 2.7 times oversubscribed, according to arranger SG Warburg, with just over half the demand from the US. Meanwhile, a Dollars 70m offering for retailer Pepkor is due to be priced this week.   Companies:-  Liberty Life Association of Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

True to form as South Africa's most powerful province, the PWV and its leaders have made the biggest splash so far on the provincial scene. Hardly a day passes but Mr Sexwale, or Miss Jessie Duarte, his diminutive police minister, visit a black township to urge residents to co-operate with police, or drop in on a migrant workers' hostel to try to foster peace. Mr Sexwale's performance as premier will be judged largely by how well he implements the reconstruction and development programme. And here, conflicts are already looming. In his inaugural speech to the new legislature, Mr Sexwale promised to build 150,000 houses in the province over the next year - compared with only 30,000 homes built throughout South Africa last year. He is understood to have plans for a grand R4bn house-building project involving massive private and public sector finance. The plan has already caused friction with Mr Joe Slovo, national housing minister, but Mr Slovo appears to have been powerless to prevent it. Mr Sexwale's youthful and inexperienced cabinet - which includes a finance minister who is regional general secretary of the South African Communist party and other noted radicals - certainly does not lack energy. Only time will tell whether it lacks the circumspection necessary to avoid grand and costly development failures.  ----------------------------------------------------- PWV Key Facts  ----------------------------------------------------- Area: 18,700 sq km Population: 6.8m Population growth: 1.3% Literacy: 69% Labour force employed: 54% Contribution to national gross domestic product: 37% Life expectancy: 66 years  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Development Bank of Southern Africa  -----------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, told a news conference yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Pounds 180m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. However South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future.

AFRICAN MOVES TO END SANCTIONS      By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The Bush Administration anticipates that South Africa will comply with the  standards set by Congress for lifting U.S. economic sanctions by the end of  this year, according to a senior U.S. official.    The official, who talked to a small group of reporters Wednesday on the  understanding that he would not be identified by name, said it now seems clear  that sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations played a role in  the decision by South African President Frederik W. de Klerk last week to lift  many restrictions on several long-banned black and anti-apartheid  organizations.    The sanctions were enacted by Congress over the veto of President Ronald Reagan  in 1986. At the time, Administration officials said they thought the sanctions  would be counterproductive, diminishing U.S. influence in Pretoria without  producing any change in the policy of the white minority-led government.    But the Bush Administration official said De Klerk decided to seek greater  cooperation with the black majority because he became convinced that the South  African economy could prosper only with cooperation between the races.    ""This realization has been pushed along by international pressure, including  American pressure,"" the official said.    Under the terms of the sanctions law, the President may lift the sanctions if  South Africa releases all political prisoners and takes any three of these  steps:    * Repeals the state of emergency.    * Ends the ban on political groups, such as the African National Congress.    * Repeals the Group Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation.    * Agrees to enter good faith negotiations with ""truly representative members of  the black community.""    The official said that De Klerk has complied with two of the standards --  repeal of the ban on political groups and agreement to negotiate. He said he  expects South Africa to move soon, certainly by the end of the year, to free  all political prisoners and end the state of emergency. He said the government  has said it will go slower in repealing the Group Areas Act.    Until the sanctions can be legally lifted, the official said, Washington hopes  to show its support for De Klerk's reforms by increasing high-level diplomatic  contacts. He said De Klerk has already been invited to visit the United States,  although no dates have been set. And he said that a top Administration  official, possibly Secretary of State James A.

'The menace of widespread suffering and death which hangs over southern Africa is no abstract issue, no idle concept,' the United Nations under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, Mr Jan Eliasson, told the opening session of a two-day aid conference. The UN and southern African nations, excluding South Africa, organised the conference to gather responses to a joint appeal they made last week for Dollars 835m (Pounds 464m) for one of the region's worst droughts. Pledges announced yesterday were difficult to sort out since some of the figures included already scheduled aid, but it appeared more than half the appeal had been met. The US announced it was giving Dollars 382m in drought relief on top of normal development assistance of about Dollars 275m. The European Community announced it was giving Dollars 276m in food aid, about half of which was in addition to normal aid.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

It  has also established a whole body of corresponding control  mechanisms. Since 1989, the total birth rate of childbearing age  women in Chengde Prefecture has been consistently maintained at  below 1.63, and the planned parenthood rate has been maintained  at better than 98 percent. In 1992, the peak year of the third  birth peak, the birthrate for the entire prefecture was only  11.72 per 1,000, and the natural rate of population increase was  only 6.29 per 1,000. Chengde Prefecture's planned parenthood  achievements have attracted attention, and the Chengde  population control model has also attracted the interest of  government departments and academicians concerned. It was  against this background that 90th form classmates from the  Chinese People's University Demographics Department went to  Chengde Prefecture to conduct an on-site social survey for the  purpose of more fully critiquing Chengde's population control  model. The following analytical report has been written on the  basis of a collation and analysis of the survey data. [passage  omitted]    1. Analysis of Parenthood Desires    During this survey, we canvassed the parenthood desires of  childbearing age married women in Chengde Prefecture. Analysis  shows that even in the absence of the limitations of planned  parenthood policy, 16.3 percent of those surveyed felt that a  single child was enough; 68.7 percent felt two children were  enough; and 12.8 percent felt three or more children were  better. Another 2.2 percent had no opinion. Clearly, the desire  for a single child was greater than for multiple births [as  published]. This shows that even in the absence of the  limitations of planned parenthood policy, 85 percent of the  people's parenthood desires were consistent with the prevailing  parenthood policy. Actually, it also tells us that the  prevailing planned parenthood policy really restricts the  parenthood desires of only approximately 13 percent of the  people. As society and the economy develop, and with the  intensification of planned parenthood propaganda, the  coerciveness of the prevailing policy is no longer its main  function. The parenthood requirements of the prevailing policy  have become the codification of people's behavior. This change  in parenthood desires shows that planned parenthood propaganda  work in Chengde prefecture has truly wrought outstanding results.    The reasons given in the survey for the number of children  desired show that 43.6 percent of those surveyed who want only a  single child feel that many children mean heavy burdens and high  expenses in rearing them; 35.6 percent feel that they cannot  afford to rear many children; and 33.7 percent feel that they  can do a better job of rearing fewer children. Among those  surveyed who want two children, 59.1 percent gave as their  reasons the economic one that ""many children mean heavy  burdens""; 35 percent felt that ""one is two few, three are too  many, but two are just right."" Those wanting only one or two  children accounted for 85 percent of the total population  surveyed. Those giving economic reasons for fewer children were  in the majority. This shows that they have already begun to  think seriously about the effects of childbearing on family  economic life and their own development. In addition, despite  the decrease in the number of people giving ""continuation of the  family line by producing a male heir"" as their childbearing  goal; nevertheless, 49 percent wanted to have three children.    Results of the above analysis show that although traditional  agriculture holds a dominant position in Chengde prefecture, and  although peasant income remains very low, the phenomenon of the  poorer the more children has not appeared here. During the  course of the survey, we had a marked sense that childbearing  ideas today have basically changed from having many children to  having fewer but better cared for children. Below, we will try  to analyze the influences that have changed the parenthood ideas  of the local populace.    Atmosphere Surrounding Population Control in Chengde    The change in the public outlook on having children is  attributable to the understanding of the importance of planned  parenthood work at every local government level. A distinctive  atmosphere about population control exists in Chengde  Prefecture. We will try to analyze it below in the following  several regards.    1. Leaders' close attention to ideology. Close attention to  ideology is an intangible part of planned parenthood work. Only  when sufficiently close ideological attention is paid to planned  parenthood work can cadres at all levels devote themselves to  doing real deeds in planned parenthood work. Chengde  prefecture's planned parenthood cadres diligently carried out  the regulations pertaining to planned parenthood, setting up  multi-purpose education schools to provide training and study.  Party and government leaders at all levels personally took  command to ensure good planned parenthood performance. They also  established a planned parenthood day for the specific purpose of  hearing reports, and for the prompt discovery and solving of  problems. Government units at all levels gave first place to  planned parenthood work. They gave priority to ensuring that  funds and other material needs of planned parenthood work were  provided, and they did all possible to provide conditions  favorable to the conduct of planned parenthood work.  Consequently, cadres were able to devote themselves to the work  at hand without concern for extraneous matters. Administrative  cadres in the prefecture frequently went into the countryside to  check on the work of selected units and to listen to the views  and complaints of grassroots level cadres and the public. They  prescribed remedies as needed for timely solution to problems.  Leading cadres at all levels showed deep affection for planned  parenthood cadres and held them in high esteem. They provided  them great respect and support. This stirred the initiative and  the zeal of the planned parenthood cadres, stimulating them to  clarify their personal responsibilities. It also made the public  feel that the government was serious about planned parenthood  work.    A survey of grassroots level planned parenthood cadres found  that 10.5 percent of them felt that the motivation for their  work came from the support that leaders provided. The public  also said that this prefecture took firm action on planned  parenthood work; 77.7 percent of the public saying that cadres  visited them regularly. Clearly the cadres were concentrating on  their work.    2. Scientific population control methods. The planned  parenthood control organizations and various systems in being in  Chengde prefecture provided the indispensable prerequisites for  planned parenthood work. They emphasized propaganda first,  providing the services required, and ""working along many lines  at the same time."" Consequently, all aspects of planned  parenthood work were performed level by level.    Standardization, systematization, and legislation are  prerequisites for smooth conduct of planned parenthood work.  All the areas we surveyed practiced a two-track leadership  system (CPC committees directing CPC branches, CPC branches  directing party members, and party members maintaining contact  with individual households; government directing village  committees, village committees directing the heads of key  households, and the heads of key households maintaining contact  with childbearing age women). It also practiced a four lines and  one point control system (the ""four lines"" being the government  administration line, the party administration line, the planned  parenthood cadre line, and the association line; and the ""one  point"" being childbearing age women). They established  level-by-level control in which forces were concentrated and  responsibilities spelled out, and they also instituted complete  contract system control. Clear regulations were provided on  marriage, childbearing, and the floating population, and these  regulations had to be followed. A system was instituted for  childbearing age women of a family visit once every 20 days,  filing of a report every 30 days, a pregnancy inspection once  every two months, a ring insertion once every three months, and  a general check once every six months. Specific punishments were  prescribed for violations of regulations, and these were linked  to economic returns.    3. Propaganda and education that truly influences people.  This is closely linked to the hard work of the grassroots  planned parenthood cadres who go from door-to-door to work with  childbearing age women, providing publicity and briefings about  pertinent information. It is only because of this work that the  survey results showed that it was through the propagandizing of  planned parenthood cadres that 97.1 percent of people learned  about the planned parenthood policy. We also found the same  thing from a number of people surveyed who did not have much  education, but who were rather well acquainted with the planned  parenthood policy.    The main approach to planned parenthood in the prefecture  surveyed was to ""use poverty to cure poverty, the main sense of  which was to use poverty as a means of convincing the public  about planned parenthood. Every county and town emphasized  investment in propaganda equipment. The survey found  eye-catching slogans everywhere one looked in Chengde  Prefecture. Everytime the public address system sounded in each  village, everyone thought that a planned parenthood announcement  was to be made. Propaganda teams roamed the villages showing  movies and video cassettes that publicized the basics of planned  parenthood and popularized basic knowledge. They used plain and  easy to understand slogans like ""if mountain region people want  to get rich, they should have fewer children and plant more  trees,"" which linked poverty to realities so that the peasants  themselves could grasp the connotations of planned parenthood.    Survey results showed that 59.6 percent of the public had  learned about planned parenthood from meetings and the  organization of study, 31.0 percent learned about it from news  media (radio broadcasts, television, and posters, 13.7 percent  had learned about it from the above two means, 7.0 percent  learned through events around them and their own experiences,  and 2.9 percent learned about it from all of the above.    The survey found that cadres believed they devoted 64.9  percent of their time to childbearing age women; 24.6 percent  felt they devoted their time to both husbands and wives, 3.5  percent spent their time on husbands and old people in the  household, and 7.0 percent spent their time with all members of  the family.    The above statistics show the difficulty of planned  parenthood work, but one heartening matter is that the gains are  equal to the effort made. Planned parenthood work has truly  produced results. Virtually everyone has heard propaganda about  the planned parenthood policy, and they understand planned  parenthood work. As a public opinion tool, propaganda has  played a mouthpiece role. Once the public understands this  propaganda and internalizes it, very good results can be  obtained. Once planned parenthood takes root in people's minds,  the change in outlook on parenthood is not difficult to  understand.    4. The effective work of cadres. The survey found cadres  engaged in planned parenthood work to be conscientious,  hardworking, highly responsible, and having a rather high  professional caliber. Cooperation with them made us feel that  the achievements made in planned parenthood work in Chengde  prefecture are attributable to the high caliber of the planned  parenthood corps. It is their hard work at the grassroots level  that has translated scientific control methods into reality, and  won outstanding results.    This survey of planned parenthood cadres shows 97 percent of  them to be between 20 and 49 years of age; 72 percent of them  have a junior middle school education or higher; and 28 percent  have a primary school education. They also expressed delight  about doing planned parenthood work.    Although planned parenthood cadre pay is low (better than  the  pay of nonplanned parenthood cadres, but affected by the level  of overall economic development, and thus still fairly low), and  though annual bonuses amount to only between 100 and 200 yuan,  and cadres bear planned parenthood contract risks; nevertheless,  the survey showed that despite the lack of inducements and care,  100 percent of them still want to do planned parenthood work.  Eighty percent of planned parenthood cadres said that their work  motivation stems from a personal sense of responsibility and the  country's need; 10.5 percent said it came from the support that  leaders provide; and 3.5 percent said it came from the power the  job conferred. (In the statistical tabulation, the three answers  of national need, sense of responsibility, and benefit to the  public overlapped). The family members of all planned parenthood  cadres understood and support their relatives involvement in  this sacred and arduous work.    The above survey results show a large cadre corps in the  prime of life, having a high educational level (for the local  area) a sense of responsibility, that takes the initiative in  work, that is ideologically well-prepared, and that has strong  backing.    The survey results show that 56.3 percent of the public  feels  that relations between the cadres and the public are very close,  39.3 percent feel that relationships are all right or ordinary,  and only 3.4 percent feel that relations are not good. This  shows that the planned parenthood corps here has gained the  respect and support of the public. The cadres may say proudly to  everyone: ""I do planned parenthood work.""    5. Natural conditions and other. Chengde Prefecture is a  mountainous prefecture of old, young, and poor people. One  senses the warmth and honesty of the public here from their  attitude in the public survey. If one presents the facts and  reasons things out, they readily accept, displaying a very high  ideological awareness.    The peasants in this area have lived in poverty for a long  time. Their desire for and interest in escaping from poverty is  extremely urgent. One can see from their hopes for their  children that 95 percent of the peasants feel rural income is  low and their social position is low. They urgently desire to  change their own miserable fate. The people hope to be able to  escape from poverty by having fewer children but rearing them  well and by concentrating their energies. Thus, the lightening  of family burdens is bound to be on their daily agenda of  important things to do. Consequently, propaganda about using  poverty to cure poverty, decreasing childbearing, and improving  the economy strikes a very responsive chord with the public. A  market and a climate for this propaganda exists.    Eighty-five percent of the public realize from their own  personal experiences and reality of numerous children around  them, heavy burdens, and many years of hardship that having many  children holds back one's own development. They know that the  lightening of the burden of rearing children, and saving  opportunity costs has a very great influence on young husbands  and wives.    This study found that 77.6 percent of the families in this  prefecture are of the nuclear type, 20.3 percent are directly  related families, and only 2.1 percent are joint families.  Family parents who are in good health generally do not live with  their sons and daughters but rather depend on the income that  their own labor provides to live alone, unless one parent is  dead and the other is feeble and thus has no choice but to live  with the children. Children's main economic obligations to their  parents are: to help the old ones by doing some farm work during  the busy season, being responsible for some medical expenses,  and being responsible for the old one's funeral expenses. There  is little difference whether one has reared a son or a daughter.  Social advances have improved the status of children, but the  value of children to a family has declined greatly. The peasants  are personally aware of the too high cost of rearing children;  consequently, their feelings about expecting the children to  look after them in their old age are not pressing. Only 2.8  percent of the peasants wanted to rear children as a defense  against old age, while 10.2 percent wanted to raise fewer  children well. Another 4.2 percent linked their personal welfare  and the state's welfare out of consideration for the needs of  the country. Better rearing of a smaller number of children has  increasingly become a trend in rural childbearing behavior.    The elderly bear historical witness to the changes in local  social life. The rich experience of the aged provide us data for  a comparison of changes in the past and present standard of  living. A survey of the elderly shows that 77.5 percent feel  that the present standard of living has risen greatly, and 19.6  percent feel it has improved and is more affluent that formerly.  At the same time, in the process of understanding the substance  of planned parenthood, 47.6 percent of the public obtained  information through the media (radio broadcasts and television).  This also shows that durable consumer goods such as television  sets have entered peasant families. This shows that the rural  standard of living has improved generally enabling the peasants  to advance to improve their living standards. Seeing the clash  of urban cultural and urban ways of life and value concepts,  people have begun to wise up. They have begun to open their eyes  and look at the world with the result that their thinking has  changed. The huge difference between the development of cities  and the poverty of this area has made the urban cultural impact  more poignant. The peasants have begun to be dissatisfied with a  subsistence standard of living. They hope to get out from under  the limitations of their miserable peasant status. They want to  throw down their ""mud rice bowls"" and stride with a brand new  outlook toward a truly cultured life.    A survey of future expectations for their children shows  that  95 percent of peasants feel that ""so long as they do not farm,  it will be all right."" Of these, 53.8 percent hoped that their  children would go to college. The peasants know that lack of  education hampers them. They hope that their children will be  able to escape from farming, that they will have high income and  a corresponding status, and that they will become the cultured  persons that they now envy.    Although the survey showed that 12.8 percent wanted to have  many children, even they expressed approval of the prevailing  planned parenthood policy. Granted that many of them were  deterred by the strict systematic control and severe penalties,  they also revealed awareness of the rural contradiction between  a large population and little land, and worried about their own  ability to provide support. At the same time, among those  supporting the policy, most had a psychology of vying with each  other and going along with the flow, a psychology of ""fish must  swim, birds must fly and people must breathe till they finally  die,"" and a psychology of whatever others may do, they will make  no criticism. Understanding and guiding the direction of the  main stream is extremely crucial in planned parenthood work, but  one cannot neglect to apply the spur in time to those who go  along with the flow.

His audience of government officials, academics and industry  representatives murmured assent, but could have spent hours  disagreeing with each other over what the statement meant. It  might have been possible to thrash out an agreed definition of  ""Achilles heel""; ""social policy"" would have presented greater  difficulties.    Their confusion is partly understandable. European Union  [EU] social policy has traditionally been dominated by  employment-related issues. Alongside these, however, a clutch  of policies concerned with the poor -- or, in the EU's preferred  term, the ""socially excluded"" -- has grown in significance.  Anti-poverty organisations are increasingly looking to Europe  for initiatives to attack deprivation. But they fear that EU  involvement in this area of social policy is about to collapse.    Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is  currently sifting through hundreds of responses to a green paper  on options for the future of social policy, before presenting  final proposals to the Commission in a white paper next month.  The green paper sounded powerful warnings about the dangers of  excluding large sections of Europe's population from a  reasonable share of wealth and opportunities. Violence, drug  abuse, racism, political extremism and social unrest were, it  said, all likely to result.    Mr Flynn made it clear last week, however, that against a  background of high unemployment, job creation would ""dominate  the whole agenda"" arising from his white paper. He emphasised  his opposition to the emergence of a ""dual society"" of  advantaged and disadvantaged in Europe, but argued the best way  of supporting the most needy groups was through measures to  attack long-term unemployment.    With the number of the EU's poor variously estimated at  between 50 million and 70 million, antipoverty organisations  regard the idea of relying on labour market policies alone to  tackle ""social exclusion"" as wishful thinking. The green paper  itself concedes that a return to full employment is ""unlikely in  the foreseeable future"" without significant policy changes.  Europe created 9 million jobs between 1985 and 1991 but  unemployment fell by only 3 million.    The European Antipoverty Network, which represents voluntary  organisations in the 12 member states, wants the introduction of  rules requiring poverty and its social consequences to be taken  into account in all EU policies, in the way that environmental  factors are considered. But campaigners' fears that their  efforts will fall on deaf ears have been compounded by signs  that the financial help the EU gives to the poor may be under  threat.    Although relief of poverty is a responsibility of individual  states, the EU supports experimental projects aimed at changing  the lives of the poor. Poverty 3, its current five-year  programme, ends this month, and last year Mr Jacques Delors,  Commission president, expressed hopes that it would be followed  by a more ambitious Poverty 4 with its budget doubled to ECUllO  million (85m pounds).    But Germany, in what started as a dispute between the  Federal  Government and laender over responsibility for running  antipoverty programmes, has blocked the introduction of the  initiative. Behind the dispute are wider reservations, shared  by some UK and Dutch ministers, about the appropriateness of EU  involvement in this area of social policy.    Mr Delors is believed to have tried to rescue Poverty 4 in  talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- without success. Unless  there is an unexpected breakthrough at a meeting of social  affairs ministers on June 22, there is little chance of the  programme being launched during the six-month German EU  presidency, which begins next month. With the specialist teams  that worked on Poverty 3 already breaking up because of the  uncertainty, this could mark the end of the programme. The  resistance to Poverty 4 is also giving rise to doubts about the  future of other EU social initiatives such as its work with the  elderly.    Most of Europe's poor would not immediately notice the loss  of the programmes -- budgets have never been big enough to  relieve much poverty. But Poverty 3 has helped fund schemes for  former prisoners in Italy, itinerant families in Ireland,  narcotics addicts in Greece single parents in Bristol.    A House of Lords sub-committee concluded last month that it  had led to work which would not otherwise have been done,  relieving poverty and starting to ""rebuild the economic and  social lives of some severely deprived communities."" Although  the invigoration of local economies was beyond the capacity of  small projects, the committee said it was ""impressed by the  determination and ingenuity"" shown by Poverty 3 initiatives in  creating limited numbers of new jobs.    The local government centre at Warwick University, which has  co-ordinated and monitored the UK projects included under the  Poverty 3 umbrella, lists a series of small but significant  practical achievements. They include a scheme to train black  people for voluntary work in Bristol, development of a new  childcare centre at Pilton, Edinburgh, and changes in Liverpool  city council's policies to encourage the employment of local  labour.    But supporters say the programme's most significant  contribution has been its direct involvement of needy and  deprived people in efforts to rebuild their communities. The  encouragement and prestige of having the EU flag flying over  little local initiatives in Scottish housing estates and  Portuguese mountain villages has, they say, been worth as much  as the money.    Mr Dennis Preston, who chairs the Brownlow Community Trust,  says Poverty 3 has provided a local test bed for national urban  aid policies. Warwick University researchers say it has enabled  people to ""participate in the process of change, rather than  becoming resentful objects of it.""    Europe's antipoverty groups fear that, if the EU abandons  such initiatives, the dangers of that resentment being expressed  in the dark forms described in its green paper will come at  least a little closer.

How are  veteran party members and former guerrillas and messengers in  southwest Zhejiang's old revolutionary base area faring? Have  cadres and people in impoverished mountainous areas adopted some  new methods to shake off poverty and set out on the road to  prosperity? In the past three years of reform [as published]  have there been any new moves in the land of southern Zhejiang  which is seething with activities? How fast is the  Jinhua-Wenzhou Railroad, on which people across the province  focus their attention, being built through high mountains? Wan  Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  governor of the province, called on people in southwest Zhejiang  and offshore islands and conducted investigations there along  with responsible persons of relevant provincial departments.  [passage omitted]    At a discussion with leaders of Taishun and Wencheng, two  poor counties, Wan Xueyuan said: To quicken their pace in  shaking off poverty and setting out on the road to prosperity,  people in poor counties should have a proper mentality; they  should have a united leading body, a fighting will, a  hardworking spirit, and a realistic work style. Judging from  the practice of various localities, to develop agriculture, it  is necessary to vigorously carry out reforms and readjust the  structures of crop farming and aquaculture. There must be good  systems, such as the cooperative shareholding system. At the  same time, we should do research on the market. [passage omitted]    While in Ruian City, Wan Xueyuan invited leaders of nine  enterprises practicing the shareholding system to a discussion  on accelerating reform of property rights and promoting the  establishment and development of a modern enterprise system by  implementing the shareholding system. In Wenzhou city, he  called a meeting of leaders of relevant departments and  enterprises and representatives of individuals engaged in  industrial and commercial businesses, at which they discussed  questions about the establishment of a socialist security  system. During the discussion, Wan Xueyuan fully affirmed the  pioneering spirit displayed by cadres and people at the  grass-roots levels in carrying out reforms and the achievements  they had scored. He said: Judging from the current economic  situation, Wenzhou has maintained a sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of its economy as has the province. To  promote development, we must deepen reforms, solve deep-seated  problems, and instill fresh vitality into the economy. The Third  Plenary Session of the Party's 14th Central Committee set the  objectives and tasks for reform. People throughout the  province, especially those in Wenzhou, should take bigger  strides in reform and exploration, be daring to innovate,  improve what they have done, and blaze new trails. [passage  omitted]    As the backbone of southwest Zhejiang, the Jinhua-Wenzhou  Railroad will be of great significance for local economic and  social development. [passage omitted] Wan Xueyuan visited a  tunnel construction site at Dongqiao Mountain in Wenzhou. He  went down to a construction site 200 meters underground to call  on workers of the Pingyang No. 2 Jingxiang Company who were  tunneling there. He held a drilling machine for a while. Wan  Xueyuan expressed satisfaction with the progress made last year  in building the railroad. [passage omitted]    While engaging in investigation and study, Wan Xueyuan also  called on teachers and family planning workers in impoverished  mountainous areas and inspected Wenzhou's developing cultural  market.

He told a  crowd of more than 100,000 squashed into a field outside Kings  Park Stadium that the ANC had taken precautions against chaos  after elections. He did not elaborate.    ""We have taken precautions in advance to ensure there is no  looting or interference in people's private property. We're  developing creative programmes in which people are taking part.    ""Nothing is going to happen to the property of any family,  black or white. We're taking precautions because we want a South  Africa of national reconciliation, peace and unity.""    The ANC president branded as ""prophets of doom"" those  predicting anarchy after the elections. In a direct appeal to  whites not to leave South Africa, Mr Mandela said: ""I appeal to  whites in particular not to fear the future."" The ANC  recognised the decisive role whites could play in rebuilding the  country, he said, adding that skills they had acquired had  become ""the most valuable asset in this country"".    Mr Mandela said he felt hurt by reports of whites leaving  South Africa and made an ""earnest appeal from a man who has  spent 27 year in jail"" for them to stay.""All of you in this  country: Africans, coloureds, whites and Indians, this is your  country. This is our country.    ""We appeal to those communities, who have benefited under  apartheid, do not leave us in the lurch at this critical moment.""    A confident Mr Mandela brushed aside the Johannesburg car  bomb and the Ulundi killings at the weekend, merely saying he  would take up these issues in discussions with State President F  W de Klerk on Sunday night. He told the cheering crowd he did  not want to concentrate on violence by those wanting to disrupt  elections.    ""We're going to deal with these issues. We've made enormous  progress despite the attempts of criminals.    ""Leave the task of dealing with law and order with the  security forces.""    The ANC president, however, criticised the security forces  for not confining the KwaZulu Police to barracks or weeding out  alleged hit-squads in that force, saying these issues had been  among the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in  KwaZulu/Natal. ""The SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP  [South African Police] have done nothing of these things except  to run round in the streets.""    Addressing indemnity for elements of the security forces, he  said the ANC would consider indemnifying those members who had  committed politically-linked offences between October 1990 and  December last year, but would not pardon those responsible for  current violence.    ""I want to state very clearly that those people involved in  killing members of the ANC in Ulundi, no matter what position  they hold, will be dealt with according to the law,"" he told the  cheering crowd.    ""They must pay for those crimes and they are going to pay.""    Mr Mandela repeated that the National Party [NP] had no  chance of winning this week's election and slammed the NP for  emulating the ANC's election slogans and for claiming to be the  only party which could stop the ANC. The NP's statement came  while the whole world was ready to assist an ANC-led government  and amounted to stopping the ANC from ""bettering the lives of  all"".    The ANC was ready to govern and the people of South Africa  were ready to rid the country of minority rule, Mr Mandela told  a media conference after the rally. ""They are not bluffed by the  National Party.""    He said earlier the NP had used South Africa's cultural  diversity to divide people while the ANC regarded the cultural  mix as one of the country's strongest assets.    Reassuring minorities, the ANC leader said majority rule did  not mean ""black majority rule"". ""All of you must pledge to be  part of the majority, not the minority. The National Party is a  government of the minority and can never be a government of  majority in this country.    ""I would urge our white counterparts to have confidence in  the future. Stay here and help us.""    Questioned on his feelings on the dawn of democracy in South  Africa, he replied: ""I feel elated. At the same time, I feel  sad,"" explaining that many people who had made freedom possible  were not alive to see it happen.     "

He pointed out that the new  government was still finding its feet.    Mr. Mandela's remarks coincided with reports that he is  expected to play a key role in attempts to end the slaughter in  Rwanda. The three-day summit meeting is expected to be  dominated by the Rwandan question. Other issues expected to be  discussed by the leaders of the 53 member states are Africa's  enormous debt, ethnic conflict, religious tension, the rise of  Islamic fundamentalism, and the failure of economic institutions  in some regions.    President Mandela held talks with King Hassan of Morocco on  his way to Tunis. He first visited Tunisia in 1962 to ask for  MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  soldiers to be trained.

Acting President of the Republic Franca van  Dunem says the victory of Mandela and the ANC is also a victory  for the Angolan people.    [Begin Van Dunem recording] I am pleased that the ANC  struggle has culminated with its victory at the polls. I am  convinced that my sentiment is shared by the majority of  Angolans, who, for many years now, have rubbed shoulders with  South African nationalists, and have given their best to make  today's celebrations a reality throughout Africa. Likewise, the  efforts of Angolans over the past years, which culminated in the  ANC victory....[changes thought] I am convinced that the victory  of the ANC and the South African people in general will be  beneficial to developments throughout Africa. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Marcolino Moco is pleased with the outcome of  the South African elections.    [Begin recording] [Moco] It is not an issue that only  affects  Angola. Obviously, Angola will benefit from the new situation  that has been created in southern Africa. I would like to  stress, however, that over the past years this process has  attracted the attention of the whole world, and Africa in  particular. It is not only a question of an ANC electoral  victory, but fundamentally a process of liberation and struggle  against racial segregation and of oppression of men by men. So,  I think the ANC victory is very good for us because the ANC  consists of our friends, who have fought by our side. I would  like to stress the major change that is taking place in the  world right now with the acknowledgment of all the victories the  South African people have scored in the past few years.    [Unidentified correspondent] As South African president,  will  Nelson Mandela ask to play a more important role in the Angolan  peace process?    [Moco] Any country involved in a process like this depends  fundamentally on its own people and on the capacity of its  politicians. That has been proven in South Africa. Like I said  earlier, with the completion of the liberation process and of  elections in South Africa, Nelson Mandela and his country will  know how to make a major contribution to Angola's progress,  including the peace process and development, because we are  aware that South Africa is a major economic power.    [Correspondent] But what about the ongoing Lusaka talks?    [Moco] Well, I think the Lusaka talks have made a great deal  of progress, despite a number of difficulties. What matters  with the South African experience is to specifically consolidate  the peace process in Angola and in southern Africa in general.  I think this will be a very useful experience. The fact that  Nelson Mandela and other South African politicians now have more  time to take part in African meetings, particularly in southern  Africa, will be very useful to us in general.

The announcement of the agreement, the terms of which were not disclosed, came just three days after Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, called for the removal of all remaining economic sanctions against South Africa. Former President Bush lifted federal restrictions against investing in South Africa in 1991, but many state and city governments across the US maintain some form of sanctions against the country. Pillsbury said it would form the new company, called Pillsbury Africa with Foodcorp's Table Top unit, South Africa's leading branded vegetable business and the top producer of frozen vegetables. The joint venture will manufacture Pillsbury's green giant vegetable products and Pillsbury baked goods at Table Top's plants in the cities of George and Port Elizabeth in the eastern Cape province. A 'significant' number of local jobs would be created over the next three years, said Pillsbury. The US group said it hoped the venture would provide a springboard into other African markets.

0,FT921-917 ,"FT921-917 _AN-CCZB1AFKFT 920326   FT  26 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kinnock's left luggage   THE LABOUR party has gone a long way towards transforming itself into a modern social democratic party; but not far enough. Nationalisation and indicative planning are out, competitive market forces are in. Yet Labour remains encumbered by intellectual baggage from the past. Already its statutory minimum wage is withering in the heat of the election campaign; it does not belong in Labour's new market garden. A little more pruning is still required. The minimum wage is a notoriously blunt method of achieving the goals Labour has set for itself. The UK does have more poverty than a wealthy society should tolerate; it has more low skill-low wage employment than a developed economy should have; and it pays some public sector workers too little. Yet the minimum wage will leave most poverty untouched. Child benefit, however inefficient, does at least ensure that the poor families benefit as much as do the more wealthy. Not so the minimum wage. Most low paid workers are second or third income earners in higher income families. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the gains to the richest 50 cent of the population will outweigh the gains to the lowest 50 per cent. True, the proportionate gains are larger for low income families where someone works, as a recent National Institute report points out. But the core poor - the unemployed, old and infirm - will not benefit. Only 13 per cent of the beneficiaries are in the poorest 20 per cent of households. Moreover, unemployment and therefore poverty will increase as a direct result of the minimum wage, as Mr Neil Kinnock implicitly acknowledged yesterday. He endorsed an earlier National Institute study which suggested that the gains in higher tax revenue will outweigh the higher public spending on wages. But it also estimated that upwards of 100,000 jobs would be lost. The market for chief executives may not be competitive; but the market for unskilled workers is fiercely so. There is still time for Labour to inject some sanity into its proposals without making a complete U-turn. The decision to delay its introduction until 1993 makes sense. By then unemployment may be levelling off while the proposed Pounds 3.40 per hour will be substantially less than half of male median earnings. But Labour should go further. If it must follow a European example, it should follow Germany and set separate minimums for different regions and industries. Moreover, an automatic link with male median earnings should be dropped, at least until the policy's employment effects have been assessed, while a sub-minimum should be added for people aged under 25. France has eschewed the sub-minimum option. Instead, it requires employers to pay the minimum wage to young people, and then subsidises their employment in a vain attempt to reduce very high youth unemployment. That is one continental practice Labour should try to avoid.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

The report, from the Labor Department, shows dual jobs to be a growing trend.  In 1980, 4.9 % of employed people held two jobs. The percentage rose to 5.4 in  1985. And in 1989, it continued on to 6.2%.    Simultaneously over the past decade, there has been a tendency of women to put  in more hours at ""official"" rather than family jobs and for older workers to  supplement pensions by working at retail outlets.    Marriages are occurring later than before, and there is a similar tendency to  postpone children until later in life. And to afford a home under present  conditions often requires the bounty of two incomes.    Still, in many areas of the country the financing and upkeep of the home take a  larger percentage of household income than they used to, up to 50% in certain  instances, or double what used to be considered affordable.    Question: Is this really the good life that was promised? Is this progress?    In spite of so-called affluence, for example, debt is increasing. And that same  Labor Department survey shows that 44% of those working an extra job are doing  so to meet household expenses and to pay debts.    Consider this: While more women than ever are working, well over 50% of them,  they earn less than men and advance more slowly. And surveys show they still  haven't shed most of their household chores.    Questions about progress arise in other areas too. The national debt is greater  than ever. Productivity increases have slowed. For the first time since the  Great Depression of the 1930s, the percentage of homeowners is shrinking.    Success in the fight against poverty has slowed.

Consider these facts, taken from a study by the U.S. Census Bureau  and the Conference Board, a private, not-for-profit educational and research  group:    Since 1900, life expectancy has risen from under 50 years to more than 75.

Average weekly hours in manufacturing declined to 40.5 hours in 1985 from 49.4  hours in 1915, while real hourly wages rose from $2.44 to $9.53.    Comparable net worth figures weren't available for earlier years of the  century, but in 1950 per capita net assets were $27,021, half those of 1985.

And each year  those houses seem to have more baths, swimming pools, decks, family rooms,  telephones, radios, TVs, electric toasters, computers and smoke alarms.    Vacation time has risen.

Soviet imperialism has been replaced by more fragmented but hardly less  troubling threats stoked by strife in the Middle East and hunger in North  Africa. The specter of terrorism, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, common  environmental concerns, and how to control the swell of economic and political  refugees from Africa crowd the new security agenda.    The Mediterranean countries of France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey,  all support CSCE and its programs as a safeguard of their continental security.  But they also argue that the Persian Gulf crisis has reinforced the need for  strong security cooperation among Mediterranean countries.    As a supplement to the CSCE, some of the major European Mediterranean countries  want to create a southern counterpart that would include non-European neighbors  in North Africa as part of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in the  Mediterranean (CSCM).    The still-fledgling idea of Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis and  Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, his Spanish counterpart, is to create an  instrument for resolving conflicts in the Middle East by grouping countries in  a vast area from Iran to Mauritania. To make the somewhat Utopian idea more  credible, they also seek American participation.    France and Portugal would be among the European sponsors of CSCM, although the  French are not persuaded that any such organization should extend beyond the  European and Africa Mediterranean and into the Middle East.    Echoing fears heard throughout southern Europe, Ordonez has warned of a  possible ""collision course between Islam and the West."" De Michelis is  proposing that the European Community nations contribute one-quarter of one  percent of their gross national products to aid the Maghreb countries -- the  principal source of migration, much of it illegal, to countries like France,  Italy, and Spain.

H. WALTERS, Times Staff Writer      Hewlett-Packard, one of a handful of large U.S. companies still operating in  South Africa, said Tuesday that it would sell its subsidiary there to a South  African holding company.    The sale to Siltek Ltd. is only a partial withdrawal from the country;  Hewlett-Packard products, largely computer systems and electronic  instrumentation, will continue to be sold and serviced by Siltek.    However, the move is a marked turnabout from Hewlett-Packard's posture on South  Africa throughout the past half-decade. The company, known in California's  Silicon Valley for its humanistic approach to business, remained a holdout in  South Africa even as scores of U.S. companies bowed to shareholder and public  pressure and pulled out.    Hewlett-Packard officials said the sale of its subsidiary was based on  financial, not moral considerations. Because of its operations in South Africa,  it has become increasingly difficult for the company to do business in the  United States, where many cities, counties, school districts and even some  states have passed laws prohibiting or severely limiting business with  companies that still have South African ties.    Its inability to bid on major municipal contracts has caused a ""severe  financial impact"" amounting to ""tens of millions of dollars on an annual  basis,"" according to a company spokesman. Because its products will still be  sold in South Africa, HP will continue to be barred from doing business with  those governmental entities that have the most restrictive laws concerning  firms with ties to South Africa.    Even so, the estimated lost income stemming from its previous South African  policy was beginning to outstrip the revenue generated by its subsidiary there,  while its policy to work for change from within the South African system was  losing its effectiveness, company officials conceded.    ""We're not taking this action because we feel it will have a beneficial impact  on bringing about the end of apartheid,"" the spokesman said. In fact, HP  officials believe it will ""be more difficult to engage in social programs  without a presence there,"" despite the company's pledge to continue to fund  social responsibility programs in South Africa.    The fact that so many other U.S. corporations have left the country has diluted  the influence of the companies that chose to remain, the spokesman said. ""We  have had a modest impact, but we felt the collective efforts (of U.S.  companies) could have an impact on apartheid. Now so many others have left . .  . and the effectiveness of our own programs has been weakened, our ability to  play a role (in changing the system) has been diminished.""    It was a ""difficult"" decision to leave, John A. Young, HP president and chief  executive, said in a statement.    ""We consistently have said that HP would remain in South Africa as long as we  could sustain an economically sound business, maintain our long-term  commitments to South African customers and contribute, even in a limited way,  to peaceful change and the creation of a more just and equitable society for  all South Africans,"" Young said.    However, he added, ""increasing political and economic uncertainties have made  it difficult for us to achieve these objectives. We are especially disappointed  that there appears to be no significant progress in bringing about an end to  apartheid.""    Throughout its 20 years in South Africa, sales there have generated less than  1% of HP's total revenue. Last year, the company said, its South African  subsidiary accounted for about $62 million in revenue. Total worldwide revenue  last year was $9.8 billion.    Siltek, an operating unit of Johannesburg-based conglomerate Anglovaal, will  offer continued employment to HP's 245 South African employees, the company  said. Other terms of the sale were not disclosed.    Its social programs, aimed at fostering change in the racially divided country,  will continue to be supported through the Hewlett-Packard Foundation. Last  year, through the HP Foundation and South African sales, HP distributed about  $750,000 to the programs.    HP's move comes less than a month after the latest of several successive  attempts by shareholders to force the company's withdrawal from South Africa.  At its Feb. 28 annual meeting, 77% of the company's shareholders voted against  a resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from South Africa, including a  halt to selling any merchandise in the country.    Hewlett-Packard is the second U.S. corporation to pull out of South Africa this  year after the departure of insurance company St. Paul Cos., according to the  Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks U.S.  investment in South Africa. In the past five years, more than 130 U.S.  companies have withdrawn.

Throughout its 20 years in South Africa, sales there have generated less than  1% of HP's total revenue. Last year, the company said, its South African  subsidiary accounted for about $62 million in revenue. Total worldwide revenue  last year was $9.8 billion.    Siltek, an operating unit of Johannesburg-based conglomerate Anglovaal, will  offer continued employment to HP's 245 South African employees, the company  said. Other terms of the sale were not disclosed.    Its social programs, aimed at fostering change in the racially divided country,  will continue to be supported through the Hewlett-Packard Foundation. Last  year, through the HP Foundation and South African sales, HP distributed about  $750,000 to the programs.    HP's move comes less than a month after the latest of several successive  attempts by shareholders to force the company's withdrawal from South Africa.  At its Feb. 28 annual meeting, 77% of the company's shareholders voted against  a resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from South Africa, including a  halt to selling any merchandise in the country.    Hewlett-Packard is the second U.S. corporation to pull out of South Africa this  year after the departure of insurance company St. Paul Cos., according to the  Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks U.S.  investment in South Africa. In the past five years, more than 130 U.S.  companies have withdrawn.

Japan will send the monitors in response to a request by the  South African Government, recognizing the historical importance  of the April 26-28 election for the international community,  spokesman Terusuke Terada said.    The election observers to be dispatched by the Japanese  Government will be joined by 10 U.N. volunteers and several  people from the private sector, he said.    A special assistant of the permanent mission of Japan to the  United Nations will also be dispatched as a liaison officer to  the U.N. Observer Mission to South Africa (UNOMSA), he said.    Japan has so far extended a total of about 34.8 million yen  in aid to nongovernmental organizations working in South Africa  to help voter education and provide vehicles for election  observation, he said.    In a related move, a private Japanese aid organization, the  Japan International Volunteer Center, also plans to carry out a  project in connection with the U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) to offer vocational training to assist the  resettlement of returnees to South Africa, he said.    The project is aimed at giving training in woodworking,  welding, plumbing and computer operation, he said.     "
0,FT944-18433 ,"FT944-18433 _AN-EJDDVACFFT 941004   FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leaders set to back shake-up of benefits      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The Labour leadership is preparing to back a radical shake-up of the benefit system for the unemployed and low-paid alongside the full integration of the tax and benefits system for the retired. Anticipating a report in two weeks' time from the party's Social Justice Commission, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Donald Dewar, social security spokesman, indicated that a future Labour government would preserve the principle of universal child benefit and the state pension. But the leadership is keeping open the option - raised in the commission's report - of extending the taxation of universal benefits. It is understood that a large part of the commission's recommendations focus on ways to remove poverty traps which discourage the unemployed from taking part-time or low-paid jobs. The focus on improving what are known as 'in-work benefits' is in line with Mr Tony Blair's insistence that Labour's approach to the welfare state will be to encourage self-help rather than dependency on state benefits. Mr Dewar underlined the point by telling the conference that Labour's aim was 'a nation at work, not a nation on benefit'. He also underlined the party's support for the social insurance principle embodied in the present system of National Insurance contributions. The commission's report articulates concern that the present system of rapidly withdrawing cash from low-income households when one member takes any form of employment discourages those on benefits from seeking work. Among those are women who are forced to give up part-time work when their partners become unemployed to prevent the family's benefits being withdrawn. Unemployed men are also discouraged from part-time work by the structure of income-support payments. One suggestion is that benefit payments should include a 'guaranteed' element which the unemployed would be allowed to keep if they took part-time or low-paid jobs. Another possibility would be to allow the jobless to keep all of their unemployment benefits for a limited period. The plan to integrate the tax and benefits system for pensioners aims to give a guaranteed minimum income for the retired while scrapping means-testing for poor pensioners. About 2m are eligible for some form of income support but about a quarter do not claim. Mr Dewar said the aim was 'to help pensioners living in poverty without leaving them exposed to the crude means-test which is income support'. But an automatic 'top-up' of state pensions for the poor would allow Labour to drop the expensive pledge given at the last election to restore the link between the state pension and earnings. Only a small part of the money would be needed to raise the incomes of the poorest pensioners. Because most pensioners have stable financial circumstances, the assumption is that the majority would have to complete only one new tax and benefit return during retirement. Those with changing incomes would be subject to regular assessments.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

Of course, the political parties are  deeply involved in the campaign. Nonetheless, there is a  dispute within the opposition. Here is Raphael Mbadinga:    [Begin recording] [Mbadinga] There is especially a war of  words among the opposition parties. Those who are in favor of  boycotting the 6 February elections are accusing the moderate  opposition of seeking to legitimize President Gnassingbe  Eyadema's government by taking part in the elections. According  to the radical opposition, President Eyadema's government has  not yet met all the conditions for truly democratic elections.  Zarifou Ayeva is critical of the attitude of the moderate  opposition here:    [Ayeva] Regarding my friends in the opposition who have  involved themselves unashamedly in this affair, I wonder how  they will find their way out. One only has to observe France's  position. Minister Roussin is already withdrawing his support  for the presidential elections. Tomorrow, faced with the  worsening situation on the ground, France will withdraw again.    [Mbadinga] The moderate opposition has reacted by saying,  and  I quote, the Togolese people are tired. They have had enough of  endless political transition. The legislative elections could  therefore be a solution to the Togolese crisis, unquote. These  petty squabbles of the opposition are publicly embarked upon in  the country's privately owned newspapers. [end recording]     "

That's good news for many thousands of children in  Orange County who, during school sessions, are fed lunch through a federal  assistance program but are not when school is out.    Despite the poverty of many of its neighborhoods, Orange County is the only  urban county in the state in which there is no federal lunch program in  operation for indigent children while they are out of school. That shouldn't be  so.    In all, 52,000 children in Orange County receive free lunches or lunch  subsidies during school sessions through a program funded by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture. When school is out, the USDA makes available similar  programs to agencies that service areas in which schools subsidize meals for  50% or more of their students. Such lunches also are available in other  counties where schools are year-round, not just in summer months but also in  the so-called ""off-track"" weeks between sessions.    But no agency yet has taken advantage of the program in Orange County. As a  result, both the USDA and California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), an  anti-poverty group, are targeting Orange County, hoping to bring a  subsidized-meals program on line in the next year. The end of this summer is a  good time to be planning for next.    While Orange County's image is one of affluence, there are portions of Santa  Ana, Garden Grove and several other cities with an underclass of impoverished  families. The children from these families many times eat their only good meal  of the day at school. When they are on school breaks, however, nothing magical  happens to replace that meal. Food banks in these areas report that it is not  unusual to have these hungry children show up at their agencies looking for  something to eat. It is heartbreaking, they say, to turn them away.    Meanwhile, the county's ability to respond to the needs of poor families seems  to diminish with each budgetary year. This is why the USDA program is  especially needed now.    Why then do no such programs exist in Orange County? The reasons are many.  While it seems hard to believe, officials at school districts in poverty areas  said they haven't noticed much of a demand. Meanwhile, nonprofit agencies --  eligible to provide meals programs for the first time in nearly a decade --  said they are discouraged by the applications and daunting requirements.    No such agencies in Orange County, and only six in the state, completed  applications in time to begin programs this year. A few, including the  Salvation Army of Anaheim, are determined to be ready by 1991. Meanwhile, CRLA  is counseling agencies on how to apply and is working with the USDA to simplify  rules. The Orange County Hunger Coalition has also been organizing for months  to help agencies gear up programs.    Other urban areas in California long ago worked through the initial  difficulties of establishing meal-subsidy programs during school breaks. In Los  Angeles, for example, the school district's 18-year-old lunch program serves an  average of 34,000 meals a day. And Riverside's Parks and Recreation Department  for 17 years has operated a lunch program that on a typical summer day serves  1,000 children.    Labor Day will mark the traditional end of summer. But Orange County needs a  major commitment to provide children's lunch programs in the future. Let's make  sure that such programs are in operation by next summer.
