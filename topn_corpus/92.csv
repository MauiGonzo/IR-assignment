Killing is killing. Justifying it, as in the case of Shaykh  Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi, is worse than the killing itself. The  abhorrence of the crime is not lessened by a heated legal debate  on diplomatic immunity and how to deal with the crimes committed  by diplomats.    It saddens the Lebanese that the Iraqi regime, after all the  disasters brought about by its policy of internal oppression and  its subjection to foreign humiliation, should insist on pursuing  its opponents with silencer-equipped guns and bombs from  diplomatic bags while allowing foreign inspection committees to  raid their presidential palace, besiege the Defense Ministry,  humiliate the Iraqi Army every minute, and dictate to the tyrant  his pocket money and his movements on land, sea, and air.    It is just as sad for Iraq and the Iraqis as it is for  Lebanon and the Lebanese (and all Arabs).    After all the oppression, coercion, humiliation, starvation,  and mass killing of Iraqis at home, death squads are formed to  pursue those who could not bear the humiliation of estrangement  and went abroad! Has this great people been condemned to mass  execution?    It is futile to blame Saddam Husayn for what he is  doing--yet  again, against Lebanon. Surely, his mercy for Lebanon and the  Lebanese is not greater than his mercy for Iraq and the Iraqis.    What is shocking, however, is that there is no authority to  take our complaints or grievances to in hopes that the oppressor  will be deterred even morally. Perhaps this is one of the  things that encourage him to carry on with his oppression.    Hence, the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon to  directly protect people living in this country, using its own  resources.    But this should not be used as an excuse for us not to  succor  political refugees, those fleeing the oppression of their  rulers, or those who seek refuge among us to protect their  families and, more importantly, to pursue their dream for change  and their right to a homeland.

The Italians demanded the release of the damaged fishing boat, being held at the Montenegrin port of Bar along with its captain and two crewmen. The Italian navy was ordered to step up patrols in the area and use all necessary force to prevent another attack on an Italian vessel. The incident is likely to compound Rome's exasperation at events in the former Yugoslav republics. Italy is already taking part in a naval blockade of Yugoslav ports with its partners in Nato and the 10-nation Western European Union. The clash, which the Italians said apparently occurred in international waters, comes just days after three Italian civilians were killed while delivering aid in central Bosnia. Four Italian airmen were killed when their UN helicopter was shot down by Serb fighters last year. A further four died when their aircraft was brought down on a mercy flight to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, last September.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.     YUZ  Yugoslavia, East Europe.

0,FT924-15580 ,"FT924-15580 _AN-CJDAFABQFT 921003   FT  03 OCT 92 / Truth of the Matter: The quality of mercy - Hugh Dickinson, Dean of Salisbury, considers the call for mercy killings following a doctor's conviction for giving an elderly patient a fatal injection      By HUGH DICKINSON   WHAT PRICE the tyranny of the abstract noun? I met the phrase for the first time recently and recognised its face at once. Abstract nouns get canonised. They get put in manifestos and men and women - though fewer women I suspect  -proceed to shed their life blood, and other people's, in defence of them. Meanwhile reality has moved on and the abstraction is beached like some beautiful empty shell after the tide has ebbed. Is 'The Sanctity of Life' one such? Or more emphatically, 'The Absolute Sanctity of Life'? My mother's family were farmers in South Africa and somewhere in the family folklore there is a story of a young man and his best friend riding out into the bush to shoot game. Some 20 miles from home they encounter and wound a lion. But the friend is thrown from his horse and terribly mauled by the wounded beast. His injuries were appalling and agonising. Obviously he cannot survive the long rough journey home. To leave him and ride for help is to abandon him to the lions. To stay with him only a prolongation of his terrible pain. The only kindly solution is quick and merciful oblivion. The bullet in the back of the head was his only option and so he shot his friend. Most Christian moral theologians would agree. In spite of much loud advocacy from Christian protest groups, I do not find the Absolute Sanctity of Life written anywhere in scripture or tradition. 'Thou shalt not kill' means 'no murder'. But killing abounds in the Old Testament. The long held concept of The Just War has a respectable place in Christian moral theology, and was much in play in the months leading up the Gulf War. So the Sanctity of Life seems easily suspended when more urgent interests supervene. There are more than 100,000 Iraqi corpses, (mostly unlettered peasants) in the desert sands following the Gulf War - but then a good deal of holy oil got spilt as well. For, whatever we may say, most of us, governments and terrorists alike, believe and act on the belief that there are a good many other things further up the sanctity scale than human life. Other abstract nouns, no doubt. But when I come to lie in mortal pain, I don't want any abstract noun standing between me and merciful oblivion. I have had enough experience of pain in my 60 years inside this creaky body to be sure of that, but I certainly do not want to put my doctor in the postion of having to break the most solemn oath of his profession, to save life not to take it. He must not cross that boundary. There has been much comment in the press about the case of Dr Alan Cox, tried and convicted in Winchester Crown Court for the attempted murder of a patient. The moral and practical issues are immensely complex and confusing and not much helped by abstract nouns. Public debate is essential for I have no doubt that the pressure for some form of legal euthanasia will become irresistible in the next 50 years. If we are to go that way we must get it right. Clearly the Winchester jury was right in law. Dr Cox intended to kill. He was therefore guilty. But mens rea (guilty intent) is a slippery fish. The doctor's choice of drug was not a painkiller but a heart stopper. A bullet would have had the same purposes and effect. He chose to end the pain by ending the life. But his intention was not malign, it was benign. If 'Always do unto others what you would have them do unto you' is the greatest moral precept of human relationships then it could be said he was doing the same final act of loving service that his friend did for the young man mauled by the lion. I would hope so to be loved myself in such a case. Should we say then a friend may do it but a doctor may not - even to end intolerable pain? Moral philosophers have a useful concept of 'double effect'. In this case we have two effects: pain killing and life killing. It is morally acceptable for a doctor to administer a drug to kill pain even if the immediate or longer-term consequence is the death of the patient. It is morally unacceptable for a doctor to administer a life-killing drug as a way of ending pain. A + B is alright, B + A is not. It is a subtle line, you may think, between 'kill to end the pain' and 'kill the pain and so end the life', but it is one on which their solemn oath and our essential trust in our doctors stands or falls. It is too dangerous to allow mercy killing to go on sub rosa amid a kindly conspiracy of silence among the medics. The conclusion I draw from this, though with some trepidation, is not that euthanasia in such circumstances must be always banned. It is rather that the burden of this decision must not be left to doctors. The vast majority of cases will continue to fall on the acceptable side of the line, and will offer patients the benign exit through pain killing drugs: but these exceptional cases will have to be held by the community through appropriate panels in partnership with the best medical advice. Death is not a medical responsibility. It belongs to all of us. The case of excessive pain is not the only one that will come to claim the panel's attention. There is a continuum through irreversible coma, Alzheimer's, to premature senile dementia and on to mental handicap and inconvenient old age. This is the dreaded slippery slope. But the social pressure to move on to that slope is already irresistible. Many doctors are standing at its upper edge. Legal enforceable guidelines or legally constituted panels are the only bulwark against the slide. The ethical problem in these cases is rather different but if we do not address it and find an acceptable legal protection for it I believe we will find people taking their own lives and the lives of their dear ones into their own hands. Less benign agencies may follow. What totalitarian regimes or venal doctors might get up to once the wall is breached is certainly frightening but I do not think they will be deterred more in the future than they have been in the past by us shouting the Sanctity of Life into their unheeding ears. Tight legislation will do more to save life and provide easeful death than any abstract nouns.  The Financial Times   London Page XX  "

By Diane Colasanto, Diane Colasanto is with the Times Mirror Center for the  People and the Press in Washington.      WASHINGTON      When a doctor from Michigan helped an Oregon woman with Alzheimer's disease  commit suicide last week, he knew his decision -- and hers -- would kindle a  debate on medical ethics and mercy killing.    While authorities debate the doctor's actions, a new survey shows that although  some Americans might disagree with the methods used by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a  Detroit pathologist, all segments of the public support right-to-die policies.  There is a widely held belief that physicians should sometimes allow a patient  to die rather than use the full range of medical procedures and treatments  available.    And Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs, overwhelmingly support  the right of patients to make their own decisions about life-sustaining  treatment. If a person is unable to make his or her decisions known, people say  a close family member should be allowed to make the call.    These are among the findings of a Reflections of the Times poll of 1,213 adults  nationwide. The poll was conducted for the Times Mirror Center for the People  and the Press in Washington, and examined public views about dealing with  terminal illness and disability.    The poll (with an error margin of 3%), conducted last month, showed:    More than half of Americans, 59%, would want their doctors to stop  administering life-sustaining treatment if they had a terminal disease and were  suffering a great deal of physical pain.    Those polled made a distinction between the decision to forgo life-sustaining  treatment for adults and the decision of parents to withhold treatment for  severely handicapped children.    The strength of religious views play a key role in determining views about  ending the life of a suffering person.    One-third of adults can imagine themselves taking the life of a loved one who  was suffering terribly from an illness that was terminal.    Americans have profoundly mixed feelings about growing old. Only four in 10  adults would like to live to be 100 years old, and half would emphatically not  want to be that old. Women especially do not look forward to reaching the  milestone of their 100th birthday. Ironically, this accomplishment is more  likely for a woman than a man.    The public's feelings about right-to-die legislation is driven by its belief in  the need for discretion in administering life-sustaining medical treatment.  Eight in 10 adults approve of state laws that allow medical treatment for a  terminally ill patient to be withdrawn or withheld, if that is what the patient  wishes.    Most states have some form of right-to-die legislation, and for the first time  in its history, the U.S. Supreme Court is now considering whether there is a  constitutional right to discontinue life-sustaining medical treatment in the  case of Cruzan vs. Harmon. The public's attitude toward right-to-die  legislation is bolstered by a trend toward greater acceptance of suicide in the  face of suffering.    About half of the public thinks a person has a moral right to commit suicide if  suffering from an incurable disease or from great pain with no hope of  improvement. Acceptance of suicide in such cases has been increasing gradually  over the 15-year period since 1975, when these attitudes were first measured by  the Gallup Poll. More than half, 55%, now think a person suffering great pain  with no hope of improvement has a moral right to suicide, compared with only  41% 15 years ago.    The increasing acceptance of suicide is largely due to the aging of the  population. The older people who overwhelmingly rejected suicide as a response  to terminal illness 15 years ago have died and been replaced in the population  by younger people with more moderate views about the acceptability of suicide  in these circumstances.    Attitudes about suicide differ greatly depending on the strength of one's  religious views.    Most ""born-again"" Christians and very religious people reject a right to  suicide even in the case of a terminal illness. They are fairly evenly divided  in their attitudes about suicide when the patient is suffering great pain. Yet,  paradoxically, a majority of ""born-again"" Christians and the very religious  think acts of so-called ""mercy killing"" by spouses are sometimes justified.    It appears that some Americans, particularly those who are very religious, make  an important distinction between what is ""justified"" and what is a ""right.""  This implies that the difficult decision to end a person's life is perhaps  justified, understandable and acceptable, yet not endorsed.    But the public makes a distinction between how decisions about medical  treatment should be made for adults and how they should be made for infants.  Half of the public rejects the notion that parents can refuse life-sustaining  treatment on behalf of their severely handicapped infant, saying instead that  such infants should receive as much treatment as possible.    ""It's difficult to agree on what the patient's best interests are in the case  of a newborn and there's no way to extrapolate what the patient would want from  knowledge of his or her life,"" said Susan M. Wolf, a lawyer with the Hastings  Center, a research institute in New York that studies medical ethics. h Views  on this issue are also profoundly influenced by religion, with ""born-again""  Christians and those who are very religious most opposed to parental  decision-making in these cases.    In fact, majority support for the right of parents to refuse medical treatment  only occurs among those who say religion is unimportant in their lives    It is the relevance of religion to a person's day-to-day life that affects  opinion on right-to-die issues, rather than one's adherence to a specific set  of religious beliefs.    The views that Americans express about right-to-die policies reflect their  personal feelings about how they would want their own medical treatment handled  in various situations, and what they know or can imagine about the wishes of  their parents. Not only do most Americans want life-sustaining treatment to  cease in the event of terminal illness with severe pain, they also want doctors  to withhold extended treatment if they had an illness that made them totally  dependent on another family member for daily care. The wish to have  life-sustaining medical treatment withdrawn decreases as the importance of  religion increases. However, a majority (52%) of even the very religious would  want their own treatment stopped if they were suffering a great deal of  physical pain.    But fewer people are willing to say they would take part in a mercy killing.  Only a third of adults can imagine themselves taking the life of a loved one  who was suffering terribly from an illness that was terminal. The ability to  imagine the mercy killing of a spouse or other loved one is greater for men.  But that desire decreases significantly with age, presumably as the possibility  of actually facing such a choice becomes more likely.      The Right to Die    the poll of 1,213 adults last month gauged the views of people about mercy  killing against the importance of religion in their lives.

The French naval ship La Rance dropped anchor 10 miles off the Christian port  of Juniyah, where France's minister for humanitarian aid, Bernard Kouchner, is  supervising a mercy mission for both Christians and Muslims.

The shooting came a day after judges shut down Colombia's courts indefinitely  and 50 of Bogota's 55 appeals court judges resigned to demand more government  protection from ruthless drug lords.    The provincial police chief, Col. Waldemar Franklin Quintero, was killed and  his driver wounded when gunmen intercepted their car and riddled it with  automatic weapons fire, authorities and witnesses said.    The attack came after Franklin Quintero sent his own bodyguards to protect  court judges whose lives had been threatened.    Since assuming his post in January, the colonel had led an active campaign  against drug traffickers and right-wing death squads.    Local reporters said he coordinated two helicopter-borne police raids aimed at  dismantling two big Medellin cocaine cartel complexes, last January and two  months ago.    Franklin Quintero had told reporters privately in recent months that he had  received a stream of death threats.    Nevertheless, provincial Gov. Helena Herran de Montoya said, he gave up his  bodyguard force because he ""thought it was more important to use this personnel  in protecting judges.""    Authorities blamed the killing on the Medellin cartel, the world's largest  cocaine ring, which is believed responsible for about 80% of the cocaine  smuggled into the United States.    ""They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel, who was hit more  than 100 times,"" an unidentified witness told Radio Caracol. ""His chauffeur was  seriously injured and taken to a hospital.""    The nation's judges went on strike Thursday to demand increased protection.  They struck after gunmen hired by drug dealers killed Magistrate Carlos  Valencia Garcia in Bogota on Wednesday night. That killing also prompted the 50  magistrates in Bogota's appellate court to hand in their resignations.    Valencia Garcia, 43, had rejected court motions to exonerate two leaders of the  Medellin cartel who were accused in the 1987 slaying of a journalist.    Asked about the strike and Franklin Quintero's slaying, Justice Minister Monica  de Grieff said: ""It's terrifying what is happening in Colombia.""    ""The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting together -- the  government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry -- to stop the wave of  violence,"" she said in Bogota.    She appealed to the country's more than 4,000 judges and magistrates to end  their strike so traffickers don't ""achieve their goal of halting the  administration of justice.""    Today's attack was the latest in several drug-related killings in Medellin,  Colombia's second-largest city and its industrial center.    In the last month, two officials investigating the activities of cocaine  kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria have been slain.

0,FT942-10916 ,"FT942-10916 _AN-EEHA5AE0FT 940507   FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Drama in court      By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD   Terence Frisby wrote the memorably named play There's a Girl in My Soup. A slightly Noel Coward piece about a wine and food critic who expects to seduce every pretty girl in sight, it ran for over six years in the West end, starting in 1966. Fashions change, however, When I went to look it up, I was convinced that it must have been called There's a Man in My Soup. No-one treats philandering so lightly today. Frisby has changed too: out with the frivolous, in with the serious. The only common element between Soup and Rough Justice is that the central character is a media man who also writes books. But they are writers of a very different kind. Robert Danvers in Soup is pompous and vain and would never have written about ethics. James Highwood in Rough Justice, represents  -as his name suggests - the higher journalism. The trouble is that this paradigm of liberal virtue is up in court for having killed his brain damaged baby son. Or so it seems. But I shall not give away the plot, save to say that it you are of a sentimental frame of mind, you can probably guess the outcome. The action takes place in the Old Bailey, mainly in court, sometimes in the defendant's cell and occasionally in a corridor outside where deals between lawyers can be done. As in most court dramas, the characters tend to be made out of cardboard. Nevertheless, there is a Wimbledon-like fascination in watching the exchanges between the prosecuting counsel Margaret Casely QC (Diana Quick) and the defendant played with some anguish by Martin Shaw. Alan Dobie's judge sits as the umpire in the middle. Issues abound: the case for so-called mercy killing and the distinction between murder and manslaughter. The law which comes in for most abuse (rightly in my view) is contempt of court: it allows the judge and the prosecution ruthlessly to bully anyone conducting their own defence and smacks, in this play, of a lawyers' cartel. Rough Justice is not very profound. It conforms effectively to the middlebrow rule of treating controversial subjects without much risk of offending anyone. Some of the characters, especially the wife, might be more developed. Still, the piece can hold an audience. I enjoyed it. Direction is by Robin Herford.

The dead men are: Dr Shamam Bakhshandegi, 29, a dentist who  worked at Mdantsane hospital; Mr Riaz Razavi, 44, the director  of finance at the University of Fort Hare; and Mr Hooshmand  ""Alex"" Anvari, a visiting American national.    A Ba'hai leader in the Eastern Cape, Mr Cyrus Mahmoudi, said  the four gunmen had entered the church at about 2PM. ""I don't  know weapons very well,"" a shaken Mr Mahmoudi told SAPA, ""but,  according to some members of the congregation, at least one of  the men had an AK-47, the others had pistols. There was no  discussion at all. These men said they wanted the white people  to stand one side.""    The three the victims, who were picked out because they had  a  lighter skin colour than everyone else present, were then told  to empty their pockets. After they had complied with the  gunmens' request ""they were brutally shot down in cold blood in  the presence of many women and small children"".    Mr Mahmoudi said that at no time had the gunmen given any  reasons for their actions. ""This was a blatantly racist attack  against us, a church which has always preached that we are all  one kind.""    The killers then grabbed a set of car keys belonging to one  of the men they had shot dead and made their getaway in the  stolen car.    Another Ba'hai elder, Cecil Cook, of Stutterheim, said the  ""attack was on a religion which believes in the unity of  mankind. Nothing could be more racist.""    The Ciskei Government released a statement on Sunday night  deploring the ""despicable and cowardly action"". The statement  added that ""every effort"" would be made to apprehend the killers.    ""The stage has now been reached when it is only fair to  announce that no mercy will be shown to the sub-humans who  perpetrate such crimes.""     "

It was undersigned by ""Fatah Hawks"" and ""'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  Battalions."" According to the document, the parties agree:    1. To immediately halt all defamation campaigns between  Fatah and Hamas, provided the right to freedom of expression and  opinion is guaranteed to everyone. A fraternal dialogue between  the two organizations will be held to decide measures that will  serve our lofty masses everywhere.    2. To renounce differences and bloody conflicts and stop  using violence to resolve these differences. The two sides  emphasize the need to be committed to constructive dialogue  among our people to put an end to the conspiracies being  concocted to trap our people in chronic crises and differences.    3. As of the date of this statement, the wanted persons and  gunmen of both sides are prohibited from interfering to resolve  organizational or family problems. The Islamic and national  reconciliation committees are asked to play their role in  resolving any problem that may arise. If no solution is  reached, the leaders of the political factions are to intervene  to put an end to the problems. Fatah and Hamas will work out a  suitable mechanism for implementing this resolution.    4. After a long study of our people's economic conditions,  it has been decided to stage a one-day strike for every martyr  in his own neighborhood only and to declare only one day of  mourning in the remaining areas. The intifadah activists are  hereby prohibited from throwing stones at cars moving for urgent  reasons. The two parties appeal to all factions to reduce  overall strikes as much as possible. In cases of emergencies, a  strike shall be announced jointly and through a fraternal and  constructive understanding.    5. Regarding educational matters, we urge our male and  female students to remain in their classes during strikes. All  students are urged to deal with any attempt to force them out of  their classes.    6. After a careful study of the question of collaborators,  Fatah and Hamas have decided to stop killing collaborators  between 22 April 1994 and 22 May 1994. During this period,  efforts will be made to tackle this phenomenon. We advise the  collaborators to cut off their ties with the enemy's  intelligence agencies for God's mercy is better for them than  the enemy's hell. This month will provide a chance to  reconsider and define positions.     "

By DAN WEIKEL and MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      TORRANCE      A reputed gang member with a long criminal history was sentenced to death  Friday for killing a Santa Ana church elder as the victim prayed for mercy in a  telephone booth a few feet from where his wife looked on in horror.    Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Jean Matusinka ordered Tracy Lavelle  Carter, 22, of Los Angeles, to die in the gas chamber for the first-degree  murder of David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion Apostolic Church  in Santa Ana.    ""The defendant has engaged in a pattern of violent conduct that indicates a  serious danger to society,"" Matusinka said. ""You should suffer the death  penalty within the vaults of San Quentin.""    Carter, wearing leg irons, white basketball sneakers and a blue jail jumpsuit,  removed his glasses and began to sob at the defense table as Matusinka spoke.  Earlier, he had whispered to his relatives in the audience and rocked back and  forth in his chair.    ""I love you all,"" he yelled to his family as sheriff's deputies led him away  after sentencing.    On Nov. 2, a jury convicted Carter on two counts of first-degree murder  stemming from the shooting deaths of Thompson, 27, of Tustin, and Leopoldo  Salgado, 48, of Los Angeles, on April 9, 1987. Both were robbed and killed  within 90 minutes of each other in South-Central Los Angeles during an attempt  by Carter and two other young men to obtain money for beer and cigarettes.    Three weeks later, the jury recommended that Carter be put to death for  Thompson's death and receive life in prison without the possibility of parole  for the slaying of Salgado. Judge Matusinka formally imposed those sentences  during Friday's hearing.    ""He deserved it,"" said Catherine Thompson, who added that she has had two  strokes following the death of her son, David. ""If it had been anything less I  would have been devastated. My son was a fabulous man. He was taken away. . . .  He who liveth by the sword shall die by the sword. All I want is justice.""    Thompson was killed in a service station telephone booth at Slauson Avenue and  Broadway, where he had gone to call for help after a bus from his church broke  down during an outing. As his wife, Namora, waited in their car, three men  accosted them and took $10 from her purse.    Court testimony showed that Carter then turned on Thompson, whose hands were  pressed together in prayer. ""Hallelujah, hallelujah,"" Thompson said before he  was fatally shot in the head.    Police said the men took Thompson's 1986 Hyundai and drove to a liquor store  where they bought cigarettes and beer. They returned to the store later and  shot Salgado when and a friend refused to give them money.    ""The death penalty was justified,"" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls, the  prosecutor. ""He put a gun to a good man's head who was praying for mercy and he  killed him.""    Before sentencing, defense attorney Susan Wolk argued that Carter should either  receive a new trial or a reduced sentence of life in prison because the jury  recommended two different punishments in November. Matusinka rejected the  argument without comment.    ""I don't think it was fair at all,"" said Carter's mother, Audry. ""Tracy is my  only son. Tracy is basically a good person. He was home that night, and he  should have stayed home. How can you spend your life on death row at 22 -- 30  years waiting to die.""    Matusinka had the power to reject the jury's recommendation of the death  penalty, but she imposed the sentence, citing the two killings and Carter's  lengthy criminal history. Those facts, she said, outweighed defense arguments  in favor of a life sentence -- Carter's age and expression of remorse for the  killings.    Court and prison records show that Carter, who is a member of the 74 Hoover  Crips street gang, has been in continuous trouble with the law since his first  robbery and malicious mischief convictions at age 11. Except for 14 months of  freedom, Carter has been serving time in Los Angeles County Jail and the  California Youth Authority for the last seven years.    ""It's hard to accept. My client is a human being,"" said Anthony Alexander,  Carter's other defense lawyer. ""I definitely feel he feels remorse for the  entire situation. I think he understands this is a tragedy for everyone.""    Carter is the last of three people to be convicted and sentenced in the  slayings. Last year, Andre Moore, 20, an accomplice, was sentenced to 32 years  to life in prison, while Todd Lavera, 26, received 58 years to life in prison.

""And in this  case, the crimes are so bad, so violent, so terrible . . . the only appropriate  verdict you can render is a verdict of death.""    Comtois was found guilty June 6 of killing Wendy Masuhara and shooting her  13-year-old friend and leaving her for dead after kidnaping both girls from  their Chatsworth neighborhood in September, 1987.

0,FT943-12374 ,"FT943-12374 _AN-EGZEHAA7FT 940726   FT  26 JUL 94 / Rwandan refugees struggle home      By LESLIE CRAWFORD and AP      GISENYI, RWANDA, KIGALI   Tens of thousands of Hutu refugees, in a thin ribbon stretching along the 160km from Gisenyi, in Rwanda, to Kigali, the capital, have returned home to throw themselves on the mercy of the country's new Tutsi-led government. The refugees, who fled Rwanda in panic, are returning rather than face death from cholera and starvation in Zaire's refugee camps. The exodus began after Zairean troops reopened the border crossing between Goma, in Zaire, and Gisenyi on Sunday. The returnees are barefoot, carrying their meagre belongings on their heads. After surviving the horror of Goma, many are too weak to make the return journey and several have died only a few kilometres outside Gisenyi. There are no relief agencies to help them along the way and little food. The Hutu exodus out of Rwanda swept the mountainous north-west of Rwanda like a plague of locusts. Banana groves have been stripped of fruit. The bean harvest has rotted. Hills have been denuded as swathes of trees were chopped down for firewood. US military officials arrived in Kigali this week to begin the planning of their humanitarian relief operation. Ms Alison Campbell, a spokeswoman for the relief agency Care said, said: 'If the refugees understand they are receiving aid from Kigali, and news spreads that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is co-operating with the international relief effort, this could have an important psychological impact in helping build trust between the refugees and the new government.' Relief workers in Goma, however, said the return of refugees had not begun to dent the magnitude of the humanitarian catastrophe in Zaire. Cholera is killing refugees in their thousands. The 28 trucks assigned to collecting the dead have been overwhelmed by the corpses that pile up. Mr Peter Hansen, a special envoy of the United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, yesterday told reporters that the UN's emergency funds were exhausted and that it had no money to continue the relief operation. He said the UN would launch a new appeal for Dollars 440m (Pounds 283.8m) to deal with the crisis, but he was not optimistic about receiving the funds swiftly enough. 'The situation is out of control,' he said. But relief agencies are not yet advising refugees to return to Rwanda. A formal repatriation programme would require the agreement of the governments of Rwanda and Zaire and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Rwanda plans to prosecute tens of thousands of people for genocide and murder in trials that could begin within a month, AP adds from Kigali. Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said that, within the bureaucracy of the former government alone, there were more than 22,000 people suspected of complicity. UN officials estimate between 200,000 and 500,000 people were murdered in three months.   Countries:-  RWZ  Rwanda, Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT931-8050 ,"FT931-8050 _AN-DBUAKAFFFT 930220   FT  20 FEB 93 / Truth of the matter: Caring for the carers - Euthanasia      By JULIA RILEY   IN THE current debate on how far doctors may go to relieve the sufferings of the terminally ill, I believe the advances in palliative medicine have often been underestimated, particularly by those who say mercy killing can be justified. The UK is a world leader in this branch of medicine (the science of treatments to relieve symptoms created by disease, rather than curing the disease itself). It started when Dame Cicely Sanders founded the Modern Hospice Movement in 1959. A new concept at the time, it unfortunately continues to be an alien concept today. Palliative medicine is now a recognised postgraduate speciality in the National Health Service. It is, however, unique, in that it started in people's homes and in the charitable sector. The health service recognised the enormous value of charitable hospices and has therefore incorporated and accredited some hospices in which doctors can train in the speciality. It is well-known that most people wish to die at home. The reality is that most people die in hospitals. This can be changed. The answer is to support patients and their relatives in the home. In 1911, 27-year-old Douglas Macmillan looked on helplessly as his father suffered from, and eventually died from, cancer of the oesophagus. Later that same year he set up Cancer Relief. Today there are nearly 1,000 Macmillan nurses throughout the United Kingdom, most of whom are community-based. Recently, the role of the Macmillan nurses has extended into helping improve care for patients in hospitals as well. Their main role is support and advice about alleviation of symptoms. Ask yourself, what is the role of a hospice? Many will answer: it is a refuge for the dying. No, I say, it is a place to control symptoms that cannot be managed at home. The symptoms may be those of the patients or the carer. The reasons for admission to a hospice are numerous. They include physical symptoms such as pain, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, loss of mobility and many others. There are emotional factors such as fear, anxiety, panic or depression. The list is endless. Then there is the question of a carer, or lack of a carer at home. Respite admissions, offering a period of rest for the patient and the family, is also common. Pain control is, of course, essential to the running of a good Palliative Medicine Unit. Pain has many components to it. It is influenced by disease, anxiety, previous experiences and fear. It is rare that pain cannot be controlled, although each patient has a different pain threshold. The greatest fear of dying patients, and indeed, the public at large, is pain. The cry of 'I would rather die than be in pain' is heard all too often. The reality is that the vast majority of patients' pain is well controlled by specialists in this field. In an extremely small minority, if pain control is inadequate, sedation is an alternative. This is effectively increasing the patient's sleep. It is not taking life. It is kind. It is compassionate. It is merciful to both the patient and his or her family and loved ones. Dealing with dying patients every day, I have yet to come across a patient to whom we were not able to bring comfort in the last phases of life. The most important question is therefore one of education, not euthanasia. If patients and doctors know where to turn for help, cases such as that of Dr Alan Cox, the Winchester doctor who was found guilty of killing a terminally ill patient, will be history. The health service has recognised the need. The speciality is growing and new posts are being created by the NHS annually. Ultimately, we should have palliative medicine physicians in all hospitals caring for those that are terminally ill. In a column on this page, Hugh Dickinson, the Dean of Salisbury, said that if we do not 'address it (euthanasia) and find and acceptable legal protection for it, I believe we will find people taking their own lives and the lives of their dear ones into their own hands'. May I contradict him and say that euthanasia is the removal of life and is not acceptable, and if the law changes to make it in any way acceptable, then we most certainly will run the risk of people taking the lives of their dear ones. Taking one's own life is a different matter altogether. So let us not change the law about euthanasia, but rather change our attitudes to dying.

The United States  literally ""payed off"" the UN Security Council, Layla Shahid, the  Palestinian general representative in France protested. It was  at Washington's wish alone that the vote on the draft resolution  on the Hebron killing was delayed for three weeks, although the  text had been amended and the voting procedure -- paragraph by  paragraph -- had been drawn up several days ago, she explained  to us.    And, above all, this is the first time that a U.S.  Administration has ventured to exclude East Jerusalem from the  perimeter of the occupied territories. The paragraph of the  preamble relating to Jerusalem -- on which the United States  abstained -- makes provision for the Council to ""reaffirm its  relevant resolutions which state that the fourth Geneva  Convention of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the territories  occupied by Israel in 1967, including Jerusalem, and Israel's  responsibilities in this regard..., condemns, and so forth.""  The French Government even approached Washington to obtain  explanations on this subject, she said. In vain.    Washington's position on the eastern part of the holy city  is  particularly serious because it violates the Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on 13 September by the PLO and  Israel, in other words by the two sides most directly involved.  Indeed, the text makes provision for the city's fate only to be  discussed during the second phase of the peace negotiations and  for ""the two sides to agree that the agreements secured in the  interim period should not undermine the result of the  negotiations on permanent status or anticipate it.""    Before the vote, Washington ""used outright blackmail on the  Palestinians: Return to the negotiating table and we will  discuss the measures to be taken,"" Dennis Ross, the U.S.  coordinator in the peace negotiations, said in substance to  Yasir 'Arafat last week, Layla Shahid explained. The PLO is  reversing the terms of the equation and refusing to be held  solely responsible for the suspension of the process.    The Palestinian general representative thinks that the U.S.  attitude on Jerusalem is a ""negative message, an insult not only  to the Palestinians but to the whole Muslim world,"" she said.  In addition to Washington's attitude, Mrs. Shahid thinks that  it is ""the cowardice"" of the international community which,  through the Council's slowness in approving a text, is another  ""negative message"" to the population of the occupied  territories. Although Russia has the merit of ""at least having  tried"" to show the United States that it could not lay down the  law, Europe, our interlocutor deplored, is totally incapable of  acting on its words at Security Council level. Before resuming  negotiations, the PLO and Israel must discuss what this  ""international presence"" stipulated by the resolution will be:  ""Will it be UN or multinational forces, civilian or military?  From whom will they receive their mandate, how many men will  they have?,"" Layla Shahid asks. In short, we are not out of  the woods, and the situation on the ground will continue to be  at the mercy of all the extremists.     "

INCONSISTENCIES ABOUND.      By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER      In striking down capital punishment laws as unconstitutionally cruel and  unusual 18 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the statutes were being  arbitrarily and capriciously enforced.    As a practical matter, only one in 100 killers was -- and still is -- being  chosen to die.    For the late Justice Potter Stewart, figuring out which one was about as easy  as predicting who was going to be ""struck by lightning.""    But the court refused to endorse state laws that would have solved the problem  by rigidly requiring that all killers who acted with premeditation be put to  death. Instead, it backed laws that left room for mercy and provided only vague  guidelines for prosecutors and jurors.    Discretionary moral judgments have remained at the core of the Death Row  selection system and have led to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have  been viewed by death penalty supporters as inevitable and tolerable, and  compared by opponents to a ""cruel lottery"" or ""crap shoot.""    Anecdotes abound of killers in California and elsewhere who have committed  horrible crimes and been sentenced to life imprisonment, while others who have  committed arguably less horrible crimes have been sentenced to die.    Consider, for example, Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono, who was convicted of  kidnaping, torturing and killing nine young women, and given a life sentence.    Then consider Robert Alton Harris, who kidnaped and shot to death two teen-age  boys, and may become the first person executed in California in 23 years. A  federal judge has stayed Harris' execution indefinitely, but the state has  asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the execution to go ahead as scheduled on  Tuesday.    Who was worse -- Buono or Harris?    Harris, at one point, raised such a question in an unsuccessful appeal to the  U.S. Supreme Court, asking that it order lower courts to systematically compare  the cases of those who were sentenced to die to the cases of those who were  not.    The Supreme Court declined, declaring in 1984 that ""any capital sentencing  scheme may occasionally produce aberrational outcomes. Such inconsistencies are  a far cry from . . . major systemic defects.""    The Supreme Court was not unanimous in its decision, however. Justice William  Brennan, a death penalty foe, said the court was ""simply deluding itself."" He  said the death penalty was being administered in as arbitrary a fashion as  ever.    But some death penalty advocates say ""So what?"" They argue that it is  irrelevant if some murderers happen to get a break and are spared death.    Brennan said the gravest inequity was racial discrimination.    By the time of Harris' challenge, the court had already struck down the chief  instrument of this kind of discrimination -- laws of some Southern states that  permitted the death penalty for rape and which were overwhelmingly applied to  black men in rapes of white women.    But a report released in February by the General Accounting Office, the  investigative arm of Congress, showed that discrimination persists. The GAO  reviewed 28 academic studies, conducted in different parts of the country from  1972 to 1988, and found ""a pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities in  the charging, sentencing and imposition of the death penalty.""    Almost all of the studies, the GAO said, found that ""those who murdered whites  were . . . more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks.  This finding was remarkably consistent . . . across states.""    One of the few studies the GAO considered that did not find racial disparities  applied to California and was conducted by RAND Corp. researchers working under  contract to state and county prosecutors. ""It may be that California is  somewhat different than other places,"" said research psychologist Stephen  Klein, one of the RAND study's authors.    Overall, researchers say, there are about 20,000 killings a year in the United  States, about 10,000 convictions and 300 sentences of death. Not all states  have capital punishment.    The death penalty is reserved for certain types of killers -- generally those  who kill on purpose and under ""special circumstances,"" such as for financial  gain, or while lying in wait, or during the course of a robbery, burglary or  rape.    Still, the death penalty could be applied much more often than it is.    In robberies where murders occur, for example, there is often more than one  criminal involved and thus more than one person who may be eligible for the  death penalty. But for a prosecutor, ""what's important is that you score one  touchdown"" in the form of a death sentence, said Franklin R. Zimring, UC  Berkeley law professor and a capital punishment expert.    Frequently, a race ensues in which the robbers try to be the first to point the  finger at an accomplice and make a deal with the prosecutor to testify in  return for leniency.    Sometimes, Zimring said, it never becomes clear whether the person who got  leniency or the person on trial for his life actually pulled the trigger.    Zimring said 80% of all killings involve acquaintances or intimates, but that  the 20% involving strangers tend to dominate the nation's Death Rows.    He said that characteristic reflects society's greater fears of strangers: ""If  a guy gets killed by his wife, we're not worried, because we're not married to  his wife.""    In California, as in most of the 37 states that now have the death penalty,  district attorneys have virtually unfettered discretion in deciding whether to  charge a first-degree murder defendant with one of the 19 ""special  circumstances"" that is almost certain to apply to his case. These special  circumstances would make him eligible for the death penalty or life in prison  without possibility of parole.    However, prosecutors say they are reluctant to overdo it.    Los Angeles County Asst. Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay decides who is charged with  special-circumstances offenses. He said his office files murder or manslaughter  charges in about 1,200 killings a year, but most of these are ""at the low end  -- friends killing friends or relatives killing each other.""    In 13 years, Livesay said, his office has filed only 1,200 special-circumstance  murder cases, pursued only 600 of those, sought the death penalty, as opposed  to life without parole, in 240 of those, and persuaded juries to impose a death  sentence in only 80 cases.    Livesay, who said that his own deliberations are complex, described one simple  rule of thumb: If a 19-year-old with no previous record robs a liquor store,  struggles with the proprietor and kills him, perhaps because the teen-ager's  gun discharged accidentally, it is probably not a death penalty case. On the  other hand, if the 19-year-old robber had an extensive criminal record, had the  proprietor kneel and then shot him in the head, it probably would be a death  penalty case.    Outside of Los Angeles County it is typically the elected district attorney,  rather than one of his assistants, who makes the final decision, and standards  differ widely from county to county, according to California Supreme Court  Justice Allen E. Broussard.    In upholding the death sentence in a Tuolomne County case of a 20-year-old who  shot a fisherman in the back of the head while robbing him, Broussard warned of  a problem. ""We have in effect 58 death penalty laws,"" or one for each county,  he said.    ""Under the guidelines established in most of the urban counties, (this) murder  . . . would not have been prosecuted as a capital case,"" he wrote.    A Death Row inmate from Merced County has based his pending appeal to the  California Supreme Court in part on a survey of scores of arguably more  horrible cases in which murderers were sentenced to life imprisonment.    California is not alone in having difficulty distinguishing which murderers  should get life and which death.    Tommy Morris, a death penalty advocate and member of the Georgia Board of  Pardons and Paroles, spoke of the problem in a 1987 interview with the Atlanta  Constitution. ""Any rational, reasonable person,"" he said, ""ought to be able to  take 100 life and 100 death cases and shuffle them, and come back and place  those cases back in the category they originally came from. And I'm saying it  can't be done. . . . When you look at death versus life cases, there's not a  heck of a lot of difference in most of them.""    There are even more dramatic inconsistencies between states. The late John  Kaplan, a Stanford University law professor, once observed that John  Spenkellink, the first man to be put to death in Florida since that state  resumed executions in the late 1970s, could have been convicted only of  second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter had he been tried in California.    ""The bottom line point,"" said New York lawyer Ronald J. Tabak, a death penalty  foe who chairs an American Bar Assn. committee on capital punishment, ""is that  your chances of getting selected for the death penalty depends to a large  extent on who the prosecutor is, how close to the election the prosecutor is,  how white or otherwise prominent your victim is, and a variety of other factors  that don't have to do with how terrible you are, or how terrible your crime is,  compared to other crimes.""    But Kate Canlis, director of the California Dist. Attys. Assn. said she is  unsympathetic to that point of view.    ""I don't believe standards vary greatly,"" she said. ""All of the people who are  tried as capital murderers are the worst of the worst,"" selected by prosecutors  who ""sort of know intuitively . . . who to single out.""    ""I know the kind of case when I see it,"" she said, explaining that it generally  involves a defendant with a violent history who deliberately chooses to kill in  an especially ""cold and callous"" manner.    The fact that prosecutors or juries have decided to show mercy and spare the  lives of others convicted of similar crimes is irrelevant, she said. The  relevant factor, she said, is whether the death penalty is a legally suitable  punishment for any individual crime.

""All of the people who are  tried as capital murderers are the worst of the worst,"" selected by prosecutors  who ""sort of know intuitively . . . who to single out.""    ""I know the kind of case when I see it,"" she said, explaining that it generally  involves a defendant with a violent history who deliberately chooses to kill in  an especially ""cold and callous"" manner.    The fact that prosecutors or juries have decided to show mercy and spare the  lives of others convicted of similar crimes is irrelevant, she said. The  relevant factor, she said, is whether the death penalty is a legally suitable  punishment for any individual crime.

By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN DIEGO      In highly emotional summations, a defense attorney and a prosecutor painted two  wildly divergent pictures of the woman who has admitted killing her former  husband and his new, young wife as they slept.    Calling it an ambush and a double execution, a prosecutor said Wednesday that  La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick fully intended to kill her  ex-husband and his wife because she crept into their bedroom while they slept  and ""blew them away.""    But as he has throughout the trial, defense attorney Jack Earley characterized  Broderick as an emotionally devastated woman who had intended only to kill  herself.    In a summation that the defense said badly miscast Broderick's emotional state,  Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said the killings were the culmination of years  of planning and a smoldering, constant hate for her ex-husband, prominent  lawyer Daniel T. Broderick III.    When the time was right -- after their four-year divorce was over, when Betty  Broderick had nothing left to gain in the courts and needed again to be the  ""center of attention"" -- she killed him and his new wife, Linda Kolkena  Broderick, Wells said.    Urging the jury to return two first-degree murder convictions, Wells said, ""You  don't point a .38-caliber gun loaded with hollow-tipped bullets at two people  lying in bed early in the morning and fire without intending to kill them.""    Broderick, 43, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the Nov. 5,  1989, killings. She could be sentenced to life in prison without parole.    Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a leading medical malpractice lawyer and a  former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Broderick, who was 28,  was his office assistant.    After 16 years of marriage, Daniel and Betty Broderick separated in 1985.  During their bitter divorce, which was not final until 1989, she accused her  husband of cheating her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual  income.    Earley said Wednesday that, as Betty Broderick had testified, she sought only  to talk to Daniel Broderick when she stole into his house, then crept into his  bedroom before dawn.    The Brodericks' bitter divorce had made her feel immense emotions of anger,  rage and depression, Earley said. Broderick stepped into the bedroom and  encountered another rush of emotion because, for the first time, she saw her  ex-husband in bed with his new wife, he said.    She fired her gun, but not in a cold and calculating way. Instead, she was at  the mercy of her emotions, out of control, like a boat without a rudder, Earley  said.    ""Her act was one of craziness, one of emotion, one that should never have  happened,"" he said.    Both lawyers were emotional during their closing arguments, raising their  voices often and gesturing frequently to the jury. Broderick, however, wrote  notes to her attorney and, for the most part, sat impassively with her chin in  a hand, looking away from the jury.    San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan said he would instruct jurors  today on their five options in the case -- first- and second-degree murder,  voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and not guilty on any charges.    The case, which has aroused extraordinary attention in San Diego, drew an  overflow crowd Wednesday to the county courthouse that included civics students  from El Cajon Valley High School.

0,FT941-2373 ,"FT941-2373 _AN-ECUC0AEGFT 940321   FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: At the fickle mercy of US securities - London      By TERRY BYLAND   The stock market continued to take its medicine manfully last week - smiling when the construction sector delivered a fresh batch of dividend increases and then grimacing when the UK and global bond traders showed they still had the power to disrupt the share market as well as their own. The flow of data on the domestic economy tended to confirm investors' belief that the British consumer is proving a poor leader for economic recovery. It is clear that equities will remain strongly influenced by the gilt-edged market until the institutions have finished reshaping their portfolios in the light of the rise in bond yields since the beginning of February. Shares are still at the mercy of sudden swings of mood in bonds and, with the Bundesbank effectively sidelined for a month, are now at the fickle mercy of the US Federal securities market. It is difficult to be sanguine ahead of a trading week which will include a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, auctions of Dollars 28m in US short-term bonds, trade figures on both sides of the Atlantic, and be topped up by an Opec meeting. The latest domestic retail price index arrives at mid-week, but should not change the timescale for the next cut in base rates. 'Rebalancing the recovery away from consumption . . .' sums up the new view taken of the stores sector by BZW, and others in the market. The UK investment bank, pinpointing 'the problem that the economy has in sustaining consumer-led growth', believes that the weakening of gross margins in the stores sector over Christmas will continue, perhaps for a full 12 months. Combined with the effective breakdown of orderly, non-price competition in such areas as the electrical, DIY and durable goods sectors, this implies an unusually risky outlook for the stores sector. Such strong names as Marks and Spencer, GUS and Boots are benefiting from the protection afforded them by brand franchises, cost advantages and the difficulties any upstart rival would find in entering their established markets. At the other end of the defensive scale, Argos, Dixons and Kingfisher are identified by BZW as facing vulnerable profit margin structures; gross margins on DIY are around five points below those for the industry average already. Longer-term views on the stock market are still bullish. 'The bull market is now well established,' is the opinion at Strauss Turnbull, which expects domestic interest rates to fall to 5 per cent very soon. Downward pressures on European rates and benign inflation in the UK should balance UK tax rises in April. The overall opinion is still that rates will come down, the economy will recover and this combination can only be good for share prices in the medium term. But the underlying worry is that the bond market may have already decided that interest rates are going higher later this year and that the stock market may have already discounted all the recovery on offer at present.

Because they -- the authorities -- are responsible  for the decisions and for implementing the laws. And neither  history nor the people will have mercy on them."" He urged GPC  and Socialist Party leaders to ""have mercy on the Yemeni people  and refer to the law.""

The General Committee of the GPC condemns and deplores such  criminal acts and asks the security and judicial quarters to  quickly put the criminals on trial to receive their just  punishment so as to avert fighting and deter anyone who  entertains the idea of disturbing society or undermining its  security and stability.

As the illness advances, usually the patient becomes blessedly  unaware of the problem. It is at that stage that most physicians will allow the  patient to die from the illness by withholding the medical support that  artificially sustains life. Even then, the decision must be made by the family  and physician taking into consideration the patient's previously known wishes.    The participants in active euthanasia are avoiding the difficult problems of  making the quality of life better for a patient with a bad disease.

It is at that stage that most physicians will allow the  patient to die from the illness by withholding the medical support that  artificially sustains life. Even then, the decision must be made by the family  and physician taking into consideration the patient's previously known wishes.    The participants in active euthanasia are avoiding the difficult problems of  making the quality of life better for a patient with a bad disease. They are  taking the convenient way out for themselves, masquerading their needs as mercy  for the patient. It was murder, not mercy and not medical care.    MICHAEL E.

He said the media is controlled by powerful  organizations established during the previous administration.    The president said such organizations frequently do not have  any mercy on the administration's need for space, adding that  his government was seated only a short time ago and had to  administer the many conflicts that currently are surfacing.    ""My government guarantees the most absolute freedom of the  press, which is controlled by powerful communications  organizations that were established during the previous  administration and that frequently do not have any mercy on the  administration's need for space in the short time it has had to  administer the many conflicts that are surfacing today,"" the  president said.    Wasmosy read his speech during a working luncheon with  European Parliament President Egon Klepsh and various European  deputies.    The head of state said the method for administering  conflicts  in a true democracy was quite different from the methods used in  the past autocracy.    Regarding the social crisis, Wasmosy told the European  deputies that his government was committed to facing the social  problems caused by poverty, disease, ignorance, and lack of  communications in wide areas of the country with courage and  determination.    Wasmosy said his government used the invaluable democratic  instrument of dialogue, compromise, and agreement with  opposition forces, adding that the opposition controlled both  houses of Congress.    The head of state stressed that this attitude permitted them  to close a pact with the opposition that will guarantee the  democratic governability of the country. Wasmosy said the pact  with the opposition will allow them to fulfill, in freedom, the  people's long delayed and legitimate aspirations.    The president admitted that the country's economy was  fragile  and weak because 76 percent of the 4 million inhabitants earned  their incomes from agriculture, adding that agriculture depended  on the success or failure of cotton and soybean crops, which  usually are affected by international markets' cyclical  variations.

The head of the political and sharia committee spoke to  AL-WASAT, having been authorized by ""the amir of the jama'ah""  [the prince of the group] Sayfallah Ja'far about the ideology,  plans, and relations of the group. He explained that it has  supporters in 39 out of Algeria's 48 governorates, and that the  jama'ah is held to be ""an extension of the jihad of Shaykh  Mustafa Buway'ali."" He emphasized that the jihad will be  sustained, since ""we do not recognize the secular separation of  the military and political action."" He considered the presence  of foreigners in his country to be ""part of a colonialist  infidel scheme,"" who, he said, ""represent the throbbing heart of  every occupation and are spies for the infidel in the land of  Islam."" He criticized the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. He  commended the Afghan jihad, indicating that ""we are in their  debt,"" noting that many of the Algerians who fought in  Afghanistan had joined the AIG.    It is to be recalled that the AIG recently decided to unite  the armed groups in Algeria, leaving out the FIS, whose present  leaders ""sold out on the cause."" A few days ago, it distributed  a statement in Peshawar, in which it pointed out that the ""unity  meeting"" among the military factions decided to merge their  groups under the designation of ""the Armed Islamic Group.""  These are Abu-'Adlan 'Abd-al-Haqq al-'Ayayidah, Dr. Abu-Ahmad  and his group, and Abu-'Abd-al-Rahman Sayyid Tarrani and his  delegation representing Shaykh al-Malyani. Sayfallah Ja'far was  assigned the leadership. The conferees formed a leading council  comprising military, sharia, political, and media bodies and  decided on the following:    1. The formulation of a comprehensive, national strategy in  the area of military operations.    2. The formulation of an accurate informational plan to  surmount the barrier of an internal and external news blackout.    3. The organization of the masses to the greatest possible  effectiveness.    4. Streamlining the arms procurement networks and  instituting new networks.    5. Instituting fund raising and spending networks.    6. Conducting a survey of the number of martyrs, mujahidin,  prisoners, with a view to looking after their families and their  needs.    7. Breaking the siege of the central governorates by  widening the base of operations so as to encompass the entire  country.    8. Keeping track of and killing traitors of the movement  [al-khawanah al-harakiyin], and sellers (hypocrites and spies).    9. Keeping the AIG under control, using sharia laws, and  spreading the sharia in the ranks of the mujahidin.    It is known that a number of the AIG members who fell, or  those who are still fighting, have participated in the Afghan  jihad. The AIG issues a weekly publication in Peshawar called  ""AL-ANSAR"" although it does not say that it speaks for the AIG.  It is printed abroad and distributed in Peshawar to Arabs who  fought in Afghanistan.    The following is the text of the interview with AL-WASAT,  which is the first press interview with one of the AIG leaders,  who received the AL-WASAT questions in Peshawar and sent them  abroad to receive answers to them. All this has taken place in  secrecy for security reasons:    [Question] When was the AIG established?    [Answer] In previous interviews, we said that the AIG is not  a newborn, but it has deep roots in the world of Islamic jihad.  In other words, the AIG is an extension to the jihad of Shaykh  Mustafa Buway'ali, may God have mercy on his soul. Above all,  the AIG is an extension to the first major battle which took  place between the believers and the infidels; namely, the Badr  Battle, which took place between the prophet, may God's peace  and blessing be upon him, and the infidels of Quraysh.    From an organizational, practical, and combat viewpoint, it  began in 1989, following the release of Shaykh Mustafa's aides  from prison, particularly Shaykh al-Malyani, may God have mercy  on his soul. Contacts then began within the ranks of those who  believe that jihad is a must when Islam is not implemented, when  the Muslims' land is usurped, when Muslim women are taken  captives, or when Muslim men are captured. As we expected, many  youths have joined Shaykh al-Malyani. Other cells from villages  and quarters, which were also preparing themselves for armed  jihad, have also joined Shaykh al-Malyani. In addition to this,  the youths who fought in Afghanistan have also joined the  shaykh. This is how the AIG was established. It later issued a  statement called ""the unity statement"" in which they explained  some of the main points of the program of action.    Direct military action began on 18 November 1991,  approximately two years after it was established and after  recruiting the cadres on which jihad depends pursuant to God's  order: Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of  your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into the  hearts of the enemies of God and your enemies. [koranic verse]    Decisionmaking is based on shura and the counselors'  opinions. This means that the AIG is based on a set of rules  that are already defined in books of jurisprudence and Islamic  politics of the pious predecessors, ulema, and reliable imams,  may God have mercy on their souls.    Concerning its military weight, it is responsible for most  of  the operations that are carried out in the country, foremost of  which are assassinations and the deportation of the foreigners,  crusaders, and Jews. It exists in approximately 39 governorates  out of the country's 48 governorates.    [Question] Was the AIG affected by the Afghan jihad?    [Answer] The blessed Afghan jihad has affected many Muslims  in the whole world. It has many advantages which can only be  denied by the unjust ones.    [Question] Do you believe in change brought about by  political action, or, to put it concisely, by violence?    [Answer] Your question prompts us to raise another important  question. What do you mean by ""political action""? If, by  political action, you mean joining suspect parliaments and  alliances, holding dialogue with tyrants, accepting the judgment  of infidelity rather than Islam, and having recourse to  international laws, such as the United Nations, the  International Court of Justice, and other Judeo-Christian  organizations, then it is the duty of every Muslim to disown and  repudiate such organizations. The mere thought of having  recourse to these organizations is against God's orders, let  alone joining them.    If, however, you mean by political action following Islamic  policy as agreed upon by the ulema of this nation, which  includes jihad and the promotion of virtue and suppression of  vice, then this is at the heart of our religion, indeed the peak  of it. Taking such a course of action is a collective duty,  which later becomes an individual duty. As for what you term  violence, this is a misrepresentation of God's words and is  meant to deceive the people. How can we consider ""jihad for the  cause of God"" as violence? Can any Muslim allow himself to say  this about God's words, unless he is a believer in the laws of  the East and the West, which serve their own interests? We do  not recognize the secular separation between military and  political action.    [Question] Why have you attacked foreigners, and what is the  message you want to deliver?    [Answer] We attacked foreigners (Jews, Christians, and  polytheists) because they are part of an infidel, colonialist  scheme. They represent a living artery and throbbing heart of  every occupation, be it external or domestic, explicit or  implicit. Also, those foreigners are spies for the infidels in  the Islamic world. In addition, those foreigners represent a  mainstay of the economy. If they live in peace, then this means  that the country is leading a normal life. However, killing and  fighting them is practical evidence of the weakness of the  infidel regime and the return of Islam as prophesied by the  prophet, may God's peace be upon him. [passage omitted]    [Question] There are reports about Iranian aid and  facilities from other neighboring states. How true is this? Do  you receive foreign support and how do you finance your military  operations?    [Answer] Iran is a Shiite state, and so we cannot receive  aid from it. God Almighty has saved us the trouble. But to God  belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the  hypocrites understand not. [Koranic verse]    [Question] What are the goals that you aspire to achieve by  armed action?    [Answer] It is a jihad for the cause of God, and not armed  action. Our only objective is to see God's law prevail, make  people worship God, end injustice and debauchery, and achieve  justice as the Koran orders us to do. By doing this, we seek  only to win God's satisfaction, and nothing else.    [Question] What is the nature of your relationship with the  Salvation Front, and can you ignore it? Suppose a change takes  place, are you qualified to fill the vacuum in terms of the  cadres, the army, police, security, etc?    [Answer] What front do you mean? There are many fronts,  many branches, and many spokesmen. Be more specific so that we  can give you an answer. [passage omitted]    [Question] Several names in the Algerian arena adopt  violence. What are the major groups in terms of strength and  presence in the arena of military action?    [Answer] There is a great clamor regarding this. Those who  read local and international press believe that the number of  the armed group exceeds 600 or 1,000 sometimes. This is  incredible; it is a legendary figure. The objective and purpose  of this are well-known. The media want to show the world that  there is conflict in order to frustrate the Muslims and create  confusion in their ranks. God willing, events will prove that  certain people only are burdening themselves with the blessed  jihad.    [Question] The Islamic Front has formed an army. Are you  ready to join it or cooperate with it?    [Answer] We would like to ask: Which front are you talking  about and which army do you mean. Many statements have been  made regarding this army now that capitulatory peaceful  solutions have become imminent. The AIG is carrying the banner  of ""There Is No God but Allah"" in the battlefield. We have not  heard about this army nor sensed its reality. He who has  anything else to say should prove it inside, in the land of fire  and dust, not in the Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, or Hilton  Hotels.    [Question] If the FIS reaches a compromise with the Algerian  regime, what will be your response?    [Answer] The Mujahidin Shura Council and the Islamic Courts  will decide what should be done if such a thing takes place.    [Question] Do your attacks on Rabeh Kebir and Abdallah Anas  represent your opposition to them personally or to the FIS?    [Answer] We oppose policies, not persons; we oppose actions,  not faces. In the end, we oppose all those who leave the  battlefield and escape the tremor. Previous experiments alone  are not criteria to judge people. The pretext that they  participated in the fighting in the past but they have abandoned  it now is not accepted. What counts is the end, not the  beginning. You can judge all those who are in your mind in  accordance with this rule.    [Question] What is the next strategy of the military action?  Do you believe that the previous operations or strategy will be  followed?    [Answer] We cannot now define a specific strategy.  Continuing or changing the strategy depends on many tactical,  geographical, social, and military factors. Therefore, we  cannot deal with this now. However, some explorations here and  there would reveal the features of the coming stage, God willing.    [Question] What kind of relationship is there between you  and  the military action groups in Egypt and other Arab states?    [Answer] It is a relationship that the holy Koran has  ordered  us to develop. ""But if they seek your aid in religion, it is  your duty to help them"" [Koranic verse]. In the same vein, the  messenger of God, God's peace and blessings be upon him, says:  ""All Muslims are brothers. They must not fail, disgrace, or  wrong each other."" [passage omitted]    [Question] When you select the targets of your military  operations, do you mean to convey a political message or signal  beyond the operation itself, or is the objective just to kill  without intending to convey any signals?    [Answer] Targets for military operations are selected in  implementation of God's words: ""And slay them wherever you  catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you  out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter.""  [Koranic verse]    [Question] A change in any state must cover many and various  fields, especially in view of the fact that social, political,  and economic relations are interlinked. Through your action, we  notice that you focus on the military aspect only.    [Answer] Establishing the pillars of the Muslim caliphate  requires greater efforts by us. We are still at the beginning.  We have not arrived at the stage that will enable us to think  of such issues. Now we should stand firmly on the ground.  Afterward, God will help us go ahead. ""And those who strive in  our cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily  God is with those who do right."" [Koranic verse]    [Question] Any armed movement or revolution needs  traditional  leaders or symbols. Do you have such symbols? Are you capable  of winning such symbols? Who among the Algerian personalities  would you nominate for leading your action?    [Answer] The existence of symbols is not a prerequisite for  waging jihad. It is favorable and nice to have symbols. But if  we suppose--and this is the actual situation in Algeria--that  there is no specific symbol, will jihad cease to exist as a  duty? This jihad began without outstanding symbols. It began  with the youth. From the womb of the ordeal, symbols will be  born, God willing.    As for the nomination of leading personalities, certain  conditions must be observed. In addition to some leadership  traits that must exist in the symbol, he must have participated  in jihad and military operations and must have killed a  considerable number of the enemies of God.

LOZANO, Times Staff Writer      A 26-year-old West Hills man was sentenced Tuesday to 32 years to life in  prison for hammering and stabbing to death two roommates because one of them  refused to give him cocaine.    Mark Jay Demand was convicted by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles  last month of two counts of second-degree murder in connection with the Jan.  18, 1988, slayings. The defense asked the judge to hear the case without a  jury.    The victims, Lori Elm, 18, and her boyfriend, Robert Ray Burley, 26, had been  dead at least a week when their bodies were found in the house that they had  shared with Demand in the 7500 block of Kentland Avenue, police said. Both had  been beaten with a hammer. Burley had also been stabbed several times.    Mireles on Tuesday imposed the maximum allowable sentence on Demand, saying  that he disagreed with defense attorney Howard Waco and members of the  defendant's family that drugs were to blame for Demand's violent actions.      'Don't Blame Cocaine'    ""I don't blame cocaine,"" Mireles said. ""I blame children and adults who don't  have the values to reject a substance that physically and emotionally destroys  them. I don't sympathize with anyone who thinks cocaine is the problem. People  are the problem.""    Before Demand's sentencing, Patrick Elm, father of the victim, asked to read a  statement to the court:    ""All of us are victims of this horrendous crime,"" Elm said, referring to  several members of his family present in the courtroom. ""The grieving and  day-to-day sorrow cannot be described. . . . We plead to the court to show no  mercy toward Mark Demand. Mark Demand surely showed no mercy toward his  victims.""    Elm has said his daughter only knew Burley and Demand a few weeks prior to her  death.      'I'm Sorry'    Demand, who appeared nervous throughout the short proceeding, also asked to  speak. ""I'm sorry for what I've done. I don't know how it happened. . . . I  don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself.""    Police said Demand, who lived and worked at the house in exchange for drugs,  attacked the couple after Burley refused to give him cocaine. Police believe  that Burley was a cocaine dealer and said two large pythons found in the house  were apparently used to guard his drugs.    After the killings, Demand took two pounds of cocaine from the house and fled  to Las Vegas in a taxi, police said. Once in Las Vegas, he was arrested in a  hotel on a charge of possession of cocaine for sale.    He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Nevada, then extradited to Los  Angeles to face the murder charges. Mireles ruled Tuesday that Demand will  serve his sentences concurrently.

The head of the political and sharia committee spoke to  AL-WASAT, having been authorized by ""the amir of the jama'ah""  [the prince of the group] Sayfallah Ja'far about the ideology,  plans, and relations of the group. He explained that it has  supporters in 39 out of Algeria's 48 governorates, and that the  jama'ah is held to be ""an extension of the jihad of Shaykh  Mustafa Buway'ali"". He emphasized that the jihad will be  sustained, since ""we do not recognize the secular separation of  the military and political action"". He considered the presence  of foreigners in his country to be ""part of a colonialist  infidel scheme"", who, he said, represent the throbbing heart of  every occupation and are spies for the infidel in the land of  Islam"". He criticized the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] . He  commended the Afghan jihad, indicating that ""we are in their  debt"", noting that many of the Algerians who fought in  Afghanistan had joined the AIG.    It is to be recalled that the AIG recently decided to unite  the armed groups in Algeria, leaving out the FIS, whose present  leaders ""sold out on the cause"". A few days ago, it distributed  a statement in Peshawar, in which it pointed out that the ""unity  meeting"" among the military factions decided to merge there  groups under the designation of ""the Armed Islamic Group"".  These are Abu-'Adlan 'Abd-al-Haqq al-'Ayayidah, Dr. Abu-Ahmad  and his group, and Abu- 'Abd-al-Rahman Sayyid Tarrani and his  delegation representing Shaykh al-Malyani. Sayfallah Ja'far was  assigned the leadership. The conferees formed a leading council  comprising military, shura, political, and media bodies and  decided on the following:    1. The formulation of a comprehensive, national strategy in  the area of military operations.    2. The formulation of an accurate informational plan to  surmount the barrier of an internal and external news blackout.    3. The organization of the masses to the greatest possible  effectiveness.    4. Streamlining the arms procurement networks and  instituting new networks.    5. Instituting fund raising and spending networks.    6. Conducting a survey of the number of martyrs, mujahidin,  prisoners, with a view to looking after their families and their  needs.    7. Breaking the siege of the central governorates by  widening the base of operations so as to encompass the entire  country.    8. Keeping track of and killing traitors of the movement  [al-khawanah al-harakiyin], and sellers (hypocrites and spies).    9. Keeping the AIG under control, using shura laws, and  spreading the shari'ah in the ranks of the mujahidin.    It is known that a number of the AIG members, who fell, or  those who are still fighting, have participated in the Afghan  jihad. The AIG issues a weekly publication in Peshawar called  ""AL-ANSAR"" although it does not say that it speaks for the AIG.  It is printed abroad and distributed in Peshawar to Arabs who  fought in Afghanistan.    The following is the text of the interview with AL-WASAT,  which is the first press interview with one of the AIG leaders,  who received the AL-WASAT questions in Peshawar and sent them  abroad to receive answers to them. All this has taken place in  secrecy for security reasons:    [AL-WASAT] When the AIG was established?    [Unidentified AIG Leader] In previous interviews, we said  that the AIG is not a newborn, but it has deep roots in the  world of Islamic jihad. In other words, the AIG is an extension  to the jihad of Shaykh Mustafa Buway'ali, may God have mercy on  his soul. Above all, the AIG is an extension to the first major  battle which took place between the believers and the infidels;  namely, the Badr Battle, which took place between the prophet,  may God peace and blessing be upon him, and the infidels of  Quraysh.    From an organizational, practical, and combat viewpoint, it  began in 1989, following the release of Shaykh Mustafa's aides  from prison, particularly Shaykh al-Malyani, may God have mercy  on his soul. Contacts then began within the ranks of those who  believe that jihad is a must when Islam is not implemented, when  the Muslims' land is usurped, when Muslim women are taken  captives, or when Muslim men are captured. As we expected, many  youths have joined Shaykh al-Malyani. Other cells from villages  and quarters, which were also preparing themselves for armed  jihad, have also joined Shaykh al-Malyani. In addition to this,  the youths who fought in Afghanistan have also joined the  shaykh. This is how the AIG was established. It later issued a  statement called ""the unity statement"" in which they explained  some of the main points of the the program of action.    Direct military action began on 18 November 1991,  approximately two years after it was established and after  recruiting the cadres on which jihad depends pursuant to God's  order: Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of  your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into the  hearts of the enemies of God and your enemies. [koranic verse]    Decisionmaking is based on shari'ah and the counselors'  opinions. This means that the AIG is based on a set of rules  that are already defined in books of jurisprudence and Islamic  politics of the pious predecessors, ulema, and reliable imams,  may God have mercy on their souls.    Concerning its military weight, it is responsible for most  of  the operations that are carried out in the country, foremost of  which are assassinations and the deportation of the foreigners,  crusaders, and Jews. It exists in approximately 39 governorates  out of the country's 48 governorates.    [AL-WASAT] Was the AIG affected by the Afghan jihad?    [AIG Leader] The blessed Afghan jihad has affected many  Muslims in the whole world. It has many advantages which can  only be denied by the unjust ones.    [AL-WASAT] Do you believe in change brought about by  political action, or, to put it concisely, by violence?    [AIG Leader] Your question prompts us to raise another  important question. What do you mean by ""political action""?  If, by political action, you mean joining suspect parliaments  and alliances, holding dialogue with tyrants, accepting the  judgment of infidelity rather than Islam, and having recourse to  international laws, such as the United Nations, the  International Court of Justice, and other Judeo-Christian  organizations, then it is the duty of every Muslim to disown and  repudiate such organizations. The mere thought of having  recourse to these organizations is against God's orders, let  alone joining them.    If, however, you mean by political action following Islamic  policy as agreed upon by the ulema of this nation, which  includes jihad and the promotion of virtue and suppression of  vice, then this is at the heart of our religion, indeed the peak  of it. Taking such a course of action is a collective duty,  which later becomes an individual duty. As for what you term  violence, this is a misrepresentation of God's words and is  meant to deceive the people. How can we consider ""jihad for the  cause of God"" as violence? Can any Muslim allow himself to say  this about God's words, unless he is a believer in the laws of  the East and the West, which serve their own interests? We do  not recognize the secular separation between military and  political action.    [AL-WASAT] Why have you attacked foreigners, and what is the  message you want to deliver?    [AIG Leader] We attacked foreigners (Jews, Christians, and  polytheists) because they are part of an infidel, colonialist,  scheme. They represent a living artery and throbbing heart of  every occupation, be it external or domestic, explicit or  implicit. Also, those foreigners are spies for the infidels in  the Islamic world. In addition, those foreigners represent a  mainstay of the economy. If they live in peace, then this means  that the country is leading a normal life. However, killing and  fighting them is practical evidence of the weakness of the  infidel regime and the return of Islam as prophesied by the  prophet, may God's peace be upon him. [passage omitted]    [AL-WASAT] There are reports about Iranian aid and  facilities from other neighboring states. How true is this? Do  you receive foreign support and how do you finance your military  operations?    [AIG Leader] Iran is a Shiite state, and so we cannot  receive aid from it. God Almighty has saved us the trouble.  But to God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth,  but the hypocrites understand not. [Koranic verse]    [AL-WASAT] What are the goals that you aspire to achieve by  armed action?    [AIG Leader] It is a jihad for the cause of God, and not  armed action. Our only objective is to see God's law prevail,  make people worship God, end injustice and debauchery, and  achieve justice as the Koran orders us to do. By doing this, we  seek only to win God's satisfaction, and nothing else.    [AL-WASAT] What is the nature of your relationship with the  Salvation Front, and can you ignore it? Suppose a change takes  place, are you qualified to fill the vacuum in terms of the  cadres, the army, police, security, etc?    [AIG Leader] What front do you mean? There are many fronts,  many branches, and many spokesmen. Be more specific so that we  can give you an answer. [passage omitted]    [AL-WASAT] Several names in the Algerian arena adopt  violence. What are the major groups in terms of strength and  presence in the arena of military action?    [AIG Leader] There is a great clamor regarding this. Those  who read local and international press believe that the number  of the armed group exceeds 600 or 1,000 sometimes. This is  incredible; it is a legendary figure. The objective and purpose  of this are well known. The media wants to show the world that  there is conflict in order to frustrate the Muslims and create  confusion in their ranks. God willing, events will prove that  certain people only are burdening themselves with the blessed  jihad.    [AL-WASAT] The FIS has formed an army. Are you ready to join  it or cooperate with it?    [AIG Leader] We would like to ask: Which front are you  talking about and which army do you mean. Many statements have  been made regarding this army now that capitulatory peaceful  solutions have become imminent. The AIG is carrying the banner  of ""There Is No God but Allah"" in the battlefield. We have not  heard about this army nor sensed its reality. He who has  anything else to say should prove it inside, in the land of fire  and dust, not in the Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, or Hilton  Hotels.    [AL-WASAT] If the FIS reaches a compromise with the Algerian  regime, what will be your response?    [AIG Leader] The Mujahidin Shura Council and the Islamic  Courts will decide what should be done if such a thing takes  place.    [AL-WASAT] Do your attacks on Rabeh Kebir and Abdallah Anas  represent your opposition to them personally or to the FIS?    [AIG Leader] We oppose policies, not persons; we oppose  actions, not faces. In the end, we oppose all those who leave  the battlefield and escape the tremor. Previous experiments  alone are not criteria to judge people. The pretext that they  participated in the fighting in the past but they have abandoned  it now is not accepted. What counts is the end, not the  beginning. You can judge all those who are in your mind in  accordance with this rule.    [AL-WASAT] What is the next strategy of the military action?  Do you believe that the previous operations or strategy will be  followed?    [AIG Leader] We cannot now define a specific strategy.  Continuing or changing the strategy depends on many tactical,  geographical, social, and military factors. Therefore, we  cannot deal with this now. However, some explorations here and  there would reveal the features of the coming stage, God willing.    [AL-WASAT] What kind of relationship is there between you  and the military action groups in Egypt and other Arab states?    [AIG Leader] It is a relationship that the holy Koran has  ordered us to develop. ""But if they seek your aid in religion,  it is your duty to help them"" [Koranic verse]. In the same  vein, the messenger of God, God's peace and blessings be upon  him, says: ""All Muslims are brothers. They must not fail,  disgrace, or wrong each other."" [passage omitted]    [AL-WASAT] When you select the targets of your military  operations, do you mean to convey a political message or signal  beyond the operation itself, or is the objective is just to kill  without intending to convey any signals?    [AIG Leader] Targets for military operations are selected in  implementation of God's words: ""And slay them wherever you catch  them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for  tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter."" [Koranic verse]    [AL-WASAT] A change in any state must cover many and various  fields, especially in view of the fact that social, political,  and economic relations are interlinked. Through your action, we  notice that you focus on the military aspect only.    [AIG Leader] Establishing the pillars of the Muslim  caliphate  requires greater efforts by us. We are still at the beginning.  We have not arrived at the stage that will enable us to think  of such issues. Now we should stand firmly on the ground.  Afterward, God will help us go ahead. ""And those who strive in  our cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily  God is with those who do right."" [Koranic verse]    [AL-WASAT] Any armed movement or revolution needs  traditional  leaders or symbols. Do you have such symbols? Are you capable  of winning such symbols? Who among the Algerian personalities  would you nominate for leading your action?    [AIG Leader] The existence of symbols is not a prerequisite  for waging jihad. It is favorable and nice to have symbols.  But if we suppose--and this is the actual situation in  Algeria--that there is no specific symbol, will jihad cease to  exist as a duty? This jihad began without outstanding symbols.  It began with the youth. From the womb of the ordeal, symbols  will be born, God willing.    As for the nomination of leading personalities, certain  conditions must be observed. In addition to some leadership  traits that must be exist in the symbol, he must have  participated in jihad and military operations and must have  killed a considerable number of the enemies of God.

The  Peruvian economy had shrunk by an amazing 20 percent during the  two previous years and inflation was running at 7,000 percent.  A U.S. company that specializes in risk analysis rated Peru as  the most dangerous place in the world to do business.    Over a span of less than four years, President Fujimori has  managed to overcome formidable obstacles. His government has  dealt such a heavy blow to the Shining Path that many Peruvians  who had to emigrate -- and even some tourists -- are returning  to what used to be battlefields. Fujimori's free trade policy  has curbed inflation and turned our country into the fastest  growing economy in the Americas. It is hardly surprising that  he now enjoys overwhelming popularity among his fellow  countrymen.    Despite all this, Fujimori has been unable to achieve one  crucial victory -- to be accepted by the U.S. Government. Some  U.S. officials say Fujimori's achievements will always be  stained by the harsh tactics he used to redress that state of  affairs. In April 1992, President Fujimori dissolved Congress,  suspended the Constitution, and took almost total control of the  country on the grounds that this was the only way to prevent the  savage Shining Path from seizing power and to end dilatory  tactics in the Peruvian Congress which thwarted the economic  reform. Peruvians applauded Fujimori's decision to wage a war  against the guerrillas and to undertake economic reforms.    The United States, however, condemned his actions and  suspended its economic aid even though Fujimori kept his promise  of holding Parliamentary elections to draft a new Constitution.  Human rights associations and leftist groups displayed more  concern about this than about the suffering of the Peruvian  people when their lives were at the mercy of Shining Path  terrorists -- at the mercy of whom they still are to a certain  extent because the Shining Path killed 750 people last year.  U.S. Congress leaders and President Clinton contend that it is  impossible to settle the issue of U.S. economic aid to Peru  unless Fujimori takes additional steps to strengthen the  democratic process and to improve respect for human rights in  Peru.    Nevertheless, the Clinton administration does not consider  democracy to be a top priority when dealing with countries that  are more strategically important. Washington openly endorsed  Yeltsin when he dissolved the Russian Parliament last year.  Fujimori argues that Yeltsin undoubtedly drew his inspiration  from Peru and that Russian intelligence services consulted their  Peruvian counterparts before Yeltsin's action.    Private investors have already reached their own conclusions  concerning Peru and are expeditiously acting to support our  country through their investments because it offers so many  possibilities, is making headway to consolidate its stability,  and its president enjoys enormous popularity at home.    It is high time for the Clinton administration to give up  its  hypocritical and moralistic attitude, which it readily overlooks  whenever interests dictate, and to resume its economic aid to  Peru.

Several hours earlier, some tens of thousands of  persons, a majority of them women, staged a demonstration  against the Islamists. The demonstrators criticed authorities  for failure to move more boldly against the Islamist movements  and reaffirmed their rejection of any ""dialogue"" with those  elements.    On Tuesday, 22 March, Roger-Michel Drouaier, a partner in a  private enterprise, and his son Pascal-Valery, 24, were murdered  ""with weapons of cold steel by five terrorists"" in their  Birkhadem home on the southern outskirts of Algiers, the  security services announced on Wednesday. The double  assassination brings to 32--including eight Frenchmen--the  number of foreigners who have fallen victim to terrorists in  Algeria in the last six months.    On the very day of this latest attack, a march against  Islamist terrorism was held in Algiers at the instigation of  womens' associations. According to the most reliable estimates,  20,000-50,000 people participated in the demonstration, although  public-service national radio put the number of participants at  150,000. Two party leaders--Said Sadi, secretary general of the  Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), and Hachemi Cherif,  secretary-general of the Ettahaddi (communist) party--were seen  marching alongside other organizers of the event.    With shouts of, ""Too much blood, too many tears, together  let  us save Algeria!,"" ""Women deserve respect and reject  subjugation!"", and even ""Free and democratic Algeria!"", the  demonstrators started at the Advanced College of Fine Arts  (whose director was assassinated, along with his son, on 5  March) and proceeded slowly up the boulevard leading to Addis  Ababa Square, where the official National Human Rights  Observation Post (ONDH) is situated.    Some groups of demonstrators chanted slogans that were even  more policy-prescriptive: ""No mercy or dialogue with killers!"",  ""To negotiate with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) is to  negotiate the army's surrender!""    These latter slogans directly echoed the position taken by a  part of the French-language press that is opposed to any  dialogue with the Islamist movement and that is sounding the  alarm, more and more openly, of the possible breakup of the  Army. However, one of the demonstrators' posters appealed to the  ""state president,"" General Liamine Zeroual, for ""a progressive,  democratic, open, and tolerant Algeria"" and proclaimed the  rejection of ""exile,"" ""submission,"" and ""compromise."" Strict  security precautions were taken to protect the demonstration,  with several riot squad vans stationed nearby and policemen  posted on rooftops overlooking the marchers to surveil the crowd  and vicinity. Similar marches were held the same day in Oran  (west), Constantine, Annaba (east), Tizi-Ouzou, and Bejaia  (Kabylia). Although not explicitly endorsing the demonstrations,  labor leaders with the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA)  and the Union of Public-Sector Entrepreneurs (UNEP) called a  work stoppage as a gesture of ""mourning"" and tribute to the  victims of Islamist terrorism. Activity in most government  offices, as well as in banks and the transport sector, was  sharply reduced by the one-day strike. Algiers, for once, looked  like a dead city.    It could be misleading to compare this womens' march with a  similar event mounted just a year ago by UGTA, which drew  100,000 participants. The reduced participation in the latest  demonstration largely reflects the sharp escalation of violence  over the last six months and the climate of terror that has  reigned since early February. In a joint editorial entitled:  ""Three Questions to Our Leaders,"" 13 daily newspapers and  periodicals have publicly demanded that the head of state answer  such questions as: ""Does `dialogue' apply to the fundamentalists  or to the productive sectors of society? What is the social  model our leaders are trying to realize? How far are they  prepared to go in its pursuit? To the point of bloodbath?"" They  called for an ""official response"" from President Zeroual. The  editors also decided to hold a strike next Saturday and Sunday  to protest a Monday, 21 March, terrorist attack on HEBDO  LIBERE's headquarters that killed two employees.    Death Toll    The 22 March killing of two Frenchmen in the suburbs of  Algiers has raised the toll of foreigners assassinated in  Algeria over the last six months to 32, including eight  Frenchmen.    Several incidents in the last few weeks have deepened  anxiety  among members of the French community still in the country. For  example, a French gendarme out of uniform was recently attacked  in downtown Annaba, miraculously escaping the bullets of his  assailants. A Frenchwoman residing in Algiers was kidnapped and  held prisoner for several hours before being released unharmed.  Finally one of her attackers, who had not recognized her at  first, introduced herself as ""her neighbor"" and released the  Frenchwoman.     "

0,FT924-14248 ,"FT924-14248 _AN-CJKABAEAFT 921010   FT  10 OCT 92 / Cambodia's fields of pity: John Westbrooke tries to make sense of a country's tragic past      By JOHN WESTBROOKE   NOTHING looks special about the killing fields of Choeung Ek. They are just fields, in the countryside some 10 miles outside Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital. But one day in 1980 a cow's hoof sank into the soil and, investigating, its owner found human bones. There are many such cemeteries round the country, the legacy of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978. At Choeung Ek, 9,000 skeletons were exhumed from a series of shallow mass graves, each some 10ft across. You can walk round inside the slender tower put up as a memorial. On shelves in the middle are 8,000 skulls, labelled according to sex and age ('Juvenile female Kampuchean, from 15 to 20 years'). They might be centuries old, but they are not: had they lived, many would have been younger than me. I asked Mr Sann, my guide - a former English teacher who trained in Singapore - if any had been identified. Only the Europeans, he giggled (Sann giggled a lot); eight or nine of these had been named and returned to their families. But he pointed to a collection of disinterred rags under the bottom shelf: 'Last year, a lady found some shorts here. Her husband's' Outside, a notice board mourns the dead in words which are, somehow, the more disturbing for their fractured English: 'We seem to be looking at the horrifying scenes and the panic-stricken faces of the people who were dying of starvation, forced labour or torture without mercy upon the skinny body, they died without giving the last words to their kith and kin.' To save bullets, many were just hit on the head with hoes while tractor engines were revved-up to drown the screams. Guards are posted around the monument; Sann said they were scared to go near it after dark. In the circumstances, perhaps there should be an eerie stillness around the memorial. But that is not so. There is a school nearby and you can hear the children laughing and playing; little girls in white blouses and navy skirts waved as we drove by. Down the bumpy roads are stalls selling beer, cigarettes and petrol in soft drink bottles. Ordinary little houses, on stilts, have porches decorated with pictures - mostly of the Buddha, but I spotted one of a young lady in a transparent nightdress. So, I was little wiser as to how Cambodians felt about the years of terror. The story is appalling. The Khmer Rouge rebels led by Pol Pot were welcomed as liberators after overthrowing the corrupt Lon Nol regime (Phnom Penh fell just before Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war); but, working to a plan to turn all of Cambodia into a sort of collective farm, they proclaimed 1975 Year Zero, renamed the country Kampuchea, and drove everyone into the countryside to work in the fields. Anyone suspected of being a saboteur, or an agent of the hated Vietnamese, or of anyone else, was likely to be tortured and killed. This included any intellectuals - anyone, for instance, who spoke a foreign language; even anyone who wore glasses. So, how did bespectacled, English-speaking Sann survive? He giggled. 'My students protected me. Many of them joined the Khmer Rouge. They remembered me and protected me and my wife and family. (Giggle). I had to work in the country on a farm. My wife was on another farm but I was allowed to see her every month. My mother and my father and my sister were killed. (Giggle). But my students protected me.' Why was he giggling? It seemed impertinent even to wonder. The Khmer Rouge laid claim to an area of South Vietnam and, after a series of border clashes, the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia. Within days, the Khmer Rouge had fled. (Pol Pot now lives in Thailand; the Thais, like the US, seem not to mind, on the ground that any enemy of Vietnam is a friend of theirs. Some of his former associates are still in power). Returning Cambodians found Phnom Penh a ghost town used as a storehouse. Houses in one street were used for keeping left shoes; right shoes were in another street across town. Its population, swollen by refugees to 3m in 1975, is still less than a third of that; of the country's 7m people, about 1m had died. One of the things the Vietnamese discovered was Tuol Sleng, a school in Phnom Penh used as an interrogation centre. Now, it is a museum; as with the killing fields, the Cambodians want everyone to see it. Notices list the Security Regulations: 'Don't try to hide the facts by making protests this and that. You are strictly prohibited to contest me . . . While getting lashes or electrification, you must not cry at all . . . If you disobey any point of my regulations, you shall get either 10 lashes or five shocks of electric discharge.' Several rooms had fresh corpses in them when the Vietnamese arrived; they buried the bodies but the rooms are otherwise as they were found, bloodstains and all. Most unsettling, though, is the display of victims. The meticulous interrogators photographed them all as they arrived; and the photos, row on row, hundreds on hundreds, line the walls of the old schoolrooms. Almost all, 17,000 of them, were tortured until they confessed; then they were sent to Choeung Ek. Confessed to what? What did the Khmer Rouge want of them? You can see, by stretching the imagination, why it might (for instance) have suited Hitler to demonise the Jews; but what sense can the mass slaughter of Cambodians by Cambodians have made? Can you even call it genocide when they were killing their own race? Not all of the victims died: half a dozen escaped alive from Tuol Sleng when the Vietnamese came. One of them is still there - showing tourists around. What are you doing here? I wanted to ask him. Why haven't you fled to the ends of the earth to get away from this place? But then I remembered Sann's unfathomable giggles and realised that, whatever this man might answer, I would never understand it; so I did not ask. Sann was reunited with his family and adopted two orphaned children. Now, he works for the government, like many Cambodians, but his wages (only about Dollars 5 a month, anyway) had not been paid for months. He supplements his income by guiding tourists, dubbing films into Khmer, and occasional teaching. The Vietnamese have gone home; the UN is trying to run the country (sending in troops to scour it for unexploded mines); and businesses such as hotels are being sold abroad for the hard currency. Cambodia is in a mess.  The Financial Times   London Page XI  "

The Interior Ministry warning, broadcast on Algiers Radio, came on the eve of a threatened mass demonstration in Algiers by followers of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which is outlawed under a state of emergency proclaimed last week. The broadcast said the security forces were determined to 'find and neutralise all terrorists and authors of unrest and subversive acts'. This latest warning followed an attack yesterday on a guard post at a naval repair yard in Algiers in which one guard died and two others were wounded. Algiers Radio reported that two of the assailants were killed in an exchange of gunfire.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

When a natural disaster strikes, they can get a premium from  disaster insurance.    In the nine counties and cities around Hangzhou, the  provincial capital, a cooperative disaster-relieving insurance  now covers more than 70 percent of the farm households.    To work out a social security system in rural China is a new  issue which the country is exploring in the process of  developing a market economy.    Such insurance also helps put an end to the traditional  practice of farmers having more children in order to guarantee a  secure old age, one of the causes of China's huge population.     "

O nation of Islam: Look at the sedition in the ranks of the  Muslim nation. There is sedition as well as wars, internecine  fighting and mutual destruction in a number of Muslim countries.  Sedition which has led to loss of life, property and the  destruction of the country. But who benefits from all this?  Muslims should fear God and their religion; they should spare  the destruction of their people and should remember that God  will be questioning them on the sedition and the wars and He  will be judging them on that sedition. O nation of Islam, you  should fear God.    Let us go back to the teachings of our true religion. Let us  make God's teachings an arbiter in our problems. Let us think  and contemplate that such sedition will not bring any good to  our nation. It will only bring destruction to property and  people. And it will only sow the seeds of hatred between  members of the nation. It will make it less united and it will  destroy its resources. You should, O nation of Islam, fear God,  use your wisdom and try to avoid sedition. Nothing good will  ever come from sedition. [passage omitted]    O nation of Islam, nation of Islam: The enemies of the  nation  have been trying to discredit it by claiming that Islam has  ignored human rights and that the latter has been ignored in  Muslim faith. This is a lie and a fallacy. Anyone who cares to  examine our faith will find out that it is the faith which has  guaranteed the true meaning of human rights. God has said to  his messenger: We have sent thee, save as a mercy unto all  beings. [passage omitted]    Human rights have been guaranteed under our faith. Creeds  before Islam used to fight each other. Whenever a creed  triumphed over another one it tried to annihilate it as much as  it could. But once God sent Muhammad, may God's prayers and  benedictions be upon him, as a mercy to the nation and to  humanity... Hence, human rights are respected by our shari'ah  and by the Muslim faith. Believers must, however, obey the  shari'ah; they must obey its divine ordinance on what is  permitted and what is not. Their religion has urged them to do  so. The true Muslim is someone who would not harm other Muslims  by words or deeds. [last sentence from the hadith] [passage  omitted]    Our religion has protected human rights for everybody and  those who claim respect for human rights are the ones who are  the enemies of mankind, the ones whose societies gave birth to  racial and ethnic discrimination, the ones who are making  weapons of destruction so that the Islamic nations use them to  eliminate one another. They are the ones who ignite sedition.  Islam, with its tenets, is innocent of the terrible events and  horrible massacres which one sees around. [passage omitted:  Islam is against dishonesty and treacherous behavior; giving  examples from the prophet's behaviour]    Islam is a religion of mercy, justice, and equity, and those  who (?allege) that Islam relinquishes the human rights of  Muslims and non-Muslims are deceiving people. Islam protects  the very meaning of human rights. [passage omitted: the ummah  and its leaders are abiding by the Islamic law as dictated by  the Holy Book]    Muslims should not listen to the ideas, deceptions, and  calumnies of the enemies of Islam. They must trust their  religion and know that their Islam is God's religion, which  Allah chose and entrusted his messenger to convey. [passage  omitted]     "
0,FT933-12556 ,"FT933-12556 _AN-DGWCHAEGFT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / Personal Viewpoint: Folly of promoting ethnic divisions      By MUHAMED SACIRBEY   Talk is cheap - that is the familiar ex-pression. But for the Bosnians talk has been anything but cheap. For well over a year, we have committed ourselves to negotiations with a criminally brutal enemy because western powers insisted that they would not allow an unjust outcome and that they were prepared to enforce a just peace agreement. As we gird ourselves for the next painful stage of resistance, we can look back and clearly see what has made all the negotiations to date both fruitless and dishonourable. We can thus define the circumstances under which they can be more efficacious in the future. So far, the negotiating process has been so flawed as not only to produce an unjust outcome but actually to encourage further war. The reasons for this flaw and the means to correct it are as follows: 1. Crimes and aggression have been committed against our people and republic in the past under the convenient cover of negotiations. Negotiations should no longer be abused and misused to undermine peace, and should only proceed on the basis of an effective ceasefire guaranteed by the international community; 2. The international community cannot morally, legally or diplomatically sanction negotiations while the 'gun of genocide' is held to the head of the Bosnians. This only encourages abuses by Serbian nationalist forces and erodes the credibility of the international community. The sieges and heavy weaponry around our cities must be removed or neutralised. Humanitarian relief must be delivered, and the international community must not allow the supplies to be blocked or looted. 3. The government of the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be confronted across the table by its ultra nationalist enemies while all leverage is in their hands. This only emboldens extremists. Such negotiations bolster those accused of war crimes, delegitimise moderates, democrats and those committed to pluralism, encourage fragmentation, and place the victim at the mercy of the aggressor. The international community must be prepared to confront the aggressors if they do not honour their commitments. At the minimum, the international community must not obstruct or hinder the self-defence of the Bosnians. 4. Similarly, the international community must be prepared to implement immediately any negotiated settlement. 5. Negotiations should be held within Bosnia and Herzegovina - preferably in Sarajevo. This would increase accountability and discourage violations of ceasefires and the denial of humanitarian assistance. 6. Negotiations and peace agreements should not exonerate war criminals. Such a result would be immoral and illegal, and would backfire by encouraging extremism and strengthening the hand of those who would challenge peace. Criminals must be prosecuted. It is unfortunate that the co-chairmen - in particular, Lord Owen - allowed themselves to be drawn into killing off the Vance/Owen plan and giving undue credibility to the 'Milosevic/Tudjman partition plan'. This predicament is in part due to Lord Owen's acceptance of the proposition that Serb extremists cannot be challenged and that war criminals may be legitimised as peace negotiators. In turn, this has encouraged extremism and opportunism among certain Croatian elements at the expense of moderates. Most critically, if the co-chairmen continue down this flawed path they will realise that, as they have abandoned the Vance/Owen plan and embraced the partition, they will inevitably have to adjust their mediation position to reflect almost any position promoted by the stronger party. The Milosevic/Tudjman partition plan is acknowledged to be unjust. Just as certainly, it is not durable. However, one argument that we can expect to be advanced in its favour is the pseudo-humanitarian one. We will soon be told that the main rationale for its implementation is the alleviation of the suffering of the Bosnian peoples. But the partition would in fact only worsen the refugee situation, promote instability, and create new battle lines. Extremism, irreconcilable national hatreds, and fascism would be encouraged and legitimised for decades. The folly of promoting ethnic divisions under the auspices of the United Nations should be reason enough to discard this ill-advised plan. Even as the casualty lists in civilian areas under Serb bombardment grow, reading like a roll-call of the republic's nationalities, all the members of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Serbs, Croats and Moslems, have embraced a rejuvenated peace plan for a 'federation' of the republic. The republic will have a decentralised form of government, with each group having parity at the federal government level. The individual units of this federation (provinces) would be established on the basis of economic, geographic, communications, historical and cultural criteria and would not be seen as constituting 'ethnic enclaves'. The federal model will promote the republic's future as a pluralistic, democratic, and secular nation. While it may be difficult in the immediate future fully to restore our nation to its multicultural tradition, this federal system will encourage reconciliation and pluralism, and not allow ethnic divisions permanently to scar our country.

After reviewing and ratifying the minutes of  the previous session, the House conducted a lengthy and  responsible discussion of conditions in our country. The House  issued the following statements:    Thanks be to God, whose blessing we beseech in calamity, and  who says in the Holy Koran: All believers are brothers; and who  also says: There is the type of man whose speech about this  world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness about  what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies.  When he turns his back his aim everywhere is to spread mischief  throughout the Earth and destroy crops and cattle, but God  loveth not mischief. [Koranic verse]    In its Wednesday, 11 May 1994 session, the House of  Representatives discussed the ugly crime committed by Socialist  Party outlaws who used long-range missiles to strike civilian  targets, murdering and terrorizing women, children, the elderly,  and the disabled who were asleep in their homes. These  missiles, paid for with the food and sweat of our people, struck  them and tore apart their bodies. They had committed no crime,  except for their love of unity and their support of  Constitutional legitimacy and political pluralism, yet they were  murdered.    In the light of this, the House decided the following:    1. To strongly condemn this crime committed by Socialist  Party outlaws and to hold the perpetrators completely  responsibile. The crime reveals the extent of the hatred  harbored by these criminals and the scope of their terrorist  acts against the Yemeni people. They want to achieve their  selfish interests by killing the innocent and destroying the  people's structures and achievements in unity, democracy, and  peace.    2. The House considers these crimes to violate Islamic  values and teachings, as well as international and humanitarian  norms that forbid the murder of the elderly, women, children,  and the disabled. These savage acts are ugly war crimes and high  treason directed against God and the homeland. Its perpetrators  deserve the severest punishment.    3. The House urges all members and segments of society, its  political forces and its popular organizations to denounce and  condemn these ugly crimes and to defend unity, democracy,  pluralism, and Constitutional legitimacy, which guarantee the  security and stability of Yemen and its people. The House urges  the Arab, Muslim, and world public opinion and all international  organizations and honorable forces concerned with the defense of  human rights to denounce and condemn these crimes.    4. The executive power must take all necessary legal and  Constitutional steps to deter these murderers and bring them to  justice and to apply the necessary legal, and deterrent  punishment against them.    5. The House urges the government to take the steps  necessary to provide full care for the families of the victims  of the Scud missiles and to consider these victims martyrs of  unity, democracy, and legitimacy.    The House stresses that Yemen and its unity, which was  built by the blood and sweat of its people, is invulnerable to  enemies and will remain an illuminating torch protecting  national, pan-Arab, and Islamic security. It stresses that  victory will, God willing, be for unity and unionists.    The House urges unionists in the Socialist Party, both the  civilian and military, to support Constitutional legitimacy and  reject these criminal acts.    The mercy of God be upon our pure martyr. God spare our  country any evil. From God we seek support.    The Republic of Yemen's House of Representatives noted the  responsible and sincere positions taken by some Arab parliaments  that support Yemeni unity, which was achieved thanks to God  almighty and the Yemeni people's long struggle, and which is  considered a candle lighting the path of Arab and Muslim unity.    The House highly praises the position of the House of  Representatives in fraternal Jordan, as well as the other Arab  parliaments, and the sincere statements they issued in support  of Yemeni unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which the  advocates of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party's  leadership tried to violate in an attempt to push the country  into the furnace of a destructive and all-out war on all levels.    Since the start of the crisis fabricated by that gang, who  are violating Constitutional legitimacy, the House has been  stressing the need to preserve the achievements of unity and  democracy in Yemen. It considers them achievements of the Arab  and Muslim nations. The House, therefore, urges Arab  parliaments and regional and international organizations to  denounce and condemn the use by the secessionist gang of the  Socialist Party of weapons of mass destruction against civilians  in certain Yemeni cities, including the capital of Yemeni unity,  Sanaa, and Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah.    The House appeals to fraternal and friendly parliaments and  regional and international organizations to motivate their  governments and media to adjust the way they view the events in  the Yemeni arena. This must be seen as an internal affair  between Constitutional legitimacy and the rebellious gang, and  not a war between north and south, as some people, intentionally  or unintentionally, are saying.    We beseech God to protect our country from any evil and  protect all of our Arab and Muslim countries from any harm. We  beseech him to grant peace and stability to the entire world.  From God we seek success.     "

Many fingers were pointed at Morningside Coach Frank Scott, who allowed Lisa  Leslie, his All-American center, to score 101 points in a half.    There was sympathy for South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez, who removed his team  from the game at halftime, trailing, 102-24, and for his team, which had begun  the game with seven players but finished with four because two fouled out and  one was injured.    Many supported South Torrance's decision not to take the floor to begin the  second half, preventing Leslie from breaking Cheryl Miller's eight-year-old  national record of 105 points.    When South Torrance school officials abided by Southern Section rules and  suspended Ramirez from coaching the last game of the season, many people still  said that Ramirez had done the right thing.    It was difficult to find backers for Morningside, even though the Monarchs  could probably win nearly every Ocean League game by a similar margin. But  Morningside was, in a way, a victim of the unwritten code of high school  athletics that says a superior team just cannot play its best against a weaker  opponent.    The Southern Section even changed its position last Friday morning when it  reinstated Ramirez and allowed him to coach the Spartans' last game, saying  that he had just cause to forfeit.    With Ramirez on the bench, the inspired South Torrance team went on to lose to  North Torrance by only 10 points, 60-50. Morningside, the defending state  champion in Division I, went back to its normal ways, defeating Compton  Centennial, 78-44.    So, what was gained from last week's activities? Did the Morningside team learn  a lesson in sportsmanship? Did the South Torrance team? No one can truly answer  those questions.    But if the Southern Section would like to see the situation not repeated, it  should simply establish a mercy rule, as it has done in eight-man football,  under which a team ahead by a certain margin is awarded the victory.    In the Morningside-South Torrance game for example, with a 50-point mercy rule,  the game would have been over early in the second quarter. No tears, no  finger-pointing and no records broken.    Having a mercy rule would be more logical than expecting a team not to play its  best. In individual sports, such as track and field, it is not expected that a  runner will slow down in every race against inferior opponents. Nor is that the  case in tennis, swimming or wrestling.    The City basketball playoffs will begin Friday with Manual Arts as the  top-seeded team in the boys' 4-A Division. The Toilers, who lost to Crenshaw in  the City final last season and again in the State Division I semifinals, won  two close Western League games last week, beating Westchester and Fairfax.    ""We have paid our dues this season,"" Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said.  ""We have played a tough schedule and we won our conference, but I don't  necessary like us being the top seed.""    The Toilers, who won the state Division I title in 1988, are 21-3 this season  and the Times' top-rated team in the City. However, in finishing conference  play undefeated, they needed late heroics from senior forward William Celestine  in both their 74-73 victory over Westchester and their 64-63 double-overtime  victory over Fairfax.    Simpson calls the 6-foot-5 Celestine, who is one of only three seniors on the  team, the most underrated player in the City. Celestine is averaging 19 points  and 12 rebounds a game. He is joined by the senior backcourt tandem of 6-2  guard Marcell Capers, who is averaging 14 points and 11 assists a game, and  Cedric Jones, a 5-7 three-point specialist.    When asked to predict a final four for the City semifinals at the Sports Arena  Feb. 23, Simpson said he expects Manual Arts to meet Dorsey, which routed  Crenshaw last Friday, 91-67, and Crenshaw to play Fairfax.    Quarterback Charles Levy of Lynwood, who was regarded as one of the top players  in Southern California last season, said Monday that he will attend Arizona  next season.    The 6-2 Levy said that he chose Arizona over Colorado and Washington because  the Wildcats had recruited him as a quarterback.    Prep Notes    Debbie Fischer of Huntington Beach Edison upped her own Southern Section  records for three-point field goals for a career (100) and season (92) and tied  her game record by making 10 of the long shots in the Chargers' 88-83 victory  over Westminster last week. She had 49 points in the game. . . . According to  Volleyball Monthly, UCLA is expected to sign three high school All-American  girls Wednesday, the first official day of the letter-of-intent signing period,  in Amy Boyer of Poway, Irene Renteria of Las Vegas Clark and Allison Randick of  Moraga Campolindo.

He expressed the government's  determination to pursue the program of peace with the  collaboration of the enlightened leadership of the rebel groups.    House Speaker Jose De Venecia and former National  Unification  Commission member Eduardo Ermita were also saddened by  Mabilangan's killing. De Venecia has regretted that Comrade  hector had to die at the height of his efforts to improve the  lives of his people. He urged authorities to facilitate  investigation of the killing and apprehend and punish the  perpetrators of the crime. For his part, Ermita was hopeful  that the killing will not be a hindrance to the ongoing peace  process.     "

The procession was led by a number of general secretaries of  the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, led by Ahmad Jibril,  secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]; Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa  Muraghah], Central Committee secretary of the Palestine National  Liberation Movement [PNLM]-Fatah; Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary  general of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; Talal Naji,  assistant secretary general of the PFLP-GC; Abu-Khalid  al-'Amlah, assistant secretary of PNLM- Fatah; Muhammad  Abu-Musa, command member of the Islamic Resistance Movement  Hamas; and Abu-Istayf [not further identified], Central  Committee member of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front; and  other alliance leaders.    Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus and an Iranian delegation  were also in the forefront of the procession.    Our correspondent in Damascus said that since the early  morning hours, the masses of our people gathered in the streets  of al-Sayyidah Zaynab camp, then headed for al-Sayyidah Zaynab  tomb where Ahmad Jibril delivered a speech. He said: Today we  stand here on the occasion of world Jerusalem day--this day  which Imam Khomeyni, may God have mercy on him, made an  international day. This was decided immediately after the  victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. Imam Khomeyni said  Israel is a cancerous growth that should be removed, and  Jerusalem should have an international day. With this, Imam  Khomeyni drew a link between Jerusalem day and the blessed month  of Ramadan, and the last Friday of that month in particular.  The Islamic conquests and the Muslims' battles against heretics  were carried out in this blessed month.    Ahmad Jibril recalled what Imam Khomeyni said--that Islam  without Palestine and without Jerusalem is an incomplete Islam,  and Muslims throughout the world should work for the restoration  of Jerusalem and Palestine.    Jibril added: We meet today on world Jerusalem day at a time  when the whole of Palestine suffers from massacres and  repression of children, woman, and the elderly. These Jews, who  killed prophets and messengers, have never hesitated to commit  more massacres. You recall, o brothers, the massacre at the  holy al-Aqsa Mosque and how they kill the worshipers who were  prostrate before Almighty God. This took place on Friday. Two  week ago, you heard how the Jews killed or injured hundreds of  worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. This also took place on  Friday.    The history of our people in Palestine is full of massacres,  from Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, Sabra and Shatila, and  'Uyun Qarah, until the latest massacre. The Zionist leaders  arrogantly denounced the massacre of al-Ibrahimi Mosque, saying  that its perpetrator was mad and deranged. We ask terrorist  Rabin: Who committed the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dayr Yasin  massacres? Was it not the Zionist army?    Jibril went on to say: These lies and tricks do not deceive  anyone. Today, the capitulationist leadership, which signed an  agreement with the Zionists and relinquished everything, agreed  to sell the homeland and the blood of martyrs to the enemies of  God and humanity.    We say to all these defeatists that the Palestinian  people--their women, youths, and elderly--have not calmed down  and have not become tired. Haven't they seen the children  chasing the Zionist soldiers and throwing stones at them?  Haven't they seen the women taking kitchen knives and stabbing  the enemy's soldiers before being martyred? Haven't they seen  how the mujahidin in Palestine fight the enemies of God? We say  to these people: Do whatever you want, but God's will shall  prevail.    Jibril concluded his speech by addressing Muslims all over  the world and said: Do not despair of Gods' mercy because God  told the faithful that they will attain victory. If you aid  (the cause of) God, He will aid you. [Koranic verse]    Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus, read a statement in which  he condemned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron,  and all the massacres the enemy has committed in Palestine and  the occupied Arab territories.    He hailed the Palestinian people and urged Muslims to  support  the Muslims in Palestine and to carry out jihad for the  restoration of Jerusalem and Palestine.     "

The prosecution is studiously silent about the defendants'  real ""guilt"" -- their participation in the protection of polling  places in Chisinau during the March 1991 USSR referendum banned  by the local authorities. In the two years they have been kept  in custody these three officers and one private have been  punished worse than for murder. They have been kept in Chisinau  detention centers in health-endangering conditions. On 6 June  1993 they were even put before the court with traces of beatings  on their faces.    During his imprisonment Major Vladimir Teterin has lost 20  kg  and has caught tuberculosis in its open form; several times he  has coughed up blood. The effects of the skull and brain injury  and contusion he received in Afghanistan are manifesting  themselves in Captain Vladimir Gram, the other paratrooper; he  is plagued by terrible headaches. The health of Major Sergey  Cherkasov and Private Andrey Khorkov has been wrecked.    It would be a mistake to think that the slow killing of  Russian officers and soldiers was carried out only at a time  when their fate did not attract public attention. In June the  court cynically refused to allow Chisinau's N. Pirogov  Association of Medical Workers to carry out an independent  medical examination of the detainees. Instead of stopping the  beatings and giving treatment for tuberculosis and the effects  of contusion they were sent for psychiatric observation, which  culminated in a finding as to their sanity. As regards Teterin,  the detention center doctor issued a piece of paper saying that  he is healthy and that it is apparently only a question of  ""residual fluctuations in the lungs after a previous bout of  tuberculosis,"" as though what was staring him in the face was  not a man virtually on the brink of death. No appeals to the  law are of assistance. When asked 23 December by the judge  whether he had any complaints or statements to register, Maj.  Cherkasov replied in the negative: ""No. Complaints are useless  because they don't give a damn about them here.""    Representatives of public human rights organizations  continue  to be amazed by the cynicism of the people staging this court  spectacle. First, for some reason a military tribunal is trying  people who have never served in the Moldovan Army. Second, the  judge, Captain Vladimir Timofti, is clearly trying to drag out  the court examination. On 22 December the court session was  canceled on a humorous pretext: The judge deemed the tribunal's  corridors too narrow to allow such dangerous criminals as the  alleged car thieves to be led along them. The next day the  corridors evidently seemed wider to the judge, but the  defendants -- each of them -- were brought under an escort of  two men armed with submachine guns and dogs. The entrance to  the tribunal was guarded by an entire platoon with assault  rifles. Who was the judge trying to impress?    At the session Maj. Teterin refused to give evidence,  demanding medical aid. The court's aim, Maj. Cherkasov stated,  is to discredit the Russian Army and portray the Russian  military as criminals. He bluntly accused the court of carrying  out the government's orders and refused to recognize it.    Capt. Gram expressed his solidarity with Cherkasov. He  demanded that an expert medical examination be made and accused  the detention center organs of treating the defendants brutally.  Every time I make statements the court does not like, he said,  I am transferred to conditions fit only for cattle, to a cellar,  to a cell in which 30 instead of 10 people are kept. Citing his  grave state of health, the captain refused to give evidence to  the court. It is hard to think of the military prosecutor as a  person who has not been initiated into the covert essence of the  ""case,"" but having seen the defendants even he echoed the  defense's demand for them to be medically examined. The judge  refused on this occasion too, placing the attorneys in a state  of disarray. Viktor Magnushev, a Russian jurist and  representative of the Congress of Russian Communities, expressed  doubt about the advisability of his participating in the trial  given such an attitude by the court toward the defense's  arguments.    The Chisinau press is full of tearful bleating about the  trial in Tiraspol of a group of Moldovan Ministry of National  Security terrorists which killed two Dniester region  politicians. In two years no information about Moldovan  Justice's outrage against the persons of Russian military  personnel has found its way onto the pages of local newspapers.  The Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian judicial organs,  not to mention the Foreign Ministry, are apparently concerned  only with searching for a reason to cast four Russian soldiers  to the mercy of fate and Chisinau officialdom. The Dniester  region press has already expressed the suspicion that the  Chisinau leadership regards S.A. Cherkasov, V.Ye. Teterin, A.M.  Khorkov, and V.A. Gram as hostages, intending to exchange them  for the murderers convicted in Tiraspol. No denials from  Moldova have been forthcoming.    ""Anything goes in relation to Russians! The West will  approve of everything we are going to do against Russians!""  These slogans, which for five years now have been quietly  voiced in editions of pro-Romanian newspapers and sometimes in  local corridors of power, can be read between the false lines of  the indictments and the admissions obtained by the investigation  by recourse to threats and violence. Only a firm word from  Moscow can stop what are in many respects reprisals which have  already been carried out against Russian military personnel.  Are the Russian power structures capable of doing this? The  Russian soldiers in the Chisinau torture chamber continue to  hope so.     "
0,FT931-16936 ,"FT931-16936 _AN-DADBPAB8FT 930104   FT  04 JAN 93 / Germany's enfant terrible bows out: Mollemann's departure leaves Kohl at the mercy of coalition compromises      By QUENTIN PEEL   Chancellor Helmut Kohl may well be breathing a sigh of relief. Yesterday's resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister and vice-chancellor, removes from the ranks of Mr Kohl's coalition government a thoroughly disruptive influence, an enfant terrible and notorious self-publicist cordially disliked by most of his colleagues. The fact that Mr Mollemann was vice-chancellor was due entirely to the logic of coalition politics, and not at all to the choosing of Mr Kohl: the job belonged, as does the economics portfolio, to the Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the three-party coalition. Following the abrupt resignation last year of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher from the government, after 18 years as foreign minister, Mr Mollemann became the most senior FDP member of the cabinet. The irony of Mr Mollemann's departure, for the apparent use of ministerial notepaper to promote a new product invented by one of his wife's relations, was that he finally fell victim to his inability to distinguish, in the words of Der Spiegel magazine, 'between public affairs and public relations'. Mr Mollemann's every new excuse brought fresh embarrassment, and from his own FDP party colleagues and Mr Kohl came only an echoing silence in his defence. Thus far, the chancellor would seem to be well rid of him. Yet Mr Mollemann is the seventh member of the current Kohl administration to leave office prematurely, the fifth in barely nine months, and the fourth to leave because of what might be called a 'silly scandal'. It all makes the Kohl administration appear fractious and adrift - just when the German economy is slipping into recession, and a clear lead from the government is needed more than ever. Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the former defence minister, was forced to quit last March, accused of allowing the illegal exports of tanks to Turkey, a Nato ally. Ms Gerda Hasselfeldt, the health minister, went in April, after one of her closest aides was accused of espionage. Two days later, Mr Genscher announced his plan to resign, rocking the stability of the entire coalition. In December, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the minister of posts and telecommunications, said he was pulling out, allegedly because of the government's inability to act more firmly over Yugoslavia. As one of Mr Kohl's longest-serving cabinet ministers, Mr Schwarz-Schilling's exit was a personal gesture of bitterness. Mr Mollemann, a former teacher, public relations man and part-time parachutist, was regarded by many, not least in German industry, as having been promoted beyond his capacities; as economics minister he was in a job at the very interface between the government and industry. Moreover, the economics ministry is arguably the most important ministry in the task of reviving the collapsed economy of east Germany. One of the weakest areas of the Kohl coalition has been its inability to forge a working relationship of mutual respect with industry in the challenge of German unification. The chancellor himself is notoriously uninterested in the economy - although he has belatedly realised its critical importance at this juncture. Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, is a much more shrewd political operator than many would believe, but he is also no expert in his field, relying instead on his senior civil servants. As for Mr Mollemann, he sometimes chose the right issue (the need to dismantle state subsidies, and reduce the high costs of industry were favourite themes), but he never enjoyed the respect needed to put his words into action. Thus his resignation is both an embarrassment and an opportunity for the chancellor. If Mr Kohl can find an alternative candidate who would enjoy the respect of the business community, Mr Mollemann's resignation would be a positive blessing. One name being widely mentioned is that of Ms Birgit Breuel, the tough-minded head of the Treuhand privatisation agency. But she is a Christian Democrat, and the job remains in the say of the FDP, which leaves Mr Kohl at the mercy of coalition compromises. The chancellor's promised cabinet reshuffle by the end of January will therefore challenge his leadership capacity to the full.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The MKO office in Paris issued a statement declaring this  stance, saying: An MKO spokesman vehemently condemned the  explosion at the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, in the  holy city of Mashhad and has said that the Khomeyni regime's  linking such a criminal act to the Mojahedin and the Iranian  Resistance is an absolute lie and its objective is merely to  tarnish the image of the just and extensive resistance of the  people of Iran against the religious and terrorist dictatorship  of the clerics.    This spokesman added: The Iranian Resistance would never  resort to such criminal actions which would desecrate the  sanctity of the infallible imams, and would cause such an  extensive loss of life and [word indistinct] among the innocent  people. This filthy and criminal action is only in the interest  of the clerical regime.    On numerous occasions in the past, the regime has planted  bombs and resorted to such acts, including hurling a grenade at  the French Embassy and the Air France office in Tehran,  ascribing these acts to the MKO.    We now draw your attention to the interview by the leader of  the Iranian Resistance, brother mojahed Mas'ud Rajavi, on the  atrocity perpetrated on Monday by the misanthropic clerics in  the hallowed precincts of the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon  him.    Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian Resistance, condemned  the heinous atrocity of an explosion in the sacred precincts of  Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad by the terrorist dictatorship of  the clerics on 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram] which resulted in  martyring and wounding a large number of innocent pilgrims and  damage to the tomb of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, and he  conveyed his condolences to the people of Iran. He described it  as a profane, antihuman, and anti-Islamic crime on the part of  the ruling tyrannical Yazidi [Yazid was Umayyad Caliph in  Damascus, and considered a heretic] clerics.    The leader of the Iranian Resistance stressed that the  objective of the Khomeyni regime in staging the explosion in the  holy precincts of the Imam Reza shrine, linking it to the MKO,  is nothing but a precursor to a series of terrorist acts in the  future against the Iranian Resistance which in the past have  included the aerial attack on the National Liberation Army  bases, explosions in offices and bases of the Iranian  Resistance, and the assassinations of Resistance activists  abroad.    Some days ago, the Khomeyni regime disseminated consummate  lies, claiming that the MKO had launched an attack on the Ilam  border, western Iran, in which some persons had been killed and  wounded.    Rajavi added: The criminal clerics are entrenched in a deep  political and economic crisis and are unable to combat the  proliferating dissatisfaction and increasing resistance by the  Iranian people. They do not find any recourse but to embark on  such inauspicious and bestial crimes and in the holy precincts  of the Imam Reza shrine at that. This is an unprecedented crime  which no other dictator has resorted to before.    Rajavi stressed: The cruel clerics have--since the heroic  uprising by the people of Mashhad--[words indistinct] continued  to seek revenge and harassed the people of Khorasan Province and  the pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Reza. He continued: The  Khomeyni regime is seeking to justify its next crime and thus to  arouse the religious sentiments of the people and to tarnish the  face of the MKO, who--because of their deep devotion to Islam,  the religion of mercy and liberation--enjoy greater credibility  among the Iranian people. They therefore chose the day of  'Ashura, the site of the holy shrine of Imam Reza, and the  anniversary of 30 Khordad--the day when the MKO uprising against  the regime was initiated--for perpetrating this crime.    The statement issued immediately by Khamene'i, the leader of  the clerical regime, linking this explosion to the MKO, and the  threatening propaganda by the regime, based on vengeance against  the MKO, are part of this previously formulated scenario.    While recalling the setting on fire of the Rex Theater in  Abadan, and the killing of innocent people in the last few  months of the shah's rule, the setting ablaze [as heard] of the  precincts of the Holy Ka'bah by agents of the Khomeyni regime in  1366 [year beginning 21 March 1987] Rajavi emphasized that the  clerical regime--despite its claims to being a protector of  Islam--has gone a step further and has massacred innocent  pilgrims in the Imam Reza shrine, the most hallowed site in all  of Iran. The unprecedented crime is an indication of the  incurable crises in Iran, and the abject impotence of the  clerics before the resistance of the Iranian people.    He added: In addition, the vestiges of the Khomeyni  regime--in view of the lack of participation on the part of the  people in the anniversary ceremonies for Khomeyni--are seeking  to damage the Imam Reza shrine and by violating its sanctity,  they wish to replace it with the temple of idols in which  Khomeyni is interred. Rajavi called on the United Nations,  Islamic Conference Organization, the Islamic governments,  international organizations that are defenders of human rights  to condemn this appalling atrocity and to send a team to Iran to  investigate this crime.    In order to thwart any deceitful actions by the clerical  regime, the Iranian Resistance deems the presence of its  representatives necessary in an international delegation to  investigate this incident. This is the insistent demand of the  people and the Resistance of Iran to the international community  who should not permit the criminal clerics to escape unscathed  after committing such an unprecedented crime.

By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BOGOTA, Colombia      Beleaguered Colombian drug lords are suing for peace, but they are unlikely to  throw themselves to the mercy of government authorities and courts, analysts  say.    Instead, they seem to be seeking an accommodation that will give them respite  from official action against them in return for an end to their  ""narco-terrorist"" activities. And high on the list of official action the  traffickers are known to hate and fear is extradition to the United States for  trial.    In a dramatic declaration this week, the traffickers acknowledged the supremacy  of the Colombian government and announced a halt in their campaign of murders,  bombings and kidnapings.    Like many Colombians, President Bush expressed skepticism over the declaration,  in which the drug lords also promised to suspend cocaine shipments and turn  over weapons if they receive ""constitutional and legal guarantees.""    The document was delivered Wednesday with the release of a mother and daughter  who were kidnaped in mid-December. On Thursday, the traffickers released a  third hostage, businessman Roberto Toro, in the city of Medellin.    Toro, who was kidnaped Dec. 14, brought a verbal message from ""the  Extraditables,"" as the traffickers call themselves in public statements.    According to Toro, they said they would free all of their hostages, believed to  number about 20. Toro also said they posed a question for the Bush  Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration: ""If you do not  believe the word of narcotraficantes, why do you negotiate with them, why do  you have them testify against other narcotraficantes?""    The example of plea-bargaining in U.S. drug cases has been used here to rebut  official Colombian policy against negotiating a peace settlement with drug  traffickers.    The Extraditables have been seeking negotiations with the government of  President Virgilio Barco Vargas since he signed an emergency decree Aug. 18  permitting extradition of accused drug traffickers to the United States.    In previous messages, the traffickers have made it clear that the main issue  they wish to negotiate is extradition. Barco has refused, and 13 Colombians  have been extradited under the August decree. In retaliation for the  extraditions and for raids on properties owned by traffickers, they launched a  terrorist bombing campaign.    In December, after security forces killed drug lord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha in  a shoot-out, the traffickers began a campaign of kidnapings. Rodriguez Gacha,  one of the three top chieftains of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, was  wanted by U.S. authorities.    Early this week, two former presidents and the archbishop of Bogota signed an  open letter proposing that the traffickers release their hostages and stop  dealing cocaine in hopes of ""less rigorous treatment"" under the law.    The army's commanding general in Medellin has said the traffickers were  consulted on the draft text of the letter through a lawyer. Former President  Misael Pastrana, who endorsed but did not sign the letter, said he was  consulted on the text by former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, who Pastrana  says called him from the presidential palace.    Those reports indicate to many analysts that some sort of agreement was being  brokered between the traffickers and the government.    Rodrigo Losada, a Colombian political analyst, said he fears that the  government may secretly have relented on extradition in exchange for peace with  the traffickers. Government officials deny that. Losada said such an agreement  could have disastrous consequences for Colombia.    It would be extremely hard to determine whether traffickers were keeping a  promise to quit the cocaine business. And even if they did, Losada said, others  would quickly move into the lucrative field, so trafficking most likely would  continue.    If accused traffickers were not extradited, they would be subject to Colombian  justice. But, Losada said, bribes, intimidation and the killing of judges have  rendered the court system in this country impotent in cases against important  drug traffickers.    The traffickers will not change their corrupt and brutal ways of dealing with  the courts, and the judges will continue to be cowed, Losada said. ""What judge  will have the courage to convict them or even put them on trial?"" he asked.    As a result, he said, the power of the traffickers would increase.    ""The narcotraficantes would remain in Colombia with their capital,"" he said.  ""Then what could keep them from investing in big companies, taking over banks,  buying politicians?""    Meanwhile, Barco may have a compelling personal reason to reach an agreement  with the traffickers. One of their hostages is the son of his friend and  closest adviser, German Montoya.    But Losada said any official concession could be politically costly for the  Barco administration, which now is claiming victory over the traffickers.    ""If the government gives in and relinquishes extradition, people will  eventually realize that the Extraditables won,"" he said.    A U.S. official in Bogota said that because the government now has the upper  hand, it is an especially inopportune moment to give the harried traffickers a  chance to regroup their forces.    ""I think they are under tremendous pressures,"" the official said. ""Their  organization is deeply disrupted.""    And, he said, Colombia should not stop extraditions until it can build ""a legal  system that has a lot of force and authority, and that is going to take a lot  of time.""    The U.S. official acknowledged that willingness to negotiate is a strong  Colombian cultural trait.    ""There is a very strong perception in Colombian culture that gentlemen are open  to negotiations,"" he said. ""Even with your worst enemy, you are open to  negotiations.""    Nevertheless, while the latest peace proposal by the traffickers has raised  some hopes for a negotiated end to the plague of ""narco-terrorism,"" many  Colombians remain skeptical and cautious.    The newspaper El Tiempo warned Thursday that ""this could turn into a Trojan  horse.""

LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BOGOTA, Colombia      Beleaguered Colombian drug lords are suing for peace, but they are unlikely to  throw themselves to the mercy of government authorities and courts, analysts  say.    Instead, they seem to be seeking an accommodation that will give them respite  from official action against them in return for an end to their  ""narco-terrorist"" activities. And high on the list of official action the  traffickers are known to hate and fear is extradition to the United States for  trial.    In a dramatic declaration this week, the traffickers acknowledged the supremacy  of the Colombian government and announced a halt in their campaign of murders,  bombings and kidnapings.    Like many Colombians, President Bush expressed skepticism over the declaration,  in which the drug lords also promised to suspend cocaine shipments and turn  over weapons if they receive ""constitutional and legal guarantees.""    The document was delivered Wednesday with the release of a mother and daughter  who were kidnaped in mid-December. On Thursday, the traffickers released a  third hostage, businessman Roberto Toro, in the city of Medellin.    Toro, who was kidnaped Dec. 14, brought a verbal message from ""the  Extraditables,"" as the traffickers call themselves in public statements.    According to Toro, they said they would free all of their hostages, believed to  number about 20. Toro also said they posed a question for the Bush  Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration: ""If you do not  believe the word of narcotraficantes, why do you negotiate with them, why do  you have them testify against other narcotraficantes?""    The example of plea-bargaining in U.S. drug cases has been used here to rebut  official Colombian policy against negotiating a peace settlement with drug  traffickers.    The Extraditables have been seeking negotiations with the government of  President Virgilio Barco Vargas since he signed an emergency decree Aug. 18  permitting extradition of accused drug traffickers to the United States.    In previous messages, the traffickers have made it clear that the main issue  they wish to negotiate is extradition. Barco has refused, and 13 Colombians  have been extradited under the August decree. In retaliation for the  extraditions and for raids on properties owned by traffickers, they launched a  terrorist bombing campaign.    In December, after security forces killed drug lord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha in  a shoot-out, the traffickers began a campaign of kidnapings. Rodriguez Gacha,  one of the three top chieftains of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, was  wanted by U.S. authorities.    Early this week, two former presidents and the archbishop of Bogota signed an  open letter proposing that the traffickers release their hostages and stop  dealing cocaine in hopes of ""less rigorous treatment"" under the law.    The army's commanding general in Medellin has said the traffickers were  consulted on the draft text of the letter through a lawyer. Former President  Misael Pastrana, who endorsed but did not sign the letter, said he was  consulted on the text by former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, who Pastrana  says called him from the presidential palace.    Those reports indicate to many analysts that some sort of agreement was being  brokered between the traffickers and the government.    Rodrigo Losada, a Colombian political analyst, said he fears that the  government may secretly have relented on extradition in exchange for peace with  the traffickers. Government officials deny that. Losada said such an agreement  could have disastrous consequences for Colombia.    It would be extremely hard to determine whether traffickers were keeping a  promise to quit the cocaine business. And even if they did, Losada said, others  would quickly move into the lucrative field, so trafficking most likely would  continue.    If accused traffickers were not extradited, they would be subject to Colombian  justice. But, Losada said, bribes, intimidation and the killing of judges have  rendered the court system in this country impotent in cases against important  drug traffickers.    The traffickers will not change their corrupt and brutal ways of dealing with  the courts, and the judges will continue to be cowed, Losada said. ""What judge  will have the courage to convict them or even put them on trial?"" he asked.    As a result, he said, the power of the traffickers would increase.    ""The narcotraficantes would remain in Colombia with their capital,"" he said.  ""Then what could keep them from investing in big companies, taking over banks,  buying politicians?""    Meanwhile, Barco may have a compelling personal reason to reach an agreement  with the traffickers. One of their hostages is the son of his friend and  closest adviser, German Montoya.    But Losada said any official concession could be politically costly for the  Barco administration, which now is claiming victory over the traffickers.    ""If the government gives in and relinquishes extradition, people will  eventually realize that the Extraditables won,"" he said.    A U.S. official in Bogota said that because the government now has the upper  hand, it is an especially inopportune moment to give the harried traffickers a  chance to regroup their forces.    ""I think they are under tremendous pressures,"" the official said. ""Their  organization is deeply disrupted.""    And, he said, Colombia should not stop extraditions until it can build ""a legal  system that has a lot of force and authority, and that is going to take a lot  of time.""    The U.S. official acknowledged that willingness to negotiate is a strong  Colombian cultural trait.    ""There is a very strong perception in Colombian culture that gentlemen are open  to negotiations,"" he said. ""Even with your worst enemy, you are open to  negotiations.""    Nevertheless, while the latest peace proposal by the traffickers has raised  some hopes for a negotiated end to the plague of ""narco-terrorism,"" many  Colombians remain skeptical and cautious.    The newspaper El Tiempo warned Thursday that ""this could turn into a Trojan  horse.""

Volume was the lowest for some weeks at 10,030 - down from 13,799 on Wednesday - leaving traders with time on their hands and at the mercy of the rumour mill. The major buzz was the existence of a stock-loss trade on the FT-SE December contract. It was said to be set by a big US house and to be triggered at 3,000. At one stage the contract moved down to 3,007 only to be reversed by modest support. It reached a 3,042 best of the day around 3:30pm before closing at 3,031. At this level the premium to the cash market is around 10 points with the fair value premium running to some 15 points. Traders described business levels as 'very bitty', reflecting the 'almost complete absence' of views on the direction of equities at present. Many took the sensible course and went home early. Activity in traded options also fell, easing back to 31,858 lots from 37,003 the previous day. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for just over half of the total. The most actively traded individual stock options were British Airways at 2,228 lots and Sainsbury (1,450 lots).   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Present legislation about who can make cash payments to building society members and in what circumstances is so confusing that the outcome is highly unpredictable. But it should not be assumed that Lloyds could easily get round an unfavourable verdict, for example by offering preference shares instead of cash. That would risk further disagreement with the Building Societies Commission and another court case. Since Lloyds and CG are sure of their case, the chances are that they would rather appeal. If the verdict goes the other way the Commission may feel tempted to appeal as well. That would at least prolong uncertainty over what is actually permitted, preventing a rash of similar merger announcements before the government can amend relevant legislation to make them more difficult. The Commission is clearly anxious to bend over backwards in defence of mutual structures. Its suggestion that societies should use their reserves to pay dividends to members would not long ago have been regarded as too risky for organisations that have no access to outside capital. Unless the Lloyds/CG deal proceeds, though, there will be little chance of subjecting building society managements to much outside pressure. The mutual structure may have some value but not if its main purpose is to protect management from competition.   Companies:-  Lloyds Bank.     Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society.

Somewhere, the exhibitor obtained a print of what looked to be the director's  cut of the film.    It was obviously an audience test print, as it had no titles, and only half of  the music was finished. But it had no ""tough-guy narration"" by Harrison Ford,  no ""tacked-on happy ending,"" and it was perfect.    Warners had cut all that was important out of this film, apparently trying to  make it a ""Star Wars."" A film about a sociopath who develops a sense of mercy  and, in dying, passes it to the hero with no conscience was made into a movie  about tall buildings and flying cars.

But had he attended last Sunday's screening at the Cineplex Odeon  Fairfax, he would have been happy to be proven wrong, I believe.    Somewhere, the exhibitor obtained a print of what looked to be the director's  cut of the film.    It was obviously an audience test print, as it had no titles, and only half of  the music was finished. But it had no ""tough-guy narration"" by Harrison Ford,  no ""tacked-on happy ending,"" and it was perfect.    Warners had cut all that was important out of this film, apparently trying to  make it a ""Star Wars."" A film about a sociopath who develops a sense of mercy  and, in dying, passes it to the hero with no conscience was made into a movie  about tall buildings and flying cars.    Warners should come clean and release a director's cut of this film, if only on  home video. Until it does, it will be denying the world a potential classic.    BRUCE WRIGHT    Rancho Palos Verdes     Cineplex Odeon Corp. confirmed that the special print (70 millimeter) shown in  its Classic Film Festival was the cut of director Ridley Scott and that it  differed from the released version.

0,FT933-15573 ,"FT933-15573 _AN-DGHCRADFFT 930708   FT  08 JUL 93 / Judges call for rethink on Bentley   THREE High Court judges ruled yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke 'erred in law' when the then home secretary refused last October to grant a pardon to Derek Bentley, who was hanged 40 years ago after being convicted of taking part in the murder of a policeman. The judges said it should be possible 'to devise some formula which would amount to a clear acknowledgement that an injustice was done'. They added: 'We would invite the home secretary to look at the matter again and to examine whether it would be just to exercise the prerogative of mercy in such a way as to give full recognition to the now generally accepted view that this young man should have been reprieved.' Bentley had allegedly encouraged a youth to shoot the policeman after the two were caught attempting a burglary in south London. Mr Clarke, who as chancellor is in Tokyo at the G7 summit, said: 'As far as I am aware my judgments in the case have not been challenged. My judgment was that the verdict of the jury was safe, and that Mr Bentley was in fact guilty of murder. 'My opinion was he should not have been hanged in the circumstances because of his mental handicap and because, though more culpable, the other man was not hanged. I followed the precedent that a royal pardon was only given where innocence was established.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9211 Courts.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Mr.  Sangare is the assistant secretary general of the main  opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front.

Masses of our militant Palestinian people, sons of our people in  the diaspora, sons of our Arab and Islamic nation, and free men  of the world, 30 March 1994 is the 18th anniversary of Land Day.  Our heroic Palestinian people are facing the ugliest conspiracy  to liquidate their national cause through the Oslo and Cairo  agreements in which 'Arafat gave in to all the Zionist-U.S.  dictates and conditions, relinquished the Palestinian people's  historical and national rights, and canceled all their  sacrifices over 70 years.    The Land Day anniversary this year falls on the 40th day of  the massacre in the Ibrahimi mosque in steadfast Hebron. This  massacre highlighted the reality and essence of the  Zionist-'Arafatist peace when scores of glorious martyrs fell,  and hundreds were wounded. The fascist Zionist army followed  this with other massacres in the same city and the other  occupied territories in response to the wave of popular wrath  that unfolded throughout the occupied territories and which  resulted in more heroes, martyrs, and wounded.    This anniversary this year also coincides with the uprising  of our militant masses in the 1948 occupied territories. This  confirms the unity of our people, the unity of their land and  fate, and their endless readiness for struggle to foil all the  Zionist schemes to liquidate their national cause.    Masses of our people, and sons of the land: This land has  been yours since time immemorial. The signature of a defeatist  traitor will not constitute an edict that changes the name of  the owner of the land. The land is yours, and yours is the sea,  the river, the valley, and the mountain. Yours are the oranges,  grapes, figs, and olives.    O Hebron, the deep wound of Palestine, the mother of  martyrs,  we shed tears on your doorstep but we will not give in. The  pledge remains as it. O Hebron, you remain in the lap of  Palestine and in the heart of the nation. The series of  massacres the occupation army has carried out and is  perpetrating under direct orders from Rabin -- 'Arafat's partner  in the Washington, Oslo, Taba, Cairo agreement -- have stepped  up the Palestinian popular call for the resignation of 'Arafat  and his deviationist clique, for halting the farce of  negotiations, and for toppling the U.S.-Zionist settlement  course. The massacres have also led to the stepping up of calls  for the withdrawal of the negotiating delegation, for the  dismantling of the settlements, for international protection for  the sons of our people throughout the entire occupied  territories, for their right to determine their fate on their  national soil, and for toppling the deviationist clique and its  main emblem, which have placed our people and cause in this  dilemma. The recent agreement with the Zionist enemy has  constituted a cover for the Hebron massacre and what took place  before it. All this confirms the unequivocal fact that  coexistence with this enemy is impossible and that the struggle  against it will continue.    O people of Palestine inside and in the diaspora, o people  of steadfast and mujahid Hebron: The popular situation caused  by the massacre, and the militant momentum the heroic intifadah  is witnessing -- in spite of the comprehensive siege and  systematic acts of mass killing at the hands of Rabin's army  gangs, 'Arafat's partner -- force the Palestinian and Arab  nationalist and Islamic forces to understand the features of  this stage and to work to develop struggle and jihad to higher  and more effective standards on the ground. They must close  ranks and adopt militant programs inside and outside the  occupied territories in order to pull the rug out from under the  feet of the capitulative leadership, to confront the onslaught,  to restore respect to struggle and jihad, to put to use the  furious popular sentiment, and to work to topple 'Arafat and his  deviationist and relinquishing clique on the path of continued  struggle and jihad in order to realize all objectives of the  Palestinian people to attain full liberation and independence.    Our observation of Land Day and the 40th day since the  martyrdom at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reemphasizes our  adherence to the unity of the people, the unity of land, and the  unity of blood that we will not relinquish no matter what the  pressures, difficulties, and obstacles might be. We pledge to  the souls of the martyrs -- the martyrs of Land Day in the  Galilee, and the martyrs of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron -- to remain faithful to their pure blood. We in the APF  [Alliance of Palestinian Forces] emphasize that there will be no  peace in the region without the collapse of the sin represented  in the presence of Israel in the heart of our Arab and Islamic  nation. We promise our people that we will carry out serious  and unionist actions, burn the occupied land under the  occupiers' feet, and topple the symbols of relinquishment,  capitulation, and treason.    On these two anniversaries, we ask our people to carry out  the following activities:    1. In the occupied territories: To escalate the intifadah  and emphasize the unity of land and people.    2. In the diaspora: To observe a general and full strike on  Wednesday morning 30 March 1994 in all camps and Palestinian  residential areas in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. To stage a  sit-in in front of the offices of the International Committee of  the Red Cross in the diaspora countries on the morning of 5  April. We also call on the masses of our people to participate  in the popular rally the APF will sponsor at al-Nujum Cinema in  al-Yarmuk Camp, southern Damascus, at 1800 on Tuesday 5 April  1994, and to take part in all rallies that will be held in  Amman, Beirut, Aleppo, Hims, and all Palestinian camps.    O relatives of noble martyrs: Your martyrs are in heaven and  will be a mercy for you and the nation. They will remain in the  hearts. Hail to the souls of the our martyrs in Hebron, the  Galilee, and Gaza, and all martyrs of Palestine and nation.  Hail to all sons of our people in the homeland and abroad.  Shame and disgrace to the fascist Zionists, shame and disgrace  to 'Arafat and his deviationist clique, glory to the martyrs,  victory to the fighting masses.

It stressed that ""there can  be no solution except complete submission to the will of the  people.""    It is the Front's first comment on the killing of El  Afghani,  whose group's statements persistently criticized the approach of  dialogue with the authorities and vehemently attacked FIS  leaders.    Well-informed sources interpret the FIS condemnation of the  GIA leader's killing as ""a clear attempt to intercept any  accusations which could be leveled at it in the future to the  effect that it was behind his betrayal.""    This condemnation comes while Shaykh Mahfoud Nahnah, leader  of Hamas [Islamic Society Movement], attacked circles ""claiming  to belong to the Islamic tendency,"" accusing them of killing the  preacher Shaykh Mohamed Bouslimani, a prominent Muslim  Brotherhood leader. The authorities accuse the GIA of killing  the preacher, who -- according to Shaykh Nahnah -- refused to  issue a fatwa sanctioning acts of murder.    Shaykh Rabeh Kebir did not sign the FIS statement. This is  in  the knowledge that he has been officially notified by the German  authorities of the decision to ban him from pursuing political  activities. The statement, which carried the signature ""the  Executive Committee abroad,"" accused the ruling regime in  Algeria of ""escalating assassination operations against innocent  citizens throughout the homeland in the hope of terrorizing and  intimidating people further.""    The statement added that ""the cowardly criminal operation  carried out by the repressive authorities against the mujahid,  leader, martyr, and Sword of Islam Djaafar and a group of his  aides -- who were the elite of the mujahidin, heroes, and  martyrs -- reflects the aims of the regime, which is oppressing  the Algerian people by fire and sword. Let the regime and its  supporters know that, whenever a leader falls in the arena of  honor, a new leader succeeds him and follows the same line.""    The statement pointed out that these operations come while  the regime continues to talk about looking for negotiated  solutions to the crisis afflicting the country, which is caused  by the regime.""    The statement concluded: ""There can be no solution to the  political problem in Algeria except complete submission to the  Algerian people's will to build a just, Islamic state that will  rid people of oppression, repression, and corruption and restore  to them their dignity and freedom."" [passage omitted]    Observers say that FIS statements condemning Djaafar El  Afghani's killing may be designed to cut short the possibility  of having an accusing finger pointed at it for revealing the GIA  leader's whereabout. These observers attribute the possibility  of such an accusation against it to reports about a dialogue  being conducted between it and the authorities and the  possibility that the authorities may have asked it to halt  violence in return for political concessions demanded by the FIS.    There are reports in Algeria to the effect that members of  armed groups are informing against one another and that many  members of these groups are falling as a result of this. There  is also widespread talk that the Algerian authorities have been  able to infiltrate the GIA.    Djaafar El Afghani assumed the group's leadership last year  after its leader 'Abd-al-Haqq al- 'Ayayidah was arrested in  Morocco and handed over to Algeria. Al-'Ayayidah has still not  been tried.    AL-HAYAH yesterday received a statement from the GIA in  which  it announced the death of its leader, pledging to continue the  ""jihad."" It also stressed that it ""will -- God willing --  continue its jihad until God proclaims this religion or until we  die for the sake of it.

For officials of the fraternity, this double  killing is probably the work of the enemies of Algeria. It is  provocation.    It is the case that 34 foreign nationals, including 10  French  citizens, have so far been killed in Algeria since September.  Jerome Bony and Bruno Giraudon, our special correspondents in  Algiers, report:    [Bony] People are dismayed in Algiers' Casbah after the  killing yesterday of Paule-Helene Saint-Raymond and Henri  Verges. Among those who miss the two religious figures most and  who dare to say so is the imam of the neighboring mosque:    [Begin unidentified imam recording] They were people who  helped the needy. They were on the side of the needy. Some  people needed them to fill in forms for retirement in France.  They came to see them for help. They asked them to write  letters to the social security services in France. They did  favors for everyone, both men and women, without any  distinction. Without any distinction among human beings.

It stressed that ""there can be no solution except  complete submission to the will of the people.""    It is the Front's first comment on the killing of El  Afghani,  whose group's statements persistently criticized the approach of  dialogue with the authorities and vehemently attacked FIS  leaders.    Well-informed sources interpret the FIS condemnation of the  GIA leader's killing as ""a clear attempt to intercept any  accusations which could be leveled at it in the future to the  effect that it was behind his betrayal.""    This condemnation comes while Cheikh Mahfoud Nahnah, leader  of Hamas [Islamic Society Movement], attacked circles ""claiming  to belong to the Islamic tendency,"" accusing them of killing the  preacher Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, a prominent Muslim  Brotherhood leader. The authorities accuse the GIA of killing  the preacher, who -- according to Cheikh Nahnah -- refused to  issue a fatwa sanctioning acts of murder.    Cheikh Rabeh Kebir did not sign the FIS statement, knowing  that he has been officially notified by the German authorities  of the decision to ban him from pursuing political activities.  The statement, which carried the signature ""the Executive  Committee abroad,"" accused the ruling regime in Algeria of  ""escalating assassination operations against innocent citizens  throughout the homeland in the hope of terrorizing and  intimidating people further.""    The statement added that ""the cowardly criminal operation  carried out by the repressive authorities against the mujahid,  leader, martyr, and Sword of Islam Djaafar and a group of his  aides -- who were the elite of the mujahidin, heroes, and  martyrs -- reflects the aims of the regime, which is oppressing  the Algerian people by fire and sword. Let the regime and its  supporters know that, whenever a leader falls in the arena of  honor, a new leader succeeds him and follows the same line.""    The statement pointed out that these operations come while  the regime continues to talk about looking for negotiated  solutions to the crisis afflicting the country, which is caused  by the regime.    The statement concluded: ""There can be no solution to the  political problem in Algeria except complete submission to the  Algerian people's will to build a just, Islamic state that will  rid people of oppression, repression, and corruption and restore  to them their dignity and freedom."" [passage omitted]    Observers say that FIS statements condemning Djaafar El  Afghani's killing may be designed to cut short the possibility  of having an accusing finger pointed at it for revealing the GIA  leader's whereabouts. These observers attribute the possibility  of such an accusation against it to reports about a dialogue  being conducted between it and the authorities and the  possibility that the authorities may have asked it to halt  violence in return for political concessions demanded by the FIS.    There are reports in Algeria to the effect that members of  armed groups are informing against one another and that many  members of these groups are falling as a result of this. There  is also widespread talk that the Algerian authorities have been  able to infiltrate the GIA.    Djaafar El Afghani assumed the group's leadership last year  after its leader 'Abd-al-Haqq 'Ayayidah [as transliterated] was  arrested in Morocco and handed over to Algeria. Al-'Ayayidah  has still not been tried.    AL-HAYAH yesterday received a statement from the GIA in  which  it announced the death of its leader, pledging to continue the  ""jihad."" It also stressed that it ""will -- God willing --  continue its jihad until God proclaims this religion or until we  die for the sake of it. The conspiracies of the Jews,  Christians, and apostates will not change it (the group). Nor  will the sayings of the atheists who have sold their consciences  to the East and the West affect its determination."" It also  said that El Afghani ""is not the first leader to fall, nor will  he be the last. It is God's will, and this is our road to make  this religion prevail -- the road of jihad and martyrdom.

The killing raised concern over security in the run-up to elections next Wednesday. Ms Benazir Bhutto and Mr Sharif are both campaigning to make a political comeback. Mr Wyne was dragged from his car and shot after the vehicle was fired on and stopped. His driver and two other passengers sustained serious injuries, police said last night. The killing was condemned by politicians loyal to both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto. Investigators indicated the killing might have been a personal attack. An injured passenger has apparently identified a gunman, which led the police to discount political motives.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

The  ""internationalization"" is a product of his despicable flunkeyist  and treacherous scheme to justify the U.S. domination and  plunder and prolong his remaining days under the patronage of  outside forces.    The ""internationalization"" is aimed at bartering away the  nation's soul and interests to outside forces and reducing South  Korea to an ""international prostitute.""

Haro Agakian, 40, was found guilty of stabbing his wife, Judy Agakian, 37, with  a kitchen knife in the master bedroom of their apartment in the 300 block of  North Isabel Street on March 16, 1988.    Judge Terry Smerling heard the case after Agakian waived his right to a jury  trial.    The prosecution and defense agreed that Agakian stabbed his wife after a bitter  argument. But at issue in the much-delayed, five-week trial was whether the  killing was premeditated. Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna L. Wills had asked the judge  for a first-degree murder conviction, arguing that the killing was planned.  Defense attorney Bradley W. Brunon had argued for a verdict of voluntary  manslaughter.      Defendant's Wounds    Wills sought to prove that Agakian brought two serrated kitchen knives to the  third-floor bedroom with the intention of killing his wife and then himself.  Agakian suffered six superficial stab wounds to his chest.    Wills argued at the trial that Agakian killed his wife in anger over their  pending divorce. Wills said Agakian had discovered in February that Judy  Agakian was having an affair. They filed for divorce but continued sharing the  apartment, sleeping in separate bedrooms. Wills said Agakian was distressed  that she was looking forward to the divorce.    Despite the defense stipulation that Agakian had stabbed his wife, Agakian  testified that he does not remember the events of that night and whether he did  so was ""anybody's guess.""    Brunon said that his client's chest wounds were inflicted by Judy Agakian and  that Agakian then ""lost control and in a fit of anger stabbed his wife to  death.""    In returning the second-degree murder verdict, Smerling said he was convinced  that the killing was murder rather than manslaughter but he remained  unconvinced that Agakian had planned his wife's death.    Agakian is being held in Los Angeles County Jail. A sentencing hearing is  scheduled July 28. He faces a maximum sentence of 16 years to life in prison.

Judge Terry Smerling heard the case after Agakian waived his right to a jury  trial.    The prosecution and defense agreed that Agakian stabbed his wife after a bitter  argument. But at issue in the much-delayed, five-week trial was whether the  killing was premeditated. Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna L. Wills had asked the judge  for a first-degree murder conviction, arguing that the killing was planned.  Defense attorney Bradley W. Brunon had argued for a verdict of voluntary  manslaughter.      Defendant's Wounds    Wills sought to prove that Agakian brought two serrated kitchen knives to the  third-floor bedroom with the intention of killing his wife and then himself.  Agakian suffered six superficial stab wounds to his chest.    Wills argued at the trial that Agakian killed his wife in anger over their  pending divorce. Wills said Agakian had discovered in February that Judy  Agakian was having an affair. They filed for divorce but continued sharing the  apartment, sleeping in separate bedrooms. Wills said Agakian was distressed  that she was looking forward to the divorce.    Despite the defense stipulation that Agakian had stabbed his wife, Agakian  testified that he does not remember the events of that night and whether he did  so was ""anybody's guess.""    Brunon said that his client's chest wounds were inflicted by Judy Agakian and  that Agakian then ""lost control and in a fit of anger stabbed his wife to  death.""    In returning the second-degree murder verdict, Smerling said he was convinced  that the killing was murder rather than manslaughter but he remained  unconvinced that Agakian had planned his wife's death.    Agakian is being held in Los Angeles County Jail. A sentencing hearing is  scheduled July 28. He faces a maximum sentence of 16 years to life in prison.    "

0,FT921-10338 ,"FT921-10338 _AN-CBFBEAE3FT 920206   FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Figurehead at the mercy of the press - The uncertain implications of Paddy Ashdown's public confession      By PHILIP STEPHENS   THE tabloid press claimed a triumph; Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock offered public sympathy; backbench MPs sniggered behind their hands; and the electoral implications remained uncertain. Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission yesterday of a relationship with his former secretary in 1987 was a severe personal blow. The Liberal Democrat leader is preparing to fight the first general election since 1979 in which the third party can justly claim a real prospect of winning the balance of power. He cannot afford bad publicity. Colleagues rallied round. But the day was a painful reminder of the risk that the Liberal Democrats have taken in building its new political identity around a single individual. It is no accident that newspapers so often refer to 'Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats'. So if his colleagues had judged that Mr Ashdown should consider resignation - and there was no indication of any such feeling - the party would have been left without a credible successor. The circumstances in which news broke - involving the theft of documents from the office of his solicitors and an attempt to sell them to a Sunday newspaper - will fuel the speculation that the approaching election will be the among 'dirtiest' Britain has seen. The Liberal Democrats carefully avoided any claim of a conspiracy by Mr Ashdown's political opponents. His solicitor called it a million-to-one possibility. But, in the wake of the spate of break-ins at the Westminster and constituency offices of all parties and a war of words over smear tactics, the House of Commons was again buzzing with talk of 'dirty tricks' and similar revelations to come. It was harder to get a coherent judgment of the extent to which the affair will influence the outcome of the election. The general assumption among MPs was that it would cost Mr Ashdown some votes - in particular from women and from the religious non-conformists who have long represented an important strand in Liberal support. Beyond that, there was no clear consensus. One senior minister predicted that the damage might be more extensive. The image of decent, honest politics that the Liberal Democrats had so carefully projected before the election had been tarnished. That, he said, might cost them 3 percentage points on election day. Another minister was far less certain. 'It depends on how you boys (the press) play it . . . It could be a one-day wonder.' Then there was always the possibility, he added, that the 'prurience' of the tabloids would generate a backlash in favour of Mr Ashdown. Psephologists agreed that if support for Mr Ashdown were to fall sharply, Labour would benefit in the key Conservative-held marginals on which the election outcome will depend. Mr Ashdown's hope is that now he has admitted to the relationship, the newspapers that have been pursuing the story with such determination this week will tire of it equally quickly. The judgment at Westminster was that he had made the right decision. The contents of the document stolen two weeks ago from his solicitor have been common knowledge among journalists and MPs since the weekend. An injunction against publication of details of the relationship - which lasted five months, ending before Mr Ashdown became party leader - offered little prospect of killing the story. The tabloid newspapers scented a non-existent parallel with the scandal that has engulfed Mr Bill Clinton, a Democrat contender for the US presidency. The combination of sex and politics was irresistible. So they determined to test Mr Ashdown's nerve. The Scotsman, unaffected by the legal constraints operating in England, disclosed the existance of the injunctions. The Daily Mirror told its readers in an opaque front-page editorial that it was possessed of important information that it could not publish. Mr Ashdown realised that the dam was about to burst. Behind the media zeal lay a curious circular logic. A five-year old extramarital relationship was important because it might affect the election. But, of course, it could only become an issue in the election if the newspapers covered it. The unanswered question is whether yesterday's story will be the first or the last before the election. Anyone who has spent more than hour in the bars of Westminster has heard of at least half a dozen other potential scandals. As one MP put it last night: 'Who next'? Mr Ashdown's statement said: 'The document reported to have been stolen from the safe of my solicitors, Bates, Wells  Braithwaite, and subsequently offered by the thief for sale to newspapers, refers to me. 'It contains information supplied in confidence to my solicitors about a brief relationship which I had five years ago, before the 1987 general election, and well before I became leader of my party. 'When the theft was discovered I was advised and believed that I had every right to defend my privacy. 'I was further advised that because its circulation arose from a criminal act, the document would be protected by the full force of the law. In those circumstances, my solicitors obtained an injunction preventing its publication. 'However, it is now clear to me that in this pre-election atmosphere, I, my family, my friends and party colleagues, will not be left alone. I have therefore decided to make this personal statement.'

The killing occurred Wednesday night in an exclusive Medellin suburb, and this  morning a car bomb went off near a police post in the same suburb, killing at  least two people and injuring 20, the RCN radio network reported. No one  immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.    John Jairo Arias Tascon, considered the cartel's No. 5 leader, was killed in  the El Poblado neighborhood when police, acting on a tip, found and tried to  arrest him, said Gen.

The killing was the biggest victory for the government's war on drugs since the  slaying of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the cartel's No. 2 boss in December.    Vargas did not say if any police were hurt in the shoot-out but he said four  more law officers were killed in Medellin on Wednesday night. Their deaths  bring to 110 the number of Medellin policemen assassinated so far this year.

""He served as chief of the armed organization of the Medellin cartel,"" Vargas  said, and was considered the cartel's fifth most important leader.    He said Arias was also responsible for two car bomb attacks on Colombia's  secret police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.    The blasts killed at least 70 people, but Maza escaped unharmed.

The dissident, Mr Taleb as-Suheil, is said to have played a prominent role in a planned coup attempt in Baghdad last July. The diplomats were named as Mr Khaled Khalaf, commercial attache, and Mr Mohammed Kadhem, cultural attache. Beirut has asked Baghdad to lift their diplomatic immunity so that they may face trial. A third man, Mr Hadi Hassan, is believed to have taken refugee inside the Iraqi embassy, which has been surrounded by police. The Lebanese government has said that all three are held to be Iraqi intelligence agents. But Baghdad has denied any involvement and called for their immediate release. The killing comes amid growing signs that the security situation in Beirut is deteriorating. A Jordanian diplomat was gunned down earlier this year and two Palestinians belonging to Abu Nidal's notorious terrorist organisation were arrested and charged with the killing. In February a bomb went off in a church near Beirut, killing 11 worshippers. The Lebanese Forces, a right-wing Christian group which was formerly allied to Israel during the country's civil war, was subsequently banned and four of its supporters charged with the bombing. The recent spate of killings is likely to mar the government's reconstruction efforts and hinder plans to raise finance on the Euromarkets. Security in and around the city has been stepped up and both Lebanese and Syrian soldiers are again patrolling the streets. Mr Faris Bouez, Lebanon's foreign minister, said yesterday that it was too early to say whether Beirut would cut diplomatic ties with Iraq over the killing but that 'Lebanon cannot be taken advantage of, not under the diplomatic cover or diplomatic immunity, to settle scores and to practise crime'.

For  some weeks now the international crisis-management scene has  become tangibly more lively, more active, and thus more  complicated. The main reason: Moscow has started to gain  profile as a new foreign policy figure. This can be seen from  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's virtually hectic activities  in the Bosnian conflict and in the crisis between Israel and the  PLO.    This new role of Russia's already has obvious consequences.  It has made the United States give up its so far very passive  foreign policy role under Clinton and pursue a constructive  policy. It has become visible in the Bosnian conflict and in  the efforts to restart the negotiations between Israel and the  PLO in the Middle East. No matter how limited Yeltsin's  possibilities may be because of his serious domestic problems,  this new foreign policy dualism has positive aspects for  international affairs. Competition is the best means on the  international political scene for overcoming budding  isolationist trends in Washington. Therefore, today's meeting  between the two foreign ministers, Kozyrev and Christopher, in  Vladivostok is of particular importance. One can expect  important decisions on the course and progress in the Bosnian  conflict and in the Middle East.    For the Europeans there is good reason to reconsider their  own role in view of this development. It is high time for them  to develop their own predictable foreign policy position. If  this is not done, they will remain at the mercy of others  instead of being partners in the new game of international  political forces.     "

Gentlemen, ladies: Dialogue is the most important method of  success. It will continue to be the only way to achieve gains  in the future and is the most exemplary means for solving the  country's current problems.

For the third time since Kraft's defense began June 30, his attorneys used work  records in a bid to show that he was busy with his computer consultant business  in Los Angeles County when bodies of young men were being found in Orange  County.    Kraft, 43, is on trial in Superior Court in Santa Ana, accused of killing more  people than any serial killer has ever been charged with slaying in California.  If convicted of any of the 16 murders, prosecutors -- in a bid to send him to  the gas chamber -- might introduce evidence at a penalty phase alleging that  Kraft committed up to 45 murders.      Defense's Picture    Defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald contends that Kraft's work records and his  demeanor among colleagues on the job were inconsistent with someone who had  roamed freeways all night, picking up young men and killing them.    Prosecutors contend that the defense's timetable of Kraft on the job helps  build a case against the defendant. They said none of the employment logs show  that Kraft was at work when any of the 16 victims were known to have been  killed.    Swimwear distributor Donald Sheahan on Wednesday produced work records for  Kraft, who was setting up computer programs for him. Here is how they relate to  three of the 16 murders, according to court testimony:    * The job records show that Kraft worked at Sheahan's Arena USA in Torrance on  Nov. 16, 17 and 19, 1978. He left work at 9:30 p.m. on the 17th and returned on  the 19th at 11 a.m. Kraft is charged with killing Michael Joseph Inderbeiten,  21, last seen alive at 2 a.m. on Nov. 18, 1978, walking toward a bus station  near a bar in Long Beach.

His body was found about 6 hours later on Moulton Parkway in  Laguna Hills.    Over the defense's objection, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has pointed out  to jurors that Kraft could have gone through Carson -- and picked up Keith  hitchhiking -- on his way home to East Long Beach after leaving Arena USA that  night.    * The records show that Kraft worked at Arena on July 5, 1978, from noon to  8:30 p.m. and on July 6, 1978, from 2 p.m. to midnight. Kraft is charged with  killing Keith Arthur Klingbeil, a transient from Washington state, whose body  was found about 3:30 a.m. on July 6, 1978, in a northbound lane of Interstate 5  in Mission Viejo.    The records also show that Kraft worked during the week before and the week  after the June 11, 1978, death of Roland Gerald Young, whose body was found in  Irvine. McDonald also introduced testimony that a week before the Inderbeiten  killing, Kraft was at his niece's wedding in Costa Mesa.    ""What we have here is a picture of Randy Kraft living a normal life style,  doing normal things at the time all this was going on,"" McDonald said after the  court session.    While McDonald was pleased with Sheahan's testimony, he lost another round with  Judge Donald A. McCartin on Wednesday in his attempt to put before jurors the  names of other potential suspects in the killings.    McCartin refused to let him elicit testimony in front of the jury that mass  murderer William C. Bonin, convicted of 14 murders in Southern California in  1978-80, was once a suspect in any of the Kraft murders.    McDonald wanted jurors to hear testimony that fibers found on one of the  victims had once been compared with known fibers in some of the Bonin cases.  Prosecutor Brown contended that the testimony would be irrelevant because the  lab reports showed that the fibers did not match, and the judge agreed.    After the court session, McDonald complained that ""the jurors should be given a  chance to evaluate any information that might be relevant.""    He said this would probably not be his last attempt to get Bonin's name in  front of the jury.

For the third time since Kraft's defense began June 30, his attorneys used work  records in a bid to show that he was busy with his computer consultant business  in Los Angeles County when bodies of young men were being found in Orange  County.    Kraft, 43, is on trial in Superior Court in Santa Ana, accused of killing more  people than any serial killer has ever been charged with slaying in California.  If convicted of any of the 16 murders, prosecutors -- in a bid to send him to  the gas chamber -- might introduce evidence at a penalty phase alleging that  Kraft committed up to 45 murders.      Defense's Picture    Defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald contends that Kraft's work records and his  demeanor among colleagues on the job were inconsistent with someone who had  roamed freeways all night, picking up young men and killing them.    Prosecutors contend that the defense's timetable of Kraft on the job helps  build a case against the defendant. They said none of the employment logs show  that Kraft was at work when any of the 16 victims were known to have been  killed.    Swimwear distributor Donald Sheahan on Wednesday produced work records for  Kraft, who was setting up computer programs for him. Here is how they relate to  three of the 16 murders, according to court testimony:    * The job records show that Kraft worked at Sheahan's Arena USA in Torrance on  Nov. 16, 17 and 19, 1978. He left work at 9:30 p.m. on the 17th and returned on  the 19th at 11 a.m. Kraft is charged with killing Michael Joseph Inderbeiten,  21, last seen alive at 2 a.m. on Nov. 18, 1978, walking toward a bus station  near a bar in Long Beach. His body was found 4 hours later along the 7th Street  on-ramp to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Seal Beach.    * The records show that Kraft was at Sheahan's on June 18, worked past midnight  and returned June 20 at 10:30 a.m. Kraft is charged with killing Richard Allen  Keith, 20, last seen alive at 11 p.m. June 18 when leaving his girlfriend's  house in Carson.

Bruce Edward Kingman, 41, was flown from Avalon to Long Beach on Thursday  afternoon and then driven to the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, where he was being  held without bail for allegedly killing Gail Lynn Pissula, 34.    Some of Kingman's friends and co-workers said she was a former girlfriend of  his who had recently returned to Avalon in search of work.      'Town Is Stunned'    ""Everybody is shook up about it,"" said Lolo Saldana, owner of the local barber  shop. ""The town is stunned.""    Paramedics received a call from Kingman about 4 a.m. Thursday and arrived at  his trailer on Pebbly Road to find Pissula lying on the ground nearby,  sheriff's deputies said.    Kingman said Pissula came to his trailer and the two argued before she slipped  and fell on a wooden patio, said Deputy Dan Cox. Kingman reportedly told  deputies that he attempted to revive her but failed.    Sheriff's officials declined to release other details or to say what led them  to suspect Kingman of murder.    Kingman and Pissula had known each other at least since 1986, when both worked  in Two Harbors, at the opposite end of the island, friends said.    For the past year, Kingman has managed Pebbly Beach Building Supply Co., a  lumberyard just outside the center of Avalon, said Jack Fennie Jr., the owner  of the business.    Fennie described Kingman as an excellent employee who reorganized the  lumberyard and made it more profitable.    He lived alternately in a trailer behind the business and in a sailboat  anchored not far offshore, Fennie said.    Kingman and the dead woman had lived together until they broke up last summer  and she moved to the mainland, Fennie said.

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NABLUS, Israeli      Occupied West Bank -- Hundreds of Israeli soldiers Saturday carried out raids  in Nablus, an urban hotbed of Palestinian unrest, arresting scores of youths  and searching dozens of homes. It was the biggest operation of its kind during  the two-year Arab uprising in the occupied territories.    The raids followed by a day the killing by Israeli troops of four members of a  Palestinian assassination squad known as the Black Panthers. The squad,  composed of young men wanted by Israeli authorities, was notorious for  murdering Arabs suspected as informers or Israeli collaborators.    Troops in plainclothes spearheaded Friday's action, opening fire on a  barbershop in the old inner city of Nablus. A barber who did not belong to the  Black Panthers was among five people wounded, Palestinian sources said.    Saturday's raids appeared aimed at breaking the back of the uprising in Nablus,  which is the West Bank's largest and most militant anti-Israeli city. Unrest  that was once confined to the stone alleyways of the Old City has spread up the  biblical slopes of the Mountain of Curses on one side and Mountain of Blessings  on the other.    ""I believe that in the future it will be quiet in this area,"" said Gen. Yitzhak  Mordechai, the Israeli West Bank commander who directed the raids.    Since the uprising began in December, 1987, more than 100 Palestinians have  been killed by Israeli action in Nablus.    Soldiers began pouring into the city at 4 a.m., splitting into groups of about  200 each and fanning out to perhaps a dozen neighborhoods. About 90 white Ford  Escorts, the emblem vehicle of the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence  agency, also drove into town.    Green army trucks roamed the streets with loudspeakers blaring a warning to  residents to be calm. ""Terrorist groups have been disturbing you. We are here  to get rid of them,"" the announcements said.    As the morning wore on, hundreds of blindfolded youths were trucked or walked  into a plaza in front of the city's tallest building. Dozens of others were  interned at the military headquarters at the northern entrance to Nablus.    Troops collected masks, axes, knives and other items that could be used as  weapons.    Several residents complained that soldiers went on rampages during searches,  overturning furniture and rifling drawers. One man was arrested for having  copies of Al Bayader Assiyasi, a moderate Palestinian political publication.  Others were detained for having large kitchen knives in their possession.    There were no immediate reports of injuries.    The killing of the Black Panther members was carried out by Cherry, a special  Israeli military unit used to track down wanted Palestinians, military sources  said. The same unit earlier carried out a raid on members of the Red Eagles,  another Palestinian death squad that specialized in killing suspected  collaborators. In that assault, one Palestinian was killed and four were  arrested.    In both cases, the Israelis disguised themselves as Arabs. They wore kaffiyehs,  the traditional cloth headdress, and rode in cars bearing the blue license  plates required of West Bank drivers.    For the past year, Israel has waged a secret war on Palestinian militants.  Soldiers and Shin Bet agents have carried out numerous ambushes of stone  throwers. Once, in Bethlehem, soldiers disguised themselves as tourists,  shooting and killing a stone thrower.    As killings of collaborators increased in number during the summer and fall,  Israeli attention has turned to wiping out Palestinian hit squads, notably in  Nablus. Some of the members of such squads carry weapons.    ""I don't think there are too many groups holding arms,"" said Gen. Mordechai.  ""But it's enough that there are just a few -- if they try to use them, it can  make a lot of problems in the areas.""    The killing of the Black Panthers set off small riots in Nablus and in the  faraway Gaza Strip as well.    In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded at least 30 Palestinians on  Saturday and placed a curfew on the town of Rafah and its adjacent refugee  camp.    Publicly, Palestinian leaders were of two minds regarding the Black Panthers  and Red Eagles. On the one hand, they considered the unbridled killing of  suspected informers and criminals as soiling the moderate image of the  uprising.    ""The hit squads became the judge, jury and executioners, and there was bound to  be abuses,"" a Palestinian journalist said.    On the other hand, Palestinian leaders recognized that while Israel continued  to hunt down hard-core street activists, it would be hard to rein in the  violent groups. Until the killing of collaborators became epidemic in the  summer, the Palestine Liberation Organization and local leaders of the uprising  had taken responsibility for the slayings and viewed them as necessary  housecleaning.    Recently, both the Black Panthers and Red Eagles rejected calls from PLO  Chairman Yasser Arafat to stop the killing. The Panthers were affiliated with  Fatah, the main PLO faction under Arafat's control; the Eagles had ties to the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist-led PLO faction.    In an interview on Israel Television on Friday, a jailed member of the Red  Eagles said, ""All due respect to (Arafat), but he doesn't know the situation  here.""    The youth, 17-year-old Jabber Hawash, admitted carrying out eight murders,  including the axing of his own cousin, a middle-aged woman. The Red Eagles had  interrogated 140 suspects and used torture and beatings to get answers, he  said.    ""If we stop the killing, what can we do here, just sit around?"" he asked.    Even as Jabber's words were broadcast on television, Israel Radio reported that  inmates of the Ketziot prison camp in the Negev desert killed a fellow inmate  suspected of informing for the Israelis.

THEY PICKED WRONG  STATE AT THE WRONG TIME.      By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DETROIT      Bertram R. Harper says his wife died Aug. 19 exactly the way she wanted, in a  motel room, with her husband and daughter holding her hands, comforting her and  in a state where she believed they wouldn't be prosecuted for their assistance  in her death.    After she had stopped breathing that stormy night, Harper, 72, called the  police. He and his stepdaughter told them exactly what happened -- how they had  come from Loomis, Calif., near Sacramento; how Virginia Harper, 69, suffering  from advanced cancer, had taken sleeping pills and how he had assisted her in  slipping a plastic bag over her head.    When the first few attempts failed, he told them, he'd waited until she had  fallen asleep and then put the bag on her himself. He secured it around her  neck with rubber bands.    ""We didn't expect problems,"" said Harper, a retired chemical engineer. ""We  wanted to come here, my wife wanted to have a suicide very quietly and with no  notoriety and that would be the end of it."" His voice cracks when he speaks of  it. ""That's why we came to Michigan.""    Instead, Harper was charged with murder.    Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hara wanted to send a message, two months after  a Michigan doctor, Jack Kevorkian, had made headlines by using his so-called  ""suicide machine"" to help an Oregon woman die: The state is no mecca for mercy  killing.    Kevorkian has not been charged in Oakland County, where his actions took place,  but Harper was put in jail. After a week behind bars, a California bail  bondsman posted the $25,000 bail and won his release.    ""It is important for people to know,"" the prosecutor said in a statement after  murder charges were filed and while Harper was incarcerated, ""that Michigan is  not a state where people can assist in suicides, commit euthanasia or murder  and escape criminal responsibility for their acts.""    Now Harper, fighting to stay out of prison, is becoming a cause celebre and a  symbol to the growing and increasingly vocal pro-euthanasia movement.    ""I think it's tragic,"" said Derek Humphry, national director of the Hemlock  Society, an organization that supports euthanasia and to which Harper belongs.  The organization is helping to pay for Harper's attorney and has created a  defense fund.    ""It's sort of like innocents abroad,"" Humphry said of the family. ""These are  good, decent people, going all that way to keep from getting into trouble and  then getting into more trouble than they imagined.""    In a hearing Friday, a district judge ruled that there is sufficient evidence  for Harper to stand trial on charges of open murder -- which may be defined at  trial as first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter -- and of conspiring  with his stepdaughter to commit murder.    His stepdaughter, Shanda McGrew, who was in the motel room and who has stood by  Harper's side since then, is not being charged.    ""I don't think any jury is going to convict this man of anything,"" Harper's  attorney, Hugh M. Davis, said after the hearing. ""This is a case of love and  death, and which will prevail. We believe love will.""    The Harpers traveled to Michigan because of a paragraph in one of Humphry's  books that mentions a 1983 case in which the Michigan Court of Appeals threw  out murder charges against a man who had obtained a gun and ammunition and left  them with a depressed friend who shot himself.    The court ruled that because the Legislature had not defined aiding suicide as  a crime, the man's actions could not be classified as homicide.    Hoping to avoid prosecution, Harper on Aug. 18 bought plane tickets to Detroit.  It was two weeks after Virginia had been told by her doctor that she had  terminal cancer and one day after she had awakened one morning in excruciating  pain and said she was ready to end it.    ""We've been married 23 years and this is something we'd discussed over the  years,"" Harper said. ""It wasn't necessarily like a suicide pact or anything  like that, but we both considered the quality of life the essential thing, not  how long you lived.""    The couple had friends who had died very painful, lingering deaths, Harper  said. ""We've seen people die deaths that you wouldn't put a dog through,"" he  said. ""If you did, you'd land in jail.""    They agreed that they'd each rather commit suicide than face painful deaths.    They joined the Hemlock Society in the mid-1980s, sometime after Virginia first  discovered she had breast cancer in 1983. The lump was removed. Then, in 1989,  another tumor was discovered. It, too, was removed.    It wasn't until early August that she discovered the cancer had spread to her  liver. The doctor gave her from ""two months to two years"" to live, Harper said.    That's when his wife began getting her affairs in order and when he began  preparing himself emotionally to help, Harper said.    Assistant Prosecutor Tim Kenny argued Friday, however, that Harper did more  than aid in his wife's suicide.    ""The evidence has indicated that Mr. Harper was motivated by love for his wife  and was concerned and moved by his wife's suffering,"" he said. But, noting a  coroner's ruling that Virginia Harper died of asphyxiation caused by the  plastic bag and not from an overdose of sleeping pills, Kenny said: ""This is in  fact a mercy killing.""    Acknowledging what he called ""on-going and increasingly loud societal concerns""  about euthanasia, Kenny argued that until the Legislature passes a law allowing  mercy killing, the government has no choice but to prosecute it.    Pro-euthanasia initiatives are being advanced in four states -- Washington,  California, Florida and Oregon, Humphry said. Farthest along is Washington. A  spokesman for Washington Citizens for Death with Decency, said 145,700  signatures have been gathered on petitions. Only 150,000 are needed to put the  issue on the ballot.    ""It's fairly certain that in Washington in November of 1991 there will be the  first ever vote on euthanasia,"" Humphry said by telephone from his office in  Eugene, Ore.    The Hemlock Society director estimated that ""many hundreds"" of terminally ill  people have used the methods described in his books to kill themselves. This is  the first time to his knowledge, however, that anyone has gone to Michigan to  do it to escape prosecution, he said.    If the Harpers had contacted him first, he said, he would have advised them  against it. Both Virginia's death and the legal aftermath would have gone more  smoothly in the calmness of her own home and in a community where the family is  known, he said.    Davis argued unsuccessfully Friday that the harshest charge Harper should face  is voluntary manslaughter, which carries a possible sentence of 15 years. The  judge refused to reduce the charge, however, leaving the issue for a circuit  court to decide.    The second count against Harper, conspiracy to commit murder, carries a  mandatory life sentence, Davis said.    Harper said that once before his wife attempted suicide alone.    ""It happened very suddenly while I was away,"" he told authorities in a  statement. ""I came home and there was a message from a friend to meet Ginger at  a Holiday Inn in Sacramento.""    When he inquired about her at the front desk, he was told that she had rented a  room. He found the key in the door, he said. When he entered, he said in an  interview, he found her sitting on the floor, slumped against a wall.    She had taken sleeping pills, and they had taken effect before she could put  the plastic bag in place, he said.    She resolved after that never to attempt it again without her family near,  Harper said.    Even now, Harper's eyes light up remembering her, and he can laugh.    Not remembering the last part. Remembering her.    Here, in a lawyer's office, with her gone and him in a mess of trouble -- more  trouble than either of them had bargained for -- Harper's belly shakes and his  eyes twinkle.    Virginia can still make him laugh.    She was irrepressible. How else to say it?    Harper was wearing a shirt Virginia had made for him, a beige and brown nature  print that matches one of her outfits. She would do that, have shirts made from  the material left over from the dresses she sewed. The two of them would walk  around in matching outfits.    ""It was Ginger's way of saying I belonged to her,"" said Harper.    She liked bright colors. In 1967, when they were married, she owned a  chartreuse '56 T-bird with floral interior. That was the kind of person she  was.    Both had been married previously. They met through a personal ad she ran in  Fact magazine, a national publication, in 1963.    ""It was very daring of her to do that,"" McGrew said of her mother.    A long-distance relationship developed over the years. Shortly before they were  married in 1967, Harper flew from Vermont to Denver on a business trip and  decided to detour to California to pay her a visit. It was his birthday, and,  ""somewhere over Kansas,"" he was startled to see a flight attendant, who had  been tipped off by Virginia, walking toward down the aisle with a birthday cake  with candles.    He laughs now thinking about it.      Photo, Bertram Harper, left, confers with his attorney at a hearing.

THEY PICKED WRONG  STATE AT THE WRONG TIME.      By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DETROIT      Bertram R. Harper says his wife died Aug. 19 exactly the way she wanted, in a  motel room, with her husband and daughter holding her hands, comforting her and  in a state where she believed they wouldn't be prosecuted for their assistance  in her death.    After she had stopped breathing that stormy night, Harper, 72, called the  police. He and his stepdaughter told them exactly what happened -- how they had  come from Loomis, Calif., near Sacramento; how Virginia Harper, 69, suffering  from advanced cancer, had taken sleeping pills and how he had assisted her in  slipping a plastic bag over her head.    When the first few attempts failed, he told them, he'd waited until she had  fallen asleep and then put the bag on her himself. He secured it around her  neck with rubber bands.    ""We didn't expect problems,"" said Harper, a retired chemical engineer. ""We  wanted to come here, my wife wanted to have a suicide very quietly and with no  notoriety and that would be the end of it."" His voice cracks when he speaks of  it. ""That's why we came to Michigan.""    Instead, Harper was charged with murder.    Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hara wanted to send a message, two months after  a Michigan doctor, Jack Kevorkian, had made headlines by using his so-called  ""suicide machine"" to help an Oregon woman die: The state is no mecca for mercy  killing.    Kevorkian has not been charged in Oakland County, where his actions took place,  but Harper was put in jail. After a week behind bars, a California bail  bondsman posted the $25,000 bail and won his release.    ""It is important for people to know,"" the prosecutor said in a statement after  murder charges were filed and while Harper was incarcerated, ""that Michigan is  not a state where people can assist in suicides, commit euthanasia or murder  and escape criminal responsibility for their acts.""    Now Harper, fighting to stay out of prison, is becoming a cause celebre and a  symbol to the growing and increasingly vocal pro-euthanasia movement.    ""I think it's tragic,"" said Derek Humphry, national director of the Hemlock  Society, an organization that supports euthanasia and to which Harper belongs.  The organization is helping to pay for Harper's attorney and has created a  defense fund.    ""It's sort of like innocents abroad,"" Humphry said of the family. ""These are  good, decent people, going all that way to keep from getting into trouble and  then getting into more trouble than they imagined.""    In a hearing Friday, a district judge ruled that there is sufficient evidence  for Harper to stand trial on charges of open murder -- which may be defined at  trial as first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter -- and of conspiring  with his stepdaughter to commit murder.    His stepdaughter, Shanda McGrew, who was in the motel room and who has stood by  Harper's side since then, is not being charged.    ""I don't think any jury is going to convict this man of anything,"" Harper's  attorney, Hugh M. Davis, said after the hearing. ""This is a case of love and  death, and which will prevail. We believe love will.""    The Harpers traveled to Michigan because of a paragraph in one of Humphry's  books that mentions a 1983 case in which the Michigan Court of Appeals threw  out murder charges against a man who had obtained a gun and ammunition and left  them with a depressed friend who shot himself.    The court ruled that because the Legislature had not defined aiding suicide as  a crime, the man's actions could not be classified as homicide.    Hoping to avoid prosecution, Harper on Aug. 18 bought plane tickets to Detroit.  It was two weeks after Virginia had been told by her doctor that she had  terminal cancer and one day after she had awakened one morning in excruciating  pain and said she was ready to end it.    ""We've been married 23 years and this is something we'd discussed over the  years,"" Harper said. ""It wasn't necessarily like a suicide pact or anything  like that, but we both considered the quality of life the essential thing, not  how long you lived.""    The couple had friends who had died very painful, lingering deaths, Harper  said. ""We've seen people die deaths that you wouldn't put a dog through,"" he  said. ""If you did, you'd land in jail.""    They agreed that they'd each rather commit suicide than face painful deaths.    They joined the Hemlock Society in the mid-1980s, sometime after Virginia first  discovered she had breast cancer in 1983. The lump was removed. Then, in 1989,  another tumor was discovered. It, too, was removed.    It wasn't until early August that she discovered the cancer had spread to her  liver. The doctor gave her from ""two months to two years"" to live, Harper said.

When Israeli Prime Minister Rabin  stops killing our children and women, Hamas will then stop  attacking Israeli civilians and commit itself to attacking  soldiers and settlers only.""    Replying to a question, he asserted that ""the intifadah  youths will perform miracles and prove that the Israeli Army is  a paper tiger."" Ghawshah rejected President Yasir 'Arafat's  declared regret over the killing of Israeli civilians, and  reiterated that ""the ball is in Rabin's court. The blood of  Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood of  Israeli civilians.""    In a telephone contact, Ghawshah told AL-HAYAH that the  Hadera operation, for which the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions  claimed credit, ""came as part of the Palestinian people's  reaction to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Moreover,  it was directed against Israeli occupation and is part of the  Hamas Movement strategy. We believe that there cannot be any  peace as long as there are settlers on our land. No doubt,  these strikes have put Rabin, 'Arafat, and U.S. President Bill  Clinton in an impasse because they are in the same boat.""    Ghawshah added: ""These strikes prove that Rabin failed to  fulfill his promise to the Jews that he would restore calm and  guarantee security. These strikes happened in the territories  occupied in 1948 under strict and serious security measures.  Rabin's situation is being eroded. As for 'Arafat, the  Palestinian people have bypassed him since the Ibrahimi Mosque's  massacre in Hebron. When the 'Afula operation was carried out,  Hamas managed to prove to the world that it can punish the  criminals and murderers and impose respect for the will of  Muslims and Arabs throughout the world.""    Replying to a question, Ghawshah said that ""Hamas was  committed to attacking soldiers and settlers. What happened,  however, is that Rabin did not stop killing children and women.  Yesterday, they killed a pregnant woman, and they did not stop  blowing up houses, which reminds us of the Nazi actions in  Europe. Therefore, Hamas was obliged to expand the circle. The  principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all secular and  religious laws. As we eagerly adhere to Islamic principles, we  are aware that Islam permits reciprocal treatment for us. Thus,  let them stop killing children and women, and Hamas will then  commit itself to attacking only soldiers and settlers. If,  however, they continue their actions, we tell them that the  blood of Palestinian civilians is not cheaper than the blood of  Jewish civilians. Rabin should be aware of this.""     "
0,FT943-4024 ,"FT943-4024 _AN-EIKACAEPFT 940910   FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Inspired by organised chaos - Venice Film Festival / Nigel Andrews thoroughly enjoys the inspired madness embodied in this week's on-screen offerings      By NIGEL ANDREWS   The Venice Film Festival has reached an alarming stage. Instead of feeling as we critics should during these events - like hardworking martyrs to art with subtitles permanently dancing before our eyes - we have been enjoying almost every new movie. From the latest Woody Allen comedy Bullets Over Broadway we jaunt over to a midnight Harrison Ford romp, Clear And Present Danger. From a jolly Spanish film about love and acrobatics, The Tit And The Moon, we proceed to a nailbiting, inspired Danish TV series about a haunted hospital, The Kingdom, before skipping over to Heavenly Creatures, a truth-based New Zealand black comedy about two schoolgirls who murder for their friendship. Jury president David Lynch was seen leaving this last in a glow of approbation, so the Golden Lion may reach a long paw into the Antipodes next Monday. Heavenly Creatures was co-written and directed by Peter Jackson, best known for spoof splatter films like Brain Dead. Here he has held back on the flying intestines but not the sense of camp hyperbole. This 1950s Christchurch is awash with picket-fence prettiness and twittering moral decency - Lynch territory par excellence - as Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) form their fantasy-filled friendship. This is fed by their own tales of castles and kings, and served by Jackson's blithe camera arabesques and transformation scenes. Gasp at the Sound Of Music-style helicopter shot of Juliet running over a hill; gasp again when that landscape is metamorphosed into a lush palace garden. Unicorns, fountains, butterflies large as hang-gliders .. It all ends in blood and tears, as the two girls' parents, who condemn the friendship as 'unhealthy' and 'unwholesome', predict it will. But for the audience, what a movie ride before we hit the buffers. The only other Venice movie on this scale of robust postmodernism - witty exaggeration built into the po-faced melodrama - was Lars Von Trier's The Kingdom. This is not a movie at all but more a four-part, 4 1/2 -then-two-hour TV series, shot with a handheld camera in poverty-row monochrome. But it proves the Danish director of acclaimed style-pieces The Element Of Crime and Europa can turn on the magic without tricksy optical effects. In this Lynch-lore festival you could call The Kingdom 'Twin Peaks in a hospital': teasingly quotidian setting; weirder and weirder characters; emergency outbreaks of non-sequitur; the apocalypse of ghosts and guilty secrets. But Trier and Niels Vorsel's script has a start-to-finish logic that Peaks never quite had. Its perfectly meshed characters - the sarcastic Swedish neuro-consultant, the solemnly deranged anatomy lecturer, the hypochondriacal old lady who hears 'voices' in the lift shaft - give the story a strong, even Ibsenite, vertebra, while the wacky toll of severed heads, masonic rituals and self-destruct surgery provides the gymnastic freedom of narrative. In the vain quest for a dud film at this festival we critics tried everything. A Woody Allen film without Woody? That might be a trial. But no  -it was Bullets Over Broadway, a sparkling comedy of theatre manners, with gangsters, gags and the funniest not-by-Woody performance in the entire Allen cannon. This was Dianne Wiest's vainglorious actress: sighing, soaring, scatterbrained, Gloria Swanson crossed with Margaret Dumont. Then there was the movie from Spain's Bigas Luna, late of Goldenballs, about the little boy, his older pal and the big-breasted circus ballerina they fight over. Tiresome Fellini rip-off? No. Charming, stylish and funny. How about Jefery Levy's SFW? This rock-scored, kaleidoscopic US movie is about a young hostage-crisis survivor (Backbeat's Stephen Dorff), who after 36 days in a convenience store at the mercy of a lunatic's video-camera whose images were broadcast 'live' across the nation, tries to adjust to the vulgar glare of media heroism. It threatens to be a glib, easy-target topical melodrama but gains in wit and bite as it goes on. The only undisputed flops have been Alexandre Rockwell's Somebody To Love - a drippy New York love story set among what seem to be the underworld folk left over from Woody Allen's film - and Ermanno Olmi's The Bible Part 1. This is subtitled Genesis: Creation And Flood - and yes, Olmi plans to film the entire Good Book. Not like this, we hope. The Noah sequence aside, with its eye-catching ark and brief warmth of human detail, the film is no more than a glorified nature documentary set to a maunderingly 'prophetic' voice-over. The Olmi style seems even more ossified in a festival that has just produced Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Some people loved this film, some hated it. The only sane response is to do both. Based on a story by Hollywood's favourite enfant terrible Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), the movie is a two-hour bloodbath. The main terrorists are a young couple (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis) who, after a cross-country murder spree in the film's first half, repeat the mayhem when they break out of jail in the second. That Oliver Stone was becoming an eccentric film-maker we knew from the St Vitus style of JFK. But even that seems measured beside the poetic epilepsy of this film. Manic jump-cuts; topsy-turvy angles; high-speed alternations between black-and-white and colour, film and video, reality and hallucination; split-second bits of newsreel, animation. Since the soundtrack also bawls out rock music, some have called the whole thing a feature-length pop promo. But it is much more. Despite the suspect encouragement it might offer susceptible filmgoers - that killing is exhilarating - it is inspired. The fragmented approach is not arbitrary. Stone offers us different ways of viewing the same story at the same time: documentary, fantasy, home movie, even sitcom. Scenes from the girl's childhood are enacted as clips from a TV comedy series, with comic Rodney Dangerfield as Dad and canned laughter greeting each dialogue exchange. Later, Stone derides the couch potato culture again in the figure of an Aussie-accented tabloid-TV interviewer (Robert Downey Jr, very funny) who follows the couple's jailbreak live. Natural Born Killers is an alarming work, and for some a demented one. (Tarantino himself has disowned the movie). But you cannot expect tranquil responses to a film that proposes a whole new direction for film-making itself - and that never offers spectators the soft option of a single, moralising perspective on its bloody subject.

Kamath: ""The Fate of Kashmiri Pandits""]    [Text] An international conference of Kashmiri Pandits was  held in Delhi in the last week of December 1993 to focus the  attention firstly of all Indians and secondly of the world  beyond, on their present fate. And what is their fate? Their  fate is to live as refugees in places outside the Vale of  Kashmir which has been their ancestral home for centuries, in  make-shift tents, braving the cold in winter and the searing  heat in summer with no proper sanitary facilities and less  medical attention. Organisations like Asia Watch while raising  howls about the difficulties of Kashmiri Muslims, make no more  than passing reference to the inhuman brutalities with which the  Muslim terrorists have dealt with them. Over three lakh Kashmiri  Pandits have been forced to flee their homes under threat of  death. The terrorists have indulged in the rape of women and the  killing of men in the best style of invading Muslim hordes of  the Middle Ages. The latest incident is the shooting down of a  hundred-year old Kashmiri Pandit in Wanpora in the first week of  June 1993. In what way an aged man could have menaced Islam only  the terrorists can tell. The Kashmir Government is silent on  this as on other reckless murders. The Government of India is  embarrassingly silent. Nobody wants to speak out lest their  secular credentials are questioned by anyone. In 1941, according  to census figures, Muslims formed 83 percent of the population  of the Vale of Kashmir and Hindus 15 percent. In 1991 Muslims  formed 97 percent of the population and Hindus 0.1 percent.  Ethnic cleansing is complete. Aurangzeb would have been proud of  the Muslim terrorists for the splendid work the latter have  accomplished in the last four decades. According to a booklet  published by the Kashmiri Samiti on human rights violation in  Kashmir, the terrorist killings have been accompanied by torture  unheard of in the annals of human history and includes  strangulation by using steel wires, hanging, impaling, branding  with red hot irons, burning alive, lynching, gouging of eyes  before assassination, dismemberment of body, dragging to death  and just plain slaughter. The booklet gives details including  the names of those killed and the dates they were killed. The  Government of India is free to challenge these facts and if they  are untrue, this should be publicised. If they are true, we need  an explanation. According to the booklet ""the (Kashmiri) State  Government is yet to disclose the identity of about 400 dead  bodies recovered by the police and disposed of at its will"". The  booklet accuses the State Government of an attempt ""to cover the  anti-Hindu character of the terrorist violence and has tried to  play down the massacre of Hindus"". It is true that the  terrorists have also killed Muslims not in their good books.  Total civilians so far killed number 2,256 in five years  (1988-1992) for which figures are available. The majority, of  course, are Hindus -- Kashmiri Pandits. The unpleasant fact  about Kashmir and its terrorist faction is that the crusade is  to merge the State with Pakistan and drive every single Hindu  out. Already the ethnic cleansing is almost complete. The brunt  of hatred has been borne by the Kashmiri Pandits who have been  denied elementary human rights. But to this date the fate of the  Kashmiri Pandits is of no concern to anybody.    But let it be said clearly and precisely: Kashmir belongs to  the Kashmiri Pandits, the original inhabitants of the state --  and NOT to the Muslims, just as Kuwait, or Oman or Bahrain which  have non-Muslim majorities belong to the local Muslims because  the latter are the original inhabitants of the areas.  Islam came to India only in the 12th century. That a good number  of the original Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam does not  hide the fact that the background and the past of all  Kashmiris is Hindu and should be recognised as such. The list of  distinguished Kashmiri poets and scholars in Sanskrit from the  Vedic period right on to the 12th century is long and  impressive. The list tapers off following the advent of islam in  the Vale.    To say that Kashmir is Muslim is a negation of history and a  pandering to the whims of the neo-historians. Kashmir was, is  and shall remain essentially Hindu and cannot be permitted to go  into the hands of Pakistan for the last traces of Hinduism to be  wiped out for ever. That is why the Kashmiris have been asking  for a ""homeland"" of their own. That homeland can only be in  Kashmir, not in Dandakaranya or somewhere in the wilds of Madhya  Pradesh. And there is nothing fanciful in the demand of the  Pandits. If Jews in their diaspora could dream and fight for a  Jewish state two thousand years after they were dispersed in the  four corners of Europe and get the support of modern states like  Britain, France and United States and other smaller nations,  there is no reason why the Kashmiri Pandits should not ask for a  homeland here and now, while their status as refugees is  temporary. There is an attempt made by our ""intellectuals"" to  fob off the Kashmiri Pandits with false promises by saying that,  why, of course, they could get back to their homes they were  forced to vacate when the Kashmir issue is ""settled"". Nobody  asks the question: Settled how? Or when? Or under what  conditions? They are not consulted when the foreign secretaries  of India and Pakistan discuss the so-called ""Kashmir Question""  as if their fate is of no moment. Aren't they entitled to know?  Are they destined for ever to live as refugees at the mercy as  much of a callous government as of a callous class of  ""intellectuals""?    There can be -- and there should be -- no Kashmir  ""settlement"" without the guaranteed return of the Kashmiri  Pandits to their ancestral homes. And even that is not enough.  The State should guarantee that they will not be treated as  second class citizens as has been the case these last four  decades. They cannot be left to the tender mercies of  ex-terrorists and their ilk. One can be sure that if Pakistan  has its way, there will be no place for Kashmiri Pandits in  Kashmir, which is their legitimate home. Under no circumstances  should this be allowed to come to pass. Islamic terrorists  should not be allowed to get away with murder. To support  Kashmiri Pandits in their just cause -- which is a demand for a  homeland -- is not communalism. Conceding that  Kashmir is ""Muslim"" is reverse communalism. Kashmiri  Pandits have a sound case and it should be presented in every  international forum. The Government has to stop being defeatist.  Kashmir cannot be given away to Pakistan; nor can it be handed  over on a platter to Islamic fundamentalists. The safe return of  the Kashmiri Pandits to their ancestral homes is -- and should  be -- the special responsibility of the Government of India  which cannot be dodged or made slight of. Kashmir is the  homeland of the Pandits -- and so it will remain.  *     "

The  aircraft dropped 16 napalm and phosphorous bombs, destroying  several houses, and killing and wounding a large number of  civilians.

Bie Province: On 2 and 3 June 1994, the MPLA-PT air force  dropped bombs over its own defensive positions in the city of  Bie [Cuito], killing and wounding many government troops and  civilians. Intense clashes have been taking place in the city  of Bie since 26 May 1994, when enemy forces once again violated  the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] on 20 September 1993.

Paramilitary police and firemen went Tuesday to rescue  survivors from the disaster, who were thought to be of West  African origin, but the precise number and nationalities of the  victims was not clear.    Early in February, 67 illegal immigrants, mainly Ghanaians  and Nigerians, died in their crowded cell at a paramilitary  police base in Libreville, sparking an international protest and  a Gabonese government enquiry.    People from other West African countries are attracted by  the  relative prosperity of Gabon, which until last year had the  highest income per head in the region. The minimum wage is  still higher than in other countries.    For clandestine travellers, the sea trip is the most  perilous  part of the journey. They travel in pirogues, generally owned  by Nigerians, which can carry up to 80 people. The voyage from  Nigeria to Gabon takes five or six days, with port calls in  Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, where the ferrymen engage in  more or less shady trading activities.    It is not uncommon for the boats to be caught in storms and  shipwrecks are frequent in the Gulf of Guinea.    Already weakened by the journey and by the lack of food,  according to some survivors, the hopeful immigrants sometimes  find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers.    One oft-used trick is deliberately to ground the pirogue on  a  bank not far offshore, where the ferrymen rob their charges of  their luggage. Some of the passengers are themselves smugglers,  carrying objects of value.    Over the years, the growth of illegal immigration and  smuggling has led to the founding of illegal ports, tucked away  on isolated shores or islands, particularly in Equatorial Guinea.     "

The idea that we should develop an ASAT as a sort of analog to the development  of our naval forces in the last century to assure freedom of the high seas is  specious reasoning.

0,FT922-8387 ,"FT922-8387 _AN-CEMBDAFCFT 920513   FT  13 MAY 92 / British Rail holds up the Euston Stagecoach      By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent   THE TRAIN arriving at London Euston's Platform One from Aberdeen every morning is the first regular privately operated passenger service to run on British Rail since nationalisation in 1948. But some things never change. The inaugural train, bearing public transport minister Mr Roger Freeman as passenger of honour, pulled in yesterday in much the same fashion as any ordinary BR train: 12 minutes late. In fairness, no blame could be attached to Stagecoach, the entrepreneurial bus operator providing the service. So far, its two carriages are merely appended to BR's existing sleeper service, so passengers remain at the mercy of BR timekeeping. Stagecoach stepped in when BR decided to drop seat-only accommodation on night trains between London and Aberdeen. It has taken over the seat-only carriages, repainting them in its own livery. Hostesses provide Stagecoach customers with a free hot meal in the evening, unlimited soft drinks and beverages (but strictly no alcohol) through the night and a bap with butter and jam for breakfast. Some fares are lower, too. BR charges Pounds 57 for a one-way ticket between London and Edinburgh, plus Pounds 25 for a sleeper berth. The price for Stagecoach's seat-only tickets, which can be bought from BR, is Pounds 33.50. On the inaugural run the worst advertisement for de-regulation turned out to be the minister himself. Under close questioning, Mr Freeman confessed that he had slipped away from the private-sector part of the train to grab a few hours' rest in the comfort of a public-sector sleeping compartment. 'I've got a full day's work in front of me,' he remarked, somewhat testily. 'I am 50 years old and I didn't feel like sitting up all night.'  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher made the decision Monday to give federal  attorneys more time to gather evidence to support their contention that the red  foxes must be killed to protect two species of endangered birds that nest in  the 1,100-acre Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge on the military property.    An Orange County-based group, the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., sued the U.S.  Navy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1986 to stop the killing of  foxes, a predator not native to the area. The foxes, according to government  biologists, prey on the eggs of the light-footed clapper rail and the  California lest tern, two endangered bird species that inhabit the marshy  refuge.    Kelleher issued a temporary restraining order last week that allows the Navy to  continue trapping and removing the foxes, but he prohibited killing the  animals. Attorneys for Animal Lovers had sought the injunction after learning  that a handful of red foxes had been killed in recent weeks by federal  biologists.    Federal officials have argued that it has become increasingly difficult to find  homes outside the area for the foxes because of their predatory nature and  ability to breed rapidly.

U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher made the decision Monday to give federal  attorneys more time to gather evidence to support their contention that the red  foxes must be killed to protect two species of endangered birds that nest in  the 1,100-acre Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge on the military property.    An Orange County-based group, the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., sued the U.S.  Navy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1986 to stop the killing of  foxes, a predator not native to the area. The foxes, according to government  biologists, prey on the eggs of the light-footed clapper rail and the  California lest tern, two endangered bird species that inhabit the marshy  refuge.

By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Justina Endjala, a shy 17-year-old from Namibia, had just finished telling of  life in her West African homeland -- of police brutality, racial segregation, a  century-old battle for independence. Rachel Richman, a white Glendale High  School senior, was shaking her head.    ""I basically know nothing about those countries,"" said Richman, 17. ""It makes  me mad that I don't know and that I'm not doing anything about it. But how are  we supposed to relate to them if we're thinking, 'Am I going to get a car for  my 16th birthday?' ""    For Endjala and seven other youths who are part of a project called Children of  War, now touring Los Angeles schools to educate and motivate their American  peers, the question was typical.    It spoke, in a way, of the divided world faced by many of the students in their  audiences last Friday at Glendale and Hoover high schools, where an increasing  number of students from war-torn countries are trying to mix into American  teen-age life.    The Glendale schools were two stops on a three-week tour by members of Children  of War, a project sponsored by the Religious Task Force, an interfaith, New  York-based group.    The task force, according to its literature, recruits and pays for teen-agers  from troubled areas, including the United States, to share their experiences  with American youth and promote grass-roots action and education about ""social  injustice.""    Glendale's eight visitors made up one of two groups touring Los Angeles,  speaking for free to student, church and community groups. Some had emigrated  to the United States, some were simply visiting as part of the tour. One was a  teen-age American mother from Boston.    After arriving at Hoover, where several hundred students filled an auditorium,  they spoke in English about their lives.    Sanaa Al Okbi, 19, a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship who attends a Jewish  university in Jerusalem, talked softly into the microphone, her voice choked by  tears. ""I feel very strongly inside that I'm Palestinian. But I can't say that  in my country. It's very dangerous. But I have no choice. I study in school  Jewish religion, Jewish language, Jewish history. I know their history better  than I know my own.    ""The land without people is our land,"" said Al Okbi, wearing a traditional  Palestinian frock, a kofia. ""I want peace for my people. I want freedom. I want  to say I'm Palestinian without fear.""    Asi Degani, a T-shirt- and sneaker-clad 18-year-old from Israel, put his hands  in his jeans pockets and spoke calmly. ""In six months I'll have to go into the  Israeli Army, and I'll have to stand in front of kids 7, 8 or 9 who will throw  stones or Molotov cocktails at me and I'll have to shoot them.    ""The question,"" he said, as Al Okbi wept in her chair behind him, ""is not  whether I'll shoot back but whether I should be there in the first place. The  answer, of course, is no.""    Saroeum Phoung, 17, a refugee from Cambodia now living in Boston, talked of his  harrowing escape from the Khmer Rouge regime. ""It's hard for a kid like me to  be born into this world where all I see, all I hear is people killing each  other and a world screaming for help.    ""My family spent five years living in a refugee camp in Thailand before we made  it to the United States,"" he said. ""When I got here, I thought it meant peace  and freedom. But it didn't. Everyone says 'go back, we don't want you here.'  This world has shown no mercy to me. Only pressure and pain. Now, I just want  peace.""    Like several hundred other students, Lisa Dohren, 18, a tall, blonde Hoover  senior, sat captivated by the words. ""I think it's really good that they, like,  talked about it,"" she said. ""You hear it on the news and you see it on TV but  you never talk to people firsthand. It makes it real.""    Reality is closer than some think. More than 65% of the district's 24,000  students are Asian, Latino, Filipino, Mid-Eastern or Pacific Islander,  according to district figures. Many of those only recently emigrated from their  homelands, said Alice Petrossian, director of intercultural education for  Glendale schools.    ""We have children from Vietnam who are boat people,"" Petrossian said. ""We have  children who were in the earthquake in Soviet Armenia. You could go to any  school site and find children who are willing to share their stories.""    One of Dohren's schoolmates, James Phan, listened to Phoung's speech and nodded  in painful agreement. Phan, 17, came to Glendale in 1988 from a Cambodian  refugee camp. His father had been killed by the Khmer Rouge; his mother, he  said, died last month in the camp.    But Phan, a junior, said he does not share his experiences with his classmates  at Hoover. And they usually don't ask.    ""It's supposed to be a melting pot, but it's like oil and water,"" Jessica  DiLullo, 17, a Hoover senior, said while standing near Phan.    After their speeches, the Children of War stepped down from the stage and  mingled with Hoover students, who approached them incredulously. The visitors,  who during their tour may make six to seven presentations each day, welcomed  the interest.    ""At Venice High, one student asked me if I had to ride a camel to school,""  Degani laughed, with a trace of weariness. ""It's not discouraging that they  don't know. It's discouraging when they don't care after they know.""    At Glendale High School, where the Children of War gave three presentations in  a classroom, their stories made Chelsey Overstreet, former student body  president, cry.    ""We were complaining last period about a lot of little things -- friendships,  weights, stuff like that,"" said Overstreet, 17. ""Then when you see kids our own  age going through those things. . . . And we worry that there aren't any  parties.""    Overstreet and two cheerleaders, Marisa Battaglia and Christie Denzel, stood  together and mulled their own, related problem: the divisions between them and  their immigrant classmates.    ""There's none of the violence, but there's a lot of prejudice,"" said Battaglia.  ""It's crossing the line that's hard. What do you do?""    Sherry Sami, 17, an Iranian immigrant now living in San Francisco, sat with the  other Children of War in the school's cafeteria and saw Overstreet cry.    Earlier, she told Glendale students how the Iran-Iraq war had taken the lives  of her relatives and the mind of her brother. Now she smiled and answered  Battaglia's question.    ""Some of them cry and apologize, but it's not their fault,"" Sami said. ""I say  that when we cry for each other, we can feel the pain in our hearts. And then  we can start finding peace.""

After three days of deliberations, the San Diego Superior Court jury rejected  the death penalty for Toufic Naddi, 49.    Naddi showed no reaction to the verdict, in contrast to his reaction to the  same jury's finding June 21 that he was sane during the crimes. At that time,  he exploded in anger and struck one of his attorneys, Beverly Barrett, and was  subdued by deputy marshals -- all in front of the jury that was to recommend  his sentence.    Jury foreman Edward Brewer said afterward that the jury disregarded Naddi's  conduct in court upon hearing the sanity finding.    The foreman said the jury would have voted for the death penalty had the life  term included parole. Brewer called the decision ""pretty difficult"" and said  the death penalty was not quickly dismissed in discussions.    Judge Raymond Edwards set formal sentencing for Sept. 17.    Naddi has admitted shooting all five victims repeatedly in the head in the El  Cajon home owned by his in-laws on June 1, 1985.    Naddi claimed that his father-in-law, Habib Sabbagh, 73, was having an affair  with his daughter, Naddi's wife, Aida, 26. Also killed were Lillian Sabbagh,  58; a cousin, Michael Sabbagh, 38, and Aida Naddi's brother-in-law, Osama  Mashini, 38.    The Sabbagh family was well-known in Amman, Jordan, and Mashini was an actor  and comedian there.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Boles, who urged jurors in his final argument to ""show  him the same mercy he showed the victims,"" said he wasn't completely surprised  by their recommendation.    This is Naddi's fourth trial. He was first convicted June 8, 1988, of five  first-degree murders, but that jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of finding him  sane, causing a mistrial.    The second mistrial occurred in 1989, after Boles compared the thinking  processes of terrorists who killed an American hostage in Beirut to the  Lebanese-born Naddi. The third mistrial was declared in February after jurors  admitted reading newspaper stories about Naddi's marriage in jail.

So recent reports that the Sandinistas are passing out guns to their supporters  before handing the government over to President-elect Violeta Chamorro are not  the cause for panic that they would be in Beirut. But it's an alarming  development that must be stopped.    The tactic is not new: The need for a well-armed militia has been Sandinista  dogma ever since they took control of the popular revolution that overthrew  Somoza in 1979. The country's 75,000-person army, for example, includes 30,000  militia members and reservists who keep their weapons at home. So the  Sandinistas won't stop their routine practice of distributing thousands of  pistols and rifles while the Contra rebels who have been fighting against them  also remain armed.    After their defeat in last month's election, Sandinista leaders said they were  willing to give up power. But they won't leave their many supporters in the  Nicaraguan countryside to the mercy of the Contras or the vengeful landowners  who may try to retake farms that were confiscated during the last 10 years and  broken into small plots for pro-Sandinista peasants.    That's why Chamorro and other opposition leaders must renew their effort to  persuade Contra leaders in neighboring Honduras to demobilize their troops.  Turning in their guns would be the clearest signal the Contras can send the  Sandinistas. That would also deprive the Sandinistas of any excuse for handing  out any more guns on their side -- or, if they did, subject them to  condemnation by the United Nations, Organization of American States and the  many other neutral bodies that verified Chamorro's election victory.    Obviously when lots of people have guns, the potential for a blood bath exists.  But it doesn't have to come to that -- if both sides are convinced that there's  no longer any need for violence in Nicaragua. For now, the first step must be  taken by Chamorro and the opposition. They have won, after all, and if the  Sandinistas try to deny them that victory, they will have something a lot more  potent than guns to back them up: world support.

'It's an industry that likes to get together. They're always holding conferences, and although they stress they don't want to talk about prices, maybe they decided they wanted to go further,' said Mr Dennis Christy, pulp and paper analyst at James Capel in London. The European Commission has alleged that carton-board makers managed to push through price rises of 6-10 per cent twice a year from 1987 to 1990 in spite of consumer resistance and falling costs of raw materials. During the four years, carton-board consumption in western Europe increased by almost 20 per cent. Mr Christy said the operation of a cartel could explain the continuation of high price levels in the sector when other parts of the industry were suffering a downturn. Prices for other products in the industry, such as pulp and high quality paper, peaked in 1989. But carton-board prices did not reach their highs until two years later. Printers, among of the main users of carton-board - a stiff card-like product used for making cardboard boxes and for graphics purposes - complained to the Commission about pricing in the Ecu2.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) industry. The British Printing Industries Federation, which recently complained to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the operation of a cartel in the paper market following recent sharp rises in price, yesterday welcomed the Commission's report. The European Union uses 3m tonnes of carton-board a year of which a third is imported from Finland, Sweden and Austria. Carton-board makers are at the mercy of wide swings in price for their raw materials, which are chiefly wood pulp and waste paper but in the period when the cartel was alleged to have operated, raw materials costs were low. This year, pulp prices have risen by 50 per cent, squeezing some companies' profit margins since they are finding it hard to pass on increases to customers.

By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      In deciding what charges to file against Marlon Brando's son, prosecutors can  choose from an array, ranging from first-degree murder to involuntary  manslaughter, legal experts say.

Depending on the facts that emerge from the investigation, legal experts say,  Christian Brando ultimately could face one of the following charges:    * First-degree murder is the deliberate, premeditated killing of a person with  malice, either express or implied. Or killing in the course of a robbery or  other felony. Or killing by poison, lying in wait or torture. Criminals like  the Hillside Strangler and Night Stalker fall within this category. The penalty  is 25 years to life in prison.    If so-called special circumstances, such as murder for financial gain, apply,  the penalty is death or life in prison without possibility of parole.    * Second-degree murder, which carries a penalty of 15 years to life, is ""your  typical garden-variety-type murder"" without premeditation, veteran Los Angeles  County prosecutor Steven Kay said. For example, a jury found former gang leader  Virgil Byars guilty last month of second-degree murder in a case involving two  drive-by shootings. The prosecution had argued for a first-degree conviction;  the defense had hoped for manslaughter if not acquittal.    * Voluntary manslaughter is killing during a sudden quarrel or in the heat of  passion. The classic example of this, Kay said, is the husband who finds his  wife in bed with another man and kills them both. ""But,"" noted Kay, ""if he hid  in the closet to surprise them, as happened in a recent case, that's not  manslaughter.""    San Francisco Supervisor Dan White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in  the 1978 killings of the mayor and another supervisor.    Voluntary manslaughter carries a sentence of three, six or 11 years in prison.    * Involuntary manslaughter, which carries a sentence of two, three or four  years, is the inadvertent killing of a person during a dangerous activity.    Sometimes what begins as murder ends up as manslaughter. In the 1987 case of  Ricky Kyle, for example, the defendant was charged with murder but found guilty  by the jury of the reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter in the Bel-Air  shooting death of his Texas tycoon father. Jurors said they believed that he  fired the gun in self-defense, while he and his father were searching for a  burglar.    A homicide may be found justifiable if it is committed in self-defense or in  defense of another person. Kunstler has suggested that this may be the tack he  takes if Brando is charged.

But defense attorneys say they are handled with extra care -- and often treated  more severely than ordinary defendants.

From Belgrade, the TV correspondent sent us this  report:    [Begin recording by unidentified correspondent] Peace and  God's mercy be upon you brothers and sisters in the Great  Jamahiriyah. Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian Republic president,  praised the efforts exerted by the brother leader of the  revolution to find a peaceful solution to the conflict raging in  the region of what used to be previously known as Yugoslavia.    The president of the Serbian Republic said this afternoon  when he received Dr. 'Ali al-Turayki, envoy of the General  People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International  Cooperation, on reconciliation between the parties to the  conflict in the region, that we highly appreciate the speedy  efforts exerted by the Great Jamahiriyah for restoring stability  and security to what used to be known as Yugoslavia.    He added that the Serbs did not object to the agreement  between the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovia, and they  did not object either to the creation of a republics for the  Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He pointed out that outside  intervention and greed were responsible for obstructing the  achievement of peace between the fighting sides for achieving  their goals and greed in the region. The president of the  Serbian Republic affirmed his country's stance with the Great  Jamahiriyah in confronting the unjust coercive measures imposed  by the imperialist countries. The meeting was attended by the  secretary of the Libyan Arab people's bureau in Belgrade. The  delegation of imams, preachers, mosque speakers, teachers of the  Koran, Arabic language teachers, and teachers of Islamic studies  this morning met Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign affairs  minister of federal Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and  Montenegro, in Belgrade. The meeting was attended by Dr. 'Ali  al-Turayki, envoy of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation, and the brother secretary  of the Libyan Arab people's bureau in Belgrade.

0,FT944-5903 ,"FT944-5903 _AN-ELAD8AEIFT 941201   FT  01 DEC 94 / Contacts with IRA reopened after Newry killing      By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS and Our Belfast Correspondent   The British government reopened secret contacts with the IRA last month after the killing of a Newry postal worker in a raid by republican gunmen. This emerged yesterday as the government looked poised to send a letter to Sinn Fein indicating its readiness to begin preliminary talks with the IRA's political wing before Christmas. These are now thought likely to start either on December 12 or December 16. Sir John Wheeler, Northern Ireland security minister, said he had no doubt exploratory talks would begin 'within a few days'. The government has also promised to start preliminary dialogue with loyalist representatives by the end of the year. It is understood that the government contacted republican leaders immediately after the Newry murder to demand in the strongest terms an explanation for what happened. The demand brought an admission from the republicans that they did not know what had prompted the raid and that they were trying to find out. The government then sent a second message demanding firm answers. The exchange underlines how close the killing - the first since the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires - came to derailing the peace process. Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, initially accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary of trying to damage the process by blaming republicans for the shooting. But the IRA later acknowledged its members were responsible. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said on the day of the killing on November 10 he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. The next day he stressed the peace process was 'on course'. It is believed the secret contacts may have been initiated by Downing Street but were probably carried out by MI5. A Downing Street official said yesterday he had seen 'no evidence' such contacts had taken place. Yesterday's developments came as Mr Adams said the government had reopened its secret contacts with Sinn Fein to advise it to expect a date shortly for exploratory talks. Earlier Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, issued their first joint statement since the IRA ceasefire. They urged the government to be more positive in its attitude to the peace process. Mr Adams has also been invited by Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, to meet him at the White House next week to discuss ways of advancing the peace process.

Pakistan has been an active supporter of this principle  on humane grounds from the very beginning. However, as any  intelligent person can understand, the only way to protect human  civilization from the nuclear danger is to remove all nuclear  weapons and related technology from the whole world. It is  amazing that the United States and some other powers are using  threats, deceit, avarice, fraud, and other despicable methods  against the countries that have this technology and whom they  think are a danger to world peace. However, the countries that  have the support of the United States and its allies are not  checked and are allowed to have these destructive weapons as if  they are toys. This attitude is totally atrocious, unfair, and  extreme. It is especially used against Pakistan and other  Islamic countries, North Korea, and other third world countries  about which the United States and its allies for some reason do  not have a good opinion. Let us reflect a bit. If India has a  stockpile of nuclear weapons and Pakistan is stopped even from  using this technology for peaceful uses, how can they guarantee  making this region safe from nuclear dangers? This situation can  help only make nuclear weapons available for unilateral  expansionist designs. Had Japan had nuclear weapons, we can  safely say that nuclear bombs would not have been dropped on its  two highly populated cities. Therefore, seriousness and  responsibility calls for the United States and its cohort  nations to either totally end nuclear technology in the whole  world or at least form a fair policy for controlling nuclear  weapons in this region, instead of coming after the Pakistani  nuclear program. If this is not done, then Pakistan has no  reason to have its hands amputated and live at the mercy of a  cruel country like India. Doing this would be more dangerous  than signing one's own death sentence.     "

That is the crux of the bill Netherlander Justice  Minister Hirsch Ballin and State Secretary Kosto submitted to  the second Chamber on Thursday [20 January]. Under this bill,  the justice minister can designate certain countries of origin  as being safe countries.    Safe countries must be countries where there is no fear of  persecution in the sense of the Geneva Convention on Refugees.  Nigeria and Russia come to mind. An asylum-seeker from such a  country can have his application for admittance as a refugee  immediately rejected as unfounded.    Under this bill, an application from such an asylum-seeker  will only be considered if he can establish circumstances which  depart from the general situation in the country of origin and  which arouse suspicions that he does indeed have grounds to fear  persecution.    According to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto, the proposed  regulation  is very similar to the change in asylum legislation that Germany  passed on 1 July 1993.    With this regulation, Hirsch Ballin and Kosto want to  prevent  refugees from applying for political asylum in countries with  the most favorable legislation. For drawing up the list of  safe countries, justice officials will consult with the Foreign  Affairs Minister. They do not, however, recognize the  usefulness of an advice obligation by the advisory committee on  refugee affairs in designating safe countries. The Council of  State had left this up to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto to consider.    The country of origin is legally defined as the country  where  a refugee is ""born and bred.""    The Refugee Foundation was not available for comment on  Thursday. Earlier the organization had raised strong objections  to the idea of safe countries because as a result, refugees are  more at the mercy of their own region, where the relief and  asylum procedures are worse than in the Netherlands for example.

[passage omitted: prayers, inviting worshippers  to observe piety and importance of the revolution anniversary  celebrations]    Another issue, to which I will briefly refer, is the issue  of  cooperation between the esteemed government and the Majlis. It  is a pleasure to see those two big powers have full cooperation  and understanding, particularly in important issues such as the  1373 [year starting 21 March 1994] budget and the Second  Five-Year Development Plan. They will solve the problems through  close consultation and understanding. God willing, both powers  will perform their duties.    I ask the esteemed deputies to be coherent, as much as  possible, and consider the future. Do not look at issues on an  individual basis and through the sole consideration of your own  constituency. Look at them according to the constitution, state  laws, and in relation with the world. In fact, look at the  current and future effects of those issues. You yourselves are,  more than anyone else, aware of the important role of this kind  of outlook. I ask the esteemed government, and particularly the  esteemed ministers who have a role in the budget issues and the  plan -- on which all cabinet ministers play a role -- to make  the most use of experts and other consultants who may even not  be so famous. The more a decision is based on expert and  scientific opinion, the better its effects. [passage omitted]    The first duty of judicial power is to monitor the best  implementation of the laws and confront the violators at  different levels. I apologize that I cannot mention the  violators' names, whether government affiliated or not, who may  exist in various offices, ministries, and organizations. They  have been confronted and they will be confronted. We have had  some cases, which I do not want to mention here. It is not good  to go on a platform and talk about shortcomings.    I would like to say here that your country's judicial  apparatus is using all its power and all the supervisory devices  at its disposal to supervise the rule of law in the country and  confront the offenders. There are other organs that help the  judiciary perform its duties properly, such as intelligence  bodies, and law enforcement and popular forces. Now there might  be an individual case who may come to me or to you, and faced  with this situation I should not interpret this in a special way  and raise the question: What is the government up to? This is  why I stress the importance of a holistic and generalistic  outlook and far-sightedess.    Now to the issue of Afghanistan. I would like to call on my  Muslims brothers and tell them: O brothers! Enough is enough.  Do not destroy your country any more. Do not fight against one  another any more. Why do you not put your weapons away and sit  together and talk to resolve your issues and reform your  country? Do not constantly associate yourselves with certain  bodies and create this ugly situation that might prompt someone  to question Islam's ability to manage and rule, God forbid. It  was under the banner of Islam that you succeeded in deposing the  previous regime and then set out to establish an Islamic  government. Can you not see our country, where in a very short  period of time all the internal squabbles came to an end and the  late Imam [Khomeyni], may he be admitted to God's paradise, put  a stop to all the arguments? Of course we had different  opinions here, and we still do, and we always will. Such  differences are only natural. However, how long do you intend  to inflict so much destruction on a poor country? Enough is  enough; stop the civil war!    Now to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Given what you all know, one is  really ashamed of all the international organizations, which  according to what has recently been announced, have issued  nearly 30 resolutions, only one of which has been implemented.  This is the one preventing Bosnia-Herzegovina from defend  itself. They have implemented this resolution pretty well, while  nothing has been done about the rest; nothing of course but idle  words. They are all after the partition of that Islamic land  and the suppression of the Muslims. However, we are confident  that the Muslims, under any condition, will not be prepared to  suffer shame, and they will not concede to the partition of  their country, no matter what hardship they have to endure.  [crowd chants]    As the compromise agreement progresses both sides realize  what the situation is. The fact that Rabin said we would not  even retreat from the Golan Heights and the occupied lands shows  how things are. Optimists should realize what the final outcome  will be. We are certain that the home of Palestinians belongs  to the Palestinians and that they should return to their home.    My time is up. There are two or three more issues that I  will not talk about, but simply refer to. The approval of the  Dutch Senate in connection with a legal and judicial matter --  with a majority of three -- that prescribes mercy killing, as  they put it, is definitely rejected and condemned in our view,  as the judicial and legal system of the Islamic Republic of  Iran. It is not correct to kill a patient even in the last  moments of his life, out of mercy and for a quicker release.    The remarks made by the head of the Turkish Constituent  Court  [as heard] are totally rejected by us. Fortunately, some  Muslims in Turkey--and another fortunate thing was that the  prime minister himself was involved in the matter--have rejected  his remarks. That gentleman thinks--I am speaking for the  judicial sector--that he can say anything he wants when he is in  court. He says Islam cannot be considered as a system of  government. What he has said is pointless. That judge should  be told: You might be of high rank, but your legal knowledge is  very poor, let alone your Islamic knowledge. You should  reconsider.

""The Perfect Crime.""    ""The Anarchist's Cookbook.""    ""The Joy of Cold Revenge"" and ""The Revenge Book.""    Why would someone have those books, books detailing how to kill without getting  caught, unless they were going to murder someone, prosecutor Larry Burns argued  during closing statements Thursday in the murder trial of David Scott Harrison.    Harrison is accused of first-degree murder in the Feb. 17, 1988, killing of his  ex-wife, Anne Jenkins, one month after she and her new husband, Gary Jenkins,  won $727,000 in the California Lottery.    ""Our society rewards success,"" Burns said. ""But there is one form of success  for which this society has no reward . . . for the one who kills their victim  and leaves no physical evidence.""    ""That is the reward that David Harrison is seeking in this case for his success  in murdering Anne Jenkins and leaving no evidence of his crime at the scene,""  said Burns, who concedes he has no evidence placing Harrison at the scene.    But defense attorney Alan May, in beginning his closing argument, accused Burns  of playing ""a shell game"" with testimony.    May also argued that Burns was trying to turn from the presumption of innocence  to ""guilty until proven innocent.""    ""Mr. Burns is saying, '(Harrison) is trying to get away with the perfect crime  and that's why we have no (direct) evidence. If you find him not guilty, you  are rewarding him for the crime, so assume him guilty,' "" May told the judge,  who is deciding the non-jury trial. ""But that's not the law.""    The defense will finish its closing arguments today, and Judge David B. Moon is  expected to deliver a verdict immediately afterward.    In Burns' closing, he detailed the stormy relationship between Jenkins and  Harrison since their 1982 divorce: Constant court battles over custody of their  two children and alimony, Harrison's bombing of the van belonging to Gary  Jenkins' first wife, and Harrison's constant harassment of Jenkins, her husband  and her father.    ""He indeed had a motive to kill Anne Jenkins on the day she was killed . . .  and he alone had such a motive,"" Burns said, as Harrison sat, his head on his  hand, eyes closed. ""In this case, the motive was overwhelming . . . and that  motive was (at its) pinnacle on the day she was killed.""    Burns said Harrison's actions between the time of their divorce and the killing  demonstrated an escalation of violence against Jenkins and her family, and he  maintained the surge followed the books on violence that Harrison owned.    ""It starts with petty, sophomoric pranks, and it escalates to more severe  things, to bombings,"" Burns said.    Burns depicted the slightly built Harrison as ""someone fascinated with murder,""  ""an inveterate liar"" and having ""an insatiable desire . . . to punish Anne  Jenkins . . . to beat down his wife.""    ""The usual motives have been ruled out,"" Burns said, noting that there was no  sign of burglary, robbery or sexual assault. ""There is no explanation for this  crime. If not David Harrison, pray tell, who did this?""    Harrison had the means to kill, too, Burns contended, pointing out the  collection of how-to books on committing crimes that Harrison tried to hide  three days before the killing took place.    Burns accused Harrison of trying to commit ""The Immaculate Murder,"" a chapter  in one of the books.    ""But he bungled it. He made aspirations to the perfect crime, but he made  mistakes,"" Burns said. ""He talked too much afterwards. He thought he was  committing the perfect crime, but he failed.""    Burns pointed out that three days before the killing Harrison had told a good  friend to ""watch the news, something big is going to happen.""    ""That is the most salient piece of evidence in this case, aside from the bag  (of books on murder),"" Burns said. ""What was he predicting? What was going to  happen?""    ""It's all consistent. The seeds that were sown four, five years ago came to  fruition in February of 1988.""    In May's closing, however, he argued that by that time, the things that made  Harrison hate Jenkins, the custody and alimony battles, had been resolved and  Harrison had nothing to gain through the murder.    ""Why not just take the kids and run?"" May said. ""He may have wanted to kill her  at some point. He may have talked about it at some point. But what did he have  to gain?""    ""At the time of the killing, he probably had less motive for killing than he  had in five years.""    May also said that motives for Jenkins' murder could be attached to several  people.

These demonstrations are also designed to protest the continued  siege of the Hazratbal Shrine, which the people visit to pay  respect to the sacred relic -- a hair from the beard of the holy  Prophet Muhammad, may the blessing and mercy of God be upon him.  This year, the people will not be able to visit the Hazratbal  Shrine because of the siege laid by Indian forces.    Meanwhile, 20 people have been killed and several others  arrested in the fresh operations carried out by occupation  forces in the occupied valley. An Indian military vehicle was  destroyed and two soldiers were killed in a land mine explosion  in the Nawanshahr area. In another operation, the freedom  fighters damaged the water supply system of Punch Cantonment.

0,FT911-4995 ,"FT911-4995 _AN-BDQBPAAKFT 910417   FT  17 APR 91 / Salvador peace talks stumble after killing      By TIM COONE      MANAGUA   PEACE talks in Mexico City between the El Salvador government and FMLN guerrillas have hit problems since the recent killing of a senior guerrilla leader. Mr Antonio Cardenal, known as Commander 'Jonas', was killed in El Salvador last week with 12 other guerrillas, in an ambush by a commando unit of the army's elite Atlacatl battalion, in what was considered a guerrilla-controlled area. The FMLN has angrily accused the government of killing 'Jonas' after he was taken prisoner and of trying to wreck the peace talks. An FMLN communique yesterday warned that guerrillas would launch similar attacks against army chiefs. It warned that any attempts by the army to push the FMLN out of territory it controls would be resisted. 'Jonas' was a member of the FMLN's political-diplomatic commission and was directly involved in earlier rounds of peace talks. He was Nicaraguan by birth, and a nephew of the Nicaraguan president Mrs Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Several big issues are at stake in the negotiations, aimed at establishing a ceasefire by April 30. The FMLN wants the government to recognise its de facto control of some territory during a period of 'armed peace' which will lead to an eventual disarmament of the FMLN. It also wants steps on constitutional reforms and the creation of an commission to oversee the purging from the armed forces of officers linked to human rights abuses.

The figure has been questioned by industry experts since news of the intended flotation emerged in January. Observers argue that Maid has few assets to justify the price. In addition, they say it is at the mercy of companies which provide its data and faces fierce competition from larger companies like Reuters and Profile, part of the Financial Times group. Mr Stephen Aulsebrook of Hill Samuel Bank, which is advising Maid on the issue, said the price had not yet been fixed. It would be arrived at through a book-building exercise over the next month but Pounds 100m was the target valuation. The company is coming to market by way of a placing on March 15. The pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday and dealings in the shares are expected to begin on March 25. About 30 per cent of the company is to be floated. The expected net proceeds of Pounds 16m will be used for product development and marketing expenses, especially in the US, which the company believes will eventually become its principal market. Maid has contracts with information providers for data which it stores and distributes over telephone lines to customers' personal computers. Its existing services include Researchline, Newsline and Companyline. A typical annual subscription rate for business information is Pounds 6,000. Last year, pre-tax profits advanced 85 per cent to Pounds 603,176 on revenues ahead 64 per cent at Pounds 5.7m. It has been profitable for the past four years, according to executives. Mr Dan Wagner, managing director, said that most of the company's revenues would eventually come from a new product, Maid for Windows, planned for launch in 1995. Mr Wagner believed he had identified a gap in the market for the supply of on-line business information to the mass market. The aim is to provide a tailored information service to individuals at a basic cost of Dollars 200 (Pounds 140) a year. The company provides a basic service on which customers can add units to suit their needs.   Companies:-  Maid Systems.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

An Army helicopter spotted the body of Private Reginald  McCollum, 19, from Cookstown, Co Tyrone, on land between two  housing estates on the outskirts of Armagh. Security forces were  not immediately able to recover the body for fear that it had  been booby-trapped. Pte McCollum, a single man, had been in the  RIR for 16 months and was based in Armagh. He was last seen at a  chip shop in the city at 2.30am after attending a stag night.    It was the third time his family have mourned a member  killed  at the hands of the IRA.    A year ago his brother Nigel, 25, was killed by an IRA  mortar  bomb fired at a police station in Keady, Co Armagh. He was a  civilian contractor operating a crane for renovation work on the  station when it was attacked.    Ten years ago Pte McCollum's grandmother was killed by a  booby-trap bomb meant for someone else.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, challenged  the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, to condemn the killing as  well as the recent murder by the IRA of Fred Anthony, a police  cleaner, and the injuring of his three-year-old daughter, Emma.    He said: ""The IRA is killing again, this time after  interrogating their victim. Is Mr Adams, who calls for peace,  now going to condemn these crimes?""    ""The IRA besmirch all they touch including the cause of  Irish  nationalism, just as the UVF, the UFF, and their like, besmirch  the cause of Unionism.""    The murder is the first by the IRA since the Government's  response on Thursday to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of  the Downing Street Declaration.    The killing would suggest that some activists are intent on  ignoring calls by Dublin and the mainly nationalist SDLP for the  terrorists to suspend their violence while the Government's  reply is considered.

U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher refused to grant an animal rights  group's request for an injunction that would have prohibited the U.S.  government from killing or maiming the foxes at the refuge within the Seal  Beach Naval Weapons Station.    Although a federal court trial is pending on a suit filed by the Orange  County-based Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., government officials said after  Kelleher's ruling that they expect the trapping and killing of the animals to  resume immediately. Trapping of the foxes had been permitted but killing them  had been prohibited under a court order of last week.    The Navy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have ordered the trapping and  killing of several hundred of the foxes since 1986, an effort they say is  essential to preserve two species of birds on which the foxes prey: the  light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern.      Foxes Not Natives    Both birds are native to California and are listed nationally as endangered  species. The red foxes, which are not native to California, are believed to  have been introduced in the area many decades ago.    The animal rights group challenged the trapping program almost immediately, and  a legal battle that has pitted supporters of the foxes against those backing  the birds has since been mired in federal trial and appellate courts.    While the issue remains to be decided in the coming federal court trial,  Kelleher made clear in his ruling Thursday that, so far, he finds the evidence  overwhelmingly in the government's favor.    In refusing to grant the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn. a preliminary injunction  to halt the fox trapping, Kelleher said he was strongly persuaded that to allow  the red foxes to roam unhindered within the 5,000-acre weapons station ""would  jeopardize the lives of the two endangered species."" The military site includes  the Anaheim Bay National Wildlife Refuge, where the birds nest.      Only 6 Clapper Rail Pairs    Kelleher said he was particularly swayed by testimony Thursday from Richard  Zembal, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who said that the population  of the clapper rails has generally declined in the last few years to a low of  only 6 pairs earlier this year.    Although he knew of only a few direct sightings of the red foxes preying on the  clapper rails, Zembal said numerous signs around the birds' nests -- such as  fox hairs and tracks -- make the danger apparent. ""There's no question . . .  (the red foxes) are a predator,"" he told the judge.    Kelleher said that Congress, through passage of recent environmental protection  statutes, has made clear that when the interests of two competing species hang  in the balance, an endangered animal should receive the higher priority.    But officials with the Animal Lovers group, disputing Kelleher's findings, said  they plan to press ahead for a full trial on the issue in hopes of gaining a  permanent injunction against the government's killing of the red foxes.    ""I was absolutely flabbergasted by the judge's decision, because the hard  evidence all points the other way from his decision,"" said Harold Baerg,  president of the animal lovers group.    He maintained that the government's policy in Seal Beach, in addition to moving  toward the virtual extinction of a species of fox that was brought into this  area, has inadvertently harmed other animals in the refuge as well.    Indeed, U.S. Department of Agriculture trapper Craig Knight testified that in  the course of catching about 84 red foxes last year, his traps also caught 60  untargeted skunks, opossums and wild cats. Like the foxes, they too were killed  by lethal injection.    Federal officials could not say how many foxes still roam the Seal Beach site.  According to Animal Lovers officials, about 263 of the animals have been killed  by the government in the last 3 years.    Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert B. Briggs said Kelleher's decision was an important  affirmation of the government's position. He said he expects federal officials  to complete an environmental assessment of the red fox situation in Seal Beach  by November, as ordered by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision  earlier this year.

He maintained that the government's policy in Seal Beach, in addition to moving  toward the virtual extinction of a species of fox that was brought into this  area, has inadvertently harmed other animals in the refuge as well.    Indeed, U.S. Department of Agriculture trapper Craig Knight testified that in  the course of catching about 84 red foxes last year, his traps also caught 60  untargeted skunks, opossums and wild cats. Like the foxes, they too were killed  by lethal injection.    Federal officials could not say how many foxes still roam the Seal Beach site.  According to Animal Lovers officials, about 263 of the animals have been killed  by the government in the last 3 years.    Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert B. Briggs said Kelleher's decision was an important  affirmation of the government's position. He said he expects federal officials  to complete an environmental assessment of the red fox situation in Seal Beach  by November, as ordered by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision  earlier this year.      RED FOX AT A GLANCE    (Vulpes vulpes)    Color: Rich reddish brown, with white-tipped tail and black ears and legs.    Coat: Long guard hairs and soft, fine underfur.    Length: 36 to 42 inches (about 13 to 16 inches of which is tail).    Height: 15 inches at the shoulder.    Weight: about 15 pounds.    Diet: Small mammals (chiefly mice and rabbits), eggs, fruit and birds.    Habitat: Highly adaptable, but prefers mixed farmlands and wood lots.

AFRICAN BLACKS TO HANG FOR '85 MOB KILLING      From Times Wire Services      UPINGTON, South Africa      A regional judge Friday sentenced 14 blacks to hang for the 1985 mob killing of  a black police officer, in a ruling that is likely to stir widespread protest.    The 13 men and one woman appeared calm during the one-hour hearing in the  heavily guarded courtroom in this remote town in Cape province as Justice Jan  Basson handed down the sentences.    The 14 are among 25 convicted of killing Lucas Sethwala in the nearby black  township of Paballelo in November, 1985, at the height of a national black  uprising against white minority-led rule.    Only four of the 14 were found to have physically contributed to the death of  Sethwala, who was caught by a mob, hit over the head and then stoned, beaten  and set on fire. Only one of the four was found to have actually inflicted the  blows that caused the policeman's death.    But Basson sentenced all 14 to hang, invoking a controversial ""common purpose""  doctrine -- that they were part of a crowd of about 300 that gathered outside  the victim's house after a protest against rent increases.    Sethwala, who was singled out for being a police officer, fired a gun out the  window, wounding a small boy. Defense lawyers said this incited the crowd to  throw stones at the house to force him to come outside. When he tried to flee,  he was caught and attacked.    But Basson said the killing was politically motivated, part of a conspiracy to  attack authorities.    ""The Upington trial is an outrage that only the apartheid system can produce,""  protested the South African Council of Churches.

Dr. Joseph Wybran, 48, secular leader of Belgian Jews and an internationally  recognized immunologist, was shot Tuesday night in the parking lot of a  suburban hospital where he worked. He died Wednesday morning.    Wybran recently took part in demonstrations outside the Vatican's diplomatic  offices in Brussels, protesting against the continued presence of the convent  at Auschwitz, the Nazi German camp where about 4 million people, including more  than 2.5 million Jews, were put to death during World War II. He also led a  Belgian delegation to Poland to meet with Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Polish  primate.    ""Given the nature of Dr. Wybran's activities,"" Belgian police authorities said  in a statement Wednesday afternoon, ""a political assassination, or at least one  springing from an ideological or philosophical opposition, cannot be excluded.""    The police said there are no witnesses to the shooting, which occurred between  6:30 and 7 p.m. Tuesday as Wybran was getting into his car in the parking lot  of Erasmus Hospital, just outside Brussels. He was shot once in the head at  close range with a 7.65-millimeter pistol.    The police statement said, ""Everything leads one to the conclusion that one or  more of the killers were lying in wait for the victim.""    Wybran's killing shocked the Belgian Jewish community of 30,000. He was  chairman of the Coordination Committee of Jewish Organizations, the umbrella  group for 30 Jewish organizations in Belgium.    ""Professor Wybran was a world-known physician in immunology,"" said a friend,  Maurice Konopnicki, director of the Israel Information Center in Brussels. ""He  was . . . not an extremist.""      In Cancer Research    Wybran was chief of the immunology, hematology and transfusion division of  Erasmus Hospital. He was active in cancer research and in efforts to find a  cure for AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He was also a professor  of medicine at the University of Brussels. He was married but had no children.    Konopnicki blamed the killing on ""some extreme-right organization who would  exploit this conflict for their own purposes.""    Shimon Samuels, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's European office in  Paris, noted that the killing comes at a time of ""rising right-wing prejudice,  particularly in Belgium.""

The movement to remove the 14 Polish and German Roman Catholic nuns from the  site began in Belgium, in 1985, after a right-wing Catholic organization  published an appeal for donations to the convent in an issue of a small  magazine, ""Aid to the Church in Distress.""    The language of the appeal, particularly a phrase that said the nuns ""would  pray for wayward souls"" at Auschwitz, outraged many Belgian Jews, some of whom  felt it was an attempt at posthumous baptism.    Shortly afterward, a delegation of four Belgian Jews led by Wybran's  predecessor as chairman of the Coordination Committee, Markus Parves, visited  Poland and met with Catholic leaders to request that the convent be moved.    The killing came at a time when tension has eased between Roman Catholics and  Jews over the Auschwitz issue.

He adds that ""it left the Slovak  settlement, whose demise we are witnessing, at the mercy of  Magyarisation.""    In connection with Slovakia's south border, Hofbauer recalls  that according to the original Trianon proposal, a part of the  Hungarian territory had to be ceded to Slovakia. This did not  happen because of a fierce resistance by Hungary and  indifference of Czech representatives to the fate of Slovaks  living in the currently Hungarian Matra mountains, or the ""lower  parts of the Slovak counties Novohrad, Gemer, Hont and Zemplin.""    ""The Masaryk-Benes -- Czechoslovak President Tomas Garrigue  Masaryk and Foreign Minister Edvard Benes -- concept sacrificed  the region in return for the questionable gain of Subcarpathian  Ruthenia,"" Hofbauer claims. He adds that Hungary, too, has not  been able to come to terms with the Trianon Treaty which is  proved by Hungarian politicians' statements on representation of  interests of ""all"" the Hungarians. ""It is not essential whether  it has been Tisza, Kun, Horthy, Kadar or the current Hungarian  Government,"" Hofbauer says.    It was difficult to establish a precise dividing line  between  the lower (Hungary) and upper (Slovakia) part of the Hungarian  kingdom due to the political development in the consequence of  which the ""population was strongly mixed"" during the Turkish  threat and anti- Habsburg rebellions, believes Hofbauer, and  adds that there was no one to represent Slovakia during the  talks of the joint border commissions in 1918.    He compares the current demands by Hungarian minority  representatives to those by the Germans in the First Republic  (Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1938) for the cultural,  educational, territorial and political autonomy going as far as  the right to homeland. He says that the pre-Munich political  leaders needed to justify by these demands their attitude in  front of the international public.    The foreign politicians of the time did not try to verify  whether this ""loud cry"" concealed anything more than calls by  suffering and humiliated minorities, says Hofbauer, and  indicates a similarity between the ""therapists and peace-makers  Lord Halifax and Lord Runciman, of that time and the current  international negotiators in Bosnia and Herzegovina Cyrus Vance  and Lord Owen.""

The security agencies should also uncover the motives of those  behind the plot.    We also take this opportunity to reassert to our people our  absolute faith and full commitment to national principles and  state that we will be the first to champion those principles,  for which the two martyred died.    The GPC urges all its members, supporters, and sons of the  great Yemeni people to be vigilant and foil any feverish  attempts that seek to undermine Yemeni national gains and the  achievements of the Yemeni people.

The opposition parties plan to grill the ruling Liberal Democratic party over whether the mounting violence violates terms of the Paris peace accord under which Japanese peacekeepers were sent to help pave the way for elections this month. One condition for sending unarmed police was that a ceasefire should be in place. The killing last week of Mr Haruyuki Takata in an ambush on UN vehicles was blamed on guerrillas from the Khmer Rouge faction, which is boycotting the elections. The government appears determined to sit out what it regards as a war of nerves in Cambodia, while pressing for improved security for Japanese personnel, but the opposition parties are likely to press the government to consider withdrawing peacekeepers if the situation deteriorates. The damage this would inflict on Japan's aspirations to a wider world role were pointed out by Mr Goh Chok Tong, the visiting Singaporean prime minister, who warned a withdrawal would signal that Tokyo no longer wanted to play an international role. To underline its commitment to UN peacekeeping operations, the Japanese government yesterday ordered 48 troops to join UN peacekeeping operations in Mozambique. The United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia agreed that 41 Japanese civilians being sent to monitor the elections should be sent to the south, near where 600 Japanese military personnel are engaged in engineering work. However, Untac has insisted that the 75 unarmed Japanese police cannot be withdrawn from their posts to Phnom Penh as this might put other peacekeepers at risk. Royalist Cambodian guerrillas and the Khmer Rouge, long-time allies in the civil war, exchanged artillery fire over the weekend in the north-west, UN officials said yesterday, Reuter adds from Phnom Penh. The fighting was apparently prompted by the killing of the Japanese police officer in a zone nominally controlled by the monarchists.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.     KHZ  Kampuchea, Asia.

By RICHARD EDER      It is all there, perhaps too plainly there, in the title. Brian Moore has  written an angry political novel that is also a novel of suspense. The suspense  is intricately tangled in an impossible moral choice, faced by a Northern  Irishman who struggles to resign from his country's conflict, and cannot.    Impossibility is the curse of the politics that has made Ulster's history a  strangled gyre that grinds away, decade after decade, sinking but never sinking  through. And it is the focus of Moore's anger.    Moore is a prolific novelist who has written on a variety of themes since he  got out of his native Belfast, young, in 1948. Belfast -- Catholic Belfast,  specifically -- is not out of him, though. ""Lies of Silence"" is his phrase for  the mental and moral excusing and evading that allow the Irish Republican Army  to operate out of the Catholic community, even though Catholics will deplore  its violence, or at least, the seeming hopelessness of its violence.    Acquiescence in the face of evil is the charge Moore brings against the  minority population of the North. He barely mentions the Protestant majority,  and the British appear only in the form of a cool and barely glimpsed security  official. The author's quarrel is with the sentimentality that allows his  Catholics to wink at present atrocities in the name of past heroics. His target  is Mother Machree. She'll kill you, the message goes; and in ""Lies of Silence,""  she does.    Michael Dillon is civilized and apolitical, the successful manager of a Belfast  hotel that is owned by an American chain. He hopes for promotion to one of the  chain's London hotels; he cannot wait to get out of the city he was born and  reared in.    London means a decent life and escape. Escape, also, because he will leave  Moira, his gloomy and sub-hysteric Belfast wife, and go live with uncomplicated  Andrea, a researcher for the BBC. Escape, finally, out Europe's last medieval  war, and into Europe of the Common Market and no-fault history.    Just as Michael is about to take off, his house is seized by an IRA gang. With  Moira as their hostage, and under threat of death, Michael must drive a  bomb-rigged car into his hotel parking lot -- as manager, he will not be  searched -- where a time-device is to detonate and kill a lot of people,  including an Ian Paisley-like Protestant extremist who is attending a lunch.    ""Lies of Silence"" is tightly, sometimes breathtakingly, constructed around the  dilemmas that ensue. If Michael warns the police, he threatens Moira's life. If  he does not, he risks the lives of dozens of others. (One of the ingenious  half-turns on this dilemma is that he cannot be sure if there is a dilemma. The  IRA itself may or may not have given a warning; his captors will not say.)    The painful but undoubtedly correct choice is to sacrifice one life -- perhaps  -- instead of many -- perhaps. Except that Moira's death would also be highly  convenient. And Michael twists in the arid scruples of choice and conscience of  a sort that Graham Greene wrote about more finely in ""The Heart of the Matter""  and ""The Power and the Glory.""    It is Moore's skill to give a living answer to this moral puzzle. No normal  human being, much less a scrupulous one, could abide doing nothing, however  finely balanced the choices. The hotel is bombed; its guests are evacuated in  time.    A moral dilemma, however, now turns political as well. Moira, too gruesomely  whiny up to now to matter much, suddenly becomes real. She and Michael,  Catholics but uninvolved, must make new choices. He will go to London, the  longed-for escape now justified by police warnings that he is in danger.    Moira, on the other hand, refuses ""to let them push me out."" She will stay and  denounce the IRA on television. In the book's most effective confrontation, she  lets Michael know that if he was willing to see her die to stand up against the  terror, she is willing to lose him to another woman to do the same thing.    Even in London, though, Michael is not free. He had recognized one of the  gunmen; the police ask him to make the identification. A priest with IRA  connections comes over, ostensibly to plead mercy for the son of a parishioner.  ""A lovely woman,"" he calls her. As for the youth: ""You know what these lads are  like, they're just kids."" As if mercy were all that was at stake, and the duty  of any Catholic, even a sophisticate, was to exercise it exclusively with other  Catholics.    But the priest brings an unspoken message as well: The IRA will kill Michael if  he talks. And he must decide finally whether he can escape the war and its  choices.    In a number of ways, ""Lies of Silence"" succeeds remarkably. On the level of  sheer suspense, for example. It is marvelously canny. And if there is  contrivance in using this suspense, and the dilemmas that nourish it, to open  up a larger political and moral dimension, it seems well justified.    Moore will be criticized for making his exclusive targets the IRA and the  failure of most Catholics to confront the kind of choice that Moira and Michael  are brought to. But he is not writing an overview of Northern Ireland; he has  chosen, as is his right, to focus upon one aspect of its tragedy. If the  chicken of majority oppression has laid the egg of minority violence -- which,  in turn, hatches a violent Protestant chicken, and so on -- why, Moore has  decided to tell an egg story. He tells it well.    On the other hand, he can be plodding in his prose. When Michael and Andrea  arrive in London and enjoy a few days of happiness, Moore writes: ""They were  here. Everything had changed. Everything.""    He can also be crude in his characters, manipulating actions and discourse to  make political points. The priest is oily and repulsive. Moore has cast a role  instead of writing a character.    It is all too convenient when Michael, driving the bomb-rigged car after the  night of terror in his hijacked home, passes the Catholic school where he was  taught to hate Protestants. It was ""run by priests whose narrow sectarian views  perfectly propagated the divisive bitterness which led to the events of last  night.""    As the protagonist, Michael has moments of real substance when he truly  embodies the dilemmas he is in. But he is given too much to do, to feel, to  think; the agony that is the heart of the book is a busy agony, and the  busy-ness weakens it.

Tim  Casserly told a Vista Superior Court jury that Pearce is unworthy of sympathy  and a life sentence because the way she orchestrated the killing of Wayne  Pearce was ""evil, vile and calls for the death penalty.""    But Pearce's attorney, Brad Patton, making a final bid to save the life of the  42-year-old former Escondido teacher's aide, implored jurors to consider how  Pearce was devastated and irrational when her husband of 14 1/2 years left her  and she realized she would never have his baby.    ""She was down on her knees, it was her lowest point,"" he said, describing the  two weeks she contemplated the crime as a ""period of aberration"" in an  otherwise normal, decent life.    Jurors will receive instructions from Judge Franklin Mitchell Jr. early Friday  and begin deliberations on their two choices -- death or life in prison without  the possibility of parole for Pearce.    She was convicted March 12 of first-degree murder with special circumstances  and conspiring to commit murder in her husband's death on Jan. 31, 1989. The  special circumstances that could bring the death sentence are murder for  financial gain and lying in wait.    The jury agreed that Pearce had her husband killed to get his $200,000 life  insurance benefits so she could keep the couple's Valley Center ranch house for  herself and her pets.    In choosing the penalty, Casserly argued Thursday that jurors shouldn't base a  decision on her formerly productive life, but on her crime. ""There's no way you  can insulate yourself from the death penalty by hiring someone else to do your  dirty work for you,"" he said.    ""Who did she hire in this case? Kids!"" he said. ""Not sophisticated hit men, she  involved kids in her crime, boys in men's bodies.""    Doing that was especially sinister considering that Pearce had been a teacher's  aide, Casserly said. ""For a teacher to use and abuse (her) position of trust .  . . that's particularly vile,"" he said.    As for the actual killing Jan. 31, 1989, by Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato, who  were 15 then and were sentenced to the California Youth Authority for their  first-degree murder convictions, Casserly said, ""There are ways of killing that  are quick, efficient and painless.""    But Pearce, he stated, knew the boys intended to stab her husband. He received  23 wounds from a kitchen knife and a carpenter's hand ax, and later died at the  hospital.    Casserly said that, when the hospital called Pearce about her husband, she  showed no remorse, but was angry with Hill and Pilato, telling them, ""You guys  blew it.""'    The nature of the crime and the motive, money, were aggravating factors that  outweighed other factors such as Pearce's clean record and previously  constructive life, Casserly argued. Thus, there isn't sufficient reason to  spare her from the death penalty.    However, Patton maintained that in cases involving a potential death penalty,  only aggravating factors that weren't an element of the crime can be considered  in sentencing.    He declared that Pearce is hardly among ""the worst of the worst"" who deserve  the death sentence. That is usually reserved for serial or random killers who  act without feeling and without motive, he said.    Patton depicted Pearce as a woman whose life and ability to reason simply came  apart when her husband walked out, leaving her without hope of having another  child -- she had two by a previous marriage -- and unable to support herself or  keep the house for her and her pets.

The killing of  Palestinians by Israeli soldiers or settlers is a daily reality  that has become of routine news value to the international  media, and even less significance to the international community.    Only a crime of the enormity of the Hebron massacre draws  the  attention of the big powers in the world to the suffering of the  Palestinian people and Israel's disregard for all international  norms and human values. This attention fades, though, sooner  than the blood of Palestinians dries on the ground.    Such is not the case with violence against Israelis. The  killing of any number of Israelis by frustrated Palestinians has  all world capitals racing to condemn ""Arab acts of terrorism""  and offer support for Israel.    The world is serving neither the Palestinians nor the  Israelis through such exercises in hypocrisy. Nor is Israel  protecting its future and that of the region by failing to  address the root causes of violence in the occupied territories.    Israel is responsible for the 'Afula bombing as much as it  is  responsible for the Hebron massacre. Its policies in the  occupied territories provided the settlers with the means for  killing the Palestinians as they prayed in the Ibrahimi Mosque.  Those same policies left the young Palestinian who carried out  the 'Afula suicide attack no choice but to give Israelis a taste  of what their government has been allowing to happen to  Palestinians for decades.    Israeli politicians condemned the Hebron massacre. So should  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat condemn the 'Afula bombing  demands the U.S. and other world powers. The naivety and  insensitivity of comparing the two unfortunate events are  appalling, even though the killing of innocent people and  civilians cannot be condoned by anybody or quarter.    Had the international community been genuinely interested in  ending the bloodshed in the occupied territories, however, it  would have had taken action to end it long before the 'Afula  bombing took place. That it could have done by putting enough  pressure on Israel to remove the injustices to which  Palestinians are subjected on a daily basis. Instead of  removing the settlers, admittedly a main obstacle to the  attainment of peace in the region, Israel threw a blanket curfew  on the West Bank and Gaza. That deprived Palestinians from even  providing for their daily needs. The suffering increased and  retaliatory action became an inevitable response.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman thus  found himself unable to condemn the 'Afula attack personally.  By doing so, he might have only infuriated his people whose  members are being killed by Israelis by the hour. Israel, on  the other hand, could affoprd to condemn the Hebron massacre  because it has within its reach tens of other measures to  appease its citizens.    The most the PLO can do in reaction to Israeli atrocities is  boycott the peace talks, and that it cannot do for long because  of the pressures that Washington and other world powers would  put on it.    But Israel does not boycott the talks, winning world praise  for not allowing ""rejectionists"" to abort the peace process.  What it does, instead, is put two million Palestinians under  siege again by closing the West Bank and Gaza totally. The  negative implications of this act for the peace process far  exceed those of withdrawing from the negotiation. Yet a few in  the world community seem to notice; and Israel gets away with  murder.    Thus only Palestinian desperation grows, and the cycle of  violence continues unabated. When inclination towards peace  becomes the ultimate causalty we can all be sure that the peace  process stands to suffer. Just when the Israelis get to realise  the folly of their policies is the question that we cannot  answer.     "

The public reaction, though, is starting to be heard, and it is anything but  quiet.    A spokesman said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. reacted Friday to  disclosure of the bird kills with astonishment, ""like most Americans, and asked  why.""    ""Pretty incredible isn't it?"" said Lujan spokesman Steve Goldstein, in  Washington, D.C. ""The secretary did not know of this in advance and would not  have approved it if he did.""    Federal officials in Anchorage confirmed that they had authorized the killing  of birds for at least eight different studies in an attempt to more accurately  determine how many animals were killed by the oil spill. The bird carcasses,  some of them oiled to simulate the spill, were then tossed into Prince William  Sound and tracked.    In one study this year, 250 or more birds were shot. In the others, federal  officials indicated, the numbers were somewhat lower -- a few dozen for each  study.    That means the number of birds killed under government contract was half or  more of the 797 injured birds found alive, cleaned of oil and released by a  legion of rescue workers in the immediate aftermath of the grounding of the  tanker Exxon Valdez.    Unlike the rescue, however, which was publicized in heart-tugging accounts  around the world, the killings were undertaken in secrecy.    Meanwhile, the state of Alaska confirmed that it, too, ""collected some animals""  in preparation for a damage suit against Exxon. But a state official said  lawyers in the case ordered on Friday that no specifics be released until the  legal implications are studied. All that is known is a previously disclosed  kill of 10 harbor seals, including three pups, in Prince William Sound in 1989.    In addition to seals, federal authorities said that the state of Alaska may  have killed river otters, deer and other mammals as well as an unknown number  of sea ducks as it builds a scientific foundation for its impending litigation.    News of the animal killing started emerging this week after some digging  through contract paperwork in Washington, D.C., by a reporter from the  Anchorage Daily News.    Lujan was not alone in expressing alarm at the notion of killing birds to add  to the evidence against Exxon. Cleveland Amory of the Fund for Animals, reached  in Tucson, Ariz., denounced the shootings as ""the most asinine plan I have ever  heard of. And I mean no put-down of donkeys.""    Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik in Anchorage noted that the company figures it  spent $25 million trying to rescue sea birds after the spill. As for the  killing, he said: ""We think they could have found alternatives that would not  have resulted in the destruction of wildlife.""    Bird Study No. 1, as it was called, is apparently the largest of the bird kills  and the only one about which details have been released. It was sought by  lawyers from the Department of Justice, who believed the government lacked  precise enough information about the number of cormorants, scoters, murres and  other species killed by the nearly 11 million gallons of oil that burst from  the tanker in America's worst oil spill.    So, the Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, apparently  reluctantly, approved a $600,000 contract with an ecological research company  from Portland, Ore. The company was authorized to shoot up to 350 sea birds,  but Fish and Wildlife spokesman Bruce Batten said the actual number killed was  about two-thirds that number.    Government lawyers and scientists have on hand as evidence the frozen carcasses  of 36,471 dead birds recovered from the oil. But officials said these were not  adequate for the kind of research the lawyers wanted.    According to federal officials, the contract killing in Bird Study No. 1  occurred this summer on various islands, including, ironically, national  wildlife refuges. The coast of Alaska is summer home to more sea birds than all  other places on the planet combined, according to the U.S. government.    By tracking the movement of the bodies through the water, the study sought to  devise a formula for determining how many birds may have succumbed to the  effects of oil.    Previously, the Fish and Wildlife Service said it could only estimate bird  casualties at 90,000 to 270,000. Justice Department lawyers said they found  that estimate too vague.    Batten said the contract shooting was undertaken despite some internal  disagreement within the Fish and Wildlife Service. ""We don't normally go out  and kill animals to make a point,"" he said.    ""But the lawyers thought this was important . . . . It's a government case,  and, as a government entity, it's our responsibility to support that case. In  theory, at least, the damages collected will go to restoration of those (bird)  populations in the future. And the better the case, the higher the damages.""    In addition to Bird Study No. 1, Batten said he had been informed that birds  were killed in two other studies this year and five in 1989. Each case involved  a couple of dozen birds.

Holding the dog down on the kitchen floor of Ou's Long Beach  apartment, they hit it over the head with a blunt instrument, slashed its  throat and began skinning it.    That is when the police arrived. Alerted by a neighbor who had heard the dog's  yelps, they arrested the two men. And last week, Chea and Ou went on trial at  Long Beach Municipal Court for misdemeanor cruelty to animals, an offense that  carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.      Disagreement on Legality    The only disagreement is over whether what they did is illegal.    The prosecution contends that the killing was a crime because it was carried  out in an unnecessarily cruel way.    The defense counters that the dog was killed humanely in a manner consistent  with contemporary slaughterhouse practices, and that the two recent immigrants  were following their own national customs with no idea that they were offending  American sensibilities.    Underlying everything, the lawyers agree, is a resounding clash of cultural  values and a basic question: Just how much is America willing to bend to  accommodate the new wave of immigrants who are daily arriving on its shores?    ""If the dog had been some other kind of animal -- like a chicken or a duck or a  pig -- these people wouldn't be in court,"" said Joe Beason, an attorney  representing Chea. ""While (Americans) consider it completely acceptable to go  out and shoot a deer, those same hunters would disapprove of killing a dog for  food.""    Countered Sarah Lazarus, the prosecutor in the case: ""We intend to prove that  this was cruelty. It's cultural to the extent that each segment of our society  has its own cultural customs, but some of (those customs) can be woven into the  fabric of our society and others cannot.""    The court proceedings have been closely monitored by animal-rights activists.  ""We do not accept these things in our society, and we would hope that the court  will deal with (these men) with the appropriate severity,"" said Jerye Mooney,  coordinator of the Fund for Animals, a national organization based in Torrance  that is pushing for legislation to specifically prohibit the killing of dogs  and cats for human consumption.    Similar legislation, inspired by reports that Southeast Asian refugees had been  foraging for stray dogs and other animals in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park,  was defeated by an Assembly committee in 1981.    ""I would like to see these other cultures contained,"" said Sabina Hubbard,  chairwoman of the Orange County chapter of the Pet Assistance Foundation. ""We  don't want these (practices) to spread.""      Considered Delicacies    Neither Chea, a custodian, nor Ou, who is unemployed, will comment until the  case is resolved.    According to local Asian leaders, dogs and cats are considered delicacies in  some Southeast Asian countries.    Two years ago, officials of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to  Animals reported an increase in the number of dogs and cats being killed for  food in Los Angeles County, a trend they attributed to the influx of Southeast  Asian refugees.    But Lazarus said that, to her knowledge, this is the first incident in which  enough evidence existed to bring the matter to court.    The trial -- which has already resulted in at least one death threat against  the defendants -- has raised the hackles of some local Southeast Asian leaders  who fear that the publicity may result in anti-Asian bias. ""I am very  concerned,"" said Vora H. Kanthoul, associate executive director of the United  Cambodian Community, a social service agency based in Long Beach.    While the eating of dogs is not uncommon in such countries as Korea, the  Philippines and Vietnam, he said, it was highly unusual in Cambodia until the  1970s, when people there were near starvation during the regime of Pol Pot, a  brutal Communist dictator. ""During the war, a lot of things happened and they  ate anything to survive,"" Kanthoul said. ""It's unfortunate that (these men)  were caught because it's blown everything out of proportion.""    Responding to a pretrial motion last week, Judge Bradford L. Andrews ruled that  killing a dog for food is not in itself a violation of the law. To win its  case, therefore, he said, the prosecution must prove that the dog was ""maimed,  wounded, tortured, mutilated or tormented"" in a manner beyond that required to  prepare it as food.    Lazarus said that as the trial progresses, she intends to produce an eyewitness  and a veterinarian who will testify that the dog was killed with unnecessary  cruelty.    Beason says he has an autopsy report indicating that the killing was done in a  manner consistent with livestock slaughter techniques and that there is no  direct evidence of inhumane treatment.    As for the cultural issue, both say it will ultimately have to be resolved out  of court. ""When you bring someone into this country, you take the whole  person,"" Beason said. ""You don't just extract them from their culture, you  bring the culture with them.""      Photo, Sokheng Chea, left, and Seng Ou outside Long Beach courtroom.

While the eating of dogs is not uncommon in such countries as Korea, the  Philippines and Vietnam, he said, it was highly unusual in Cambodia until the  1970s, when people there were near starvation during the regime of Pol Pot, a  brutal Communist dictator. ""During the war, a lot of things happened and they  ate anything to survive,"" Kanthoul said. ""It's unfortunate that (these men)  were caught because it's blown everything out of proportion.""    Responding to a pretrial motion last week, Judge Bradford L. Andrews ruled that  killing a dog for food is not in itself a violation of the law. To win its  case, therefore, he said, the prosecution must prove that the dog was ""maimed,  wounded, tortured, mutilated or tormented"" in a manner beyond that required to  prepare it as food.    Lazarus said that as the trial progresses, she intends to produce an eyewitness  and a veterinarian who will testify that the dog was killed with unnecessary  cruelty.    Beason says he has an autopsy report indicating that the killing was done in a  manner consistent with livestock slaughter techniques and that there is no  direct evidence of inhumane treatment.    As for the cultural issue, both say it will ultimately have to be resolved out  of court. ""When you bring someone into this country, you take the whole  person,"" Beason said. ""You don't just extract them from their culture, you  bring the culture with them.""      Photo, Sokheng Chea, left, and Seng Ou outside Long Beach courtroom.

Mahmud Qandil, a member of the organisation's board, said it  was difficult to have a precise figure because ""every day many  detainees are arrested or released."" The Interior Ministry  could not give an exact number, he said, but added that  ""according to various estimates, the number of political  prisoners was between 20,000 and 30,000.""    Qandil was presenting a report by a team from the  organisation which visited Asyut, the southern region which has  seen the worst violence between fundamentalists and the security  forces. According to the report nearly two-thirds of the 114  people killed in the violence in the first four months of this  year died in Asyut province. It blamed the outlawed al-Jama'ah  al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) for the murder of a German woman  tourist and 29 policemen in the region this year and also said  the al-Jama'ah was suspected of killing eight Coptic Christians,  including five gunned down in a monastery in March.    However, the organisation also accused the security forces  of  rounding up daily at least 250 people ""indiscriminately"" on  suspicion of belonging to the al-Jama'ah.    Witnesses quoted in the report said the ""excessive or  accidental"" use of firearms by the police had led to the deaths  of innocent people, such as the killing of four people on March  27 who had no connections with the outlawed fundamentalists.  The government has launched frequent raids on hideouts used by  the Islamic militants, whose two-year violent campaign has badly  hit the tourist industry and cost almost 400 lives.    The human rights organisation said the situation was likely  to ""explode"" in the Suhaj and al-Minyah provinces to the north  and south of Asyut. It urged the authorities to set up an  independent legal commission to investigate killings by the  security forces in their battle against the militants.    The report said the violence would only stop when the  government respected the law, ensured freedom of speech, changed  the education system and stopped certain broadcasts likely to  incite sectarian violence.    On Tuesday a senior Egyptian opposition MP, Kamil Khalid,  accused unnamed government officials of ordering the killing of  a lawyer closely associated with the militants. Khalid said  'Abd-al-Harith Madani died after having tried to give him  proposals for ending the conflict between the militants and the  security forces.    The Egyptian Bar Association earlier accused the security  forces of torturing Madani to death in custody.     "

Therefore, their initial reaction was to  reject transferring the ""dirty war"" to Bolivia.    In this regard, the three opposition congressmen lashed out  at the fact that Bill Clinton's administration has decided to  give more attention to its ""domestic policy,"" leaving the  producing countries at the mercy of clashes between drug  traffickers and antidrug forces that, more often than not, kill  peasants and not the criminals deeply involved in drug  trafficking activities.    Landivar exclaimed: ""We will not allow our country to become  another Colombia."" Paz pointed out: ""A bloodbath involving  innocent people will be the result of an antidrug war.""  Medinacelli stressed: ""We cannot pay for Clinton's pragmatism.""    Like the Industrial Field    Medinacelli compared the U.S. decision with a situation that  arose a few years ago in the industrial field when the United  States purchased mineral complexes from Bolivia and paid for tin  alone. Nevertheless, when the United States realized that  refining tin damaged the U.S. environment, it preferred the  refining to be carried out in our country.    The MIR congressman added: ""The same happens with drug  trafficking. First, the United States waged a cruel war against  drug trafficking in which even politicians were involved, and  now it wants this dirty war to be waged outside U.S. territory.""    The Armed Forces Will Not Join the War    After pointing out that the U.S. contribution always  involved  interdiction, with its consequences of violence and death, Paz  ruled out the possibility that the Armed Forces might join the  struggle against drug trafficking because in the past few years  the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) has managed to  accumulate more ""firepower"" than the Bolivian Army.    The CONDEPA deputy noted: ""The U.S. decision will promote an  antinational discussion on the viability of alternative  development in our country.""    He Is Not Acquainted With Latin America    For his part, Landivar said Clinton's decision seems to be a  result of his unawareness of the positive results yielded by  alternative development in the Latin American countries.    In Bolivia, Landivar said, the Repentance Decree was the  outcome of the social isolation to which the drug traffickers  have been exposed through well-developed consciousness-raising  campaigns.

Preliminary investigations prove the assassination was  carried out by direct orders from Baghdad and that a large  sabotage network, including diplomats, carried out the operation.    Perhaps it is not unusual for the Iraqi regime to carry out  such practices because it relies on methods of killing and  bodily liquidation as official policy, even inside Iraq. The  question is: What could the Iraqi regime reap from such murder?    The deceased shaykh had lived in Lebanon for a long time.  Lebanese circles say he respected the principles governing his  presence as a guest and was not a direct threat to the Iraqi  regime, although he devoted his life to serving his people's  causes.    It is indeed very sad for Iraqis to see their regime  implementing these murders. But the fact remains that the Iraqi  regime continues to live in isolation, outside the contemporary  world. It is futile even to imagine that there is any  possibility that this regime will behave differently and stop  its ugly methods, known to Iraqis, Arabs, and foreigners alike.    Iraqis are sad and indignant because of the crimes committed  by their regime. This is indisputable. They are not just  witnessing what is happening, but are confronting it with the  means at their disposal, waiting for the right opportunity.    It is unacceptable and unreasonable for conditions in Iraq  to  continue as they are now and for the regime to continue gambling  with the fate of the land and people, after all the disasters it  brought to them over the past years -- disasters whose  humiliating results are impossible to comprehend.    Nevertheless, the Iraqi regime continues to dispatch  sabotage, sedition, and killing missions without doing anything  positive about Iraq, which is now under trusteeship and whose  people are suffering pain and want.    Many strings connected with al-Suhayl's murder have been  unraveled. The Iraqi charge d'affaires in Beirut himself heard  what the detained diplomats said about the murder and the  instructions they had received directly from Baghdad.    Lebanon has regained its strength and unity. It has said it  will not allow sabotage gangs, whether they are Israeli or are  linked with the Saddam regime, to carry out acts of killing and  terrorism on its territory, that all the vicious acts will be  referred to the law so the killers will take the punishment they  deserve.

The guns are the largest still in use by any navy, either of a Western country  or a Communist Bloc nation. And the ships that carry them -- the 45,000-ton  ""battlewagons"" of naval lore -- are the Navy's oldest and most romantic  warships.    The turret on which the guns are mounted is a rotating gun platform that  extends down into the ship in the form of a huge cylinder. The cylinder itself  has decks on several levels. The guns' ammunition is stored here and in  compartments -- called magazines -- along the cylinder side.      Silk Bags of Gunpowder    The ammunition looks something like a very long bullet that has been cut into  small pieces. The head -- or projectile, as it's called -- is loaded into the  breech (the rear) of the gun-barrel first. Behind it comes the powder -- in six  cylindrical 110-pound silk bags.    To fire the projectile, the gun crew sets off a primer -- essentially a blank  cartridge that in turn explodes to light a special igniting powder that  generates enough fire to make the gunpowder explode. The explosion from the  gunpowder propels the projectile to its target.    The projectile and the bags of gunpowder are hoisted by separate elevators from  their storage compartments in the lower part of the cylinder. A pneumatic ram  packs the various components into the barrel before firing. Each gun crew has  its own walled-in compartment.    Turret explosions, especially involving 16-inch guns, are rare. ""I can't even  recall one that ever happened before,"" said Al Carney, who served as commanding  officer of the Missouri from 1986 to June of last year.      Three Malfunctions Described    Naval experts say turret explosions usually can be traced to one of three  malfunctions:     -- If the powder bags are loaded so that the igniting powder is pointing away  from the primer rather than toward it, the result could be a ""hangfire."" The  gunpowder would not explode, but it could be consumed in a slow, smoldering  fire that could prove dangerous.     -- If the gun crew inadvertently leaves bits of burning debris in the barrel  from the powder bags that were used in firing the previous round, they could  set off the next round prematurely. Powder bags are made of silk because it  burns more completely than other fabrics, but some smoldering residue is  possible.     -- If the powder ignites accidentally, either in the powder hoist or in the  handling room at the base of the turret, the result could be tragic. Because so  many men -- 47 at last count out of a 71-man turret crew -- were killed in the  accident, speculation is that the Iowa suffered just such a mishap.      Loading Accident Suspected    ""For 47 people to have died, the explosion would have to have occurred  somewhere in the loading cycle,"" Carney said Wednesday.    David R. Cox, a retired Navy captain who served aboard the Iowa as a  midshipman, said the flooding reported in the Iowa's turret could have been  intentional. Crews traditionally flood compartments in disabled turrets to  prevent any fire from spreading.    The ammunition is large and unwieldy by any standard. Each projectile for a  16-inch gun weighs 2,700 pounds. The 110-pound powder bags are 16 inches in  diameter and about a foot and a half in length.    Rear Adm. Gene La Rocque, a highly decorated World War II veteran who serves as  director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington, told Reuters on  Wednesday that most often ""sparks traditionally set old-fashioned bag  ammunition off.""    Once the blast occurred, he said, the turret had to be sealed off and the men  inside had no chance to get out. ""There is no escape for anyone from the fire,  the heat, the blast, the debris,"" he said. ""The battleship turret is a giant  steel tomb.""      MAJOR NAVY ACCIDENTS    These were among the major explosions, fires, collisions and similar disasters  in the Navy in this century:    Oct. 1, 1972 -- During the Vietnam War, there was an explosion in the center  gun of turret No. 2 of the heavy cruiser Newport News during shore support  operations, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36.    June 2, 1969 -- Destroyer Frank E. Evans collided with Australian carrier  Melbourne in South China Sea, killing 74.    May 21, 1968 -- Nuclear submarine Scorpion sank in the Atlantic with 99 aboard.    July 29, 1967 -- Fire ravaged the aircraft carrier Forrestal off the coast of  Vietnam, 134 died.    Oct. 26, 1966 -- Aircraft carrier Oriskany caught fire in the Gulf of Tonkin,  with 43 deaths.    April 10, 1963 -- Submarine Thresher sank in the Atlantic, killing 129.    Dec. 19, 1960 -- Aircraft carrier Constellation caught fire at her berth in New  York City. There were 50 fatalities.    May 26, 1954 -- Aircraft carrier Bennington exploded and burned near Quonset  Point, R.I., killing 107.

The guns are the largest still in use by any navy, either of a Western country  or a Communist Bloc nation. And the ships that carry them -- the 45,000-ton  ""battlewagons"" of naval lore -- are the Navy's oldest and most romantic  warships.    The turret on which the guns are mounted is a rotating gun platform that  extends down into the ship in the form of a huge cylinder. The cylinder itself  has decks on several levels. The guns' ammunition is stored here and in  compartments -- called magazines -- along the cylinder side.      Silk Bags of Gunpowder    The ammunition looks something like a very long bullet that has been cut into  small pieces. The head -- or projectile, as it's called -- is loaded into the  breech (the rear) of the gun-barrel first. Behind it comes the powder -- in six  cylindrical 110-pound silk bags.    To fire the projectile, the gun crew sets off a primer -- essentially a blank  cartridge that in turn explodes to light a special igniting powder that  generates enough fire to make the gunpowder explode. The explosion from the  gunpowder propels the projectile to its target.    The projectile and the bags of gunpowder are hoisted by separate elevators from  their storage compartments in the lower part of the cylinder. A pneumatic ram  packs the various components into the barrel before firing. Each gun crew has  its own walled-in compartment.    Turret explosions, especially involving 16-inch guns, are rare. ""I can't even  recall one that ever happened before,"" said Al Carney, who served as commanding  officer of the Missouri from 1986 to June of last year.      Three Malfunctions Described    Naval experts say turret explosions usually can be traced to one of three  malfunctions:     -- If the powder bags are loaded so that the igniting powder is pointing away  from the primer rather than toward it, the result could be a ""hangfire."" The  gunpowder would not explode, but it could be consumed in a slow, smoldering  fire that could prove dangerous.     -- If the gun crew inadvertently leaves bits of burning debris in the barrel  from the powder bags that were used in firing the previous round, they could  set off the next round prematurely. Powder bags are made of silk because it  burns more completely than other fabrics, but some smoldering residue is  possible.     -- If the powder ignites accidentally, either in the powder hoist or in the  handling room at the base of the turret, the result could be tragic. Because so  many men -- 47 at last count out of a 71-man turret crew -- were killed in the  accident, speculation is that the Iowa suffered just such a mishap.      Loading Accident Suspected    ""For 47 people to have died, the explosion would have to have occurred  somewhere in the loading cycle,"" Carney said Wednesday.    David R. Cox, a retired Navy captain who served aboard the Iowa as a  midshipman, said the flooding reported in the Iowa's turret could have been  intentional. Crews traditionally flood compartments in disabled turrets to  prevent any fire from spreading.    The ammunition is large and unwieldy by any standard. Each projectile for a  16-inch gun weighs 2,700 pounds. The 110-pound powder bags are 16 inches in  diameter and about a foot and a half in length.    Rear Adm. Gene La Rocque, a highly decorated World War II veteran who serves as  director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington, told Reuters on  Wednesday that most often ""sparks traditionally set old-fashioned bag  ammunition off.""    Once the blast occurred, he said, the turret had to be sealed off and the men  inside had no chance to get out. ""There is no escape for anyone from the fire,  the heat, the blast, the debris,"" he said. ""The battleship turret is a giant  steel tomb.""      MAJOR NAVY ACCIDENTS    These were among the major explosions, fires, collisions and similar disasters  in the Navy in this century:    Oct. 1, 1972 -- During the Vietnam War, there was an explosion in the center  gun of turret No. 2 of the heavy cruiser Newport News during shore support  operations, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36.    June 2, 1969 -- Destroyer Frank E. Evans collided with Australian carrier  Melbourne in South China Sea, killing 74.    May 21, 1968 -- Nuclear submarine Scorpion sank in the Atlantic with 99 aboard.    July 29, 1967 -- Fire ravaged the aircraft carrier Forrestal off the coast of  Vietnam, 134 died.    Oct. 26, 1966 -- Aircraft carrier Oriskany caught fire in the Gulf of Tonkin,  with 43 deaths.    April 10, 1963 -- Submarine Thresher sank in the Atlantic, killing 129.    Dec. 19, 1960 -- Aircraft carrier Constellation caught fire at her berth in New  York City. There were 50 fatalities.    May 26, 1954 -- Aircraft carrier Bennington exploded and burned near Quonset  Point, R.I., killing 107.    April 26, 1952 -- Destroyer Hobson collided with the carrier Wasp in the  Atlantic and sank, killing 175 sailors.    April 21, 1952 -- Powder explosion occurred in a gun turret aboard the cruiser  St. Paul during the Korean War; 30 died.

0,FT933-14974 ,"FT933-14974 _AN-DGLB7AANFT 930712   FT  12 JUL 93 / Slav states pledge economic union      By JOHN LLOYD      MOSCOW   BELARUS, Russia and Ukraine, the three former Soviet republics which created the Commonwealth of Independent States, have pledged themselves to a close economic union designed to knit together once more their devastated economies. The agreement was announced at the weekend as waves made by the Russian parliament's decision on Friday to declare Russian ownership of the port of Sevastopol in the Ukrainian region of Crimea subsided, at least for the moment. Ukrainian leaders appeared pacified yesterday by comments from Mr Boris Yeltsin on his return from the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. The Russian president said he was 'ashamed' of the decision. The prime ministers of the three Slav states signed a 'declaration on economic integration' which commits them to an economic treaty by September 1. This would sweep away both formal and informal barriers to trade, permit citizens of all three countries to live, work and buy property in the others and propose new institutions for developing a 'common economic space'. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, hinted that the agreement would go 'much further' than mere economic union - a possible reference to a clause in the declaration which says that 'the governments proceed from the fact that economic integration cannot be effective in isolation without a wider, multilateral mutual action in the political, defence and legislative areas'. However, the agreement faces a number of hurdles before it can be taken at face value, not least that it is one among many such declarations which have barely addressed the growing distance between the members of the CIS. It is only an agreement to agree - at the mercy of a worsening of relations between the states over the next few weeks, especially between Ukraine and Russia. The union reunites the original signatories of the CIS agreement in December 1991 but leaves out the other seven members, especially the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, all of which have clamoured to remain in the group. Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belarussian prime minister, denied that the non-Slav peoples had been left 'out in the cold' but the declaration itself specified 'certain conditions' which would be attendant on their joining the new 'union within a union'. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said that a condition of membership was that the participating states should not be members of any other such union. However, the Central Asian states have already formed their own 'common market'.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.     BYZ  Belarus, East Europe.

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BEIT FURIK      Israeli-occupied West Bank Twice this year, self-appointed rebel executioners  have forced a suspected collaborator into the central mosque here and made him  foretell his death over a loudspeaker.    Then the victims were killed. One was hacked and slashed first; the other was  beaten, kicked and trampled.    Killings such as these have become an important feature of the Palestinian  uprising, known as the intifada. Now, the executioners' weapons are competing  with the stones thrown by young people as symbols of the revolt.    The slayings of Palestinians suspected of cooperating with the Israeli army and  secret police -- carried out in defiance of pleas by Palestinian leaders -- are  more than keeping pace with killings at the hands of Israeli soldiers. So far  this year, 19 Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians; 18 have been  killed by soldiers.    The persistence of Palestinians killing Palestinians has raised questions about  the hold the public Palestinian leadership has on grass-roots activists. Those  who hope to persuade Israel to agree to a new Palestinian state have been  placed on the defensive. Indeed, many Palestinians now fear that the killings  may eventually undermine the uprising.    ""We do not want someone taking to himself the power to decide who is  participating enthusiastically in the intifada and who is not,"" a Palestinian  activist in Jerusalem said the other day.    Many of these executions have taken place in the occupied Gaza Strip, where  Islamic fundamentalist groups sometimes strike at Palestinians believed to be  involved in drug dealing and prostitution. On the West Bank, Palestinians have  become alarmed about renegade groups of masked men carrying out attacks on  nationalists and robbing stores and homes.    Beit Furik, an impoverished farm town near Nablus, has a long history of  fighting the Israelis. In 1967, Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine  Liberation Organization, escaped pursuing Israeli soldiers by hiding in the  basement of an old house here.    On Feb. 27, young men forced Ali Nasasra into Beit Furik's mosque, where  according to witnesses he confessed to informing on Palestinians. Nasasra had  been banished from the village 20 years ago because, residents say, he worked  for Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency.    He was found at the home of a relative and seized by about a dozen men armed  with hatchets and knives. His captors, members of a Nablus-based group called  Revolutionary Security, said he would be subjected to the ""justice of the  people.""    As Nasasra, 45, left the mosque, scores of people beat him with sticks, kicked  him and trampled him to death.    In January, a group of masked youths dragged Mohammed Hatatbeh, 53, to the Beit  Furik mosque, where he was forced to confess over the mosque's sound system. He  was said to have admitted to leading two Palestinian gunman into a fatal army  ambush in 1969 and to cooperating with the Israelis ever since.    After confessing, Hatatbeh was released -- but two days later, masked  executioners came to his home, took him to a square and hacked him to death  with axes. The blood-soaked ground where he died has been left undisturbed as a  warning to others, youths in the village told reporters.    ""The collaborator was dangerous,"" one of the youths said. ""He was responsible  for the deaths of two of our fighters, and he continued to work for the  Israelis.""    The youth, who gave his name as Najib, guided the reporters to the scene of the  killing. When asked why Beit Furik rebels had disobeyed Palestinian leaders'  orders to stop killing suspected informers, he responded with a familiar  refrain:    ""Arafat is not here. He does not know our situation.""    Najib insisted that Hatatbeh was given a trial and that his killing was  necessary in view of the risks the rebel activists take in their battle with  the Israelis.    The killing of suspected collaborators began in earnest last summer. At first,  Palestinian leaders and PLO members justified the deaths on grounds that the  informers were placing activists in mortal danger by identifying them to the  Israelis.    Over the years, according to Israeli intelligence experts, the Shin Bet  recruited many informers in the West Bank and Gaza and still has thousands of  them on its payroll.    Some Israeli politicians, including the hawkish Ariel Sharon, a member of  Parliament, have suggested that armed collaborators be unleashed on the  nationalists as a way to quell the intifada.    As the number of executions mounted, the PLO announced that it alone could  authorize an execution. But the killing continued.    At least 170 Palestinians are believed to have been killed by other  Palestinians since the uprising began 27 months ago, all but about 30 of them  since last June.    By November, the uprising's public leadership had become alarmed. Faisal  Husseini, one of the few widely recognized voices of the uprising, went from  village to village appealing for an end to the killing.    The executioners resist discipline. Said Kanaan, a Nablus businessman and  longtime pro-PLO contact, recalled that last November he tried to deliver a  letter containing an appeal from Arafat to a nationalist group known as the  Black Panthers, responsible for slaying at least eight suspected collaborators  in Nablus.    ""They took the letter and asked me to prove it was authentic,"" Kanaan said. ""I  tried to assure them, but they threw the letter up in the air and shot at it.  They demanded that Arafat make a speech on radio.""    Arafat complied, but it is not clear whether his appeal succeeded in cooling  their ardor.

Hung up in echoing patterns of obsession, novelist Hubert Selby's heroes are  forever trying to beat the system but find themselves doomed to a loser's  world. Driven to escape a fatal confinement in material hells of New York City  and in complex hells of Being, they mount violent, dark revolts, but are  continually pulled back into the damned condition from which they started --  discovering, like Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, that ""where we are is hell, / And  where hell is we must ever be.""    In Selby's world of urban lost souls, individual identity is as much beside the  point as it is for John Bunyan's ""Everyman"" or Samuel Beckett's ""Unnameable.""  Suffering through endless ""routines"" of abjection as ultimate proof of the  humility of a dehumanized humanity's humility before a nonexistent God, his  protagonists drift in a fluid, hallucinatory haze of drive and phobia, lust and  revulsion, sin and retribution, necessary crime and inevitable punishment.    Headlong, stark and arresting, Selby's books have the energy, intensity and  pain of alienated singular vision and an inexorable momentum of horror that is  at once hypnotic and almost too much to bear.    Selby is a self-taught writer who went from P.S. 102 in Brooklyn to the  Merchant Marine to a long literary apprenticeship, working at odd jobs while  moonlighting as a storyteller. His first book, ""Last Exit to Brooklyn,"" won  some fame -- and, due to its raw content, more notoriety -- in the mid-1960s.    His three novels of the following decade -- ""The Room"" and ""The Demon"" (first  published in 1971 and 1976, respectively) as well as ""Requiem for a Dream"" --  undeservedly received far less notice. Since then, he has published only one  book, ""The Song of the Silent Snow,"" a collection of short stories to which  readers may wish to turn to find early rehearsals of the two novels here under  review.    In a significant sense, Selby's entire work comprises one overlapping tale,  with interchangeable settings and a single central figure who, when given a  name at all, always is called Harry. In ""Last Exit,"" he is Harry Black, a union  shop steward. In ""The Demon,"" an almost perfect novel that may well be the  writer's finest achievement, he is Harry White.    White is an ambitious, upwardly mobile young corporate executive with the sex  drive of a satyr, the inner tension of a tightly coiled spring and a  sleepwalker's lack of self-knowledge. The latter deficiency, a tragic constant  in Selby's scheme of the doomed, triggers a geometric progression toward  despair whose finely calibrated gradations the novelist charts with terrifying,  Dantesque precision. Harry may not know it, but each step in his climb up the  success ladder, and each mechanical surrender to ""the demon that was welling up  inside him,"" adds to the burden of inarticulate grief, guilt and shame that  will become his downfall. And the higher he climbs, the steeper will be his  vertiginous tumble into the inferno.    For Harry White, an automaton-like pursuit of sexual release with woman after  woman is the only way of appeasing the inner demon. Sex for Harry is not  passion but a convulsive compulsion, a wallowing in defilement that defers but  does not remove a crushing weight of meaninglessness in his life. Each new  conquest brings temporary relief that soon yields in turn to new cycles of  tension, self-conflict and pain. An ""ideal"" marriage to a beautiful, loving  wife, an executive vice presidency of his firm, a luxurious home in the  suburbs, all the trappings of fortune are but fuel to Harry's insatiable demon.    When the fall comes, Harry at first does a good job of concealment. A crack-up  episode over lunch at the Banker's Club leads to a hospital visit, where, to  his secret dismay, the doctors are able to find no physical explanation of his  erratic behavior -- ""no tumor. . . . Nothing. Just him."" But soon his ""night  visits to hell"" are becoming more and more desperate, his battles with the  demon less and less successful. He turns from casual sex to petty theft to  gratuitous murder, eventually finding himself immersed beyond all extrication  in ""the huge cesspool that he felt he was, and could not get away from.""    With Selby's careful prose taking on the accelerating force of catastrophe,  Harry meets his fate in scenes of orgiastic violence and sacrificial  self-immolation, an Easter Sunday murder of the Cardinal of New York on the  altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral followed by a final suicidal plunge into the  vortex of oblivion.    Harry White's spasmodic attempt to penetrate the void of being, to force  meaning out of the pointlessness of his life, brings him to self-revelation at  last. As he dies, all the evasion and avoidance and ""games"" now swept away, he  finds ""the truth of his life suddenly thrust in front of him,"" his timetables  of success obliterated in a timelessness of vision.    It is out of a like timelessness that Selby's companion novel, ""The Room,""  begins. A nameless prisoner, charged with a crime he may or may not have  committed, speaks to us from his confinement in the remand cell where he is  being held pending trial. His telling-over of the repetitive minutiae of  abjection, his reveries exposing the repressed traumas of his childhood, the  sexual warpings and stuntings of his adolescence, and his violent, imaginary  revenges against his captors, make up a canticle of pain that reiterates the  central truth of Selby's dark vision: The interior hell and its torments are at  once the supreme proof of cosmic justice and of the absence of mercy from the  world.    In Dante's medieval conception, hell was located at the Earth's core, and thus  farthest from the sun, stars and planets by which human time is told. For  Selby's incarcerated hero, similarly, there is no time, only the unendurable  weight of being -- ""it just seems to drag and drag and weigh a ton. And hang on  you like a monkey. Like it's going to suck the blood out of you. Or suck your  guts out. . . .""    Selby is a seeker after the quality of mercy in an age ruled by the indifferent  mechanics of quantity, a writer whose books defiantly refuse any such easy  accommodation with the social order as is implied in the work of, say, John  Updike; as Amiri Baraka once suggested, Selby's pages are populated by  ""Americans no character in a John Updike novel would be happy to meet.""    At a time when the most successful fiction is that which provides reassuring  distraction from the difficult truths of existence, it is easy to see how the  acute and agonized moral vision of a writer like Selby may go ignored by -- as  culture critic Theodor Adorno once put it -- ""those who would like to sleep  through the deluge that threatens them.""

The first incident broke out when three Tuaregs tried to  seize a land cruiser near the central mosque. One of the  bandits, caught by the crowd, was stoned and later burned while  one of the remaining two was killed in an exchange of fire as he  tried to run away.    A few hours later, several men belonging to the Tuareg  community attacked the hospital, killing three civilians and  wounding an undetermined number of people. Also, on the night of  13 May, some Tuaregs threw grenade canisters into a house in  Gao, killing one woman and injuring one child, the same source  added.    These incidents come at a time when representatives of the  Malian Government and the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad  (MFUA, former Tuareg rebels) have been meeting since 10 May in  Algeria to work out measures that are likely to bring an end to  the violence in northern Mali.

Mr Ingo Heinrich, a 27-year-old electrician in civilian life, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for firing the first fatal shot at 20-year old Chris Gueffroy, who was attempting to flee to West Germany on February 6 1989. The sentence was 18 months more than the public prosecutor had demanded. A co-defendant was given a suspended two-year prison term for severely wounding another escapee. Defence lawyers said they would appeal. Two other border guards were found not guilty of shooting at the escapee. Justice officials said the verdicts were likely to influence future trials of east German border guards accused of murder along the frontier.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Alternatives to TB Isolation Rooms         Isolation can also be achieved by use of negative-pressure enclosures (e.g, tents or booths) (Suppl. 3, Section II.A.1). These can be used to provide patient isolation in areas such as emergency rooms and medical testing and treatment areas and to supplement isolation in designated isolation rooms.         III. UVGI           Purpose:     To kill or inactivate airborne tubercle bacilli.     Research has demonstrated that UVGI is effective in killing or inactivating tubercle bacilli under experimental conditions (    66,107110    ) and in reducing transmission of other infections in hospitals (    111    ), military housing (    112    ), and classrooms (    113115    ). Because of the results of numerous studies (    116120    ) and the experiences of TB clinicians and mycobacteriologists during the past several decades, the use of UVGI has been recommended as a supplement to other TB infection-control measures in settings where the need for killing or inactivating tubercle bacilli is important (    2,4,121125    ).     UV radiation is defined as that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum described by wavelengths from 100 to 400 nm. For convenience of classification, the UV spectrum has been separated into three different wavelength bands: UVA (long wavelengths, range: 320400 nm), UVB (midrange wavelengths, range: 290320 nm), and UVC (short wavelengths, range: 100290 nm) (    126    ). Commercially available UV lamps used for germicidal purposes are low-pressure mercury vapor lamps (    127    ) that emit radiant energy in the UVC range, predominantly at a wavelength of 253.7 nm (    128    ).         A. Applications         UVGI can be used as a method of air disinfection to supplement other engineering controls. Two systems of UVGI can be used for this purpose: duct irradiation and upper-room air irradiation.         1. Duct Irradiation             Purpose:     To inactivate tubercle bacilli without exposing persons to UVGI.     In duct irradiation systems, UV lamps are placed inside ducts that remove air from rooms to disinfect the air before it is recirculated. When UVGI duct systems are properly designed, installed, and maintained, high levels of UV radiation may be produced in the duct work. The only potential for human exposure to this radiation occurs during maintenance operations.     Duct irradiation may be used:   In a TB isolation room or treatment room to recirculate air from the room, through a duct containing UV lamps, and back into the room. This recirculation method can increase the overall room airflow but does not increase the supply of fresh outside air to the room.     In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, and other general-use areas of a facility where patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air, to recirculate air back into the general ventilation. Duct-irradiation systems are dependent on airflow patterns within a room that ensure that all or nearly all of the room air circulates through the duct.         2. Upper-Room Air Irradiation             Purpose:     To inactivate tubercle bacilli in the upper part of the room, while minimizing radiation exposure to persons in the lower part of the room.     In upper-room air irradiation, UVGI lamps are suspended from the ceiling or mounted on the wall. The bottom of the lamp is shielded to direct the radiation upward but not downward. The system depends on air mixing to take irradiated air from the upper to the lower part of the room, and nonirradiated air from the lower to the upper part. The irradiated air space is much larger than that in a duct system.     UVGI has been effective in killing bacteria under conditions where air mixing was accomplished mainly by convection. For example, BCG was atomized in a room that did not have supplemental ventilation (    120    ), and in another study a surrogate bacteria,     Serratia marcesens    , was aerosolized in a room with a ventilation rate of 6 ACH (    129    ). These reports estimated the effect of UVGI to be equivalent to 10 and 39 ACH, respectively, for the organisms tested, which are less resistant to UVGI than     M. tuberculosis     (    120    ). The addition of fans or some heating/air conditioning arrangements may double the effectiveness of UVGI lamps (    130132    ). Greater rates of ventilation, however, may decrease the length of time the air is irradiated, thus decreasing the killing of bacteria (    117,129    ). The optimal relationship between ventilation and UVGI is not known. Air irradiation lamps used in corridors have been effective in killing atomized     S. marcesens     (    133    ). Use of UVGI lamps in an outpatient room has reduced culturable airborne bacteria by 14%19%. However, the irradiation did not reduce the concentration of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria; although fast-growing mycobacteria were cultured,     M. tuberculosis     could not be recovered from the room's air samples because of fungal overgrowth of media plates (    134    ).     Upper-room air UVGI irradiation may be used:   In isolation or treatment rooms as a supplemental method of air cleaning.   In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, corridors, and other central areas of a facility where patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air. Determinants of UVGI effectiveness include room configuration, UV lamp placement, and the adequacy of airflow patterns in bringing contaminated air into contact with the irradiated upper-room space. Air mixing may be facilitated by supplying cool air near the ceiling in rooms where warmer air (or a heating device) is present below. The ceiling should be high enough for a large volume of upper-room air to be irradiated without HCWs and patients being overexposed to UV radiation.       B. Limitations       Because the clinical effectiveness of UV systems varies, and because of the risk for transmission of     M. tuberculosis     if a system malfunctions or is maintained improperly, UVGI is not recommended for the following specific applications:            "," FR941028-2-00200   FR941028-2-00109        4.

The addition of fans or some heating/air conditioning arrangements may double the effectiveness of UVGI lamps (    130132    ). Greater rates of ventilation, however, may decrease the length of time the air is irradiated, thus decreasing the killing of bacteria (    117,129    ). The optimal relationship between ventilation and UVGI is not known. Air irradiation lamps used in corridors have been effective in killing atomized     S. marcesens     (    133    ). Use of UVGI lamps in an outpatient room has reduced culturable airborne bacteria by 14%19%. However, the irradiation did not reduce the concentration of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria; although fast-growing mycobacteria were cultured,     M. tuberculosis     could not be recovered from the room's air samples because of fungal overgrowth of media plates (    134    ).     Upper-room air UVGI irradiation may be used:   In isolation or treatment rooms as a supplemental method of air cleaning.   In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, corridors, and other central areas of a facility where patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air. Determinants of UVGI effectiveness include room configuration, UV lamp placement, and the adequacy of airflow patterns in bringing contaminated air into contact with the irradiated upper-room space. Air mixing may be facilitated by supplying cool air near the ceiling in rooms where warmer air (or a heating device) is present below. The ceiling should be high enough for a large volume of upper-room air to be irradiated without HCWs and patients being overexposed to UV radiation.       B. Limitations       Because the clinical effectiveness of UV systems varies, and because of the risk for transmission of     M. tuberculosis     if a system malfunctions or is maintained improperly, UVGI is not recommended for the following specific applications:            "

In the '80s, it was all-league running back Mike Conover.    But as they approach the '90s, the Hunters have become the hunted.    Granada Hills, the Valley-area's top-ranked team, showed Canoga Park no mercy  Friday night, stalking the Hunters and dropping them, 44-6, in a Northwest  Valley Conference game at Granada Hills.    About the only thing the woeful Hunters (0-6, 0-3 in conference play) had in  common with the Highlanders was their green-and-white school colors.    Granada Hills running back Brett Washington led the way, rushing for 165 yards  and two touchdowns -- his seventh and eighth of the year.    Granada Hills scored on its first three possessions and was driving again when  the half mercifully ended for Canoga Park.    The Highlanders went 54 yards on their first scoring march, Washington running  seven yards for the touchdown with 7:01 remaining in the first quarter.

They have not only repulsed attacks by the LTTE though  heavily outnumbered, but also killed as many as an estimated 100  terrorists mostly in close quarter battle, military spokesman  Brigadier Gemunu Kulatunga told LANKAPUVATH Thursday.    Giving details, he said that a group of soldiers training  with dummy ammunition and firing mortars at Weli Oya were fired  on by LTTE terrorists with a barrage of live mortars on Tuesday.  The mortar trainees had immediately reloaded their mortars with  live ammunition and hit back hard at the terrorists killing two  of them and forcing others to withdraw. Two soldiers were also  killed in this incident which occurred during daylight hours.    Brigadier Kulatunga said that 15 terrorists were confirmed  killed and 10 bodies recovered at Comar Point, Pooneryn, in  northern Sri Lanka.    He said that in an another incident, 30 to 40 LTTE  terrorists  had been killed in a dawn attack on an army picket moving from  Kahambiligasyayad detachment at Weli Oya. In this incident four  soldiers had been killed when a terrorist mortar hit a buffel  [as received] vehicle which they were manning causing an  explosion of the ammunition inside it. In an act of rare  bravery and courage a single soldier charged at the LTTE  terrorists with his T-56 firing burst after burst at a group of  thoroughly shocked terrorists killing five of them while the  others ran. Subsequently reinforcements and air cover were  called in and about 30-40 terrorists were killed.    A report from Thoppigala in the jungles south of Batticaloa  District states that troops effectively beat back a pre-election  attack by about 200 terrorists with two terrorists being  confirmed killed.    The military spokesman said that at Angodawillu eight  terrorists were confirmed killed when a group of 75 cadres  attacked a security forces patrol.    At Etawetunawewa in Weli Oya, a group of 25 soldiers, many  of  them bathing naked in the tank, after a hard day's training were  repulsed an attack at dusk by two groups of terrorists numbering  about 50 in each group. The soldiers had swum ashore, picked up  their rifles and blasted the terrorists killing at least 20 of  them. The terrorists had on radio transmissions monitored by  technical sources admitted being stunned at the fierce counter  attack launched by the soldiers and made frantic calls for  vehicles to evacuate the wounded terrorists. Only four soldiers  were wounded in this incident.     "

REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Pacific Beach real estate broker Howard F. Barton Jr. was ordered Monday to  stand trial for murder in the shooting of Marco Sanchez after a traffic dispute  between Sanchez and Barton's daughter. Barton's $500,000 bail was revoked by a  judge who called him ""hot tempered and a danger to the public.""    ""The killing was committed without any cause, without justification. . . . It  was an uncalled for, premeditated, unlawful killing,"" said Municipal Judge  Rafael A. Arreola. ""The killing was unnecessary to prevent death or great  bodily injury to you or your daughter,"" he told the defendant.    Barton, 47, is charged with murder in the    Feb. 22 shooting death of Sanchez, 24, a National City resident. He was taken  into custody and put in the County Jail after Monday's hearing.    The shooting occurred in Pacific Beach, after a minor traffic altercation  between Sanchez and Barton's daughter, Andrea Barton.    After the altercation, Andrea Barton drove to her father's nearby real estate  office. The Bartons then went looking for Sanchez and found him shopping in a  store on Garnet Avenue. Witnesses said a series of arguments ensued, with  Sanchez walking away from the Bartons each time.    Witnesses testified that Howard Barton followed Sanchez to his car and shot him  once in the back, while Sanchez was sitting inside. A wounded Sanchez exited  the car and ran down the sidewalk, before collapsing and dying inside a store.    Defense attorney Clyde Munsell argued throughout the five-day preliminary  hearing that Barton shot Sanchez in self-defense, claiming that Sanchez  attacked Barton with a knife. However, none of the witnesses testified to  seeing a weapon in Sanchez's hands. Munsell also attempted to justify the  killing on grounds that Barton believed his daughter was in imminent danger.    On Monday, Arreola lectured Barton that ""there was no justification"" for him to  get involved in his daughter's argument with Sanchez. The judge said ""a  reasonable"" person would have called the police instead.    In his closing argument, Munsell asked Arreola that, if he found it necessary  to order Barton to stand trial to bind him over on a charge of voluntary  manslaughter or at the very most second-degree murder, and throw out a  first-degree murder charge.    Deputy Dist. Atty Lisa Chappell pointed out to Munsell that the district  attorney can merely charge Barton with murder, and that it is up to a jury to  decide whether to convict him of first- or second-degree murder or  manslaughter, or to acquit him.    Munsell made a final appeal to have Barton remain free on bail pending his next  hearing May 25, but Arreola turned him down.    ""My concern is his temper and danger to the public. . . . I don't know if it's  (the shooting) an isolated incident. But I don't want to have another isolated  incident,"" said Arreola.

The widening of the ban from 10 departments in central  Algeria to the whole country follows the killing Wednesday of  two political activists.    Yahia Bouguettaya, the former mayor of Mohammadia,  south-east  Algeria, and Mohamed Touali, an activist in Algeria's Ettahadi  (Challenge) political party, were assassinated Wednesday.    Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday in Constantine,  east Algeria, and his body later discovered, the party said.    Their deaths bring the number of political assassinations to  six since former communist party official Ferhat Chibout was  killed on January 27.    The latest deaths follow the killing Tuesday in the Casbah  district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and  the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague,  Scott Allan White.    Armed Islamic groups have waged a war on the regime,  targeting foreigners politicians, and intellectuals as part of  their campaign, since the cancellation in January 1992 of a  general election which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was  poised to win.

This morning six tanks and hundreds of Chetniks are  attacking  Gorazde from the direction of (Osanica). The attacks have also  started on Ilovaca, Zorovici, and Bare. People are fleeing from  these villages toward the town. And while 60,000 people are  crowding the town center on the left bank of the Drina River,  the Chetniks are looting and burning all the villages that have  been emptied. Yesterday dozens of trucks arrived in Kopaci, 5  km from Gorazde, from Priboj and other towns in Serbia and  Montenegro, and looting is under way on a massive scale. This  was supervised yesterday by the two brothers in crime, war  criminals Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. They also  toured the premises of the wire factory and [word indistinct] in  Kopaci, which they managed to capture with the full support of  the UN, together with the residential area [words indistinct].    The mass slaughter of these people is to happen today as the  Chetniks have already this morning activated their bloody  artillery on the surrounding hills. The shells are again  killing, and who knows for how long it will continue to claim  victims among the women, children, old folk, and all those  caught in this tiny crowded space.

Brown, a millionaire computer entrepreneur from Anaheim Hills who is on trial  for murder, conceded in the conversation that he took part in his daughter's  1985 plot to kill his wife, but insisted repeatedly that he never encouraged  it.    ""I didn't want it to happen -- you should remember that,"" the 38-year-old Brown  told Cinnamon sternly during an August, 1988, visit to the California Youth  Authority in Camarillo, where Cinnamon was imprisoned for her stepmother's  murder. ""I told you guys I didn't want any part of it.""    With Cinnamon Brown's cooperation, authorities tape-recorded the conversation  in an attempt to show that David Brown had orchestrated the murder of his wife,  24-year-old Linda Brown, and then set up Cinnamon to take the fall for it.    Following her 1985 murder conviction, Cinnamon Brown, now 19, remained silent  for more than three years about what happened on the night of the killing,  saying she could not remember. But she changed her story and implicated her  father after authorities disclosed to her that he had collected $835,000 from  the victim's insurance and then married Patti Bailey, the victim's sister.    Bailey, now 22, has since pleaded guilty to murder for her role in Linda  Brown's shooting death in the family's Garden Grove home. Bailey and David  Brown now have a daughter. But on the tape, Brown vigorously denies to Cinnamon  that the child is his or that he and Bailey were romantically involved.    Some five weeks after the tape recording was made, David Brown was arrested and  charged with murder.    Prosecutors said they believe that the tape offers one of their most damaging  pieces of evidence against Brown, leaving unchallenged his role in the killing  of his wife. The tape, portions of which were published in The Times last year,  was played for the first time publicly Friday at Brown's trial in Superior  Court.    Co-defense attorney Richard Schwartzberg, pointing out Brown's denials that he  wanted his wife dead, said: ""This does not hurt David. It supports our belief  that David was not involved in the killing of Linda Brown.""    Schwartzberg said that Brown's knowledge of any plot to kill his wife is not a  criminal offense. But Brown, in the recorded conversation, clearly thinks  differently.    In the tape, Cinnamon Brown tells her father that she is confused and tired of  telling ""lies"" to CYA parole officials, who had been trying to convince her to  tell what she knew about the murder.    Her father responds: ""You can tell the truth, if you don't tell the whole  truth. If there was knowledge . . . in advance of what was going to happen,  then we'll all go to jail.""    During the conversation, Brown acknowledges that he had talked with Cinnamon  and Patti Bailey about killing Linda, who he claimed was a drug addict with  ties to the ""Mafia"" and the ""mob."" Linda and her twin brother, Brown tells  Cinnamon, planned to ""off"" him and take over his lucrative computer  data-retrieval business.    Prosecutors don't believe such a plan ever existed and say the claim was  Brown's way of getting his daughter to shoot Linda Brown to death on March 19,  1985.    On the tape recording, Brown urges Cinnamon to continue telling authorities  that she doesn't remember what happened on the night of the murder and avoid  casting suspicion on himself, Patti Bailey and his parents, who he said had  been present during part of the discussions.    ""Do you see any reason for five people's lives to be ruined . . . for all of us  to go to jail because we knew what was going to happen beforehand?"" Brown asks.  ""I can't survive in jail. . . . I would kill myself before I'd let myself die a  slow and painful death in a cell.""

The militias,  apart from the killings within Rwanda, are now also killing  people in refugee camps, mainly in Tanzania and Burundi. The  militias have organized gangs with code names and use whistles  as their signals when carrying out their murderous plans.    Before the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] took up control of  areas bordering Tanzania, the militias killed thousands of  people, mainly the Tutsi and some Hutu in the opposition. Those  who managed to escape these killings took refuge in Tanzania,  making the first batch of refugees going to Tanzania since the  war resumed in the month of April. When the RPF forces advanced  and took over the areas of Kibungo, the militias also took to  their heels, and sought refuge in Tanzania as the second batch  of refugees. Thousands of pangas [machetes] that were used for  killing were abandoned by the militias at Rusumo on the Rwandan  side. The militias came to live in the same refugee camps with  people who ran away from their acts of murder. Known militias,  like Gatete, the former leader of Commune Murambi, and Mpambara,  of Commune Rukara, who fled after untold mass killings in  churches, are among the people who went to the refugee camps in  Tanzania, and the Tanzanian authorities know very well that  these militias are in their country.    The Tanzanian Government should be able to give security to  the refugees and stop the killings done by militias in the  refugee camps. Militias have killed people in the refugee camps  at Ngara, but surprisingly the district commissioner of Ngara,  Brigadier Alexander (Henedi) refuses to accept this. The UNHCR  should do everything possible to save these people whose lives  are threatened in countries of asylum. Occasionally, the  refugees in Tanzania have been stopped by local authorities  there, to go back to their country. Some have had to pay bribes  and others robbed, so as to be allowed to cross the borders to  return home. It is a right of every person who seeks asylum in  another country to go back to his own country the moment he  feels that his life is no longer threatened. The Tanzanian  authorities therefore and the UNHCR should facilitate people who  want to go back to their country, instead of leaving them to be  killed by the very people they ran away from. The killing of  the Tutsi in refugee camps in neighboring countries is a plan by  the Hutu exteremists who through their radio RTLM  [Radio-Television Libre Des Milles Collines] call for the  extermination of the Tutsi and Hima [Tutsi clan] people in the  region. The authorities in refugee camps in Tanzania and  Burundi should crack down on these gangs of militias, apprehend  them, and bring to justice the criminals.     "
0,FT932-9906 ,"FT932-9906 _AN-DELCNAA7FT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Japan to reaffirm UN commitment      By ROBERT THOMSON      TOKYO   MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, is expected today to deliver a strong reaffirmation of the country's commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, as opposition demands for an immediate pull-out intensified. The Japanese government has been under extreme pressure since the killing last week of a civilian policeman in an ambush, and Mr Miyazawa has been advised to make an address that shows the government is both concerned about the safety of the peacekeepers and is committed to the UN operation. However, the National Police Agency, which has responsibility for the 75 civilian police officers sent to Cambodia, continued to argue yesterday with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) over the duties given to Japanese officers. Officials at the NPA say Japanese police, who are not carrying arms, have been given inappropriate responsibilities such as acting as bodyguards and, in some cases, have not been given sufficient water or provisions by the UN authorities. Relations between Untac and the NPA have been strained since about eight Japanese police officers returned to Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, without official approval after the killing of the Japanese officer. The police officers have since returned to their posts. A Japanese television news programme poll of 690 people last weekend found that 52 per cent believe the police and 600 military personnel should be withdrawn, while 37 per cent believe they should remain in the country. The killing of the officer has stirred debate over whether the conflict in Cambodia now fits the five principles which supposedly govern Japanese participation in international peacekeeping operations. One of those principles is that a ceasefire agreement is in place, and opposition parties say the Cambodian ceasefire has collapsed. Meanwhile, a six-member advance party left Tokyo yesterday for Mozambique, where 48 Japanese military personnel are due to assist in another UN operation. The other members of the group are due to leave before the end of this month and will co-ordinate transport operations. Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, yesterday suggested that China will not be a significant military threat to the region over the next five years, but he warned that the country's rapid economic growth could be accompanied by an expansion of military ambitions in about 20 years' time. In a meeting with Mr Toshio Nakayama, the director-general of Japan's Defence Agency, the prime minister said that the US-Japan-China triangular relationship had to remain stable to ensure that China had no incentive to build up its military capability.

I have received a variety of comments on this issue, which  is worth examination because of the place that Baghdad has  occupied in Arab literature. The names of al-Karkh and  al-Rasafah are mentioned in numerous creative works of verse and  in entertaining anecdotes. This is something that has aroused in  me the wish to tackle the various aspects of this issue, even if  with some brevity.    An interesting thing about the Arab conquerors is that  wherever they went, they took with them their nomadic character,  embodied in their camels, their date palms, and their Bedouin  traditions. They were eager to maintain their intellectual and  material contact with the desert. All peoples send their  children from the countryside to urbanized cities to learn  refined language and civilized ways, except for the Arabs, who  sent their children from urbanized cities to the desert to learn  refined language and the Bedouin ways of life. This is what the  Arabs did with the Apostle Muhammad, God's peace and prayers be  upon him, when they handed him over to Halimah al-Sa'diyah.    Arab Strategy    When the Arabs established their capitals, they located them  on the brink of the desert, as in the case of al-Basrah,  al-Kufah, Wasit, Damascus, and al-Ramlah. This was part of the  Arab strategy developed by Abu-Bakr, the first caliph, may God  be pleased with him, when he instructed his commanders not to  allow water to separate him from the Muslim armies. This  strategy was the secret behind the impregnable Arab power. If  Arabs wanted to raid the enemy, they could catch him. But if the  enemy wanted to raid them, they withdrew into the desert's  belly, and so he could not catch them.    In accordance with this strategy, Caliph Abu-Ja'far  al-Mansur  built his circular city, Baghdad--the city of peace. He chose  for it the western bank of the Tigris River, thus letting the  river stand as a defense line separating his capital from the  other peoples to the north and the east and leaving his back  open to the desert. This is the geographic position of the  al-Karkh side, or of al-Karkh when approached from Baghdad.    But Baghdad's growth compelled its inhabitants to move to  the  opposite side of the river, or in the direction of al-Rasafah.  Soon, this side became the bigger of the two. Nearly two  centuries later, the caliphs moved their palaces and their  governments to this side of the river and allowed the circular  city that had been built by al-Mansur to disintegrate and  collapse, and to let all traces of its walls disappear. There is  no doubt that the circular city was not big enough to  accommodate the capital of a major empire, which Baghdad was  destined to be.    The transfer of government from al-Karkh to al-Rasafah was  politically and humanly significant, denoting the transfer of  the center of influence from Arabs to non-Arabs. Consequently,  the Tigris River protected the city's southern and western  flanks from the desert (Arabs) and opened it from the north and  the east to Iran and Central Asia. From that time on, the caliph  became a toy in the hands of non-Arabs. Perhaps we can consider  the move to al-Rasafah to be one of the biggest military  mistakes committed by the Abbasides. Soon thereafter, Hulago  invaded Iraq and found nothing to obstruct his way to an open  Baghdad.    This geographic position of al-Karkh and al-Rasafah has had  an important impact that has continued to exist to this day and  that has played its role in our modern history. The al-Karkh  side has continued to be inclined toward the desert. It has also  been the home of Arabism and Islam, whereas al-Rasafah became a  cosmopolitan city (multinational, multireligious, and  multiethnic). It became a haven for non-Arabs and foreigners, a  playground for entertainment and a place of song, dance, and  opulent and sophisticated living. This is the situation  currently. There is hardly a non-Arab and non-Muslim home in  al-Karkh, whereas al-Rasafah is divided into varied cosmopolitan  quarters. It has the Christian Quarter, the Jewish Quarter, the  Kurdish Section, the Armenian Camp, and so forth.    Tolerance Versus Fanaticism    Lifestyles have also been divided along the above lines of  division. Al-Rasafah is characterized by tolerance, and al-Karkh  is characterized by clannishness and by clinging to tradition.  To this day, unveiled women have continued to avoid passing  through al-Karkh. When Salwa, my sister, went to visit our old  homes in al-Suq al-Jadid with her face unveiled, a storm of  protest rose against us, and my sister did not visit the area at  all for years. A similar storm rose when the quarter's  inhabitants noticed poet Naji al-Qashtini, my uncle, in a  carriage, with his unveiled wife sitting next to him.    We moved out of al-Karkh in the 1930s, which saw the start  of  the process of a class emigration. Many people, including my  father, may he rest in peace, noticed that the area's sternness  and clannishness were no longer compatible with the developments  of the time. So they sold their homes and moved to the new  development areas in al-A'zamiyah, al-Battawin, and al-Karradah.    However, the majority stayed. With time, al-Karkh turned  into  a stronghold of the advocates of pan-Arabism, such as  'Abd-al-Salam 'Arif, 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Arif, and Naji al-Suwaydi.    Inversely, leftist activity spread on the al-Rasafah side,  and it is from this side's school that numerous communist,  socialist, and democratic leaders graduated, such as Zaki  Muhammad Busaym and Husayn Jamil.    In 1958, 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim staged his coup, which resulted  a few days later in a bitter conflict between the Communist  Party and the Ba'th Party, and between the advocates of  separatism on the one hand and the advocates of Arab unity on  the other. In that conflict, Iraq, and the Arabs generally,  faced another chapter of the Karkh-Rasafah polarization.  'Abd-al-Karim Qasim, Wasfi Tahir, and al-Mahdawi were from  al-Rasafah and were supported by the advocates of regionalism  and the leftist philosophy. These men were countered by  'Abd-al-Salam 'Arif and al-Shawwaf from al-Karkh, and these two  were supported by the advocates of pan-Arabism and Arab unity.    There was some sort of a psychological conflict between the  two sides. Al-Rasafah people characterized al-Karkh people as  fanatic and savage, and al-Karkh people characterized the  Rasafah people as corrupt and dissolute. My father was from  al-Karkh and my mother from al-Rasafah. Whenever he got into an  argument or had a quarrel with her, he cursed the hour when he  married a woman from ""that direction,"" which is the phrase the  al-Karkh people give to the al-Rasafah side. They even refuse to  refer to al-Rasafah by name, calling it ""that direction.""    This bias is, in fact, a part of the lengthy historical  development of the city of al-Mansur and al-Rashid, and of the  inflow of non-Arab and non-Muslim peoples to the al-Rasafah  side, which is open to the north and the west, and the inflow of  the sons of Arab tribes to al-Karkh, the side that is open to  the south and the west, i.e., to the desert.    This explains why the people of Najd have persistently  emigrated to and landed on the al-Karkh side. This side is not  only the closest to them, but is also the side of Arabism,  Islam, Bedouin values, and an absence of the elements of  diversion that are found on the other side. This is the answer  to my question as to why the Najd people settled in al-Karkh and  avoided al-Rasafah.    We encounter the reverberations of this makeup even in the  city's economic life. One secret behind al-Rasafah's expansion  is the presence of craftsmen's markets and vocational markets on  this side, in addition to the presence of government offices and  courts, of course. This is confirmed by the names of some of  al-Rasafah's markets, such as the Goldsmiths Market, the Weavers  Market, the Brass Founders Market, the Tailors Market, and the  Cobblers Market. Arabs despise crafts and vocations.  Consequently, no significant presence of such markets is found  in al-Karkh. What one finds there are some crafts that are tied  to Bedouin life, such as articles needed for camels and horses;  Bedouin clothes, such as robes, gowns, and headgear; articles  needed for tents, and similar stuff that is sold in 'Alawi  al-Hillah.    One City    The two sides are not, of course, separated totally, because  they form one city. This city's caliphs and rulers have  constantly tied the two sides, first with one bridge and then  with two bridges, to which various modern governments added more  bridges. These bridges have played a major role in Baghdad's  social, literary, political, and even military life. Ibn Batutah  visited the city and referred to its two bridges, saying,  ""Baghdad has two bridges tied in the fashion we described when  we mentioned the al-Hillah Bridge. People, both men and women,  cross them day and night. In this regard, they are on an endless  picnic.""    From Ibn Batutah's description of the al-Hillah City Bridge,  we conclude that the Baghdad Bridge was built on a number of  vessels tied by iron chains to a wooden pole on each side, as he  says. As for his reference to an endless picnic, it reminds us  that the bridge area has continued to be to this day the area of  fashion, display, and watching. It is in this area that young  men watched young women. We conclude this from numerous literary  anecdotes.    It is said that 'Ali Ibn Jahm appeared before Caliph  al-Mutawakkil when he, 'Ali, had just arrived from the desert  and proceeded to praise the caliph with these coarse words:    ""You are like a dog in your loyalty and like a billy goat in  butting heads with difficulties;    ""You are like a bucket, may God preserve you for us, and  some  big buckets are full of sins.""    Al-Mutawakkil was a wise man, who realized the man's poetic  potential and who, at the same time, realized that Ibn Jahm  meant well and that he was praising him in the ways he was used  to paying tribute in his Bedouin life. So the caliph ordered  that Ibn Jahm be given a home on the bank of the Tigris, right  next to the bridge. He then summoned the poet six months later  and asked him to recite some of his verses. Ibn Jahm proceeded  to utter this verse, which is truly famous for its sweetness:    ""Deer's eyes between al-Rasafah and the bridge have hit me  with love from every direction.""    All this change only six months after watching the eyes of  Baghdad's women! A lot has been said about these women's beauty.  Ibn Batutah drew attention to this beauty when he said, ""Between  Baghdad's water and her air, feminine beauty arises."" About  Baghdad's women, one poet has said:    ""My heart yearns for its Baghdad and its Iraq; for its  gazelles and for the beauty in their eyes;    ""They strut in paradise as if platonic love were part of the  city's qualities.""    Narrators recount that a woman from the al-Rasafah side was  crossing to the western (al-Karkh) side when she was accosted by  a young man, who said to her, ""God's mercy be upon 'Ali Ibn  Jahm."" She responded, ""And may God's mercy be upon Abu-al-'Ala'  al-Mi'arri."" Then each went his way. People asked the man what  it was that he had said to make her give him this answer. He  said that he had asked God to have mercy on 'Ali Ibn Jahm, thus  reminding her of his verse, ""Deer eyes between al-Rasafah and  the bridge...."" She responded by asking God to have mercy on Abu  al-'Ala' al-Mi'arri, thus reminding him of al-Mi'arri's verse:    ""Oh how sad, she lives nearby, but the path to her home is  strewn with horrors!""    Thus, the Baghdad Bridge was a playground for lovers,  flirts,  and for perfume and medicine vendors; a meeting place for ulema  and jurisprudents; and a pavement for Koran reciters and  beggars. But even beggars were of a special kind, according to  Abu-Ja'far Muhammad Ibn Ja'far al-Bur'i who has said, ""I passed  by a beggar sitting on the bridge. He was saying, 'A poor blind  man.' I gave him a coin and said to him: 'You have wished me  nothing in return.' The beggar answered: 'For your charity, it  is: Have mercy.'    With time, the Baghdad Bridge gained extreme political and  military importance. Al-Mansur made the right strategic  calculations when he selected the location, considering that the  city is situated at the point that represents the shortest  distance between the Tigris and the Euphrates and at the center  of the route that separates the Syrian semidesert and Najd from  Kurdistan's mountains and Iran. For many centuries, the Baghdad  Bridge was the only crossing point between the eastern and  western sides of the Tigris. It is, of course, the crossing  point between al-Karkh and al-Rasafah, each of which represents  a human polarization point, as we have already pointed out.  Control of this bridge became a major mobilizational objective.  A number of skirmishes and battles were staged on this bridge,  and I was witness to some of them.    In the final days of Rashid 'Ali al-Kaylani's uprising in  May  1941, British forces approached the rebellious city. The Iraqi  military command hastened to fortify the bridge with some barbed  wire, machine guns, and one single, miserable tank. But the  bridge surrendered when al-Kaylani's government collapsed and  fled. The British then proceeded to open the route, through this  bridge, to send supplies to the Soviet Union.    The successive governments feared that the ""savage"" al-Karkh  people would cross into al-Rasafah (the seat of the government)  whenever a crisis developed. Thus, the government hastened to  secure the bridge with soldiers to prevent al-Karkh people from  crossing over when Rashid 'Ali al-Kaylani's government fell.    The Al-Farhud Operation    The al-Farhud operation erupted in Baghdad. As a result,  some  people were killed and their homes and shops were looted,  because they were considered sympathizers with the British. I  was in al-Karkh at the time. So, I came out to watch this  al-Farhud that was running in the direction of al-Rasafah. But  police detachments, which had been deployed on the bridge,  opened fire in the air in a desperate attempt to stop the  ""savage"" al-Karkh people from crossing over to al-Rasafah.    The same kind of operation recurred in the 1948 uprising  against the Iraqi-British friendship treaty (the Portsmouth  treaty). This time, I was on the al-Rasafah side, and I saw the  police open fire on the al-Karkh crowds, also to stop them from  crossing to al-Rasafah. Blood flowed copiously on the Baghdad  Bridge. One of the people killed in that incident was Ja'far  al-Jawahiri, the brother of poet Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri.  Ja'far's death was the occasion for a magnificent poem, of which  every educated Iraqi has memorized some verses:    ""Do you or do you not know that victims' wounds are a mouth;  A mouth that makes no claims and that asks for no mercy; A mouth  that tells the starving destitute: Sacrifice your blood, be  generous.""    I attended the funeral of Ja'far al-Jawahiri, and I heard  the  lines of people escorting the funeral reiterate in 'mass frenzy:'    ""It was on the bridge, on the bridge; the battle took place  on the bridge.""    This government fear of al-Karkh people has its historical  justifications. The al-Karkh side has often created problems for  the government, especially after numerous members of the 'Aqil  tribe settled in al-Karkh. In 1834, the 'Anzah tribe clashed  with the forces of 'Ali Rida Pasha, the Ottoman ruler, and  emerged from the battle triumphant. Consequently, the tribe  gained control of the entire area south and west of Baghdad and  camped in the area known as 'Akarkuf. As soon as the 'Aqil  tribe, which lived in al-Karkh, heard of the 'Anzah tribe's  victories against the Ottoman Army, it felt stronger and was  emboldened. So it rebelled against the ruler, took control of  the coffee shops overlooking the bridge, and cut off the bridge.  A heated, day-long battle then ensued between al-Karkh, which  was controlled by 'Aqil, and al-Rasafah, which was controlled by  the Ottoman forces. But the ruler's forces were not able to  prevail in that battle until they borrowed the British consul's  boat and used it as a military boat against the al-Karkh people.    In his book, ""Social Glimpses of Iraq's Modern History,"" Dr.  'Ali al-Wardi says, ""But something worse than the battle started  then. Soldiers rushed into the al-Karkh side to indulge in  whatever they wished to indulge in. So they plundered the  markets and set fire to them. Then they marched into homes and  started looting them. They then proceeded to violate women and  to offend them in indescribable ways. Women's screams could be  heard from the al-Rasafah side. In one scandal, an Albanian  soldier tried to rape a woman who resisted him, so he killed  her. The woman's body was taken to Shaykh 'Abd-al-Qadir  al-Kaylani's shrine and was deposited at the shrine's doorstep.  There, the head of Prophet Muhammad's descendants ordered that  she be buried as a martyr.""    A Little of What Baghdad's People Have Experienced    It seems that the al-Karkh side has also played the role of  safe haven and refuge for outlaws who have fled to the area and  from there to Bedouin tribes and to semidesert villages. Thus,  the authorities were unable to pursue and arrest them.    Saddam Husayn is, of course, considered a living example of  this fact. After he tried to assassinate 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim,  Saddam crossed to the al-Karkh side and fled from there to the  Arabian Peninsula and then to Damascus and Egypt. The same  happened with Mufti 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jamil Zadah, who led on 28 May  1832 the inhabitants of Qanbar Quarter of al-Rasafah in an armed  rebellion against the Ottoman ruler. At the time, Abu-al-Thana'  al-Alusi went to al-Karkh to urge its inhabitants to join the  rebellion. But the ruler's troops were able to suppress the  rebellion by turning their guns on Qanbar Quarter and setting it  afire. The soldiers then proceeded to loot the mufti's home and  to burn its library, which contained nearly 7,000 volumes.    When that uprising failed, the mufti crossed over to  al-Karkh  and took refuge with al-'Aqil tribe, which was able to smuggle  him, along with his companions, to the village of 'Anah on the  upper Euphrates River and the heights overlooking the Syrian  semidesert.    The Baghdad Bridge has witnessed momentous historical events  in its long history. It has its tragic aspect, which is embodied  in the massacres perpetrated on both its sides; in the  executions that have been carried out at its ends; and in the  suicides that some Baghdadi people (mostly women) commit by  jumping off the bridge into the river running under it. But the  bridge has its funny side also. Numerous jokes and anecdotes are  told about the bridge and about those who cross it, both man and  beast.    Escaped Bridge    Frequently, the violent flow of the Tigris River during the  flood days in the spring have torn the bridge away from its  moorings and dragged it downriver, with the people atop the  bridge screaming and imploring heaven for their safety and the  safety of their bridge. The bridge used to be carried away by  the current for long distances before the authorities could get  hold of it and return it to its location. People used to bring a  band to the river bank to play certain tunes that were supposed  to return the bridge to its place, as if this bridge were a  living creature who could hear their tunes and respond to their  call. The late Haqqi al-Shibli told me that he saw the unmoored  bridge pass through the al-Karradah Quarter with amazing speed.  Suddenly, a man standing on the drifting bridge gestured with  his hand and called Shibli at the top of his lungs, telling him,  ""O man whom I don't know and who doesn't know me, look at me and  tell my mother, may God have mercy upon your parents, that the  bridge got untied with her son on it and that he doesn't know  where he is going!""    Oh, what words with which to sum up the aimlessness in which  Baghdad's people have lived throughout their tragic history!     "

[passage  omitted] Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Juan Jose Rodil  Peralta issued a strong statement condemning the killing, which  adversely affects the state of law in Guatemala. Rodil Peralta  added this killing demonstrates those responsible for numerous  acts of violence in the past are still on the loose.    Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, said  she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car theft,  as certain versions have reported. She added there was no  attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their  weapons into the car, damaging it badly.    According to another version, unidentified gunmen were  following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where  they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's  home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior  minister. Gonzalez' body was taken to a funeral parlor, where  several people have come to express their condolences, including  lawyers, former magistrates, and other Guatemalan political  personalities. Gonzalez's funeral was scheduled for tomorrow,  after being honored at the Constitutionality Court.     "
0,FT944-9584 ,"FT944-9584 _AN-EKOENADWFT 941115   FT  15 NOV 94 / Survival of Irish coalition comes under growing threat      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   The survival of Ireland's Fianna Fail-led coalition government was under increasing threat last night, with senior government officials predicting its collapse. The crisis throws fresh doubt over the future pace of the Northern Ireland peace process. As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was outlining proposals to bring Ulster's loyalist groups into the talks process in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, was preparing for a parliamentary showdown today with his Labour party partners. The crisis, triggered by Labour's opposition to Mr Reynolds' proposed appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court, looks certain to end the 22-month coalition. Mr Reynolds was in consultation with his Fianna Fail ministers yesterday. If the crisis is unresolved and Mr Reynolds loses a vote of no confidence he could seek the permission of Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, to dissolve parliament, and call early elections. Alternatively, and some political observers believed this more likely yesterday, Mrs Robinson could ask the opposition parties to form a government with Labour. Mrs Robinson is understood to have taken legal advice yesterday. The prospective collapse of the Dublin government threatens to halt progress on the joint framework document being negotiated by the UK and Irish governments for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. But in a remark hinting at the possible break-up of the coalition, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and Labour leader, said: 'The momentum towards peace this opportunity offers as a prospect is beyond attack by any form of government or political party.' After a meeting with Mr Spring in Dublin yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that progress had been made, although he refused to be drawn on a date for completion of the framework document. The UK government aims to start exploratory talks with loyalist political representatives before the end of the year, Mr Major announced yesterday. Speaking in London, he confirmed that the government was ready to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, by the end of the year. His remarks were welcomed across the political divide in Ulster. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'These talks should happen as quickly as possible so that the preliminary elements can be dealt with.' However, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, described Mr Major's speech as 'wholly inadequate' and attacked him for 'still talking about talks'.

The operation started hours after the UN Security Council on  Wednesday gave lukewarm support to a two-month mission by  French-led troops to stop the ethnic carnage in the central  African nation.    French officials said none of the 2,500 French soldiers  assigned to Operation Turquoise had yet crossed into Rwanda,  where up to 500,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis have been  killed since the April 6 death of the president of Rwanda, a  Hutu, in an unexplained plane crash.    The UN Security Council authorized the mission, expected to  comprise 2,500 French troops and some Senegalese, to use all  means necessary to assure the protection of displaced people,  refugees and civilians in the African state.    The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front,  which  controls about two-thirds of the country, accuse France of  backing the government and have warned that they would consider  any French intervention as hostile.    The French officials said French forces were being ferried  to  the Zairean military bases of Goma and Bukavu near the Rwandan  border while French Air Force Jaguar planes were flown from the  Central African Republic to Kisangani airport in northeastern  Zaire in a support role.    French General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, who commands  Operation  Turquoise, left Paris late Wednesday to join his expeditionary  force, which includes 1,000 troops from France and 1,500  stationed in Gabon and Djibouti.    France said Wednesday that its soldiers would cross the  Rwandan border from Zaire starting Thursday morning on a  strictly humanitarian mission.    Thursday afternoon, between 500 and 600 men were to deployed  on Goma and Bukavu and the foray into the soutwestern Rwandan  region of Cyangugu will then be envisaged. France said 8,000  Tutsis were surrounded by Hutu-dominated government forces in  that region.    The UN Security Council also obliged the troops to be  impartial in the battle between majority Hutus and minority  Tutsis that erupted 2-1/2 months ago.    The vote was 10-0 with five countries abstaining: Brazil,  China, Nigeria, New Zealand and Pakistan.    The force would be deployed for a maximum of two months to  protect civilians from massacres until the arrival of  reinforcements for the UN Mission in Rwanda, which now has 500  soldiers and military advisers.    The Security Council last month passed a resolution  approving  the expansion of the UN mission by 5,000 peacekeepers. But a  lack of equipment and logistical support has delayed their  deployment.     "

It is remarkable that during this time it has not only  failed to adopt a single draft law regarding the pressing  problems currently facing Russia, but it has also failed to  submit any for examination. It is also symbolic that the Duma  began its session Friday with the issue of providing backup  services for its work. Deputy Nikolay Travkin reproached his  colleagues with the fact that ""having received 800,000 rubles  each,"" they have been in no hurry to get down to lawmaking work.    Another ""anniversary"" observation. Joint sessions begin with  ""warm-up sessions"" or discussions of the agenda lasting two  hours or 90 minutes. As a rule, these are a kind of ""stream of  consciousness"" during which it is possible to hear political  statements, outbursts directed at arch-opponents, and comments  on the business in hand. However, having worn out their nerves  and wasted time on sorting out the agenda, its subsequent  implementation is never brought to a conclusion. The same  proposals are submitted at the next session all over again to be  accompanied by the same discussion.    Basically, the Duma is being dragged into discrediting  itself. It sometimes seems that certain forces are doing this  deliberately. It is not at all hard to lead the nervous  parliamentary audience on.    Thus on Friday 90 minutes were devoted to the agenda. It was  not until midday that the deputies addressed legislative issues  directly. These included the draft decree on the amnesty in  connection with the adoption of the Russian Federation  Constitution. In accordance with a decision made by the  deputies, the issue of a general political and economic amnesty  has also been submitted for examination. The issue chiefly  involves the defendants in the State Committee for the State of  Emergency case and people who are currently being investigated  following their arrest in the events of October 1993. This is  the first category. The second includes people who have received  jail terms for economic crimes which are no longer considered  offenses.    The State Duma's draft decree ""On an Amnesty in Connection  With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution""  proposes, among other things, that ""defendants who have  performed military service in operational armies and combined  units and taken part in hostilities in defense of the Motherland  or while performing military duties in connection with this"" are  to be let off. Moreover, a general pardon awaits men and women  above the age of 60 and first and second category invalids. The  list of names eligible for an amnesty is fairly wide. The only  people to whom the state's mercy does not extend are recidivists  and murderers.     "

To prove her case, the prosecutor produced a neighbor who had witnessed part of  the incident and two veterinarians, including one who had examined the carcass.

This  phenomenon should be dealt with firmly and decisively by the  security agencies. The reason for this is that any person who  takes revenge for what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque by  stabbing a foreign tourist is harming an innocent human being  and rendering a service to Israel and Zionist gangs.    If those who carry out such attacks knew the extent of  sympathy the Hebron massacre has evoked in the United States,  and even Japan, they would definitely feel guilty and come to  the conclusion that they have unwittingly rendered a service to  our enemies. When an ordinary citizen in Europe and the United  States hears that a foreign tourist was stabbed in an Amman  street, or in any other Arab country, he will be more responsive  to Zionist propaganda portraying us as killers and terrorists.    It is not true that every Westerner is our enemy and  Israel's  friend. World public opinion has shifted greatly in favor of  our cause. The intifadah in the occupied territory has opened  the eyes of Westerners to the reality of matters in our region.  European and U.S. citizens are now aware that Zionist  propaganda is misleading and that Israel is a racist,  suppressive state.    It is totally unacceptable that foreigners and tourists in  our country should be targets for spontaneous, emotional  reactions whenever Israel commits a massacre in Palestine. We  should launch a media campaign using television, radio, and the  press to warn against these odious actions that harm our cause  and substantiate Zionist propaganda against us in Western  nations.    Those who regard an attack on an innocent tourist -- whose  true feelings and sympathies are known only to God -- as a  heroic act should follow the example of the occupied territory.  No foreign tourist has ever been attacked in the West Bank and  Gaza, even when clashes and confrontations are raging, save what  happens by mistake. This is why the presence of foreign  journalists and tourists has been utilized in the interest of  the struggling Palestinian people and against Israel and the  Israeli troops.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has elicited sorrow and sadness  not just from those who attacked foreign tourists and others  they thought were foreign tourists; all our people were deeply  moved and were in tears over this massacre. However, they  expressed their sadness and sorrow by staging demonstrations,  making donations, or praying for the mercy of the martyrs. They  did not resort to unacceptable reactions, as did those who  attacked our foreign guests.     "

And, predicted the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce, the number of private firms in the country could reach  more than 300,000, up 26 percent from last year.    ""But, private businesses are now more at the mercy of  outside  interference,"" said an official with the administration's  Department of Individual and Private Enterprises.    Private businesses have become a major source of State  revenue, and to protect them China should promptly deal with the  many difficulties they face, said the official, who declined to  be named.    He noted that the country is awaiting more stringent  official  tax policies on self-employed businessmen and privately owned  firms.    The administration believes there are many arbitrary levies  on private businesses.    Besides the regular income taxes levied by the State  Administration of Taxation, private businesses in some provinces  must pay at least 100 other assessments by other official  departments.    These practices create a heavy financial burden on daily  business operations.    Such charges -- often in the name of improving urban  infrastructure, transportation and management -- often exceed  taxes owed to the State.    ""The government should ban these financial levies while  strengthening the management of tax collection from private  businessmen and individual firms,"" the official noted.    By doing so, cash-starved local governments can raise enough  revenue to develop their local economies.    However, some local governments prefer to impose extra  levies  on private businesses instead of improving tax collection, said  analysts with the Ministry of Internal Trade.    Such practices have left many loopholes for some individual  businessmen and privately owned firms to evade taxes, they added.    The State Administration for Industry and Commerce would not  release figures on tax evasion by individual businesses.    However, it does claim that the tax levies on individual  businessmen and private firms are much better than its  expectations.    The administration's figures show that self-employed  businessmen and privately owned firms turned over to the State  more than 29.3 billion yuan ($3.37 billion) in taxes last year,  up 6.3 billion yuan ($724 million) from 1992.    At present, the State Administration of Taxation levies  income taxes only on self-employed businessmen, and the tax  treatment it applies to individual business firms is the same as  that for State enterprises.    By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million  individual business households, up 15.2 percent from a year  earlier.    It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 percent.

Flanagan, a male prostitute who turned to killing homosexuals, was  executed by lethal injection early today, mouthing his last words, ""I love  you,"" to the district attorney who prosecuted him for two murders.    Flanagan, 28, a homosexual foamer Marine, sang hymns and read the Bible before  being led to the execution room at Nevada State Prison, where he died of lethal  injection 12 minutes after the drugs were administered at 2 a.m.    In the front row of witnesses to the execution was Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan  Seaton, who had prosecuted Flanagan for the killing of two homosexual men in  Las Vegas.    Flanagan was strapped to a table but lifted his head to mouth the words, ""You  are a just man,"" to Seaton and then told him ""I love you.""    Seaton said Flanagan had asked him not to come to the execution, but the deputy  district attorney said it was his duty to ""observe the ultimate effects of  prosecution.""    The prosecutor said Flanagan, a self-proclaimed ""born-again"" Christian, would  ""kill more homosexuals if he ever got out.""

0,FT933-15397 ,"FT933-15397 _AN-DGICIAAZFT 930709   FT  09 JUL 93 / Hunger strike Serb in danger      By LAURA SILBER   A TEAM of doctors appointed by the Serbian government yesterday appealed to the authorities for the 'urgent release' of jailed opposition leader Vuk Draskovic 'in order to avoid a fatal outcome'. The condition of Mr Draskovic, on hunger strike for the past week, was 'rapidly deterioriating' and there were fears for his life, the doctors warned in a letter to a Belgrade court. They said they could not be held responsible for his health if he and his wife Danica, jailed on June 1 after street protests left one policeman dead, were not released. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has rebuffed international appeals for the release of Mr Draskovic, who was beaten badly by police during his arrest. But the Serb leader may now choose to release Serbia's most popular opposition politician rather than risk unrest in the event of his death. The deterioration in Mr Draskovic's health came as Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, the international peace mediators, arrived in Belgrade to urge leaders of warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems to end bloodshed in Bosnia. They met Mr Milosevic and his federal Yugoslav counterpart after talks on Wednesday with Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president. Asked what would happen if all three sides failed to reach agreement by July 20, a deadline set by Bosnian Serb leaders for Moslems to back the republic's partition on ethnic lines, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'If we don't find a compromise by that date, I fear an intensification of the war.' Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has warned that his forces would push for total defeat of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army if partition is rejected. But Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic indicated yesterday his people might have to accept a three-way partition of the country if this was imposed on them and if the alternative was war without end. In a radio interview, Mr Izetbegovic said: 'Bosnia is not going to commit suicide,' apparently ruling out a fight to the finish. Bosnia's Moslems are confined to isolated pockets at the mercy of their Serb and Croat enemies. Serb commanders have all but stopped the flow of overland aid to Sarajevo, without water and electricity for the past month. The World Health Organisation said hospital services in Sarajevo were on the brink of collapse and warned of an impending catastrophe on a scale unseen in Europe 'since the dark days of the second world war'. Five independent international aid agencies said Sarajevo's 380,000 residents were 'reverting to the most desperate measures to stay alive'.   Countries:-  YUZ  Yugoslavia, East Europe.

0,FT944-3644 ,"FT944-3644 _AN-ELMDEAE6FT 941212   FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: More progress for '95 less and less likely - London      By STEVE THOMPSON   Any market that can survive relatively intact after a week which included news of a significant defeat for the government in the House of Commons, a half percentage point rise in UK interest rates, a mini-budget featuring big tax increases in consumer areas, and the threat of another base rate rise in the US has to have very solid foundations. Whether the UK equity market can build on such solid ground in the short term is another thing. More than ever, markets appear to be at the mercy of a Wall Street showing increasing volatility and being hit by a succession of hammer blows. With each blow confidence is draining away from Wall Street and worries about the US are gnawing at London's fragile grip on the 3,000 level. Not even the prospect of a bid battle triggered by the merger discussions between two of the financial world's biggest names - SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley - could check stock market slides across Europe on Friday. The woes affecting Wall Street last week came from three different directions. First, Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, one of the biggest mutual funds in the world with assets of Dollars 35bn, said it would not make a year-end distribution to its 3m investors, causing ripples of unease across world markets. Second, the local authority in Orange County, California, filed for bankruptcy, prompting fears that it may be forced to liquidate its Dollars 20bn bond portfolio. Third, and most importantly, the prospects of another interest rate rise in the US grew strongly after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the US economy was growing faster than expected and that the financial markets apparently still doubted the Fed's determination to fight inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee meets on December 20 and Mr Greenspan's remarks can only be interpreted as a strong indication that US rates will rise again, only a month after the last increase. The response in London to the government's defeat over the second stage of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and the subsequent interest rate rise was impressive, as it was initially to the increases in taxes on alcohol, tobacco and fuel. However, with the Conservative government lurching from crisis to crisis and Wall Street unnerving even those with the strongest of constitutions, it is looking increasingly unlikely that UK equities can make much progress before the end of the year. Unless of course, there are more big bids in the pipeline and the Warburg saga developes into something of an auction.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft was on a flight from Karachi to Kathmandu. It lost contact 10 minutes before it was due to land and crashed 22km from the airport, Pakistani officials said. The passenger list included at least 34 Britons, 30 Spaniards, 14 Dutch, 10 Italians, two Swiss, two Canadians, one Japanese and three Americans. The aircraft also carried 30 Nepalese, two Bangladeshis, and 30 Pakistanis. Pakistani civil aviation staff are due to arrive in Kathmandu today to investigate. It was the second Airbus crash near Kathmandu within two months. On July 31, a Thai Airways A310-300 hit a Himalayan ridge after trying to land at the airport, killing all 113 people on board. Kathmandu airport is one of the world's more difficult airports for pilots. They have to descend steeply to the runway to avoid the surrounding mountains. The airport has no radar and aircraft are guided in by radio beacon. However, Mr Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, deputy chief at the airport, was quoted as saying that the crash occurred in scattered clouds and moderate winds. The pilot had given no indication of any problem. Yesterday's was the A300 model's first fatal accident, although there have been four previous crashes including a training accident in Egypt and a runway overshoot in India. A fifth A300, owned by Iran, was shot down by the USS Vincennes over the Gulf in 1988, killing 290 people. The A300, introduced in 1974, was the first aircraft type built by Airbus. It is a wide-bodied twin-engined aircraft capable of flying up to about 8,000km, the distance from New York to Istanbul. The crashed PIA model was one of the first built, taking to the air for the first time in 1976. PIA bought it in 1986. The design of the A300 bears little resemblance to that of the A320 model which has crashed three times, including once in France last year, and whose computerised controls have attracted criticism from some pilots.

Earlier reports released by the  security forces said that the assassination attempt was carried  out by two gunmen.    Moreover, the security forces have announced the killing of  16 members of armed groups and the arrest of 43 other persons in  the past two days. The same source added that the operations  took place in Boumerdes, Blida, Tipaza, Jijel, Batna, and  Algiers provinces.

I had been intending to spend some time here, resting, and  undergoing some routine medical examinations, but the start of  fighting in the brotherly Yemen, and due to what I have been  watching and hearing from the media channels, my heart bleeds  with sorrow and sadness because of my acquaintance with the  Yemeni leadership, people, and clans, and because of old  friendship bonds.    I personally served Yemen and worked for its' development  and  encouraged its' leaderships, morally and financially, to advance  the Yemeni people.    In front of this painful event that is sweeping Yemen, my  personal comfort has diminished and I have decided to return to  my headquarters to be at the disposal of the custodian of the  two holy mosques and his crown prince, who are in constant and  serious contact with their brethren kings, princes, and  presidents of Arab countries in order to save Yemen from this  painful fate, from the abyss it is sliding into. In particular,  the Yemeni people, who have worked to build this unity between  the two parts, which was blessed by Saudi Arabia when it was  established with a positive spirit and in anticipation of a  better future.    When disputes surfaced we were not surprised because  brothers  and friends disagree. But when the language of dialogue stops  between brothers and the brothers resort to bloodshed, killing,  wasting energies, and destroying the achievements -- which the  Yemeni people attained with great difficulties -- to settle  their differences, it then becomes a matter that brings sadness  for every Arab and Muslim and bleeds the hearts that love Yemen,  the country that we all love and appreciate.    I beseech God from the bottom of my heart to enlighten the  brothers in Yemen to solve their differences by resorting to  reason, logic, and dialogue aimed at serving Yemen's interests  and sons. [passage omitted]    He said Yemen had high hopes in the Kingdom under the  leadership of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, as well as in Egypt  under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and all Arab  leaders to find an urgent solution to stop the bloodshed and  restore purity to Yemen.

The Arab  countries should reconsider their stance on Iraq based on  accurate, logical, rational, and long-term calculations to serve  the Arab nation's interests, and even the interests of the  neighboring countries that have been subjected to aggression  from the current Iraqi regime.    After more than three years since the Gulf War, which led to  the collapse of the old Arab system without bringing down the  Iraqi regime, and in view of the failure of all efforts to  establish a new system capable of assimilating Arab and  international changes, it is necessary for the Arab world to  look for other ways to bring the Iraqi regime back into the  fold. The Arab world should not leave Iraq in its isolation at  the mercy of the international forces, primarily the United  States and Britain, which seek to use the current situation for  their own interests.    What happened at the UN Security Council recently indicates  that the international alliance, which was opposed to Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait and also encouraged Saddam Husayn and  provided him with weapons and nuclear capability that made him  the bully of the Gulf, has been beset by clear rifts. These  rifts appeared in the differences among the Security Council  members over the statement that it releases periodically on the  extent of Iraq's compliance with Resolution 715 on subjecting  its military resources to international supervision, which is a  condition for lifting international sanctions.    France, Russia, and the PRC believe that there is a need to  note in the statement the ""progress"" Iraq made in destroying  banned arms instead of issuing the usual arbitrary statement on  which the United States and Britain insist, a statement that  maintains that Iraq has not complied with all the necessary  conditions to lift the sanctions. By insisting on this usual  statement the United States and Britain seek to achieve goals to  entrench the current division of the Arab world, a division that  will only increase Iranian influence and deepen suspicions and  fragmentation within the Gulf Cooperation Council itself.    The United States usually uses the stick and carrot in its  dealings, even with North Korea, but it only uses the stick with  Iraq. France and Russia believe that ""encouraging"" Iraq by  giving it time to watch its behavior and note its progress will  motivate it to cooperate in all areas, notably recognition of  the state of Kuwait.    It is strange indeed that when foreign countries are seeking  to ""normalize"" ties with Iraq, the Arab countries, which are  racing to normalize ties with Israel, find no justification to  even consider reaching a minimum level of normalization with  Iraq.

By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Among the spiritual leaders of Hare Krishna, embittered former member Stephen  Bryant was considered a dangerous man. Outfitted with a rifle, a computer and a  small bed, the 33-year-old Bryant traveled the country in his van, writing and  preaching attacks on the Hindu religious sect.    It was feared that the zealous Bryant might harm, even kill, the swamis who ran  Hare Krishna temples in Moundsville, W. Va., and West Los Angeles.    But late one night in 1986, death ended Bryant's crusade. While seated in his  van only blocks from the West Los Angeles temple, he was shot twice in the head  with a .45-caliber handgun. Police later arrested Thomas Drescher, now 42, a  lifelong Krishna devotee who has acknowledged conducting a long odyssey of  secret surveillance against Bryant.    Drescher's murder trial, which resumes Monday in Van Nuys Superior Court,  presents a tale of treachery and espionage that crisscrosses state lines, from  tiny motels in Ohio to abandoned mine shafts in California's Apple Valley. The  death penalty case also raises questions about the granting of immunity from  prosecution because the three key witnesses against Drescher came forward only  under protection from the law.    One of those witnesses, defense attorneys claim, is the more likely killer,  based on the scant evidence.    ""The prosecution has not only given immunity to the wrong person, but the wrong  person is on trial and you should ask yourself why,"" defense attorney Madelynn  Kopple told jurors this week in opening statements. ""There may be a dead body  and there may be a number of immunized witnesses. But what you don't have in  this case . . . (are) eyewitnesses.    ""You will not see or hear anything about fingerprints in this case . . . or  hear anything about hair samples, for example. You will not see a murder  weapon. There was no murder weapon found.""    The case against Drescher is based largely on the detailed accounts of men who  knew him during the weeks he tracked Bryant. Those witnesses -- including a  onetime Krishna security guard in Los Angeles named Jeffrey Breier -- say  Drescher carefully plotted Bryant's assassination and scouted the secluded mine  shafts as a possible place to dump the body.    It is alleged that Drescher was to receive $8,000 for killing Bryant in order  to protect the swami Bahktipada, whose 4,000-acre site in West Virginia was one  of the largest Hare Krishna temples in the United States.    However, defense attorney Barry Levine said a witness who lived near the murder  scene will testify to seeing a sports car speed away just after the shots were  heard -- a car more similar to Breier's Alfa Romeo than to Drescher's rented  four-door Chevrolet.    Breier, who lived in a one-room apartment at the temple in West Los Angeles,  was paid to protect the swami Rameswar, who was considered another possible  target of Bryant's anger.    Bryant had lived at the West Virginia temple for several years in the early  1980s and blamed the Krishnas for the breakup of his marriage. He attracted  publicity in West Virginia for his allegations that the temple there was  involved in drug abuse and prostitution. And he later expanded his campaign to  the temple in West Los Angeles.    Levine said gun records will be introduced to show that Breier owned three  .45-caliber pistols. Yet when questioned by police who considered him a  suspect, Breier turned over only one of the .45s, Levine said, telling  detectives that at least one of the others had been stolen.    ""We can prove that Tom Drescher was not in L.A. at the time of the shooting,""  Levine said in an interview. But the defense attorney declined to specify where  Drescher was or how soon he left town before the May 22, 1986, slaying.    Those surprises, he said, will be unveiled as the trial unfolds.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris downplayed the defense evidence and  characterized the claims of wrongful immunity as a ""common defense strategy.""    ""We feel very confident from our evidence that Breier is not the killer,""  Norris said. ""We had a substantial case on Drescher before we ever arrived at  the point of granting immunity to Breier. Breier was just a piece of the  puzzle.""    Norris said one key witness against Drescher will be a former West Virginia  steelworker named Randall Gorby, who testified at length under immunity during  a 1989 preliminary hearing and later committed suicide.    Gorby, whose earlier testimony will be read to the jury, was not a Hare Krishna  but was closely associated with the temple in West Virginia. Defense attorneys,  citing his suicide, questioned Gorby's reliability and called him an ""emotional  and psychiatric misfit in this world.""    Gorby testified that he had known Drescher since 1983. Drescher, once a  spiritual master at the West Virginia temple -- his Krishna name was Tirtha  Swami -- had called Gorby in 1986 to ask a favor: Would he travel to a small  motel near his home in Ohio to help find Bryant? After doing so, Gorby was met  at the motel by Drescher and another Krishna.    ""They explained to me . . . that they had been trailing him,"" Gorby testified.    In separate cars, Gorby said, the three men followed Bryant to Wheeling, W.  Va., where Bryant stepped into a building housing FBI offices. As Gorby waited  outside in his car, Drescher walked over and joined him.    ""(Drescher) said: 'That son of a bitch is going to the police and he is going  to have to be killed, and I am the one that is going to do it,' "" Gorby said.  ""I did not want that type of activity . . . on my conscience,"" he said.    Gorby did not notify authorities but said he tried to prevent a killing by  having Bryant arrested for making threats against the Hare Krishna. That night,  police arrested Bryant after finding him with a loaded .45-caliber gun. He was  convicted of illegal gun possession and spent several weeks in jail.    Meanwhile, Drescher showed up in West Los Angeles, according to Breier. ""He  said that he was tracking (Bryant) for a long time and that he wanted to kill  him,"" Breier recalled. ""He was looking for help.""    Breier said he agreed to watch for Bryant in Los Angeles and accompanied  Drescher to Apple Valley to look at boarded-up mine shafts as a possible burial  place.    On May 17, after Bryant's release from jail, Gorby got a call from Drescher,  who was traveling to West Virginia. According to Gorby, Drescher was on his way  to pick up $2,500 from a man at the temple.    ""(Drescher) told two different stories at that time about the $2,500,"" Gorby  said in his testimony. ""One, the original story, was that it was (for) ongoing  expenses that had been incurred in the trailing of Stephen Bryant. And then he  said it was a partial payment of $8,000 that had been negotiated sometime  previously with members of the community for killing Stephen Bryant.""    Gorby said he tried to talk Drescher out of the killing -- successfully, he  thought. But a new development interceded: Breier spotted Bryant's van in Los  Angeles. Word was relayed to Drescher.    Two days later, Drescher was in Los Angeles asking to see the van. Breier said  he met Drescher and they traveled in separate cars to a neighborhood near  Venice Boulevard and the Santa Monica Freeway, where they met near the van.    ""He (Drescher) was putting bullets into the (gun),"" Breier said. ""I thought  maybe that was for his protection because . . . the speculation among ourselves  was that (Bryant) had a gun also.""    Breier said he left the scene about 9 p.m. because he was due to start his  night shift at the temple. Witnesses reported hearing shots soon after  midnight.    Gorby said he heard from Drescher after the shooting. The two met near  Youngstown, Ohio. ""Tom said he had flown to California, that he had decided to  go ahead and kill Bryant,"" Gorby said.    Gorby said he tipped authorities. But he implicated Drescher not only in  Bryant's murder; he also named Drescher in the 1983 killing of former Krishna  member Charles St. Denis, who had been shot and stabbed.    West Virginia state police arrested Drescher on May 27 -- five days after  Bryant's murder. The arrest, however, was for the death of St. Denis.    The Bryant investigation was continuing. Gorby was to meet again with police on  May 28 to provide further information. That morning, as Gorby stepped out of  bed, an explosion devastated his home.    ""I . . . started to light a cigarette and my home totally disappeared,"" Gorby  said later. ""It was leveled to the ground.""    Gorby spent more than a month in a coma. Even so, charges were filed against  Drescher in the Bryant murder, and an accused accomplice in the St. Denis  killing agreed to testify under immunity.    Ultimately, Drescher was sentenced to life without parole in a West Virginia  prison for murdering St. Denis. Defense attorney Levine declined to discuss  details of that case except to call the trial a ""kangaroo court.""    ""What they really did,"" Levine said, ""was to use the St. Denis arrest as a ruse  to get (Drescher) into custody for the Bryant killing."" Authorities were afraid  he would flee the country.    According to defense lawyers, Breier had as much motive as Drescher for killing  Bryant because of his role in protecting the West Los Angeles swami Rameswar.  If Breier is innocent, Levine asked, then why was a sports car similar to his  seen speeding from the neighborhood?    In testimony at the preliminary hearing, Breier conceded being in the  neighborhood, Levine said. But he claimed he was only curious about the crime.  ""He was afraid that somebody saw him. . . . (He) had to account for his vehicle  being seen.""

By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Among the spiritual leaders of Hare Krishna, embittered former member Stephen  Bryant was considered a dangerous man. Outfitted with a rifle, a computer and a  small bed, the 33-year-old Bryant traveled the country in his van, writing and  preaching attacks on the Hindu religious sect.    It was feared that the zealous Bryant might harm, even kill, the swamis who ran  Hare Krishna temples in Moundsville, W. Va., and West Los Angeles.    But late one night in 1986, death ended Bryant's crusade. While seated in his  van only blocks from the West Los Angeles temple, he was shot twice in the head  with a .45-caliber handgun. Police later arrested Thomas Drescher, now 42, a  lifelong Krishna devotee who has acknowledged conducting a long odyssey of  secret surveillance against Bryant.    Drescher's murder trial, which resumes Monday in Van Nuys Superior Court,  presents a tale of treachery and espionage that crisscrosses state lines, from  tiny motels in Ohio to abandoned mine shafts in California's Apple Valley. The  death penalty case also raises questions about the granting of immunity from  prosecution because the three key witnesses against Drescher came forward only  under protection from the law.    One of those witnesses, defense attorneys claim, is the more likely killer,  based on the scant evidence.    ""The prosecution has not only given immunity to the wrong person, but the wrong  person is on trial and you should ask yourself why,"" defense attorney Madelynn  Kopple told jurors this week in opening statements. ""There may be a dead body  and there may be a number of immunized witnesses. But what you don't have in  this case . . . (are) eyewitnesses.

The army denied that their foes had seized control of a  stretch of the road from Kigali to Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25  miles) to the southwest. But Abdul Kabia, executive director of  the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, said the rebel Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) had cut the road as they tightened their  grip on Kigali, which they have sealed off on three sides.  Kabia said government forces now controlled only the western  part of Kigali and the rebels were trying to sever their supply  lines.    The RPF, dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe that has  borne  the brunt of six weeks of bloodletting in which 200,000 people  have been butchered, claimed responsibility Monday for shooting  at an army-escorted convoy carrying former French humanitarian  minister Bernard Kouchner on a mercy mission. [passage omitted  covered in referent items]    Kouchner left Rwanda on Monday after spending five days  trying to persuade both sides to allow civilians trapped in the  capital and still being massacred by death squads to leave via  ""humanitarian safe corridors"" which he wants the army and rebels  to keep free from fighting.    Kouchner was still trying to secure an agreement to begin  evacuating civilians Monday, but UN sources said his mission  could still produce results.    Sporadic firefights broke out in different areas of Kigali  on  Monday as rain lashed the surrounding hills, once green with  banana trees but now brown and barren, stripped by hungry  displaced people. It was a relatively quiet day after 10 days of  fierce artillery duels, said UN spokesman Moctar Gueye, who was  slightly hurt when bullet fragments struck his face during the  attack on Kouchner's convoy. ""Everyone's waiting,"" Gueye said.    The UN has protested to the rebels over the shooting, and  has  also complained to the army over its failure ""to ensure the  security"" of Kouchner.    The UN Security Council is preparing to approve  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for the UN force in  Rwanda to be increased to 5,500, according to reports from New  York. [passage omitted]    French officials said several African countries including  Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria were willing to contribute troops to  a strengthened UN force.    Eleven UN peacekeepers have been killed in the past six  weeks  in Rwanda, 10 of them Belgian soldiers allegedly murdered by the  presidential guard.    Most of the 200,000 Rwandans butchered with machetes or  clubbed to death with wooden stakes were Tutsis or opposition  supporters from the majority Hutu tribe.     "

By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A judge on Tuesday convicted Timothy Scott Roman of involuntary manslaughter in  the 1986 bludgeoning death of his mother, actress Susan Cabot, famed for her  roles in B-movies and her romance with Jordan's King Hussein.    However, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp declined to find  Roman guilty of murder. She said there is no evidence that Roman premeditated  bludgeoning Cabot to death with a barbell in the Encino home they shared.  Premeditation would have been required to prove murder.    ""There is no question that the defendant loved his mother very much,"" said  Schempp, who presided over Roman's six-day, non-jury trial. Cabot, 59, was  found dead across her bed in a blood-soaked nightgown on the night of Dec. 10,  1986. She had been clubbed repeatedly on the head.    The verdict was delivered just 10 minutes after closing arguments, which lasted  less than an hour. One of Roman's two attorneys ushered him out of the  courtroom through a rear exit immediately afterward. His grandmother said she  and Roman are ""just overjoyed at the verdict.""    ""Oh, what we have gone through. Timothy and I are just drained,"" said Elizabeth  Roman, who sat through her grandson's trial. ""It's time to start a whole new  life. We are taking him away from this area, this town.""    Roman, a 25-year-old former art student, could receive a maximum sentence of  four years and a minimum sentence of probation. Since he has already spent  about 2 1/2 years in jail, he could conceivably have enough credits for good  behavior and jail work to have fulfilled his sentence, officials said. Schempp  scheduled sentencing for Nov. 29.    ""It was an extremely tough call for the judge to have to make,"" said the  prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone.    Stone originally was seeking a murder conviction but asked Schempp in closing  arguments to convict Cabot of voluntary manslaughter, an unlawful killing  without malice but with intent to kill. Stone said he decided to seek  conviction on the lesser offense late last week after hearing the defense case  and deciding Roman did not act with premeditation.    Richard P. Lasting and Michael V. White, Roman's attorneys, did not dispute  that Roman killed his mother. However, they asked Schempp to acquit Roman or  find him guilty only of involuntary manslaughter, which is unlawful killing  without malice or intent. They contended that Cabot provoked the killing with  aggressive, irrational behavior and that Roman's actions were caused by  hormones and drugs he took because he did not have a pituitary gland.    Born a dwarf, Roman's growth to his present height of 5 feet, 4 inches was  induced with thrice-weekly injections of a hormone derived from the pituitary  glands of cadavers. A former attorney once called him ""a failed human  experiment."" The attorney claimed the experimental treatments caused aberrant  behavior.    Schempp said she was swayed by testimony that Cabot was deeply depressed,  suicidal and suffering from increasing mental deterioration in the days before  her death.    Schempp particularly cited the testimony of Cabot's longtime psychologist that  his 50-minute sessions with the actress were so emotionally draining that he  felt sorry for Roman, whom he surmised constantly lived with Cabot's fears.    Schempp also noted her shock at a videotape showing the slovenly, unkempt  condition of Cabot's Encino house. The tape and testimony showed the house to  be littered with newspapers that were three to four years old and spoiled food.    ""It was beyond my imagination that a person of such success and notoriety at  one time could live in such indescribable conditions,"" Schempp said.    During the trial, Roman testified that his mother seemed not to recognize him  and was screaming, talking to herself and calling for her mother on the night  of the killing. When Roman tried to call paramedics, he testified, his mother  attacked him with a weight bar and scalpel.    Roman said he later found Cabot dead but does not remember killing her. He  admitted lying to police, telling them a burglar in a Ninja mask had killed his  mother, and said he hid the barbell and scalpel because he didn't think anyone  would believe his story.    Roman, who has been free since June on $25,000 bail and living with his  grandmother in Los Angeles, had faced a maximum sentence of life in prison.    In May, Schempp granted Roman a mistrial about a month into the proceedings  after his attorney, Chester Leo Smith, was admitted to a hospital with what  were said to be stress-related heart problems.    Had he not bowed out, Roman's family had vowed to fire the attorney for, among  other things, revealing to jurors that Roman had confessed to police that he  killed his mother. The information otherwise would have been excluded from the  jury since Roman had asked to have a lawyer present before confessing.

By CHRIS ANGELO, ASSOCIATED PRESS      ESCOBILLA, Mexico      Hosts of olive ridley turtles crawl from the pounding surf, in a season more  peaceful than the last, to lay their eggs on a beach that stretches to the  horizon.    Olive ridleys were butchered by the tens of thousands a year ago, but in May  the government forbade the killing.    Fishing boats no longer prowl the waters off the main nesting beach. The  slaughterhouse 12 miles away is silent and abandoned, its roof collapsed inside  the concrete-block walls.    Not all the danger is gone, however.    Biologists working out of a nearby camp still race egg thieves to the nests.  Authorities recently confiscated 944 skins, representing half as many dead  turtles, in a village up the coast known in the past for clandestine slaughter.    Fishermen who lived by killing sea turtles have few alternatives.    Those in the cooperative at San Agustinillo, where the slaughterhouse sits  derelict, were well off last season. Now they wonder how to feed their  families.    ""We all know the ecologists have money to take food home every day without any  problem, and they've put us on a diet,"" Silverio Alvarez said of the pressure  to stop the killing of sea turtles.    By all accounts, there are more turtles this year -- in part because of the ban  and in part, it seems, because it is just a good year for turtles.    ""I think I could definitely say the death toll has decreased,"" said Georgita  Ruiz, a veterinarian who has studied turtles for 13 years.    ""There are more turtles nesting on the beach than in previous years. They have  natural surges in nesting activity, but I think it's logical that if there  isn't as much disturbance where they're going to nest, you're going to see  more.""    She added, however: ""People are still people and they're still hungry. They're  going to beg, borrow, steal or kill to get what they need.""    Ruiz runs the Pronatura conservation organization's turtle program at  Escobilla, 300 miles southeast of Mexico City on the Pacific Coast of Oaxaca  state.    Elpidio Marcelino Lopez said the 10 to 15 boats he saw capturing turtles 200  yards off the beach last year aren't there this season. Marcelino is a  biologist from Oaxaca State University who has spent several seasons at the  Escobilla camp.    Conservationists say some killing continues despite the ban decreed by  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    ""We know there are two clandestine slaughterhouses,"" said Homero Aridjis,  president of the Group of 100, an environmental organization.    He said they were discovered on secondary nesting beaches, one of which also is  used by leatherback turtles. Aridjis said there was no indication of how many  turtles were being processed there.    Biologists move the eggs from nests on the beach to nursery areas at the camp.    ""If we had 200 nests, they'd steal 201,"" Marcelino said of the egg thieves.    Mexico was the world's leading killer of sea turtles and Japan its biggest  customer.    The victims generally were olive ridleys, the most numerous of the seven  species of sea turtles. Six of the seven species are found in Mexico.    What makes olive ridleys special are their arribadas, mass nestings that occur  about once a month from July to December. Biologists estimate that 75,000  nested on 1 1/2 miles of the Escobilla beach during the October arribada, more  than in all of 1988 and more than half the 1989 total.    Marcelino also said more are nesting between arribadas this year.    Pairs of turtle tracks make stripes on the beach, one from the water, the other  returning, their edges scrolled like ocean waves. The tracks going up the beach  are a bit deeper, because of the 10 pounds of eggs in a 100-pound turtle.    If there is only one track, a turtle is at the end of it. Her back flippers,  curled like hands, scoop out a hole where she lays 100 or so eggs the size of  golf balls. Then she fills the hole, tamping down the sand, and heads back to  the sea.    Olive ridleys have nine other major nesting beaches worldwide, but the level of  killing wiped out the two or three other major sites in Mexico.    ""There was no reason to think Oaxaca wouldn't go the same way,"" Ruiz said.    An estimated 70,000 turtles were killed in 1989. The legal limit, divided among  licensed cooperatives, was 23,000.    In addition to forbidding the olive ridley kill, the presidential decree  increased the government commitment to enforce bans on killing other turtle  species and the taking and selling of eggs, shells, skins and other products.  It also supports research.    In San Agustinillo, there were two things to do: capture turtles or work at the  slaughterhouse. Both stopped at the end of May.    ""Sometimes we borrow money, or you don't eat beans, you eat tortillas, just to  buy school supplies for the children,"" said Alvarez, the idle fisherman.    He said he had earned about $140 from turtles during peak months, as much in  five days as fish brought the rest of the month. With their minds on nesting,  turtles are easy to grab.    Shark fishing, a likely alternative, means going so far to sea you can lose  sight of land, he said, more fuel and maintenance for the boat and, without a  radio, more danger.    New boats, motors, trucks and nets that the government fishing department gave  cooperatives do not make up for the loss, Alvarez said.    Fishermen contend that there are plenty of turtles. Those outside cooperatives  are blamed for much of the illegal killing, before the ban and now.    ""Even with all the vigilance we have, the nesting beaches are very extensive,""  said Myrna Wong of the fishing department. ""You can't cover all of it at the  same time.""    Todd Steiner, director of the sea turtle project of Earth Island Institute,  agreed that the ban had been effective, but also said: ""I think if the  international environmental community goes to sleep, all the turtles will get  is a temporary reprieve.""    On a busy Saturday in Mexico City's Tepito market, famous for contraband, four  vendors hawked turtle eggs, a delicacy, at three for the equivalent of $1.70.    Businesses were required to register their turtle products after the decree,  but there was no deadline on selling nonperishable products. That makes tracing  new stock, an indication of poaching, more difficult.    Authorities have confiscated large amounts of tortoise shell, a product of the  hawksbill turtle, but Homero Aridjis, president of the Group of 100  environmental organization, said it still is available in stores.    Two men selling part-turtle boots were certain they wouldn't run out.    ""There's always clandestine trade,"" Hector Guevara said, making a gesture under  the table.

Under often-tough cross-examination, the 19-year-old woman closed out her two  days of testimony as the star witness against her father, 38-year-old David  Brown, who is on trial for murder for allegedly orchestrating his wife's 1985  shooting death.    Cinnamon Brown, incarcerated in the California Youth Authority facility in  Camarillo for nearly the last five years, admitted that she shot to death her  stepmother, 24-year-old Linda Brown, while the victim slept in their Garden  Grove home in March, 1985. But the teen-ager said she committed the crime under  the prodding of her father, who made her keep silent about the scheme and then  collected $835,000 from his wife's insurance and married the victim's sister.    In her testimony, Cinnamon Brown recounted that, while on a drive a few months  before the killing with her father and Patti Bailey, the victim's 17-year-old  sister, Cinnamon suggested that the trio could kill Linda Brown by throwing an  electrical appliance into the bathtub with her.    The trio then broke into laughter when they realized that this would not work  because ""Linda never took baths -- she always took showers,"" Cinnamon Brown  testified.    Defense attorney Gary M.

Noting the air of levity surrounding the conversation, Pohlson asked in an  incredulous tone: ""I mean, it's kind of a big deal, isn't it -- killing  someone?""    Cinnamon Brown said she first thought that her father and Patti Bailey were  just kidding about the need to get Linda out of the way before Linda could  carry out her own plan to kill David Brown and take over his lucrative computer  data-retrieval company.    But soon, she said, she became convinced that there was a real danger and that  she had to be the one to kill Linda Brown -- in part because her father had  assured her that her youth would preclude a prison sentence.

Cinnamon Brown said she kept silent about her father's role in the alleged  scheme for more than three years out of loyalty to him. But her loyalty waned  -- and she was willing to cooperate with authorities -- once she heard about  the insurance money her father had collected and his marriage to Patti, she  testified.    ""I was mad and angry because (David Brown and Patti Bailey) didn't tell me. And  I felt hurt because they just left me there. And it seemed like it was not  important to them anymore,"" she said.

A third secretary of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Saleh  Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, was shot dead on 4 January 1989, in Soi  Phipat 2, between Bangkok's North Sathon and Silom roads. Three  bullets from a 6.35 mm pistol struck Al-Maliki in the head,  right temple, and left ear, killing him instantly.    Police believed the motive for the murder was the  dissatisfaction of employment agencies, which were losing  commission because of Al-Maliki's method of issuing visas direct  to Thais wanting to work in Saudi Arabia.    At yesterday's hearing, Judge Charan Hatthakam ruled that  acquittal was the correct verdict because the testimony of the  prosecutor's eye-witnesses was not deemed reliable.    The accused, Adinan Songkoewala, 26, was arrested on 23 June  1989. The prosecution witnesses -- Thongkham Lengkham, Somwang  Kritchukiat, and Lun Posayanon -- identified the accused as the  man who shot Al-Maliki dead. They told the court that Al-Maliki  was shot while he was walking to his residence at the PMP  Mansion. The gunman shot Al-Maliki at close range and ran away.  But in passing his verdict, the judge reminded the court that  the eyewitnesses had also said they could not remember much  detail about the gunman because they were in shock.    The accused had pleaded innocence, and said he had been at  work in his garment business up-country at the time of the  murder.     "

Their death is yet another confirmation of horrors caused by  the aggression and war which is continuing in former Yugoslavia.  Around 50 journalists have been killed so far, and as of late  aid workers have become target of attacks which proves that we  all have to double our efforts for the hostilities to cease and  a peace solution to be found, Minister Granic's letter says.    Once again I would like to condemn the crime most vehemently  and assure you that the Croatian government will not begrudge  effort to provide help in an independent investigation to  clarify the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident, the  statement says underscoring that as soon the Croatian government  received the news about the killing of the three Italian  citizens, it exerted all its influence over the warring factions  in Mostar to help in the establishment of a cease-fire and the  evacuation of the killed journalists.    In conclusion of this letter Minister Granic said he was  hoping that in the course of his forthcoming meeting in Rome he  would be able to have talks with his Italian counterpart on the  possibilities for halting the war in this area.

From Associated Press      WASHINGTON      The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed new rules that could  return to some cities the right to regulate basic cable television rates.    Under existing rules, only about 3% of the nation's 9,500-plus cable TV systems  are under price restraints, and there have been rising complaints that cable  systems raise prices willy-nilly and get away with poor service.    The proposed new rules, adopted on a 5-0 vote, would make it tougher for cable  systems to avoid price regulation, while at the same time avoiding what FCC  officials view as heavy-handed controls.    The proposal says local communities may regulate a cable system's ""basic tier""  of services, which includes network broadcast stations, unless one of the three  following conditions exist:    * There are six or more unduplicated over-the-air channels available and the  cable system is subscribed to by less than 50% of the TV homes in a community.    * There are other multichannel service providers in the community, such as  microwave cable or direct broadcast satellites, that are available to 50% of  the homes with cable and are actually being subscribed to by 10% of those  homes.    * The cable system offers a minimum level of service and programs at a  reasonable price that is comparable to communities in which there is effective  competition. This so-called good actor clause is favored by a number of FCC  commissioners.    FCC officials would not speculate on how many cable systems could avoid rate  re-regulation under the new proposals.    The proposals could affect parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties where cable  penetration is above the 50% level.    Following a period of public comment, the commission will adopt final rules  sometime next year.    FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes said the proposals would ""give some measure of  consumer protection . . . and some assurance of fairness"" to the cable TV  industry.    Sikes has championed competition among cable systems and satellite broadcasters  as a means of guaranteeing continued growth in the cable industry and holding  prices down for subscribers.    National Cable Television Assn. President James Mooney, however, said the FCC  proposals could hurt the cable industry.

A crack 60-strong unit that arrived at Cyangugu, across the  border from Zaire, on Thursday, was on Friday assessing the  humanitarian needs of the civilian population of the region, the  army's Information Department said here.    A giant Russian-built Antonov 22 transport plane left France  on Friday with 80 tonnes of medical equipment and medicines.  The plane was bound either for Bangui, Central African  Republic, or Libreville, Gabon, a military spokesman said.    The equipment would then be transferred to France's two  staging areas in eastern Zaire at Goma and Bukavu. A second  Antonov carrying a similar 80-tonne cargo was scheduled to leave  Lyon, central France, for Africa later on Friday.    Meanwhile a UN spokesman reported in the capital, Kigali,  that rebel and army gunners pounded Kigali overnight and  sporadic fighting continued Friday as UN forces prepared to  evacuate hundreds of displaced people from the airport, a United  Nations spokesman said.    ""The fighting was very intense last night,"" said UN military  spokesman Jean-Guy Plante, contacted by telephone from Nairobi.  ""There was a lot of heavy mortar and machinegun fire.""    Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their  offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the  capital Kigali, apparently fearing that the French troops may  forestall an all-out victory by the rebels, who control about  two-thirds of the small central African country.    In Paris, the military said the 60 troops sent on the  UN-mandated mercy mission spent their first night in Cyangugu  ""without incident"" and were ""welcomed"" by local people. [passage  omitted]    The 50-bed field hospital will have an operating theatre and  12 doctors forming two full medical teams. [passage omitted]    The French expeditionary force, which will have a full  strength of 2,500, is to set up safe areas for minority Tutsi  people who are stranded inside territory held by forces of the  majority Hutu government. [passage omitted]    In Nairobi, the STANDARD newspaper, which is owned by the  Lonrho multinational, said Friday the French operation was ""pure  neo-colonialism"" aimed at strengthening French influence in the  regime.    Plante said UN commander General Romeo Dallaire planned to  meet Rwandan Army chief of staff General Augustin Bizimungu  later Friday to discuss the French intervention and the future  UN role in Rwanda.    The UN has fewer than 500 soldiers in Rwanda, but plans to  boost the force to several thousand. [passage omitted]    Plante said UN troops in Kigali planned to escort about 800  displaced people under UN guard at the airport to a camp at the  King Faisal hospital where thousands of civilians are sheltering.

Up to 2,500 hired killers could already be in the  country.    A special investigation by CITY PRESS has found a terrifying  web of conspiracy between the highly trained mercenaries and  groups of rightwingers bent on toppling the ANC-led Government  of National Unity. Police said they knew many German neo-Nazis  were infiltrating the country -- and warned that they should  expect no mercy from the law.    It has been found that the Nazis -- who enjoy close links  with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] -- and other secret  organisations -- have been armed with weapons of Russian origin  and provided with military uniforms used by the SADF [South  African Defense Force]. The mercenaries have also been linked  to Third Force activities, the manufacturing of deadly weapons  and gun running.    Security forces believe some of the Nazis enter the country  illegally and are issued with false identification documents.  South African and German authorities are, however, cooperating  in trying to weed out the Nazi assassins.    Although the Department of Home Affairs and National  Statistics Services have no figures of German tourists who  entered SA [South Africa] in March and April, the figure for  February was 10,477, compared to less than 1,000 in January. It  is estimated that more than 800 mercenaries entered the country  in February.    During an interview, which was attended by a foreign  television crew, one of the sources -- who asked to remain  anonymous -- showed CITY PRESS a large quantity of rifle bullets  he said he had purchased from the foreigners. [passage omitted]    CITY PRESS also found that when Germans enter the country  they are put in a private house in Kempton Park. There they are  given money and documents before they are dispatched to their  underground cells.    The Germans were promised 1,000 German marks per week for  doing duty in South Africa.    A German embassy spokesman in Pretoria said they knew of the  Nazis coming into SA from Namibia and Mozambique. Others came  from Germany, the French Foreign Legion and Bosnia.    ""There is little that we can do to stop them coming into the  country with valid documents, even though they are not coming  with good intentions. However, we are working closely with  South African authorities to identify them,"" he said.    Safety and Security Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said  police knew of the mercenaries' presence and special action to  counter them had been launched. ""They are planning to use South  Africa for easy pickings as a mercenary mecca. But we are  watching them. Their moves are being closely monitored."" Kotze  said an investigation was underway into the role of the Nazis as  they were regarded as extremely dangerous.     "

What do you expect in this regard?    [Habash] What happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an odious  and bloody massacre that severely shocked the national, Arab,  and international levels. It is a massacre that shocked the  human conscience everywhere.    Whoever knows the history, nature, and mentality of the  Zionist entity and the Zionist movement was not been surprised  by this massacre. The Zionist history is rife with massacres.  This bloody massacre has shattered any illusions about the  nature of this fascist, racist, bloody entity. Most explicitly,  I hold the Zionist entity's government and Rabin personally  responsible for what was committed against our innocent and  defenseless people at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent  premeditated killing of the sons of our people who rose to  express their indignation throughout the occupied homeland. As  Rabin talks about peace, his troops and settlers continue their  cold-blooded killing of innocent worshipers and our defenseless  masses. It is ironic to claim that the perpetrator of the  massacre was an insane settler. In fact, the massacre is the  logical outcome of the policy of settlement and arming the herds  of settlers from head to toe. It is the logical outcome of  having an army addicted to killing and slaughtering.    The United States also bears direct responsibility for this  and other massacres, for it continues to protect the Zionist  entity, cover its crimes, and does its utmost to spare the  Zionist entity any harm, and even condemnation. This is most  visible through its stands at the UN Security Council, where the  U.S. Administration is desperately fighting to circumvent the  horrible massacre and its indications and dimensions. The  settlements spread over our territory are an absolute violation  of all UN resolutions. Why are these resolutions not  implemented immediately? Why doesn't the U.S. Administration  show the same enthusiasm to enforce the will of the  international community, that it shows when imposing its will  and racism against the peoples of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and  other countries? There is no explanation for that except  acceptance of what the Zionists are committing against our  people to break their will and resistance and to peddle  destructive schemes.    In the same vein, I do not absolve the spineless Palestinian  leadership from responsibility for the tragedies and massacres  of our people. That leadership has abandoned all national  rights and recognized the Zionist entity's right to exist on our  soil and agreed in the Oslo-Cairo accords to keep the  settlements and settlers implanted among the sons of our people.  However, this leadership knows well these settlements' nature  and expansionist and bloody objectives. He who allows the  occupation and its troops and settlers to stay on our national  soil bears direct responsibility for the occupation authorities'  acts of killing, repression, and terrorism against our resisting  people.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has strongly and glaringly  exposed the falsehood of all Zionist-U.S.-'Arafatist demagoguery  about the alleged peace. What is being offered is capitulation  that maintains occupation and settlements and approves of the  acts of repression and killing against our people.    The crime is terrible and appalling. Therefore, we should be  extremely vigilant to deny the U.S. and Zionist attempts to  circumvent and contain this massacre through cosmetic measures  any chances of success. 'Arafat and the Oslo team are striking  a deceptive tone to absorb and contain the overwhelming and  decisive popular reactions. The masses are well aware of the  illusions and deceptive campaign that the spineless leadership  has promoted after the signing of the Oslo and Cairo agreement.  The masses are also aware of this leadership's deceptive talk  about peace, security, prosperity, and sovereignty.    Therefore, in view of this massacre, we explicitly state  that  our masses can be protected and their security maintained only  through the departure of the occupation troops, the complete  removal of settlements from our land, and recognition of our  people's right to repatriation and statehood, including  Jerusalem. This means that the humiliating agreements, which  fundamentally contravene our national principles and rights,  should be overturned.    We are demanding an urgent popular and political movement  pressing for the following:    --Overturning the humiliating agreements which contravene  our  national rights.    --Halting negotiations completely.    --Removing the settlements from our land completely.    --Providing international protection for our masses in the  occupied homeland immediately in preparation for the Zionist  army's full withdrawal.    --After the failure of the U.S. course which started in  Madrid and the subsequent agreements, leading up to the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, we are demanding a return to the international  option and the UN resolutions approving our people's national,  inalienable rights: The rights to repatriation,  self-determination, and statehood, including Jerusalem, the  capital of Palestine. This should be an alternative to the U.S.  course.    We hope that the massacre will constitute a turning point in  the life of our Palestinian masses, the national, democratic,  and Islamic political forces, and on the pan-Arab level to  collectively confront the destructive Zionist-imperialist scheme  and to maintain the option of struggle in order to attain our  national and pan-Arab objectives.

Thai police received information from Washington that Mir  Aimal Kansi, 30, slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide  in the network of guerrilla and criminal gangs operating here,  according to the source, a senior member of the special branch  who spoke on condition of anonymity.    Kansi was suspected of killing two employees of the Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Virginia on January 25, 1993.    He was also suspected of operating in the same gang as  Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, suspects in the Febuary  26, 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center.    Although Thai police have not received information on  Farooq's or Yousef's whereabouts, they have circulated wanted  posters for all three men in Thai tourist resorts. The posters  offer a US$2 million reward in exchange for information leading  to their arrest.    The source said Thai police had sent three teams to search  for Kansi in the tourist resorts of Pattaya, Phuket and Hat Yai,  one to northern Thailand and two to the Muslim-dominated  provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat.    ""But so far there is no clue leading to the suspect,"" he  said. ""We believe he has had cosmetic surgery done to his face,  is carrying false travelling documents and is associating with  international gangsters.""

In the same way as they directed their  internationally-prohibited missiles of mass destruction toward  Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Ma'rib, and al-Rahidah, killing  innocent children, women, elderly people, and men, and  destroying the secure residential areas, they did not spare the  valiant city of Aden from their treacherous, cowardly strikes.  Missile strikes were dealt to it by the forces of apostasy and  secession during the past few days, aiming at the residential  areas in the city of Aden as if the bloodthirsty criminals --  through this terrorist action -- are warning the citizens in the  valiant city of Aden with the aim of terrorizing them and  dissuading them from joining the ranks of unity and  constitutional legitimacy.

""There are three more attacks to come,"" Hamas said in a  communique sent to AFP in Gaza City.    On April 7, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at 'Afula killing  seven Israelis and wounding 45 in the first attack to avenge the  mosque massacre of 30 Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron on  February 25.

Israel ""totally"" sealed off the occupied territories after  the 'Afula bombing in a bid to halt more killings and announced  that security had been stepped up for Wednesday's memorial day  for fallen soldiers and independence day on Thursday.    Hamas warned Arabs living in Israel to keep away from public  places where Jews gathered. ""We advise them not to get on  Israeli buses.""

A gunman shot dead embassy first secretary Na'ib 'Umran  al-Ma'aiytah outside his Beirut home on Saturday and seized  documents from his briefcase.    He was the first diplomat to be killed in Lebanon since the  end of the 15-year civil war in 1990.    No group has claimed responsibility for the murder, which  Jordan blamed on opponents of the Middle East peace process.    ""Witnesses have given the security services a description of  the killers,"" Mirhij told AFP. ""This information could lead to  their arrest,"" he said.    ""Some witnesses also revealed that the killer seized a file  from the Jordanian diplomat's car,"" he added.    According to the latest police report, al-Ma'aiytah, a  42-year-old father of three, was killed when a gunman pumped 10  bullets into his neck, head and chest as he sat in his Mercedes.    The killer then fled in another car with an accomplice.    Jordanian Foreign Ministry officials, citing Lebanese  police,  reported on Sunday that a file which al-Ma'aiytah had at the  time of his killing had disappeared.    Jordan's ambassador in Lebanon, Fakhri Abu-Talib, said ""the  murder was planned and carried out by professionals and it could  have taken place in any other country.""    The killing came almost a week after Jordan's King Husayn  said in Washington that he hoped to meet Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin to boost the chances for peace.    Several Palestinian and Lebanese groups opposed to the peace  process, including pro-Iranian and pro-Syrian factions, are  based in Beirut.     "
0,FT933-5963 ,"FT933-5963 _AN-DIAB3AAXFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Gap shrinks between Serbs and Moslems      By LAURA SILBER and GILLIAN TETT      GENEVA, LONDON   BOSNIAN Serbs and Moslems appeared to be inching closer towards a settlement yesterday after officials announced that Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, had agreed to a ceasefire and an early prisoner exchange. The moves are part of a five-point plan agreed by the two yesterday, including establishment of a communications hot-line between Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold 10 miles to the east. The announcement came after the leaders of the three warring parties held separate sessions as the Geneva peace talks resumed after an 11-day break. Earlier in the day Mr Izetbegovic had criticised the proposed map for a peace settlement as 'unfair'. But, after meeting his Bosnian Serb adversaries, they agreed to order a ceasefire, according to Mr Nikola Koljevic, a Bosnian Serb official. The five-point plan was hailed as a positive sign for the future of wider negotiations on an overall Bosnia peace accord. In an attempt to increase pressure on the Moslem delegation, Lord Owen, the EC's peace envoy, warned Mr Izetbegovic yesterday that renewed fighting between Serb and Moslem forces would pose 'real dangers that the Serb forces will cut the country in two'. Bosnian Serbs have accepted the 'peace package' but refuse to make any more concessions to the mainly Moslem republic which, under the plan, will form a 'union' along with the Croat and Serb republics. But wedged between the two ethnic states, the Moslems fear that they will be at the mercy of their foes. Mr Izetbegovic's delegation wants restoration of key territory in eastern Bosnia and the town of Prijedor, north-western Bosnia, which were mainly Moslem before the war, when Serb forces seized control. They want access roads to Neum, a fishing village on the Adriatic as well as connecting the isolated eastern enclaves. The Bosnian delegation has also demanded stronger international guarantees that the plan will be enforced. Serb forces used the 1992 Vance peace plan in Croatia to consolidate their territorial gains. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, today in Geneva amid signs that the allies are stepping up their military plans for a deployment. The international mediators had originally indicated that 40,000 extra troops would be needed to police a partition. But Nato officials in Brussels warned that the alliance was a long way from making a firm commitment on troop numbers. Meanwhile, in Mostar a UN protection force yesterday finally succeeded in leaving the city, after it had been trapped there for several days by Moslem demonstrators. The Moslems had refused to let the troops leave, fearing their departure would trigger a fresh assault by the Croat forces, who have been besieging the city for more than two months.

Although the Department of Home Affairs and National  Statistics Services have no figures of German tourists who  entered SA [South Africa] in March and April, the figure for  February was 10,477, compared to less than 1,000 in January. It  is estimated that more than 800 mercenaries entered the country  in February.    During an interview, which was attended by a foreign  television crew, one of the sources -- who asked to remain  anonymous -- showed City Press a large quantity of rifle bullets  he said he had purchased from the foreigners. [passage omitted]    City Press also found that when Germans enter the country  they are put in a private house in Kempton Park. There they are  given money and documents before they are dispatched to their  underground cells.    The Germans were promised 1,000 German marks per week for  doing duty in South Africa.    A German embassy spokesman in Pretoria said they knew of the  Nazis coming into SA from Namibia and Mozambique. Others came  from Germany, the French Foreign Legion and Bosnia.    ""There is little that we can do to stop them coming into the  country with valid documents, even though they are not coming  with good intentions. However, we are working closely with  South African authorities to identify them,"" he said.    Safety and Security Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said  police knew of the mercenaries' presence and special action to  counter them had been launched. ""They are planning to use South  Africa for easy pickings as a mercenary mecca. But we are  watching them. Their moves are being closely monitored."" Kotze  said an investigation was underway into the role of the Nazis as  they were regarded as extremely dangerous.     "

At the government's behest, traffic across the country came to a respectful halt during a moment of silence at 11.30am, the hour of his shooting in the eastern town of Annaba. However, crowds at the el-Alia cemetery turned the gathering into a demonstration, waving banners calling on the government to tell 'the truth' about the killing and chanting 'The assassins are in power'. Postcards were distributed addressed to President Ali Kafi demanding a full explanation of the assassination. A commission of inquiry's verdict on the killing was that the assassination was the act of one of his bodyguards, Mr Lembarek Boumarafi, who opened fire on the 72-year-old leader while he was making a speech. Mr Boumarafi is waiting trial. Mr Boudiaf had returned to Algeria barely six months earlier from nearly 30 years of exile to lead his country, after the resignation of Mr Chadli Bendjedid as president, and immediately gained popularity for his claims that he would clean up corruption. But yesterday's demonstration, and press comment this week, indicate that few Algerians are satisfied. 'The explanations given have convinced no one,' said an editorial yesterday in Liberte, the francophone daily. The unease and suspicion have been heightened among Algeria's secular intellectuals in recent months by a spate of other murders of prominent scholars and writers in what appear to have been carefully planned operations.

0,FT934-11471 ,"FT934-11471 _AN-DKACHAADFT 931101   FT  01 NOV 93 / De Klerk concedes ground to ANC over constitution      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICA's ruling Nation-al party appears to have abandoned its demand for a constitutionally enshrined veto in a government of national unity to be headed by Mr Nelson Mandela if his African National Congress wins the country's first all-race general election next April. Joint proposals, which will be incorporated in a draft of the constitution due to be released today, show that the government has given substantial ground in its negotiations with the ANC on a new constitution. The National party would have little constitutionally entrenched power to block majority decisions. In an earlier draft, the party was guaranteed what amounted to a veto in the areas of budget, finance and security. The proposals call for multi-party power sharing in a five-year national unity government. However, the long-ruling National party, which speaks for minority interests and is likely to come second in next year's elections, now seems to have accepted a form of voluntary rather than enforced power sharing, with President F. W. de Klerk appearing to rely on assurances from Mr Mandela that fundamental decisions will not be taken without his approval. If the ANC wins the general election set for next April, Mr Mandela would become president of South Africa. Unless National party electoral support is drastically eroded, Mr de Klerk is likely to become second deputy president, alongside a first deputy president also from the ANC. If Mr de Klerk disagrees with the ANC, he can try to muster support from allies to outvote it in the cabinet. He is likely to need 40 per cent support to block the ANC, which still might not guarantee him automatic veto power. Dissent surfaced within Mr de Klerk's National party about the outcome of the talks. One influential party member said the proposals would leave the party 'at the mercy of the ANC'. The proposals also offer only limited powers to provincial assemblies. They are likely to reinforce fears of many whites and harden the opposition of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom party which demands a quasi-independent status for Natal province, the IFP stronghold. The IFP and its white partners in the right-wing Freedom Alliance have been given 10 days to respond to the proposals. Freedom Alliance officials condemned the proposals, released yesterday, saying they did not devolve sufficient powers to regional governments. ANC and government negotiators expect to wrap up three years of off-on constitutional negotiations this week, completing proposals on how a final constitution should be written, on the composition of a constitutional court, and on local government. They will then present the document as a final offer to the Freedom Alliance, which includes the IFP and the white Conservative party. Negotiators, say they will tell the alliance to accept the offer within 10 days, or the government and ANC will proceed to elections alone.

Mr Gaviria made the announcement after calling an emergency Security Council meeting with his cabinet yesterday to discuss measures to combat Colombia's 35-year-old rebel insurgency. The state of emergency will last for 90 days, in which the government will take extraordinary powers: Mr Gaviria will be able to order actions against rebels without consulting Congress or the courts. Before the meeting, Mr Gaviria's interior minister, Humberto de la Calle Lombana, said the guerrilla attacks were unprecedented and called for a state of emergency. Earlier yesterday the president said: 'It's now the hour to confront, without truces - in the military, judicial and legislative fields, and with the support of citizens - those who have become the worst criminals of the country.' Leftist rebels of the Simon Bolvar Guerrilla Co-ordinator movement began an offensive on Saturday, killing 26 policemen who were protecting oil drills at a petroleum field in southern Colombia. Drug dealers have also targeted police. They have killed 20 officers in the past 10 days. The Bolvar group comprises the three remaining rebel factions: the National Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and a dissident faction of the Peoples' Liberation Army.

Three militants gunned down General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and  his  police bodyguard in a hail of automatic weapons fire which also  wounded the general's driver.    The dying bodyguard managed to fire back and wound one of  the  militants, while the other two fled. The shooting occurred as  Fahmi was leaving his home.    The general's wife witnessed the shooting from a balcony,  tearing off window shutters and throwing them in a vain attempt  to drive off the killers.    Security officials said the wounded gunman, Hasan Khalifah  'Uthman, was a key member of the outlawed fundamentalist  organization al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) in the  region, a hotbed of Islamic militancy.    'Uthman, who was hospitalised, was wanted for a series of  attacks, the most recent being the killing of a policeman in the  Asyut region last week.    In a statement sent to AFP in Cairo, al-Jama'ah claimed  responsibility for the latest killing and warned that ""the  liquidation of leading officials in the (interior) ministry is a  cornerstone of our armed campaign.""    The aim is to make the authorities ""respect the rights of  Muslims"" and end their abuse of human rights in Egyptian  prisons, the group said.    Fahmi, appointed police chief in Asyut for one year last  August, was the second police general murdered this month. On  April 9, the general leading the battle against Islamic  militants, Ra'uf Khayrat, was shot dead in Cairo.    More than 130 policemen have been killed since Islamic  militants declared war on the secular government of President  Husni Mubarak in March 1992. The confrontation has claimed a  total of more than 360 lives.     "

No doubt this is true; one would only  wish it will not be made into an alibi.    By definition, professional killers slay their designated  victim without passion but with accuracy; and they make sure  they leave no evidence behind. Millions of detective motion  picture and TV serial viewers know all about such details.  However, there is no hard and fast rule; there are mediocre  professionals and careless assassins. Sometimes, also, chance  interferes with action. We shall see whether the investigation  progresses, whether names can be placed on shadowy figures.    It may be necessary to go even further. This murder is not  only a physical act, it is also a message meant for the whole  political class, for judges, for policemen, for journalists.  Whether the murder's sponsors belong to the French naturalized  Mafia or to the scum of political circles does not make much of  a difference. In France today as in Italy yesterday, someone is  trying to scare people. There are issues which politicians  should refrain from investigating -- drugs especially. Because  the drug trade is a state within states; because millions of  people make a living out of it; because it brings unlimited  wealth to seemingly blameless individuals.    What is a mere Parliament representative in the face of this  huge global industry? Of course, nothing supports this  explanation right now. But it is exactly what must be on the  mind of other deputies who have been meticulously working toward  the defeat of the Mafia and drug traffickers. Once again, the  two motorcycle men who killed the Hyeres representative on a  back road were in fact taking aim at France's whole political  class.    This is an absurd threat, though. Politicians are not easily  terrorized. While they are often cowardly before their  electors, in front of threats they are not. In any case, they  will keep in mind Yann Piat's face. Her death may sign the  beginning of a confrontation between the Mafia and our country's  political system. As we all know, no mercy may be expected from  killers; one would like to see the Republic demonstrating equal  determination. After all, its own dignity is at stake.     "

Artillery shells exploded in the streets, maiming children on the way to  school.    Airplanes flew to Cyprus to avoid shelling at the Beirut airport, which was  then closed. Ships put to sea in an effort to escape the artillery pounding.    Gen. Michel Aoun, premier and commander of the Christian army, accused Syrian  army forces of initiating the fighting, the culmination of a week of escalating  clashes.    Aoun said the Syrians fired into both Christian East Beirut and Muslim West  Beirut, triggering a daylong exchange of artillery between Christian and Druze  militias in the hills southwest of the city.    Aoun said his army will try to force the Syrian troops to withdraw from  Lebanon.    ""Lebanon cannot possibly stay under the mercy of the Syrian cannon,"" he told  reporters at the presidential palace in suburban Baabda, in Christian territory  five miles northeast of Beirut.    Aoun called on the Muslims of West Beirut to rise up against the Syrians as  Palestinians have risen up against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    He said he also asked the Arab League, which has been trying to mediate the  crisis, to ""intervene at once to ensure the withdrawal of the Syrian occupation  army."" The Syrians, brought in to put an end to the civil war, have been in  Lebanon since 1976.    Aoun's accusations were dismissed in Damascus as false. The official daily  newspaper Al Baath said the charges were aimed at ""devastating Syria's  constructive role in Lebanon.""    The shelling Tuesday morning caught Beirut civilians out in the streets at the  height of the rush hour. Screaming mothers ran through streets to rescue  children from schools in areas hit by shelling or from buses stranded in the  open. Shopkeepers banged down their shutters as radio stations urged people to  stay indoors and seek cover from the shelling. Banks also closed their doors.    The shelling on both sides of the line seemed to be indiscriminate, according  to reports reaching here, hitting near restaurants, bakeries, hospitals and  U.N. buildings.    Lebanon's latest crisis began last September when the Lebanese Parliament  failed to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel. Gemayel then appointed  Aoun as premier. The incumbent premier, Salim Hoss, a Muslim backed by Syria,  refused to step aside, leaving the country with two competing governments and  no president.

The parents of slain Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem, Patricia and Richard  Stethem of Port Tobacco, Md., sat silently facing Hamadi as Chief Judge Heiner  Mueckenberger delivered the verdict and sentence. Later, the Stethems indicated  that a ""more severe"" punishment should have been imposed.    West Germany has no death penalty, and Peter Korneck, one of the prosecutors,  said Hamadi will be eligible for a parole review in 15 years. Hamadi's lawyers  said they plan to appeal the sentence.    Before reading the verdict, the judge recalled Hamadi's troubled life in Beirut  as the defendant, his beard neatly trimmed, sat with his eyes downcast behind  two walls of bullet-proof glass in the courtroom at Frankfurt's Preungesheim  maximum-security prison.    ""The accused is found guilty of collective murder in connection with air  piracy, hostage-taking and causing serious bodily harm as well as the illegal  import of explosives in one case while using forged documents,"" the judge  ruled. ""He is sentenced to life-long imprisonment as a total sentence.""    Prosecutors last week requested a life sentence for Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite  Muslim who confessed that he and a still-at-large accomplice hijacked TWA  Flight 847 with 153 people aboard en route from Athens to Rome on June 14,  1985. But Hamadi denied he had killed Stethem. One American aboard, Peter Hill,  testified that Hamadi, holding a 9-millimeter Beretta pistol, told him in  English, ""This is the gun"" that killed Stethem.    Mueckenberger said the court was unable to decide who actually shot Stethem.  ""But the defendant knowingly and willingly participated in Stethem's killing  and actively took part in its preparation,"" he said.    The hijackers had demanded freedom for 700 Shiite Muslim prisoners held by  Israel. The 17-day ordeal ended after Israel agreed to the phased release of  the prisoners who were captured in fighting in southern Lebanon.    After the verdict, Stethem's father said: ""We praise the court's efforts and  hope this conviction will stand as an example and encouragement to other  countries to decisively deal with terrorists.    ""Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishment more severe than  allowable under German law,"" he said, adding that any commutation of Hamadi's  sentence would be a ""pure mockery of justice.""    In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Hamadi's  sentence ""satisfies the demand for justice.""    Regarding speculation that Hamadi's sentence might be commuted in a trade for  hostages in Lebanon, Fitzwater said, ""We expect Hamadi will serve the full  sentence in accord with German law.""    In the TWA hijacking, Hamadi apparently was acting on behalf of Hezbollah, the  shadowy fundamentalist terror group that backs Iran's leader, the Ayatollah  Ruhollah Khomeini.    Judge Mueckenberger said ""the court assumes"" Hamadi would rejoin Hezbollah ""if  he was set free today."" Mueckenberger added that it could be assumed ""the  accused will consider the sentence an injustice, but the will of God.""    The judge said the ""hijackers had used the utmost brutality"" on the TWA  passengers, and he praised Stethem as ""a model U.S. serviceman -- tall, strong,  good looking and soldier-like in his deportment.    ""He was less ready than other passengers to yield to the hijackers.""    Testimony revealed that Stethem, 23, was severely beaten, then ""executed"" and  his body thrown on the tarmac in Beirut when authorities refused the hijackers'  demands for fuel for the jetliner.    Hamadi quietly listened as Mueckenberger told him, through a translator, that  he had a right to appeal. He left the courtroom with his eyes downcast.    American observers closely watched the 63 days of proceedings, which began in  July, 1988, after West Germany rejected a U.S. request to extradite Hamadi for  fear of reprisals against two West German businessmen held in Lebanon at the  time. Bonn's refusal in 1987 to grant extradition caused a rift with the United  States.

Several innocent civilians were also arrested. In  all, 10 people were killed in random firing by Indian soldiers  who also killed six people in indiscriminate firing in Srinagar.  Mojahedin in retaliatory attacks killed nine soldiers. They  carried out rocket attack on a battalion headquarters at  (Manjakot) in Rajouri area killing six Indian soldiers. The  building of the Battalion headquarters was badly damaged.  Mojahedin killed another two soldiers when they opened fire on  rampaging troops during siege and search operations in Pulwama.    The leader of the All Parties Hurriyat [Freedom] Conference  in occupied Kashmir has described the last session of the UN  Human Rights Commission in Geneva as a great victory for the  Kashmiri people as Pakistan was able to internationalize the  Kashmir issue. The Kashmiri leaders, who had come to the Indian  capital to apprise the U.S. deputy secretary of state and  members of his delegation about the ground realities in occupied  Kashmir, rejected India's claim that the deferment of the  resolution on Kashmir at the human rights conference in Geneva  was a severe jolt to the Kashmiri movement. In an interview,  the Hurriyat leaders Professor Abdul Ghani, Justice retired  Mufti Bahuddin Farooqi, Mr. G.M. Bhatt, Maulavi Abbas Ansari,  and Mr. G.N. Shahin said top priority for the Kashmiri people is  to get rid of the yoke of Indian slavery. They praised Pakistan  for internationalizing the Kashmir problem, saying it was a  great achievement as Kashmiri people could not do so in Geneva  without Pakistan. The Hurriyat leaders praised Ms. Benazir  Bhutto's government for its stand on Kashmir and hoped Pakistan  would continue its diplomatic, political, and moral support to  the Kashmiri people.     "

The victim, a 20-year-old transient, apparently became involved in an argument  with a group of men at Main and 5th streets shortly before 1 a.m., said Police  Detective John Dunkin, who refused to speculate on the nature of the argument  or motive for the attack.    The mob caught up with the man in front of the Palace Theater, 630 S. Broadway,  Dunkin said. The man was beaten and stabbed eight or nine times with a  four-inch knife and died on the northbound lanes of Broadway. His name was  being withheld pending notification of relatives.    ""It looks like a blade out of a Buck-type folding knife,"" Dunkin said of the  murder weapon found bent at the scene. ""It's the weapon of preference, of  choice in this type of attack.""    Dunkin said the victim had apparently been robbed.    Witnesses to the early morning attack flagged down a police patrol car and  officers arrested four men as they were running from the scene minutes after  the stabbing, Dunkin said.    The suspects are James Turner and Adrian Norris, both 19; Robert Riley, 18, and  Gerald Jackson, 25. All were arrested on suspicion of murder and were being  held Friday at Parker Center without bail, Dunkin said.    Though police would not speculate on a motive for the killing, Dunkin did say  that the area is the site of frequent sales of crack cocaine and that an almost  identical mob killing occurred at nearby 6th and Spring streets last month.      'Drug Deal Gone Bad'    ""In that case, it was definitely a drug deal gone bad,"" Dunkin said of the  killing of Fred Matthews, 38. Five suspects were arrested in Matthews' killing,  he said.    Almost all of the businesses on Broadway's busy shopping strip were closed at  the time of the killing. During the day, the site of the attack is a busy bus  stop. Most merchants and passers-by said they had not heard about the killing.    ""The last movie here ends at 10:30 (p.m.),"" said Maria, an usher at the Palace  Theater who asked that her last name not be used. ""People don't come to the  late movies because it's dangerous at night. There's nothing but winos out on  the street.""    Thomas Bartsouleas, manager of a video arcade next to the theater, said he  closed his business at 8:30 p.m. He said he found yellow police tape on the  street when he opened his store Friday morning.    ""If there were that many people, it must have been a gang,"" Bartsouleas said.  ""I don't think it was regulars"" in the neighborhood.      'Become Safer and Safer'    Dunkin said the mob killings occurred during a period when homicides in the  downtown Skid Row area have declined. ""It's become safer and safer all the  time,"" he said. ""There's less killings. They seem to be more focused and less  random.""    But Mike Neely, director of the Homeless Outreach Project on 5th Street, said  Friday's killing is similar to the drug-related assaults that have become an  everyday occurrence on Broadway and other downtown streets.    ""A guy tries to get the drugs for free and a group of people chases him down  the street and beats the hell out of him. That's the way these things happen,""  Neely said.

""People don't come to the  late movies because it's dangerous at night. There's nothing but winos out on  the street.""    Thomas Bartsouleas, manager of a video arcade next to the theater, said he  closed his business at 8:30 p.m. He said he found yellow police tape on the  street when he opened his store Friday morning.    ""If there were that many people, it must have been a gang,"" Bartsouleas said.  ""I don't think it was regulars"" in the neighborhood.      'Become Safer and Safer'    Dunkin said the mob killings occurred during a period when homicides in the  downtown Skid Row area have declined. ""It's become safer and safer all the  time,"" he said. ""There's less killings. They seem to be more focused and less  random.""    But Mike Neely, director of the Homeless Outreach Project on 5th Street, said  Friday's killing is similar to the drug-related assaults that have become an  everyday occurrence on Broadway and other downtown streets.    ""A guy tries to get the drugs for free and a group of people chases him down  the street and beats the hell out of him. That's the way these things happen,""  Neely said. ""I've seen it happen before. I've seen guys beaten with baseball  bats. I've seen it on Broadway quite often.""      Photo, Slaying took place in front of Thomas Bartsouleas' video arcade.

Three militants gunned down General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and  his  police bodyguard in a hail of automatic weapons fire which also  wounded the general's driver.    The dying bodyguard managed to fire back and wound one of  the  militants, while the other two fled. The shooting occurred as  Fahmi was leaving his home.    The general's wife witnessed the shooting from a balcony,  tearing off window shutters and throwing them in a vain attempt  to drive off the killers.    Security officials said the wounded gunman, Hasan Khalifah  'Uthman, was a key member of the outlawed fundamentalist  organization al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) in the  region, a hotbed of Islamic militancy.    'Uthman, who was hospitalised, was wanted for a series of  attacks, the most recent being the killing of a policeman in the  Asyut region last week.    In a statement sent to AFP in Cairo, al-Jama'ah claimed  responsibility for the latest killing and warned that ""the  liquidation of leading officials in the (interior) ministry is a  cornerstone of our armed campaign.""    The aim is to make the authorities ""respect the rights of  Muslims"" and end their abuse of human rights in Egyptian  prisons, the group said.    Fahmi, appointed police chief in Asyut for one year last  August, was the second police general murdered this month. On  April 9, the general leading the battle against Islamic  militants, Ra'uf Khayrat, was shot dead in Cairo.    More than 130 policemen have been killed since Islamic  militants declared war on the secular government of President  Husni Mubarak in March 1992. The confrontation has claimed a  total of more than 360 lives.     "

The statement said the garage was a stronghold  of the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force, an armed Protestant group. But police  said the shooting was ""indiscriminate.""      Tit-for-Tat Violence    The incident occurred in Coagh, about 50 miles west of here, and was the latest  in what Northern Ireland security authorities describe as a worrisome spate of  tit-for-tat sectarian violence in which 16 people have been killed this year.    Coagh is a predominantly Protestant village identified with the majority of the  people in Northern Ireland who want to remain a part of the United Kingdom.    The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility last month for killing John  Joe Davey, a town councilor from the same general area who represented the  nationalist Sinn Fein party. Sinn Fein, which wants the British out of Northern  Ireland, is the legal political arm of the outlawed IRA.    Tuesday's shooting was considered noteworthy because of an IRA pledge to  ""refine"" its activities after a year in which its operatives killed 23  civilians in bungled attacks.    Sinn Fein leader Jerry Adams told a party conference in Dublin five weeks ago  that there had been ""an exceptional and regrettable level of civilian  casualties arising from IRA operations"" in 1988.    The IRA is believed to be responsible for killing 33 soldiers and 6 policemen  in the province last year. Illegal Protestant groups are blamed for 22  killings.    The police said that at least three men drove up to Leslie Dallos' garage in  Coagh shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday in a red Vauxhall auto that had been stolen  shortly before. Two of the men jumped out and sprayed the garage with gunfire.    Dallos was killed instantly, as was 72-year-old Ernie Rankin, a pensioner,  according to the police. A second pensioner, Austin Nelson, 61, died of wounds  on the way to a hospital.    Nelson, a former truck driver, had taken up violin-making in retirement and was  featured on a local television newscast Monday evening. He said he hoped that  through his hobby he could make a lasting contribution to the world.    Garage owner Dallos was described as a drag-racing enthusiast in his early 40s.  His wife was reportedly visiting the garage at the time of the shooting. His  teen-age children were among a group of youngsters who witnessed the killings  as they were getting off a school bus nearby.      Arms, Ammo Discovered    In a related development, authorities in northern England reported Tuesday that  they had found a cache of arms and ammunition and a large quantity of  high-explosive Semtex buried in a wooded area near the seaside town of  Scarborough.    Officials pointed out that in 10 days Scarborough is to be the site of a  conference of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party and that  Thatcher is expected to attend.    In 1984, IRA assassins bombed the hotel where Thatcher and members of her  Cabinet were staying in Brighton during a Conservative Party convention. Five  people were killed in the explosion, but the prime minister was not injured.    There have been a number of other IRA bombings in recent months aimed at  military targets in England.

First, it is good that you have arranged  this meeting in this tent, this family-like atmosphere, instead  of having to make speeches in public squares. This is much  better, a family-like, brotherly meeting.    First, I am happy with your high morale and readiness for  confrontation. This is not unusual for you as your kinfolk and  your forefathers were the heroes of the battle of Sidi 'Abd al  Samad, Al Dhlila, Sidi Said, Sidi 'Ali, Al Gdaline [against the  Italian invading army in 1911]. History is a witness to the  courage of your kinfolk, and their confrontation with foreign  invasion, particularly after the fall of Zouara, and the enemy's  attempt to advance toward Al 'Ujaylat, the mountains, and  Fazzan. [passage omitted]    Now there is another confrontation, in another era, with  different methods. So far, the battle has not reached the level  it had attained with the Italians, with rifles, bullets, and  machine-guns. So far, the battle continues with the enemy, but  with other weapons and other methods. We want to be very  careful this time. We do not want the enemy to laugh at us. The  enemy fears us. It says: This land has an armed and trained  people, prepared for confrontation. It will bring us other  methods. We must be careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans:  ""Hang them in the public square,"" ""O leader, do not show mercy  to any traitor""]    Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact  that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed  resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it  enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant  to this.    This is what we should be aware of as a people who want to  be  victorious in this battle, and this confrontation, and allow  this period to pass without the enemy achieving victory over us.    Our forefathers fought the Italians for years and years. The  Italians had a super power state in those days in comparison to  the Libyans. [passage omitted]    We are now in better shape. We are a trained and armed  people and more numerous in number. Our population is larger  now than in the past. We have industry, agriculture, water, and  potential. We can fight and continue the battle for a longer  period. Your kinsfolk and forefathers here were the area's  lions and protectors. They confronted the Italians and offered  their lives in sacrifice to prevent them advancing to 'Ujaylat,  Jabal Nafusa, and Fazzan.    What is required of you in this place, which is called Al  'Assah, is that you be the guards...[crowd shouts slogans] What  is required of you is that you will be protectors of the area  once again as your fathers and forefathers had been.    Defense is a patriotic duty to protect the economy, the  national product, and the Libyan dinar. We are not going to  sell our homeland for our stomach. We do not protect our  borders by a police force, by helicopters, or desert vehicles.  We protect them by our conscience and our patriotism. We are  committed, not to do these things [encroach on borders] and we  will prevent anyone from doing them. That is protection.  [crowd chants]    Our ancestors neither lived by smuggling nor did they rely  on  Italian goods. How could they have fought against Italy if they  had been importing everything from it? We are now in a  situation as if we were fighting against America, so we are not  importing American goods. We are doing without them. We are as  if we were fighting against France and Britain, and we are not  importing goods from Paris and London. Our independence,  sovereignty, and honor are above goods. [passage omitted]    Those who stretched their hands and dealt in francs sold us  out. They enabled the Italians to reach Fazzan [in southern  Libya] and enabled them to trample over the bodies of our  martyrs.    The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to  public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family  and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who  can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede  into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn  and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying  out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much  you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a  deluge. [crowd chants]    There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that  those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the  court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are  determined to strom the house and property of a traitor, and to  burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable.  In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation  should come to this, but those are the masses.    Traitors used to be referred to the law and the court and  that was sufficient for us. However, the masses are above the  law, above courts and above everything. [passage omitted]    The masses can storm any place without mercy or pity where  treachery is concerned. This has occurred before my eyes.  Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied  evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family  were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said:  Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will  storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of  treachery.    Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers  are treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous;  al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous;  the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have  foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in  smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer  goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If  we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of  awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what  weapons are required for the battle.    If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do  not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver,  aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that  corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face  with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel  weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One  should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must  know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and  the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is  shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then  that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver  cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who  would defeat you.    Let us live like our forefathers used to live, a clean life,  a life accepted by our own conscience, a life that allows us to  be free with our heads held high, relying on our land, our  animals, our farming, our trees, palm trees, olive trees,  relying on ourselves, our own production. But if we keep  looking across the sea at their consumer goods and then  challenge them, we would not be able to do so. I have already  told you: If our forefathers were relying on Italian canned  food, or if they were dealing in Italian lire, then we would not  have been able to fight Italy. How could we have fought Italy  while eating, drinking, and dressing with its products? [passage  omitted]    Great, that is it, exactly. Great. In reality you people in  Al 'Assah area do not need a speech from me. You do not need a  long speech. You understand what I have been saying. [passage  omitted]     "

Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, who fought alongside Fidel Castro in  the revolution 30 years ago, was executed by firing squad at dawn Thursday  along with three other officers after being convicted in a $3-million  drug-smuggling and corruption scandal.    Their deaths, reported by the Cuban news agency AIN, came as no surprise to a  nation that for a month watched the progress of the trial on television.    The drug scandal has stunned and embarrassed Castro and his Communist  government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that Cuba was being used to  smuggle drugs into the United States.    Found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by firing squad by a  three-member military court last Friday were Ochoa; a former Interior Ministry  official, Col. Antonio de la Guardia; a secret police official, Maj. Amado  Padron, and Ochoa's military aide, Capt. Jorge Martinez.    ""Today at dawn a sentence dictated by a special military tribunal was carried  out against the accused,"" said Prensa Latina, identifying the four without  further comment in a dispatch from Havana.    The four former officers, who were arrested in June, were also found guilty of  drug trafficking and hostile acts toward foreign nations.    Last weekend, Cuba's Supreme Court and its Council of State, which is headed by  Castro, refused to overturn the sentences. The Cuban leader later declared that  even if he had the power he would not stop the executions.    They four were among 14 senior military and Interior Ministry officials  convicted by the tribunal of embezzlement and helping Colombia's notorious  Medellin drug cartel smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States. They  were said to have accepted at least $3.4 million in bribes.      Smuggled Other Goods    The officers were also convicted of black marketeering and smuggling diamonds,  ivory, sugar, fine wools, manufactured goods and U.S. dollars.    All admitted guilt but asked for mercy based on their records and contrition.  The other 10 officers, including one woman, were sentenced to terms that ranged  from 10 to 30 years in prison.    Two Cabinet ministers also were fired in the crackdown.    The death sentences were carried out despite appeals for clemency from Pope  John Paul II, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.    Ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised proceedings that began  June 12. Cubans gathered around their sets in fascination not just at the drug  scandal but also because of the scenario of unbridled greed that unrolled.    The trial was shown nightly on national television. Cubans watched as Ochoa,  dressed in his general's uniform, with Cuba's highest decoration, Hero of the  Republic of Cuba, pinned to his jacket, said: ""One pays for treason with one's  life.""    For many Cubans, the trial was traumatic. The 57-year-old Ochoa was a  much-decorated and popular hero who most recently commanded the victorious  Cuban forces in Ethiopia during its war with Somalia that began in 1978 before  becoming chief of the Cuban military mission in Angola.

Cubans watched as Ochoa,  dressed in his general's uniform, with Cuba's highest decoration, Hero of the  Republic of Cuba, pinned to his jacket, said: ""One pays for treason with one's  life.""    For many Cubans, the trial was traumatic. The 57-year-old Ochoa was a  much-decorated and popular hero who most recently commanded the victorious  Cuban forces in Ethiopia during its war with Somalia that began in 1978 before  becoming chief of the Cuban military mission in Angola.

0,FT944-11320 ,"FT944-11320 _AN-EKGC8AC9FT 941107   FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: War and peace   During the past 10 days, the world has glimpsed the possibility that the Bosnian army will retake by force some of the territory which it has failed to gain by diplomacy. If the Bosnian government gains are sustained - and this is still in the balance - that may possibly be one of the least bad developments in that terrible situation. Western leaders will no doubt deplore further death and destruction and rightly condemn the Bosnian army if it violates UN safe havens. But having recognised the Sarajevo authorities as the legitimate rulers of an independent state, the world cannot, with any consistency, condemn the Bosnian army for winning back some of the land taken from it. The west may also hope that the latest battles will create a better chance of a viable settlement than has existed since the Serbs seized control of about 70 per cent of Bosnia. Until recently, the Serbs had little incentive to negotiate a peace on terms which others might consider reasonable; the Bosnian army's successes make this somewhat more likely. If peace negotiations should indeed result, the cautious strategy of the five-nation contact group for bringing the parties together will prove to have been partially vindicated. If the west had intervened directly, either with its own air power or conspicuous deliveries of big guns, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, would have come under stronger pressure to rescue the Bosnian Serbs. Although Mr Milosevic is widely blamed for starting the war, his decision to isolate the Bosnian Serbs has contributed to the recent successes of their enemies. Even if a more even balance of forces can eventually bring the conflict to an end, there is no ground for complacency. Worse horrors may be in store. The United Nations forces in the region are trying to mitigate the effects of the fighting on civilians by distributing aid and maintaining safe havens. The new fighting redoubles the moral imperative to demilitarise and protect the six UN-designated safe areas, a task which should not be confused with any ambition to influence the course of the war. These efforts by the UN have been undermined by all the parties, including the Bosnian government. The UN deserves support in facing down, by all means at its disposal, any challenges to agreed peacekeeping arrangements The outside world's moral influence over Bosnia's leaders is weak, given that it failed to stop the atrocities by the Serbs. However, if the Sarajevo authorities wish to retain the sympathy they have gained among western nations, they must address two questions: will they help their own civilians by co-operating more with the UN? And will they show mercy to Serb civilians in their army's path?   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

It says:    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher returned for a  new  tour of the Middle East after this region witnessed disgraceful  events between his current and previous tour. We also believe  he has no plan to end the region's grievances and sufferings, as  well as Israel's terrorism and tyranny.    As an example, we would like to mention the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and the killing of innocent worshipers in the mosque by  Israeli settlers, as well as the continued killing of the sons  of the Palestinian people. The United Nations has condemned  that terrorism and crime and stressed the need to find  international protection for the Palestinians, but the United  States voiced its biased reservations about some of the  provisions. [passage omitted]    We also demand that the unjust blockade, which the United  States has imposed on Iraq's people in order to plunder the oil  wealth in the region, undeterred by law or conscience, be lifted.    Regarding Jordan, we can say that despite the statements the  U.S. secretary of states made on several occasions that Jordan  is a friendly country and maintains cordial relations with his  country, the United States is still exercising, under UN cover,  these cordial relations with a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, in  order to maintain the interests of its servants in the Arab  world and Israel and to harm Jordan's economic status. As some  media organizations say, the United States is dissatisfied with  democracy in Jordan because any attempt by neighboring Arab  countries to follow suit will threaten its servants' regimes.  Despite all this, the United States urges Jordan to continue  peace talks with Israel under the usual U.S. sponsorship of  peace conferences.     "

With obvious  instigation from Vladislav Ardzinba's fascist regime, the  criminal and socioeconomic situation in Abkhazia has sharply  exacerbated. It can be said with confidence that complex  anarchy is reigning there. The law enforcement bodies fail  completely to monitor the situation, let alone the repressions  carried out against the remaining Georgian population.  Abkhazians and the Russian speaking population -- Russians,  Armenians, Greeks, and others who are forced to leave the  autonomous republic of Abkhazia and seek refuge somewhere else,  are also alarmed.    In only the Ochamchire and Gali rayons over the last three  months -- October-December -- about 40 Abkhaz combatants were  killed in clashes between separate individuals and armed units  over pillaged goods. On 10-11 January this year, almost a real  war was waged between the Abkhaz population of the villages of  Chlou and (Arasartikhi) in Ochamchire rayon. Famous people  living in Abkhazia are falling victim to the lawlessness of  Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries. The public was alarmed over  the news of the beastly killing of Shitnik, the chief doctor of  Sukhumi's ambulance service. Especially worrying are instances  of the mass killing of people of various nationalities. The  mercenary executioners Balov, Smetanin, and Krasnov set up an  horrific slaughterhouse in the village of Odishi in Sukhumi  rayon as a result of which about 30 people were killed, mostly  of Greek nationality.    It is obvious that we are dealing with the genocide of the  Greek population. Against this background, the populist  statement by the Gudauta leader [Ardzinba] about the need for  those Greeks who were evicted from Abkhazia in the 1940s to  return to their homes can only be described as cynical.  Drawing your attention to the above-mentioned atrocities, we  call on the world community to strictly condemn the criminal  acts committed by the Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries as well  as their Gudauta patrons.

The head of the FIS abroad, Rabah Kebir, who normally lives  in Germany, called on international human rights organisations  to condemn what he said was a wave of killings.    A number of anonymous callers have also phoned AFP in Paris  over the past few days to denounce what they say have been  ""kidnappings"" and ""killings"" by the army.    ""Amongst the many examples of barbarity (...), one notes  over  the past few days the assassination of 82 civilians in Blida,  south of Algiers, of 120 others between Meftah and Sidi Moussa,  east of Algiers,"" said the statement dated March 31.    ""Not a day goes by without word of collective killings  across  the country (...) people are taken from their homes and then  assassinated, slaughtered and their bodies abandoned in the  streets to create an atmosphere of fear amongst the population,""  the statement said.    Women are also victims of such ""institutional terrorism"",  the  statement said, referring to the killing of two women wearing  the Islamic veil at Boudaouaou, east of Algiers, on Tuesday.    Anonymous telephone callers said they had witnessed the  ""execution"" of at least 10 people Wednesday at Les Eucalyptus,  an Islamic fundamentalist stronghold in the southeast suburbs of  Algiers.    The callers said the 10 were killed in reprisal for the  death  of 10 soldiers and para-military police caught in an ambush.    One caller said he had seen a man deliberately ""run over"" by  a tank on the main street of Les Eucalyptus.    Algerian authorities have blamed the FIS for a wave of  terrorist attacks in the country since January 1992 when general  elections the Islamists were poised to win were annulled.     "

[koranic verse] Prayers and peace be upon our master Muhammad  and all his kin and companions. In these blessed days all our  people from al-Maharah to Sa'dah are hoping for an end to the  crisis that has affected every aspect of our lives and  aggravated our people's pain and suffering. Our people have been  waiting for their political leaders to return to attend to their  duties and for state agencies to fulfill their Constitutional  tasks and carry out the accord document after it was signed in  Amman on 10 Ramadan [20 February].    Thus, our patient people are surprised by the military  movements and the incidents that have sparked off the crisis  anew and threatened the unity, security, and stability of the  homeland. These incidents were orchestrated as a device to  weasel out of the responsibility for implementing the provisions  of the accord document and then to drift to only God knows what  fate.    The higher council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping has been  following these developments and the irresponsible media hype  about them. It contacted official circles with the aim of  bringing the situation under control and keeping irresponsible  actions from getting out of hand. The higher council condemns  these regrettable incidents that can only harm the homeland and  the citizens and play into the hands of the haters of the  homeland's unity, security, and stability. It calls on all the  parties to be equal to their religious, national, and historic  responsibilities and work toward bringing these incidents to an  end and ensuring that they do not recur. The council calls for  the relocation of all military units to their positions and for  the Armed Forces to be kept out of political and party disputes.  This is in order for them to remain a source of strength for  the homeland and a shield for the country's sovereignty and  independence and the community's security and welfare and to be  kept unaffected by political considerations and narrow party  interests.    The council calls on all political forces and the citizens  from all walks of life to exercise vigilance and not allow  themselves to be drawn into any actions that may hurt the  homeland or its unity. It also calls for forestalling the  advocates of sedition who do not care for the well-being of the  Yemeni people and are used to living in a climate of bloody  conflict and deception and breaking promises and breaching  charters.    The higher council calls on the competent authorities to  speed up the enquiry into the incidents and name those who were  responsible and disclose facts to the people lest they remain at  the mercy of internal and external misinformation. We pray that  God keep our country and people and spare us all [word  indistinct] and lead us all to all that is good and our leaders  to the right ways.     "

GOLDMAN, Times Staff Writer      NEW YORK      More than 5,000 demonstrators protesting the slaying of a black teen-ager in  the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and the killing of former Black Panther  leader Huey Newton in Oakland closed the Brooklyn Bridge on Thursday, but were  thwarted by police when they tried to march on City Hall.    As the marchers, carrying twin coffins and chanting: ""No Justice, No Death,""  were met at the Brooklyn end of the bridge by a massive outpouring of police,  violence broke out. Bottles and sticks were thrown at police. At least 23  officers were injured and at least five protesters were arrested.    Massive traffic jams were created by the demonstration and by a police order  shutting down subway stations at both ends of the bridge to prevent protesters  from crossing into Manhattan.    The dramatic scene capped a day of fast-moving developments in the Bensonhurst  case, including the arrest of the prime suspect in the killing of 16-year-old  Yusef Hawkins a week ago.    Joseph Fama, 18, the subject of an intense manhunt, surrendered Thursday in  Oneonta in Upstate New York.    ""He was running like hell and scared to death and knew that we were breathing  on his heels,"" said Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward after Fama was returned  to the city.    Witnesses have told police that Fama shot Hawkins after a crowd of 30 or more  whites, some carrying baseball bats, had surrounded Hawkins and three black  friends, who had entered the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used  car. Police said the four blacks were mistaken for friends of a white woman in  the neighborhood, who earlier had reportedly jilted one of the attackers for a  black.    The killing of Hawkins has become a symbol of racial divisiveness in the city  and has taken center stage in New York City's closely contested mayoral  primary. The killing was one of the worst racial incidents in New York since  1986, when a black man was chased into traffic on a busy highway and killed by  a speeding car in the Queens neighborhood of Howard Beach near Kennedy Airport.    In the days after Hawkins' killing, leaders in New York from all major  religious groups have appealed for calm. But the demonstration Thursday raised  new fears of heightened tensions in the days before the mayoral primary on  Sept. 12.    Several extremely bitter demonstrations have been held in Bensonhurst. Scenes  of protesters being jeered by whites, some of whom held up watermelons, have  been shown on television and have changed the climate of the campaign.    Hawkins' funeral Wednesday in a small, yellow brick church attracted most of  the mayoral contenders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. All but David Dinkins, who is  seeking to become New York's first black mayor and whom polls show running  virtually even with three-term Mayor Edward I. Koch, were booed by crowds in  the predominantly black neighborhood.    In an effort to mitigate tensions in the Bensonhurst case, black clergymen and  clergymen from the troubled Brooklyn neighborhood met on Thursday with local  leaders in a church in the area of small shops and homes. Dinkins attended the  gathering. Afterward, all agreed that church bells in Bensonhurst would ring  Sunday in the name of racial peace.    But the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Brooklyn preacher without a pulpit, who had taken  part in the Bensonhurst marches, on Wednesday called for a ""day of outrage""  demonstration for Thursday.      Traffic Halted on Avenue    At one point the march stretched for more than half a mile through downtown  Brooklyn, halting traffic on Flatbush Avenue, one of the area's main arteries.    ""This was an absolute success!"" Sonny Carson, a black community leader, told  the Associated Press. ""This will make the city wake up. This will let the city  know that there are young black people who will not take this anymore.""    After the violence at the foot of the bridge, many of the demonstrators marched  down Fulton Street into the predominantly black area of Bedford-Stuyvesant.    Passing a white-owned pizza parlor, some of the demonstrators, shouting slogans  against the police and against Italian-Americans, told blacks eating inside the  pizzeria to get out. The owner quickly closed the shop as the taunts of the  crowd rang out in the gathering dusk.    Newton's slaying, the second focus of the protest, occurred a day earlier than  Hawkins' shooting. Oakland police described Newton's death as a drug-related  homicide. Authorities have ascribed no racial motivations to his death and no  arrest has been made.    Before the New York protest, New York City detectives drove to Oneonta and  placed Fama under arrest.    Oneonta police Sgt. Joe Redmond told United Press International that Fama,  wearing blue jeans and a gray sweat shirt, had arrived at 2 a.m. in the police  station in the small city, which is dominated by two colleges and sits in the  middle of rolling dairy farmland about 40 miles southwest of Albany.    ""He hitchhiked up here. He doesn't know anybody in the area,"" Redmond said. ""He  had no place to stay.""    Describing Fama as nervous and frightened, Redmond said Fama ""had just been  eating potato chips and sodas, picking a sandwich up here and there, and he  just decided to come in.    ""He looked tired and had a couple day's growth of beard.""    A Brooklyn grand jury Wednesday indicted two suspects on charges of  second-degree murder and other charges in the attack. Four other Bensonhurst  youths have been charged but not indicted.    Wednesday's murder indictments were a surprise because police had said they  were still seeking the suspected gunman. Officials, however, said the pair were  charged for their alleged complicity in the attack.

Joseph Fama, 18, the subject of an intense manhunt, surrendered Thursday in  Oneonta in Upstate New York.    ""He was running like hell and scared to death and knew that we were breathing  on his heels,"" said Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward after Fama was returned  to the city.    Witnesses have told police that Fama shot Hawkins after a crowd of 30 or more  whites, some carrying baseball bats, had surrounded Hawkins and three black  friends, who had entered the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used  car. Police said the four blacks were mistaken for friends of a white woman in  the neighborhood, who earlier had reportedly jilted one of the attackers for a  black.    The killing of Hawkins has become a symbol of racial divisiveness in the city  and has taken center stage in New York City's closely contested mayoral  primary. The killing was one of the worst racial incidents in New York since  1986, when a black man was chased into traffic on a busy highway and killed by  a speeding car in the Queens neighborhood of Howard Beach near Kennedy Airport.    In the days after Hawkins' killing, leaders in New York from all major  religious groups have appealed for calm. But the demonstration Thursday raised  new fears of heightened tensions in the days before the mayoral primary on  Sept. 12.    Several extremely bitter demonstrations have been held in Bensonhurst. Scenes  of protesters being jeered by whites, some of whom held up watermelons, have  been shown on television and have changed the climate of the campaign.    Hawkins' funeral Wednesday in a small, yellow brick church attracted most of  the mayoral contenders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. All but David Dinkins, who is  seeking to become New York's first black mayor and whom polls show running  virtually even with three-term Mayor Edward I. Koch, were booed by crowds in  the predominantly black neighborhood.    In an effort to mitigate tensions in the Bensonhurst case, black clergymen and  clergymen from the troubled Brooklyn neighborhood met on Thursday with local  leaders in a church in the area of small shops and homes. Dinkins attended the  gathering. Afterward, all agreed that church bells in Bensonhurst would ring  Sunday in the name of racial peace.    But the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Brooklyn preacher without a pulpit, who had taken  part in the Bensonhurst marches, on Wednesday called for a ""day of outrage""  demonstration for Thursday.      Traffic Halted on Avenue    At one point the march stretched for more than half a mile through downtown  Brooklyn, halting traffic on Flatbush Avenue, one of the area's main arteries.    ""This was an absolute success!"" Sonny Carson, a black community leader, told  the Associated Press. ""This will make the city wake up. This will let the city  know that there are young black people who will not take this anymore.""    After the violence at the foot of the bridge, many of the demonstrators marched  down Fulton Street into the predominantly black area of Bedford-Stuyvesant.    Passing a white-owned pizza parlor, some of the demonstrators, shouting slogans  against the police and against Italian-Americans, told blacks eating inside the  pizzeria to get out. The owner quickly closed the shop as the taunts of the  crowd rang out in the gathering dusk.    Newton's slaying, the second focus of the protest, occurred a day earlier than  Hawkins' shooting. Oakland police described Newton's death as a drug-related  homicide. Authorities have ascribed no racial motivations to his death and no  arrest has been made.    Before the New York protest, New York City detectives drove to Oneonta and  placed Fama under arrest.    Oneonta police Sgt. Joe Redmond told United Press International that Fama,  wearing blue jeans and a gray sweat shirt, had arrived at 2 a.m. in the police  station in the small city, which is dominated by two colleges and sits in the  middle of rolling dairy farmland about 40 miles southwest of Albany.    ""He hitchhiked up here. He doesn't know anybody in the area,"" Redmond said. ""He  had no place to stay.""    Describing Fama as nervous and frightened, Redmond said Fama ""had just been  eating potato chips and sodas, picking a sandwich up here and there, and he  just decided to come in.    ""He looked tired and had a couple day's growth of beard.""    A Brooklyn grand jury Wednesday indicted two suspects on charges of  second-degree murder and other charges in the attack. Four other Bensonhurst  youths have been charged but not indicted.    Wednesday's murder indictments were a surprise because police had said they  were still seeking the suspected gunman. Officials, however, said the pair were  charged for their alleged complicity in the attack.

0,FT932-1561 ,"FT932-1561 _AN-DFWCJADOFT 930623   FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: BTU tax RIP   THE ENERGY tax which President Clinton announced in February was that rare thing: a tax that would raise money and improve economic efficiency at the same time. Four months of special pleading later, the chances that it will do either are fading fast. Mr Clinton's difficulties hold important lessons for governments chasing the same prize. When first unveiled, the BTU (British thermal unit) tax was the cornerstone of Mr Clinton's deficit-cutting package, intended to raise Dollars 72bn over five years. The final version has yet to emerge from Congress. But the idea of taxing fuels on their thermal content has already been dropped. So too has the revenue figure, now likely to be some two-thirds lower. What went wrong? As with much of the Clinton plan, the BTU tax began life as a careful compromise, less green - and trickier to collect - than the carbon tax the purists would have wanted, but apparently more likely to survive. Unfortunately, the horse trading did not end there. Both efficiency and clarity of purpose were the losers. Increasing the price of fuels with a tax improves economic efficiency to the extent that it makes people pay the full social cost of using the fuel. Not all fuels impose the same costs. If a tax is to capture the differences between them, it must be shamelessly selective, hurting some energy users more than others. The problem is finding a way to sell such a seemingly capricious tax. As Mr Clinton discovered, the result can be a costly mess. Complicated taxes are usually the result of pinning several distinct aims to a single mast. In the case of the BTU tax, Mr Clinton tried to meet an environmental objective, while giving into the demands of 'dirty' fuel lobbies and holding on to future revenues. The predictable result was an exemption-ridden monstrosity, too complicated to collect or, indeed, to defend. When he abandoned the BTU tax altogether on June 9, it was a mercy killing. Finding a replacement seems just a local US difficulty. Some kind of generalised fuel levy is likely, along with further budget cuts to make up the revenue shortfall. Both are clearly desirable in their own right. For environmentalists, however, a uniform tax is a blunt instrument, since it fails to match tax paid to relative damage done. This is why non-Americans should pause. There may be little new in the sight of yet another US president trying to introduce the kind of fuel taxes which have long been accepted in other OECD countries. But Mr Clinton began on a fresher path, which many in Japan and the EC wish to follow. His ambition was to combine an environmentally nuanced idea of efficiency with cutting the budget deficit. After the death of the BTU tax, governments may well wonder whether both can be tackled at once.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The item, published under the heading ""Opinion Concerning  the  Attack,"" comprises four pie charts and four graphs that show the  results of the survey, which questioned an unidentified number  of Monterrey and Mexico City citizens on issues ranging from the  possibility of rescheduling the presidential elections to who  should replace Colosio on the PRI presidential ticket.    Most citizens polled in Monterrey and Mexico City believe  that the date for the scheduled 21 August elections should not  be changed and that there likely is a covert mastermind behind  the crime. Of the citizens polled in Mexico City, 54 percent  responded by saying the date of the elections should not be  changed, while 51 percent of Monterrey citizens opposed changing  the date of the elections. Of those polled in Mexico City, some  15 percent believe opposition parties are behind Colosio's  killing, followed by fellow PRI members (11 percent); Manuel  Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas (9 percent); the government (9 percent); Party of the  Democratic Revolution candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas (3 percent);  the Zapatist National Liberation Army (1 percent); drug  traffickers (1 percent); and foreigners (1 percent). Also, 39  percent of those polled in both Mexico City and Monterrey said  they believe the motive behind the killing was political.    Meanwhile, 20 percent of those polled in Mexico City said  the  killing will bring about more violence and will destabilize the  country. Regarding people's preferences to replace Colosio, 36  percent of those polled in Mexico City said they favor Manuel  Camacho Solis, who was followed by Pedro Aspe Armella (4  percent), Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon (6 percent), Fernando  Ortiz Arana (5 percent), Jaime Serra Puche (2 percent), Jorge  Carpizo (6 percent), and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios (2 percent).

The head of the FIS abroad, Rabah Kebir, who normally lives  in Germany, called on international human rights organisations  to condemn what he said was a wave of killings.    A number of anonymous callers have also phoned AFP in Paris  over the past few days to denounce what they say have been  ``kidnappings'' and ``killings'' by the army.    ``Amongst the many examples of barbarity (...), one notes  over the past few days the assassination of 82 civilians in  Blida, south of Algiers, of 120 others between Meftah and Sidi  Moussa, east of Algiers,'' said the statement dated 31 March.    ``Not a day goes by without word of collective killings  across the country (...) people are taken from their homes and  then assassinated, slaughtered and their bodies abandoned in the  streets to create an atmosphere of fear amongst the  population,'' the statement said.    Women are also victims of such ``institutional terrorism,''  the statement said, referring to the killing of two women  wearing the Islamic veil at Boudaouaou, east of Algiers, on  Tuesday.    Anonymous telephone callers said they had witnessed the  ``execution'' of at least 10 people Wednesday at Les Eucalyptus,  an Islamic fundamentalist stronghold in the southeast suburbs of  Algiers.    The callers said the 10 were killed in reprisal for the  death  of 10 soldiers and para-military police caught in an ambush.    One caller said he had seen a man deliberately ``run over''  by a tank on the main street of Les Eucalyptus.    Algerian authorities have blamed the FIS for a wave of  terrorist attacks in the country since January 1992 when general  elections the Islamists were poised to win were annulled.     "

By T.W. McGARRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Just over 21 years after the death of her son in a long-forgotten American  rescue operation in Africa, a San Fernando Valley woman will visit his grave at  Forest Lawn this week and place a single rose on the grass.    The ability to observe the anniversary of his death at the graveside for the  first time will mark her victory in a struggle with two governments for more  than two decades.    Until two months ago the body of Richard Jacox lay in a deliberately unmarked  and obscured grave in the Nigerian province of Biafra, where he died in the  crash of a C-97 cargo plane loaded with fish and cornmeal as it tried to land  on a jungle highway at night.    Jacox was one of the volunteers who flew for the United States as part of an  international airlift to bring food to the starving Biafrans during their  unsuccessful war to secede from Nigeria. Many of them, such as Jacox, belonged  to a California Air National Guard unit based until recently at Van Nuys  Airport.    Ever since the crash, his widowed mother, Billie Jacox, has badgered the State  Department, the Nigerian government, United Nations diplomats -- anyone she  thought could help return her son's remains. They have included every U.S.  President since Lyndon B. Johnson. She acquired drawers and boxfuls of  correspondence and stories about her campaign in American and Nigerian  newspapers, all leading nowhere.    ""Dick was my life,"" Jacox said. The walls and shelves of her home are filled  with photos of her son. She could not live with the thought that he would not  be buried in the family cemetery plot with her and her late husband, she said.    The Nigerians regarded the airlift mercy pilots as mercenaries who prolonged  the civil war. Until this year they rejected all Jacox's overtures.    ""They wouldn't even let me have a visa to get into the country to see the  grave,"" she said.    Jacox's quest took a turn for the better after she told her saga to Santa  Barbara attorney Edward Medvene last year.    ""My wife knew Billie as a friend,"" Medvene said recently. ""She was at a  stalemate and asked me to take a look at this thing. It was an incredible  story.""    Medvene contacted John W. Foley Jr., a retired State Department officer who had  tried several times to help Billie Jacox. Foley was connected to the airlift as  director for Nigerian affairs during the Biafran War. He had located the graves  of Jacox and about 25 other airmen who died in the airlift before he left  Africa in 1972.    ""Foley confirmed that her story was accurate and that he had been to the  cemetery and seen the grave,"" Medvene said. ""He thought a letter to the State  Department from someone prominent in the government might help.""    The U.S. portion of the airlift -- organized by an interdenominational  religious group called Joint Church Aid -- had received support from the Nixon  Administration.    And Medvene had an old friend, Herbert W. Miller, Nixon's Washington attorney.  ""I called Miller last October and asked if Nixon would help,"" Medvene said.    According to Miller, Nixon wrote to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.  Eagleburger, suggesting that relations with Nigeria had become sufficiently  friendly to ask for the return of Jacox's body on humanitarian grounds.    Eagleburger's intervention succeeded, Miller said. Foley, coming out of  retirement for one mission as a favor to Billie Jacox, went to Nigeria with  State Department backing in June, located and disinterred the body, Miller and  Medvene said.    Foley declined to comment, saying ""the State Department made a commitment to  the Nigerians that we wouldn't talk about it.""    In an earlier interview, Foley had described finding the graves near St.  Teresa's, a Catholic Church in the jungle next to the two-lane road that was  once a makeshift airstrip, Biafra's only link with the outside world.    A caretaker ""still had a diagram that showed where the graves were, and he took  me to the site, way back in the boondocks,"" Foley said.    The food airlift was one of the most dramatic chapters of the Biafran war of  1967-70, in which the oil-rich eastern provinces of Nigeria tried to secede.    Nigerian federal forces occupied the ports and food became critically short in  Biafra. Western newspapers and TV screens were filled with pictures of starving  children, emaciated stick figures or with bellies bloated by kwashiorkor, a  wasting disease caused by protein deficiency. Most of the estimated 600,000 to  1 million deaths in the war were blamed on kwashiorkor.    Pressure mounted from world public opinion to do something for the starving  Biafrans. Church groups and the International Red Cross massed cargo planes on  Portuguese-held islands off the coast of Nigeria, a few hours flying time from  the improvised airstrip at Uli.    Because gunrunners flew the same routes, Nigeria regarded the airlift planes as  legitimate military targets and sometimes attacked them with MIGs and  antiaircraft guns. The threat from fighters restricted the airlift to night  flights. Landing on the thinly paved road, by the light of kerosene torches or  auto headlights, was perilous.    At the height of the airlift in the summer of 1969, after the United States had  become involved, 40 flights a night carried 500 tons of food into Uli.    Richard Jacox, then 25, died there because he did a friend a favor.    A Glendale native and 1961 Birmingham High School graduate, he joined the Air  National Guard's 146th Tactical Airlift Wing at Van Nuys Airport in 1965.  Because the wing had been equipped with the C-97 cargo planes being used in the  airlift, dozens of its members volunteered for it, saying they were acting as  civilians.    Jacox's mother knows far more than she otherwise would have about her son's  last hours because of a remarkable coincidence: Her brother, Robert J. Leigh,  an aircraft mechanic at Van Nuys Airport, was with him.    About sundown on the evening of Sept. 26, 1969, Richard Jacox was reading a  paperback book on the steps of Fat Freddy's, a bar on the Portuguese island of  Sao Tome where the airlift crews hung out.    A fellow cargo-handler from the Air Guard back in the Valley asked for a favor.    Would Jacox switch planes with him that night? If the friend flew on the plane  Jacox was supposed to be on, the pilot would let the friend log training time  as a flight engineer.    Sure, Jacox said. He headed for the flight line, tucking his novel into his  pocket. It was ""Fate Is the Hunter,"" a book by Ernest K. Gann about how casual  decisions lead airmen into peril.    About three hours later, the plane Jacox had volunteered to work on crashed  into the jungle and exploded, killing all five men aboard.    Leigh, whose job was to work on the planes in Sao Tome, saw them take off and  return each night, but he had never been to Biafra. Not until he heard his  nephew had been killed.    He volunteered to join a crash investigation team of four Americans who went in  on a West German DC-6 the following night, because he wanted a death  certificate for insurance purposes.    ""If it wasn't for the fact that he was my nephew, I wouldn't have tried to be a  hero and get in there,"" he said. ""There was antiaircraft firing at us on the  way in and on the way out.""    The wreckage was scattered over a large area covered with debris. His nephew's  body apparently had been hurled clear of the plane as it disintegrated. It had  not been found.    ""The plane cartwheeled and busted open and exploded,"" he said. ""They had about  35,000 pounds of beans and grain and stuff in burlap sacks. It flew all over. A  nun found the body the next day. It was burned pretty bad, but she recovered  his wallet with it.    ""They had a grave dug for Dickie in the churchyard. The bodies were in little  plywood boxes. The hole wasn't too deep.""    That is where Foley found the body in June. He escorted it as far as London,  from where it was shipped to LAX.    On the afternoon of July 3, about 30 people, including Medvene's wife, attended  a reburial ceremony at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills. The minister who conducted  the service paid tribute to Billie Jacox's long struggle.    ""I waited there until the grave was all filled in,"" she said.    ""He has a tombstone now with his name on it. It bothered me all those years to  think of him in an unmarked grave.    ""I finally have peace now.""

If the friend flew on the plane  Jacox was supposed to be on, the pilot would let the friend log training time  as a flight engineer.    Sure, Jacox said. He headed for the flight line, tucking his novel into his  pocket. It was ""Fate Is the Hunter,"" a book by Ernest K. Gann about how casual  decisions lead airmen into peril.    About three hours later, the plane Jacox had volunteered to work on crashed  into the jungle and exploded, killing all five men aboard.    Leigh, whose job was to work on the planes in Sao Tome, saw them take off and  return each night, but he had never been to Biafra. Not until he heard his  nephew had been killed.    He volunteered to join a crash investigation team of four Americans who went in  on a West German DC-6 the following night, because he wanted a death  certificate for insurance purposes.    ""If it wasn't for the fact that he was my nephew, I wouldn't have tried to be a  hero and get in there,"" he said. ""There was antiaircraft firing at us on the  way in and on the way out.""    The wreckage was scattered over a large area covered with debris. His nephew's  body apparently had been hurled clear of the plane as it disintegrated. It had  not been found.    ""The plane cartwheeled and busted open and exploded,"" he said. ""They had about  35,000 pounds of beans and grain and stuff in burlap sacks. It flew all over. A  nun found the body the next day. It was burned pretty bad, but she recovered  his wallet with it.    ""They had a grave dug for Dickie in the churchyard. The bodies were in little  plywood boxes. The hole wasn't too deep.""    That is where Foley found the body in June. He escorted it as far as London,  from where it was shipped to LAX.    On the afternoon of July 3, about 30 people, including Medvene's wife, attended  a reburial ceremony at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills. The minister who conducted  the service paid tribute to Billie Jacox's long struggle.    ""I waited there until the grave was all filled in,"" she said.    ""He has a tombstone now with his name on it. It bothered me all those years to  think of him in an unmarked grave.    ""I finally have peace now.""

At the same time, at a news conference in  Jerusalem this morning, the organization criticized Israel's  deliberate recruitment of collaborators. Details from reporter  Mark Weiss:    At almost every Betzelem news conference over the years, the  organization has been accused of avoiding the issue of  collaborator killings while concentrating exclusively on human  rights abuses committed by the Israeli authorities. Yuval  Ginbar from Betzelem denies the accusation. [passage omitted]    Between 750 and 950 Palestinians suspected of collaboration  have been killed since the start of the intifadah, many after  suffering severe torture. Both Israeli and Palestinian sources  estimate that more that half of the Palestinians killed as  collaborators did not in fact work for the authorities.  According to a sample investigation conducted by Betzelem, many  of those called collaborators had committed so-called social or  criminal offenses, such as drug-trafficking or homosexuality.  Many suspected collaborators were killed without any prior  interrogation or judicial proceeding.    Betzelem considers the Palestinian political organizations,  whose activists torture and kill, as responsible for these gross  violations of human rights, along with the perpetrators  themselves. The organization calls on the Palestinian political  organizations to put an immediate stop to the torture and  killing of suspected collaborators, to sever all financial and  organizational ties to groups that commit such acts, and to  place suspected perpetrators on trial.    Betzelem also criticizes the Israeli Government for  flaunting  international law, for what it terms the exploitation and  extortion tactics employed to recruit collaborators. The  recruitment of agents from the occupied territories by these  methods is prohibited under the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Betzelem calls on the Israeli Government to end the recruitment  of collaborators, to stop using collaborators in illegal actions  such as violent interrogations, and to enforce the law equally  against collaborators who use violence or commit other criminal  acts.

The chairman of the presidency of the parliament, Pjeter  Arbnori, the vice-premier, Bashkim Kopliku, the chairman of the  DP parliamentary group, Ali Spahia, and the DP Secretary General  Tritan Shehu took part in the meeting.    1994, underlined Mr. Selami, will be marked as the year of  coalition of the left extreme forces directed by the Socialist  Party. The Democratic Alliance Party is taking part openly into  it unfortunately, he said. Shkoder became one of the arenas of  the political tension which is a result of the coordination  between left extremes.    Speaking abut the killing of Gjovalin Cekini, during an  incident on January 14, he said that the Democratic Party has  condemned the crime and holds that he was a victim of the  unnecessary tensions. Regarding accusations against the DP for  the killing are groundless, Mr. Selami said adding that the  Democratic Party has no relations with the crime. ""We will wait  until the verdict is taken and then we shall give our opinion  about these accusations.""    ""We will answer the unbridled antidemocratic propaganda,  which has in its focus the Democratic Party at all its levels,  with the promotion of the reform,"" Mr. Selami said.    Mr. Pjeter Arbnori spoke about the reorganization and  consolidation of the commission of the constitution. He said  that the constitution ""belongs neither to the Democratic Party  nor to the Socialist Party, it belongs to Albania, so we should  compile it together through understanding.""    Mr. Bashkim Kopliku spoke about the economic reform in  Albania, the achievements and the difficulties which have been  encountered as well as about the opinions of the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund with regard to the reform in Albania.

Members of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO) attacked  three villages on December 20, killing traders they accused of  supplying their rivals of the National Patriotic Front of  Liberia (NPFL), the sources said.    Questioned by AFP from Dakar, Guinean Interior Minister  Alseny Rene Gomez confirmed ""the existence of trouble"" along the  border, but declined to give any casualty toll.    Almost all those killed were Malinkes, but the minister said  the massacre had nothing to do with ""an ethnic problem or a  political problem"" among Guineans following a presidential  election here.    Alpha Conde, Guinea's main opposition leader, who is a  Malinke, also said there was no question of ethnic strife among  Guineans.    ""These are ULIMO men who once again have made incursions  into  Guinea, killing Guineans they accuse of cooperating with (NPFL  leader) Charles Taylor,"" he said.    Guinean officials have also accused the NPFL of launching  punitive raids into Guinean territory to kill traders they  accuse of supporting ULIMO.    Both ULIMO and the NPFL are, with the Armed Forces of  Liberia, the army of assassinated President Samuel Doe,  signatories to a peace and disarmament accord reached in Benin  in July after more than three years of civil war.    In a separate development, a first contingent of 173 Ugandan  soldiers arrived in the Liberian capital Monrovia on Friday, to  join the Nigerian-led ECOMOG peacekeeping force first sent to  the war-torn country by other West African states in 1990.    They immediately went on to the iron-ore port of Buchanan,  90  kilometres (55 miles) east of Monrovia, where their headquarters  will be established.    More than 600 soldiers from Tanzania have arrived in Liberia  since December 23 under a plan to reinforce ECOMOG with some  2,55O soldiers from Uganda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, bringing the  force's total strength to 19,000.

Brother dear citizens: On this venerable day of faith, in  which the magnificence of the shining picture of the Islamic  nation manifests itself, represented in the guests of God  visiting the holy places and taking up position in common  worship to the one God on the blessed Mount 'Arafat, and in the  apex of great rites that almost count as the complete pilgrimage  to quote Prophet Muhammad, who said that to climb Mount 'Arafat  amounts to a complete pilgrimage. This is because standing on  Mount 'Arafat [word indistinct] is an important religous event,  where the sentiments of all Muslims gravitate [word indistinct]  the close bond that does not unravel, and that makes us stick  more firmly to it and believe more in the justice of the  virtuous Islamic faith. We thank God for his guidance.    On the occasion of the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, I  take pleasure to send my sincere, heartfelt congratulations to  all members of our people and Arab and Islamic nations, hoping  that when the occasion next comes round all of us will be in the  happiest state possible. This 'Id confirms great values of  sacrifice and self-denial that are today manifest in the heroic  acts of the courageous and faithful sons of our believing and  proud people in the Armed Forces and Security Forces as they  fight battles of sacrifice and self-denial and stand up to  rebellious and secessionist gangs within the leadership of the  Yemeni Socialist Party and display the finest examples of  sacrifice with all courage and chivalry and dedication to the  sacred duty. To them in particular, I send my warmest greetings  on the occasion of 'Id al- Adha [word instinct] what they have  always done in the areas of sacrifice and self-denial and  standing up to the enemies of the people and the homeland and  the enemies of principles, ideals, and values.    Thanks to them, our people have been able to ward off the  dangers that were ignited by the rebellious secessionists,  threatening the homeland's unity and safety. They have  extinguished the fire of those dangers before they became an  overall national ordeal, thus bolstering and fortifying the  people's unity, increasing the firmness of the people's faith in  democracy, and enhancing faith in the present and future of the  new Yemen, the Yemen of unity, freedom, and democracy, the Yemen  of wellbeing, justice, and prosperity.    On this occasion, we beseech Almighty God to have bountiful  mercy on all the martyrs of our people, the martyrs of the  revolution, unity, and democracy, and to elevate their souls to  highest ranks among the prophet's companions and martyrs. We  beseech God to accept the prayers of the pilgrims to holy Mecca,  to guide our steps, and to lead us along the path that pleases  Him. God is all-hearing, ready to answer. Many happy returns.

Dr Zeenat Naquatee said a Kashmiri youth had been trapped by  terrorists. ""I know of drugs being distributed from mosques to  recruit boys,"" she said.    ""One youth is made an addict and he is told he will get the  drug if he recruits ten others. Narco-terrorism is a fact of  life in parts of the Kashmir Valley,"" Dr Naquatee who is from  Srinagar, said. ""Many among the youth had gone insane. They  can't believe what they have done,"" she added.    Dr Naquatee, who is here for a Commonwealth Youth  Conference,  was speaking to journalists yesterday.    She said youths had been taken across the border with  promises of jobs and money. ""They have been forced to write  letters saying all is well with them"" she said. ""But when the  truth has come home, these turned out to be horror stories,"" she  said.    She said now many Kashmiri Muslims are fleeing the Valley to  escape forced recruitment by terrorists. The youth are getting  disillusioned with terrorism, she said. ""So foreigners are  coming from Afghanistan, Sudan and Pakistan. These people are  now killing Kashmiris in Kashmir"" Dr Naquatee said.    She said ""the terrorists speak of a freedom struggle. (But)  did Indians kill Indians when they were struggling for freedom?""  She said the terrorists have brought problems for everyone.  ""It's dark in our homes. We can't go out. We don't know when  firing, killing will happen,"" she said.    Talking about women, Dr Naquatee said they have become the  worst victims of terrorism in the State. But she regretted that  nobody is talking about the human rights of women.    ""Women have no freedom of action or movement, no education,  no medical care. Women have seen their sons snatched away to  join terrorists, their husbands forced to give money at  gunpoint,"" she said. There have been too many ""forced  marriages,"" she said, adding that everyone knows about these.    ""For whose independence are the terrorists fighting? For  that of terrorists trained across the border? Independence  movements come from the people and not from a handful of trained  terrorists,"" she said. The world had seen movements against  Communism. India had seen its independence struggle. ""These  movements came from the people who did not need to be trained  across any border,"" Dr Naquatee said.    Dr Naquatee said the real problem was in Pakistan Occupied  Kashmir (PoK). ""Unlike us, people there do not know what  democracy means"" she said. Kashmiris had a peaceful alliance  with India, she said. ""Otherwise people would have called  Sheikh Abdullah a traitor"" she said.    Pakistan was killing Kashmiris in the name of Islam and  within Pakistan was dividing Muslims among themselves, she  alleged. Within Kashmir, she said, the majority did not want  Pakistan. ""The trouble in any case is only in three or four  districts within Jammu and Kashmir,"" she said.    Terrorists would oppose elections because the gun has given  them power she said. ""When they want money, when they want  something done by a bureaucrat, when they want something from a  shop, they get it at gunpoint,"" she said. But people wanted  elections, she said. ""People need someone they can go and talk  to, someone who will back them,"" she said. ""The majority is  being ordered around by a minority with guns,"" she said.    She said the people were caught between the terrorists and  the security forces. But the trouble had been started by  terrorists, she said. ""The security forces have been there  since 1947. They have been protecting us since then. We had no  problem with them all these years,"" she said. The security  forces have a problem in identifying terrorists, she said. ""If  there had been no sponsored terrorism, there would have been no  excesses,"" Dr Naquatee said.     "

The shootings occurred shortly before 3 p.m. after Alfonso Alonzo Romero, the  owner of El Gato Repair Shop at 1706 W. 1st St., fired the mechanic, Santa Ana  Police Lt. Robert Helton said. Romero then asked the mechanic to return his  uniform, Helton said, and that's when the mechanic pulled out a 9-millimeter  pistol and began shooting.    Although investigators are not certain what happened next, they believe that a  bystander picked up a gun from the body of the dead customer and fired at the  mechanic, hitting him in the head. The mechanic was later pronounced dead at  UCI Medical Center in Orange. Neither the mechanic nor the slain customer was  identified.    The bystander then ran from the repair shop and drove off in a 1981 yellow  Toyota pickup truck. He was last seen heading north on Walnut Street, police  said. A witness, however, said that she saw two men run from the shop.    ""This person on the premises saw the gun, grabbed it and then shot the suspect.  We don't consider him a suspect right now. He is, however, a major material  witness,"" Helton said.    Investigators said they do not know what the bystander did with the gun as he  fled from the auto repair shop. He could face possible charges, but for now he  is only wanted for questioning, Helton said.    Although several witnesses said they heard as many as seven shots, police said  they do not know how many were fired.    ""There was a whole lot of shots fired. We can't make an exact count yet,""  Helton said.    Investigators late Wednesday were interviewing witnesses and trying to piece  together the sequence of events.    Romero, 30, was apparently the first to be shot. He was taken to UCI Medical  Center, where he was listed in critical condition with head and chest wounds.  He underwent surgery late Wednesday.    His 18-year-old wife, Elia Padilla, was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa  Ana, where she was listed in serious condition with wounds in the side and  shoulders.    El Gato Repair is in a small outdoor mall that includes three other auto repair  shops and an upholstery store. Several witnesses were either at El Gato or at  the other stores in the mall, police said.    At least seven witnesses were being questioned by the police Wednesday evening.    Residents near the mall said they heard at least seven shots fired and a woman  screaming. The gunfire sounded like ""a car backfiring,"" said one resident,  Maribel Munoz, 13.    Tillie Flores, who lives on Walnut Street, said she saw not one but two men run  from the mall after the shootings. One man ran north and the other, who police  believe was the bystander who killed the suspect, jumped into a Toyota truck  and sped off.    ""They looked terrified. They did not look like they wanted to be around at  all,"" Flores said.    Staff writers Bob Schwartz, Matt Lait and Davan Maharaj contributed to this  report.

The shootings occurred shortly before 3 p.m. after Alfonso Alonzo Romero, the  owner of El Gato Repair Shop at 1706 W. 1st St., fired the mechanic, Santa Ana  Police Lt. Robert Helton said. Romero then asked the mechanic to return his  uniform, Helton said, and that's when the mechanic pulled out a 9-millimeter  pistol and began shooting.    Although investigators are not certain what happened next, they believe that a  bystander picked up a gun from the body of the dead customer and fired at the  mechanic, hitting him in the head. The mechanic was later pronounced dead at  UCI Medical Center in Orange. Neither the mechanic nor the slain customer was  identified.    The bystander then ran from the repair shop and drove off in a 1981 yellow  Toyota pickup truck. He was last seen heading north on Walnut Street, police  said. A witness, however, said that she saw two men run from the shop.    ""This person on the premises saw the gun, grabbed it and then shot the suspect.  We don't consider him a suspect right now. He is, however, a major material  witness,"" Helton said.    Investigators said they do not know what the bystander did with the gun as he  fled from the auto repair shop. He could face possible charges, but for now he  is only wanted for questioning, Helton said.    Although several witnesses said they heard as many as seven shots, police said  they do not know how many were fired.    ""There was a whole lot of shots fired. We can't make an exact count yet,""  Helton said.    Investigators late Wednesday were interviewing witnesses and trying to piece  together the sequence of events.    Romero, 30, was apparently the first to be shot. He was taken to UCI Medical  Center, where he was listed in critical condition with head and chest wounds.  He underwent surgery late Wednesday.    His 18-year-old wife, Elia Padilla, was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa  Ana, where she was listed in serious condition with wounds in the side and  shoulders.

THE BOY'S FATHER SAID THE PISTOL WAS TAKEN FROM HIS  GARAGE.      By MICHAEL ASHCRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ORANGE      The father of a 12-year-old boy charged with shooting a friend to death in  front of horrified Christmas shoppers at a mall here asked a Juvenile Court  judge for mercy and accepted the blame for the shooting.    ""I am the one who should be incarcerated and not my son,"" Juan Manuel Cardenas  of Orange wrote in Spanish. ""Because my error is not having educated him  properly. Because I never spoke with my son about the dangers of a firearm. . .  . Because if I had not permitted this firearm to be brought to my house, none  of this would have happened.""    Cardenas' son is charged in the fatal shooting of Jacalyn Calabrese, 12, at the  Mall of Orange on Dec. 18. Friends have said the boy had shown a .25-caliber  pistol to companions from his school, Cerro Villa Junior High, as a form of  braggadocio. They have said the boy did not mean to kill Jacalyn.    The father said the pistol belongs to his brother, who travels from San  Francisco to visit his girlfriend in Orange County nearly every weekend. The  father said he let his brother store the pistol in the garage but told him to  hide it in a pile of old clothes.    The boy apparently stumbled across the pistol and took it, the father said.    To protect his father, the boy would not at first tell police where he had  found the pistol, said Deputy Public Defender Chris Hilger, who is representing  the boy.    ""The boy was being a little kid, thinking about his dad,"" Hilger said. ""So he  didn't say where the gun came from. He didn't want to get his dad in trouble.""    For his part, the father did not volunteer information about the pistol either,  for fear that it would make matters worse.    However, he detailed his feelings in a letter that he gave to Hilger, who  released a copy Friday after a pretrial hearing was postponed.    In the letter, the father asked the judge who will be hearing his son's case  for leniency and counseling.    ""Your honor, my son is a good boy who is not lost,"" Cardenas wrote. ""He only  needs your help to continue being a useful man in life.    ""Your honor, you, he who makes the law respectable -- and I respect it. But at  the moment of judging my son, judge him with a little bit of your heart. We are  a united family, and it's in your hands alone to return us to be a united  family, to live eternally grateful.""    Hilger said the boy continues to suffer psychologically as he awaits trial in  Juvenile Hall.    ""He's trying to block it out and pretend it (shooting) never happened,"" Hilger  said. ""When I ask him about it, he twitches and scratches his arm. He won't  answer questions about it. I've stopped asking him about it.""

By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The squirrels seem harmless enough -- furry, little creatures, scurrying busily  across the College of the Canyons campus in search of nuts or food left by  their human friends. But look again.    Squirrels may have cornered the market on cute, but they carry fleas that are  potential carriers of plague, and Los Angeles County health officials have  ordered the Valencia college to get rid of some of the creatures. That mandate  has alarmed some COC students and animal rights activists, and left school  officials reluctantly searching for the best method to carry it out.    ""I don't like killing animals any more than anyone else,"" said Cal Allsup, COC  facilities director. ""But I fully understand that there's a problem and the  squirrels need to be suppressed.""    Although some students and animal rights activists are opposed to killing any  squirrels, others are mostly concerned that it be done humanely.    County agriculture officials recommended killing the squirrels using the  chemicals Diazinon, diphacinone and aluminum phosphide. Diphacinone, an  anti-coagulant, dilutes the squirrels' blood so that it seeps out, causing them  to bleed to death.    Officials said the squirrels would probably return to their burrows to die but  that the bodies of those found aboveground would be disposed of immediately.    Some students and animal rights activists have proposed trapping the squirrels  and putting them to sleep painlessly. Better yet, the squirrels would not have  to be killed at all if they were sprayed with a chemical to eliminate the  fleas, they say.    Squirrels on the Valencia campus are as common as students, and their burrows  dot the hillsides and fields. Some are so tame ""they'll actually come up and  take food out of people's hands,"" Allsup said.    The order to reduce the campus's large squirrel population was issued after a  routine inspection in September.    ""Ground squirrels and the fleas that they carry are important in the  transmission of plague,"" said Franklin Hall, chief of the county Health  Services Department's vector-borne disease control program.    Squirrel eradication programs are common. ""In recent years, there has been an  increase of plague occurring in wild rodents throughout Los Angeles County,"" he  said.    The fleas that live on the squirrels can carry sylvatic plague, Hall said. When  the squirrels come in contact with people or domestic animals, the insects can  be transmitted.    When contracted by people, the disease is known as bubonic plague, whose  symptoms include inflamed lymph glands, fever and delirium. The disease can  lead to death.    Although no squirrels examined on campus have been found to have fleas carrying  plague, the population still must be reduced as a precaution. ""It's similar to  inoculating children for measles,"" Hall said. ""We're taking the measures to  prevent something from occurring rather than waiting for it to occur.""    Last week, the school's board of trustees allocated $5,000 for an eradication  program but did not decide what method should be used.    The plan proposed by the county agricultural commissioner has met with  opposition from some student activists and others.    ""I think that we should look for and find the most humane and realistic method  possible to take care of the problem,"" said Michael Daly, a student. ""I think  ideally we can find a solution where none of the squirrels have to be killed.""    Daly and others have posted Save the Squirrels banners around campus and held  meetings to inform students and faculty members about the issue.    Community animal rights activist Kathleen Ungar said a suppression program was  unnecessary. ""As far as I'm concerned, people overreacted,"" she said.  ""Everyone's just guessing"" that the squirrels might carry the disease.    Daly has expressed concern that the chemicals suggested for use may also harm  people or animals that eat the poisoned squirrels.    Sentiment on campus ranges from apathy to adamant support.    Even before the health department mandate, the squirrels kept groundskeepers  busy. Workers constantly refill holes made on athletic fields by squirrels.  Allsup said squirrels have even caused structural damage to buildings by  burrowing underneath.    ""I say, 'Kill 'em,' "" said Jim Blankenship, a natural resources major. ""I'm an  environmentalist and all that, but they're undermining the grounds.""    But other students disagree, just as adamantly.    ""I don't think they need to suppress them at all,"" said Shannon Stark, 19. ""We  took their area. We destroyed their home, basically, so where else are they  going to live? They're just trying to survive.""    College of the Canyons is all too familiar with animal controversies.    Four years ago, college officials attempted to rid the campus of swallows  roosting on the ledges over the entrance to the campus's main building.    Officials tried driving them off with gooey repellents, sonic beepers and  high-powered water hoses. Nothing seemed to work and six of the birds, which  are a protected species, were killed in the attempts.    Since 1987, however, the school seems to have learned to live with the birds  and now even has a festival celebrating their annual return.    ""The student community and faculty at COC realize the value of having the  swallows come home to their college, and now I would like to see the squirrels  given the same respect,"" Ungar said. ""If we can save the swallows, we can save  the squirrels.""    Although the swallows and squirrels are a cause celebre on campus, officials  have been killing gophers for years without causing an outcry from students or  community animal rights activists.

During these days:    1. Our forces continued to block the entire Sala Krau-Kon  Damrei route. The invading forces were completely cut off from  their communications and supplies.    2. The entire route north of Pailin remained disconnected.  The invading forces tried hard to contact their colleagues by  travelling in small groups on foot through the jungle. We kept  attacking them, though, and they also hit our land mines,  suffering continuous losses. The survivors fled, leaving  ammunition, dried food, and medicine along the way. Some fled  into the dense forests. No one knows whether or not they are  still alive.    3. On 1 April, we launched four attacks on the invading  forces along a stretch of road from Veal Cheng to Sala Krau,  killing 18 of them on the spot and wounding others.    4. The road from Sala Krau to O Rum-el was blocked by our  forces in several places. On 2 April, we attacked the invading  forces fleeing from the western part of Sala Krau in waves,  killing 42 of them.    5. We are continuing to cut off the invading forces from all  corners, and are waiting in the bamboo forests to smash them.  They only have a small number of tanks left. These tanks do  not dare to dash about and launch operations. They are in  hiding, fearful that we will smash them.    6. Every day, we cut off the stretch of road from Suosdei to  Chisang and Treng. The battle is continuing within the  perimeter of Pailin and along the communications lines the  invading forces are trying to use to send supplies to their  colleagues within the perimeter of Pailin. The invading forces  cannot bring their dead or wounded colleagues out because they  cannot get there either on foot or by air. More puppet soldiers  are continuing to desert the Pailin battlefield for fear of  being killed.     "

The leader president received the congratulations of the  heroic fighters at a hall bedecked with the flag of great Iraq.  The flag had the name of martyr Staff General 'Adnan  Khayrallah, whose death was a loss to the people and the Armed  Forces, engraved on it in appreciation of his efforts to build  the Armed Forces and enable them to defend great Iraq and  vindicate its sovereignty and territories, and also in  recognition of the great pioneering role he played in the  liberation of al-Faw.    The president received the great fighters Staff General  Husayn Kamil Hasan, who was in charge of the Republican Guards;  Brigadier General 'Abd Hamid Mahmud, who was the president's  escort; Udayy Saddam Husayn and Qusayy Saddam Husayn, whose  involvement in the battle was ordered by the leader, may God  protect him, so they may perform their duties toward the  homeland; the staff of the Armed Forces General Command; the  Army Corps and division commanders who had the honor of  contributing to the liberation of al-Faw; and escorts of his  excellency the president, may God protect him.    The leader president, may God grant him certain victory,  offered his congratulations on this eternal occasion to the sons  of his steadfast people, as well as the personnel affiliated  with his valiant Armed Forces. He recalled this splendid epic  waged by the Iraqis and the Armed Forces personnel in defense of  their territories, sovereignty, and independence. He also  commended their efforts to safeguard land and honor.    The president, may God protect him, evoked God's mercy on  the  souls of the martyrs who fell on the territory of al-Faw. He  also expressed his affection for their families, noting  appreciation for their positions. He said that the state, the  homeland, and the march are thankful to these patient families.    His excellency the president, may God grant him victory,  delivered a valuable and comprehensive speech, addressing the  injustice done to Iraqis and Arabs when they were branded as  people who are incapable of regaining lost territory.  Nonetheless, al-Faw was the beginning. In al-Faw, there was a  clash of two wills. And in this clash, one will was defeated  and a city was liberated without any (?political) move and  without the intervention of any external factors, the president  said.    In this clash, the aggressive will was [words indistinct].  It recognized in writing that it was defeated. It wished that  it had never lived to see what happened on the war front.    His excellency the president, may God protect him, also  spoke  on the Iraqis' patience and jihad in the course of their efforts  to cope with the embargo, reaffirming that the good is coming,  not because the evildoers intend to remove evil, but rather  because the evil hand that is gripping the sword by the blade  will find itself compelled to release the sword's blade when its  owner pulls it forcefully.

PRISON      From Associated Press      CARSON CITY, Nev.      A convicted killer was slain Friday by sheriff's deputies who stormed into an  infirmary office where he held a woman doctor hostage for 10 hours at the  Northern Nevada Correctional Center, officials said.    Kenneth James Meller, 48, was shot by deputies who tossed a ""flash-and-bang""  concussion grenade into the 12-by-12-foot office and then rushed through a door  and broke through thin wooden wall panels.    Dr. Karen Gedney was stunned by the explosive device but otherwise unhurt.  Meller was shot several times, at least once in the head, after he lunged at  SWAT team deputies with a four-inch knife, prison Director Ron Angelone said.    Prison officials said that during the hostage ordeal Meller talked about  committing suicide today, exactly 14 years after he shot and killed a Nevada  Highway Patrol trooper after a bank robbery.    Angelone said Meller didn't threaten Gedney until the end. ""As it was going  downhill, he said that if anyone showed his face he would hurt her. At that  point we decided to go in.""    The director said negotiators tried unsuccessfully for hours to get Meller to  release the doctor and give up. Even after deputies rushed into the room,  Angelone said the plan was to not shoot Meller unless he attacked first.    Gov. Bob Miller praised Angelone and Carson City Sheriff Paul McGrath for their  handling of the hostage incident. The governor added that Gedney ""is a heroine.  She kept her cool. She was courageous, and if she had not been able to deal  with the situation calmly, it could have gotten out of hand very quickly.""    Meller had gone into the medium-security prison's infirmary, scuffled with  staffers and then took Gedney hostage, saying he was thinking about killing  himself. He made no demands.    Meller was imprisoned for killing Trooper Gary Gifford, who pulled him over  after a $4,250 robbery of a Lake Tahoe bank in 1975. Gifford was the first  trooper shot while on duty in the history of the Nevada Highway Patrol.    Meller was arrested later after taking four people hostage at the north shore  of the lake.

The attorneys who represent Justin Neff met privately with Ventura County  Municipal Court Judge John Hunter to discuss the case, in which Neff is accused  of causing the death of James Anderson, 18, a former fellow student at Fillmore  High School.    Hunter excluded Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes from the meeting at the  request of defense attorneys Michael Norris and Richard Loy -- and despite  objections from Holmes.    Holmes argued that there is no California law allowing criminal defense  attorneys to discuss a case with the judge while excluding the prosecutor. But  Hunter refused to allow Holmes to join the meeting, and sealed the court  reporter's transcript of it.    Holmes moved to have the transcript unsealed, but Hunter denied the motion  after the five-minute meeting with Neff's attorneys.    Norris and Loy refused to tell reporters the nature of the meeting, and Holmes  said he had no idea what they discussed with Judge Hunter.    Meanwhile, Neff stood in the jury box, wearing prison garb and leg irons,  waiting to answer charges of drunk driving and gross vehicular manslaughter  while intoxicated. He appeared healthy, showing little evidence of the severe  internal injuries he suffered in the June 15 accident.    Neff is accused of driving his car while intoxicated into a power pole just  south of Fillmore and killing Anderson, who had received his diploma just hours  before from Fillmore High School.    Neff's attorneys said they expect that he will plead not guilty to the charges  at his arraignment, which Hunter continued until July 31. Hunter set a  preliminary hearing for Aug. 27 after Norris and Loy said they need more time  to study evidence including police reports, videotapes, photographs and  statements from nearly 60 witnesses.

[Ben-Eli'ezer] It was a very grave incident. I sharply  denounce the attack. It came not only at the wrong time, but it  could lead to the situation getting out of control unless the  following conditions are observed: All the security forces,  especially the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], must show maximum  determination and control on the ground. There is no room for  mercy to anybody. In this situation, there are two  possibilities: Either we immediately clamp down on everybody or  there is havoc. At the same time, the IDF, the security forces,  and the political echelon, must and can bring about steps to  calm down tempers. I reiterate my long-term conclusion that  when extremists on both sides -- and this time religious  extremists -- live together, such a situation is inevitable.    [Engel] This incident is not linked to the IDF's action in  the field. We understood from Qiryat Arba' local council head  Beni Qatzover that the assailant was mentally unstable, at least  lately, yet he had weapons and plenty of ammunition which he  could use whenever he felt like it. How can the security forces  or the political establishment cope with such a situation?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] I heard Qatzover saying that the man was  mentally unstable. It is a shame that we found out about that  after he murdered others and committed suicide. I think that  political and municipal officials have to cooperate with the  authorities, despite all the difficulties involved, to prevent  crazies from carrying weapons. There are extremists in the  territories belonging to very extreme movements who are no less  dangerous than that crazy man.    [Engel] How will this grave incident influence the  negotiations with the Palestinians?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] It will definitely not contribute to the  talks.    [Engel] Was Israel in touch with the Palestinians this  morning?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] I have not had any contacts. It is possible  that others have. I think contacts are vital and coordination  between the two leaderships is critical. I would welcome such  moves. We must remember that we are in the midst of the Ramadan  fast, which will bring the entire Islamic world up in arms. How  can we go and tell them that a crazy man was responsible? We  must not ease up our control on the territories and our efforts  to return calm through talks and actions.    [Engel] We understand that the prime minister plans to  convene the Inner Cabinet.    [Ben-Eli'ezer] I think that is the right thing to do.    [Engel] Can you tell us what you think it will decide?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] No, I cannot. I am no prophet. I can only  say one thing: We do not have any interest in bringing about an  escalation of the situation. Our only interest is to restore  calm. We are not going to war against either side. In my view,  it is a grave escalation of the situation because if whoever did  it is crazy. It is something you have no control over unless as  I said, people cooperate. I believe that any decision made will  be aimed at controlling the situation and restoring calm.     "
0,FT934-15161 ,"FT934-15161 _AN-DJMCRADUFT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: US concerns hit Micro Focus / A look at the worries behind the fall of a software star      By ALAN CANE   THE MARKET value of Micro Focus has fallen sharply over the past few weeks as US investors question the company's ability to maintain its hitherto impressive record for growth and profitability. Last night shares in the Berkshire-based software house closed at Pounds 13.33 in thin trading having lost 25 per cent of their value in the past seven days alone. They stood at just over Pounds 30 in February this year. The company is now capitalised at Pounds 188m compared with over Pounds 400m at its peak. The share price was not helped by a sell note last week from a US analyst, Mr Paul Bloom, of brokers Volpe, Welty  Co, a company which in earlier years had praised Micro Focus' management and market positioning. Mr Paul O'Grady, Micro Focus managing director, said Mr Bloom had issued the note without consultation with the company In the UK, however, analysts were not reassured by a round of presentations last week from Mr O'Grady. He seemed 'downbeat' and had failed to impress UK shareholders. Micro Focus is a company whose stock is at the mercy of its American Depositary Receipt listing. At one stage almost 40 per cent of its shares were held in the form of ADRs; now the total is about 20 per cent. US investment has been behind the dramatic rise in Micro Focus' share price over the past three years. Now it is the root cause of its collapse. US investors understand the software market better than their European counterparts. Micro Focus had powerful appeal because it had developed a set of tools - software which makes it easier to write other software - which were of obvious value in corporate data centres. They made it possible to write software in Cobol, the most common business language, on cheap personal computers rather than taking up expensive mainframe time. Micro Focus has an alliance with Microsoft, the world's largest software company, through which Micro Focus tools are included in Microsoft products. Mainframes, however, are gradually giving way to networks of smaller computers (client-server systems) and Cobol will eventually be superseded by more modern computer languages: the question hanging over Micro Focus has always been: when? So US investors began to take fright when the company recorded flat profits and a mere 11 per cent rise in revenues in dollar terms in the first half of the year. Typically Micro Focus has grown both revenues and profits by more than 20 per cent. In sterling terms, revenues were Pounds 40.8m and pre-tax profits Pounds 11.6m for the first half. US investors also noted poor performances from traditional mainframe vendors such as Amdahl and concluded the shift to client-server systems was under way. Mr O'Grady said yesterday that Micro Focus was well positioned to exploit moves to newer technology. UK analysts agreed yesterday that little had changed in the company's underlying trading performance and were maintaining estimates of pre-tax profits for the full year at between Pounds 27m and Pounds 30m. The company has Pounds 53m cash.   Companies:-  Micro Focus Group.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7372 Prepackaged Software.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

Fierce 70-m.p.h. wind tore through central and eastern Massachusetts on Friday,  tearing roofs off buildings and killing a woman when a church steeple toppled  onto her car.    A second church steeple also was felled by the wind, which accompanied a line  of thunderstorms that uprooted dozens of trees and utility poles, cutting off  electricity to thousands of customers in many towns.

In Fitchburg, the hardest-hit community, steeples fell from the First Parish  Unitarian Universalist Church, built in 1837, and the Faith United Church, both  located along the Upper Common on Main Street, which was flooded by the storm.    The steeple from the Unitarian church landed on the car, killing Sandra R.  Cressey, 53.    Officials at Burbank Hospital said at least eight people were treated for  injuries stemming from the storm. Most of the injuries were caused by the  toppled Unitarian church steeple, including injuries to a mother and her three  children.    Authorities evacuated 200 people from a 14-story senior citizens high-rise  because part of the roof came off and the wall was cracked. The roof on the  Sanitoy factory, which makes toys for children, also was blown off.    Substantial damage also was reported in nearby communities, including Gardner  and Leominster, and there was widespread damage in the Boston area before the  storm swept out to sea.

Esteemed brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the  Armed Forces: Greetings of the revolution and unity. While we  do not want to remind you of the stands, sacrifices, and heroic  deeds, that the sons of the Abyan Governorate have registered at  various stages and of their national militant role in achieving  unity and democracy, we would like to stress that the situation  in Abyan Governorate has become grave as a result of the  barbaric provocations and killings to which the governorate's  honorable and innocent sons are being exposed. We urge you to  face up to your responsibilities and your historic mission,  which you pledged to God to carry out for your people and your  homeland.    While we take pride in the fact that Abyan has been destined  to be the cradle of the revolution and the revolutionaries, we  are displeased by the negligence displayed toward the  governorate and its achievements. In addition to losing its  best and noblest men, as well as being deprived of most of its  rights and needs, Abyan Governorate is being exposed to killings  and torture. (?Most parts) of the governorate are still to this  moment besieged by the most lethal machines of destruction and  death, which were brought by the advocates of division to settle  purely divisionist scores.    Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members:  While we are addressing you, our hearts are bleeding because of  what is happening to our sons, daughters, mothers, brothers, and  sisters. While we reiterate our readiness to continue to offer  more sacrifices for the sake of unity, we do not want our  governorate, Abyan, to be the hotbed of the conflict, which  would not serve the homeland or the people's interest.  Therefore, we urge the withdrawal of all the military units  from the governorate, as well as the implementation of the  contents of the accord document, as the only solution to the  crisis.    While we urge you to abide by this, we call on the parties  in  the coalition; all the political forces, represented by the  Dialogue Committee; all the political organizations; and the  vocational and creative popular organizations to close ranks in  the face of threats to our unity and the implementation of the  Amman accord.    Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members: The  state of loss being experienced by the sons of the Abyan  Governorate, throughout the republic, and abroad as a result of  statements transmitted by print and electronic media organs,  prompts us to urge, through this message, a halt to this media  propaganda that only harms our governorate. At the same time,  we call for the facts to be clarified to our people through the  military committee and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee  so that we, as well as our people's masses, can unveil those  behind the bloody conflict from which the sons of Abyan -- who  are faithful to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity --  are suffering. May God grant you success in maintaining the  interest of the homeland and people. Peace and God's mercy and  blesses be upon you.    [Signed] The sons of Abyan Governorate     "

""Guilty,"" Hayhurst replied.    Deputy Dist. Atty.

By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Charges of murder with special circumstances and attempted murder were filed  Tuesday against a 17-year-old youth accused of firing a shotgun into a weekend  birthday party in South-Central Los Angeles, killing a 6-year-old girl and  fatally wounding a 14-year-old boy who died Tuesday.    The decision to seek special circumstances of multiple murder is the first time  since Proposition 115 was approved in June that a juvenile defendant has been  charged in Los Angeles County under a provision that calls for life without  parole upon conviction, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office said.    The district attorney's office declined to identify the suspected gunman  because of his age. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Markus, head of the Compton Hard  Core anti-gang unit, said authorities will seek to try the youth as an adult.    The teen-ager is scheduled to be arraigned today in Compton Juvenile Court.    Before Proposition 115 was approved, a juvenile could not be sentenced to  prison for life, without possibility of parole, even if convicted in a case  involving special circumstances, the spokeswoman said.    The events leading to the filing of Tuesday's charges unfolded Saturday night  when a gunman fired two shotgun blasts at party-goers in an apartment at 10500  S. Vermont Ave., killing Natalie Faine, fatally wounding Tyren Blow and grazing  the arm of an 11-year-old girl.    Tyren died Tuesday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center where he had  been hospitalized with a head wound and placed on a respirator.

By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Charges of murder with special circumstances and attempted murder were filed  Tuesday against a 17-year-old youth accused of firing a shotgun into a weekend  birthday party in South-Central Los Angeles, killing a 6-year-old girl and  fatally wounding a 14-year-old boy who died Tuesday.    The decision to seek special circumstances of multiple murder is the first time  since Proposition 115 was approved in June that a juvenile defendant has been  charged in Los Angeles County under a provision that calls for life without  parole upon conviction, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office said.    The district attorney's office declined to identify the suspected gunman  because of his age. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Markus, head of the Compton Hard  Core anti-gang unit, said authorities will seek to try the youth as an adult.    The teen-ager is scheduled to be arraigned today in Compton Juvenile Court.    Before Proposition 115 was approved, a juvenile could not be sentenced to  prison for life, without possibility of parole, even if convicted in a case  involving special circumstances, the spokeswoman said.    The events leading to the filing of Tuesday's charges unfolded Saturday night  when a gunman fired two shotgun blasts at party-goers in an apartment at 10500  S. Vermont Ave., killing Natalie Faine, fatally wounding Tyren Blow and grazing  the arm of an 11-year-old girl.    Tyren died Tuesday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center where he had  been hospitalized with a head wound and placed on a respirator.    According to police, the gunman fired two shots toward a second-story balcony  outside the apartment where Norvelle and Ann Aldridge were celebrating the  birthdays of several relatives and hit the three children. Natalie had come  from her home in Pomona to attend the party.

0,FT921-9810 ,"FT921-9810 _AN-CBJBRACEFT 920210   FT  10 FEB 92 / Rebel chief defiant as Serb resistance to peace plan crumbles      By LAURA SILBER      KNIN   THE LEADER of Krajina, the Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday reaffirmed his resistance to the United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, in the face of increased pressure from Serbia to accept the proposals. On the eve of a crucial session of the Serb enclave's parliament today, Mr Milan Babic, president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Krajina, said: 'A step forward has been made in the plan.' But he continued to oppose a key element of the UN initiative to despatch 10,000 peacekeepers. He said Serb reservists could not be disbanded while Croatia maintained its army. Mr Lazar Macura, Krajina's information minister, added: 'The Yugoslav army no longer exists. There are many army officers who are ready to stay in Krajina, about 30,000 reservists are from the region. . . only the generals who are manipulated by Belgrade will leave.' At the same time, in a move directed by Serbia, a rival parliament in Glina, northern Krajina, unconditionally accepted the UN plan at an emergency session. Mr Babic dismissed the manoeuvres by Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, to marginalise the leadership in Knin, the capital of Krajina. He said: 'It (Glina) is not a legitimate session. It is simply a continuation of pressure from Belgrade.' The parliament in Knin is expected today to approve the holding of a referendum on the UN plan. Krajina's leaders say the referendum would be held as soon as possible. The referendum could break the deadlock between Krajina and Serbia, offering Mr Babic a way out of the impasse. He said: 'If the people approve the plan, I will bow to their will.' Despite Mr Babic's defiance, the inhabitants of Knin, tired of the economic deprivation brought on by the civil war, seem likely to approve the UN plan. 'We want peace. Any plan that will bring us peace,' one worker in Knin said yesterday. Krajina's leaders, say Mr Milosevic, have betrayed the region's 300,000 Serbs, stranding them in an independent, hostile Croatia. 'Mr Milosevic doesn't need us any more, so he is ready to sacrifice us,' said Mr Macura. Serbia has denounced Mr Babic as the main obstacle to bringing peace to Yugoslavia, torn by deep ethnic antagonism. In a further effort to undermine Mr Babic, Belgrade has economically isolated the poor mountainous region of Krajina. Serbia last month also cut off Krajina from the monetary system, when it issued new bank notes. The Yugoslav dinars currently circulating in Knin are practically worthless, valid only in the enclave. Mr Babic opposes the UN plan for Yugoslavia because he fears that replacing the federal army in Krajina with UN troops and disarming local Serbs would leave them at the mercy of Croatian forces. UN Security Council members urged all warring sides in a resolution passed on Friday to give their unqualified support to the UN peace proposals.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said the 11:01 a.m. quake was centered on the  coast about six miles south of Hualien.    Police there said one construction worker died after falling from the second  story of the building and that a laborer shaken off a scaffold died of head  injuries.

Biggs contended that Bishop killed Garcia in a fit of passion,  and was only guilty of manslaughter, punishable by a maximum of 11 years in  prison.    Bishop was convicted of the June 3, 1988, murder of Garcia. A former girlfriend  of Bishop's testified during the trial that she heard him mention the idea of  killing Garcia the day before the murder. According to testimony, Garcia was  attempting to end a long relationship with Bishop shortly before the crime.    The next day, Bishop choked and then drowned Garcia in the bathtub of her  Huntington Beach home. After cleaning up the house, Bishop took her body and  buried it in the desert near Victorville. He returned later with his brother to  dig a deeper hole for fear that the body would be discovered.

Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, who is accused of involvement in the  murder of a Jordanian diplomat, told a Beirut court he blew up  the Pan Am airliner which exploded over Scotland in December  1988 killing 270 people.    Sha'ban is a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the  Palestinian terror organisation led by Abu-Nidal.    But yesterday a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We have  stated many times we believe that there is a case to be answered  in a court in Scotland or the US involving two Libyans.""    Mr Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives of the  victims of flight 103, said the claim ""should be regarded with  grave suspicion.""    He added: ""It could be that he is seeking to attract what  terrorists might regard as kudos for the Abu-Nidal organisation.""    The belief that Libya is to blame for the bombing was  repeated by Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5,  in the Dimbleby Lecture on Sunday [12 June]. Both Britain and  the United States are demanding that Libya hand over the two  suspects, 'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali al-Migrahi and Lamin Khalifah  Fuhaymah, for trial in either country.    The Abu-Nidal group has close links with Libya, but  officials  say it has not been identified with the Lockerbie atrocity. Nor  is the name of Sha'ban well known to the security sources.    Sha'ban claimed in court he had repeatedly told the  magistrate investigating the assassination that he was the  Lockerbie bomber but his claim had never been recorded.    Yesterday the likeliest explanation for his ""confession"" was  thought to be a desire to delay a possible death sentence in his  current trial. He and two others are charged with killing Na'ib  'Imran Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January.    Lebanon has recently begun carrying out the death penalty  for  murderers.    Another theory is that Sha'ban was acting on Abu-Nidal's  orders to try to divert attention from his patron Col  Al-Qadhdhafi, whose Libyan regime has suffered two years of  sanctions over his refusal to give up the suspects.

Mine owners Johannesburg Consolidated  Investment [JCI] Gold Division Chairman Kennedy Maxwell said the  parties agreed to a code of conduct, security arrangements and a  high-level committee to investigate the causes of conflict.    In terms of the agreement mine security personnel and  National Peace Secretariat monitors would be deployed  underground where four miners were killed on Wednesday.    Western areas consulting engineer John Brownriggs said  miners  had agreed to resume work on Saturday.    Search teams comprising mine security, the South African  National Defence Force, the Internal Stability Unit and the  National Peace Secretariat had confisticated eight tons of  home-made weapons during hostel searches in the past week.    Mr Brownriggs said initial indications were that the faction  fighting was a sequel to the killing of two Zulu miners  returning from an Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] rally on April 17.  Subsequent to the arrest of a Xhosa suspect on May 4, renewed  tension arose in the mine when a group went to the mine  management demanding the release of their arrested colleague, he  added.    JCI was assessing production losses resulting from the work  stoppages during the conflict and would make an announcement  next week, Mr Maxwell said.    Production had continued throughout the period as white  miners had continued working.    National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] Assistant General  Secretary Gwede Mantashe said the code of conduct agreed to with  JCI provided for the control of access to mine hostels,  possession of weapons as a dismissable offence and control of  visits by non-hostel dwellers. Mr Mantashe blamed the conflict  on the housing of workers on ethnic lines and the promotion of  IFP-aligned elements to undermine the NUM.    Mr Maxwell conceded that historically workers had been  housed  according to ethnic affiliations, but JCI had started  negotiations a year ago to abolish ethnic housing.    JCI Gold Division human resources manager Craig Lawrence  said  the transformation from compulsory segregation to integration  was a sensitive and difficult problem, with no consensus among  all those involved.

On 4 March 1984, an Israeli explosive device went off at the  al-Husayni Club in Ma'rakah in southern Lebanon, killing a crowd  of people and a group of resistance men. On that day, Muhammad  Sa'd and Khalil Jiradi, two resistance leaders, closed their  eyes for the last time, fully aware that lofty southern Lebanon  will persist with its resistance activities, that it will bow to  nobody except God, and that it will shed no tears, except when  it beseeches God, imploring Him for mercy.    Now, 10 years after the Israeli crime against a house of  faith and resistance, and only a few days before the anniversary  of that event, Israel, using sinful hands, has perpetrated a new  crime against a house of God in the heart of Lebanon. Had it  not been for God's grace and providence, this criminal massacre  would have assumed monstrous proportions. It is no coincidence  that only 50 hours separated the two crimes committed against  peace in both Lebanon and the region. One of these crimes  targeted faithful people and the Church in Lebanon, while the  other targeted faithful people and the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron.    This month, approximately two weeks before the two massacres  took place, I said that we would face real terrorism that could  revive the terrorism of the Stern Gang and Haganah. I  elaborated, saying that daily events show that Israel is  upgrading its combat capabilities and staging maneuvers, the  last of which was staged in the Golan on 9 February 1994. All  these developments show that Israel is heading for war, rather  than peace. I also said then, and I reiterate this right now,  that I would not be making any miscalculations when I say that  Israel is incapable of walking the path of settlement, and of  paying a price for peace. This is because the Palestinian,  Syrian, and Lebanese experience with Israel has revealed the  dark shadows of an Israeli belligerence and occupation that  cannot be removed by an unrequited peace.    The bloodbaths in the holy lands of Palestine and Lebanon  are  the best evidence that Israel is incapable of making peace. The  new Israeli massacres are carbon copies of the massacres  committed in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Bahr al-Baqar, Hula, al-Khiyam,  Bint Jubayl, al-'Abbasiyah, al-Zurayriyah, and Ma'rakah.    Despite this bloody Israeli record, we still feel that  Israel  is granted immunity by the international community. It is  allowed to act as it wishes, depending on the veto right, which  is preventing the passage of firm international resolutions and  the implementation of the provisions enshrined in Chapter 7 of  the UN Charter against it. This renders the killing of our  peoples, as is happening at present, a condonable crime, and the  killing of a single Israeli settler or soldier on our occupied  territories an unforgivable crime. Their occupation of our  territories is justified, whereas our resistance on our own  national soil is deemed terrorism.    At any rate, and in the aftermath of the bloodbaths the  international community has seen with its naked eye, is there  any longer anybody who believes in the attainability of peace on  Israeli terms, when the places of worship have become targets of  outrageous Israeli attacks? This is not indicative of a change  in our options. For, in the first place, Syria and Lebanon,  which share a common history, geography, destiny, and future,  have adopted just and comprehensive peace as a strategic option.  Such peace must liberate the territories and guarantee the  restoration of rights upheld by international resolutions.    Hence, His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has  characterized the peace we are striving to achieve as the peace  of the brave. This peace is grounded in the option of  resistance, struggle, and intifadah against the occupation.  This is because these things are an indivisible part of our  ancestry, heritage, Arabism, and creed, and also because they  reflect rights enshrined in the UN Charter and international  legitimacy. The confrontation of occupation is upheld by the UN  Charter and international legitimacy. [passage omitted]     "

After all, the white flag might at least put an end  to the slaughtering and the further escalation of the  inconceivable. Sometimes capitulation really is the last resort.  But the wild attack on Gorazde by the Serbs cannot be compared  with a ""normal"" war, and this shows the barbarism to which  ""civilized"" Europe is in danger of falling victim.    In the 18th century, there was a well-contrived war code  that  said: After so many hits, the commander of the fortress or city  may honorably surrender, whereupon the conquerors march into the  city with proper respect. Even in World War II, the ""most  total"" of all wars, the right of capitulation was more or less  respected -- see Rome or Paris. But Gorazde? Not capitulation  that is followed by mercy, but destruction and expulsion are at  issue.    No other signal is given by the offensive, which will have  soon lasted for three weeks and which does not even refrain from  well-aimed shots at hospitals. The conquest of a strategic point  is not at issue; the city is to be emptied as much as possible  by murders and escape so it will become ""Muslim-free."" The  people know this and that is why they are fighting so  desperately for every meter. Capitulation does not promise mercy  to them, but terror and death.    What follows from it for the rest of the world? The  so-called world community must understand that civilians are not  murdered here by chance, but ""purposefully."" It must understand  that unrestrained meanness in the form of Serbian tanks has  driven the moral duty to the foreground of all considerations,  no matter how weighty the strategic and political arguments  against intervention are. For: He who does not prevent murder,  although he could do so at justifiable risks, becomes guilty.    And yet the ""world community"" seems to watch the horror as  if  in a trance. The latest Security Council resolution -- the  Serbian gentlemen should withdraw from Gorazde -- must have made  them laugh. For weeks NATO has been silent. And the Americans,  who are playing the key role now as ever, are indulging in hints  like in oracles, which everybody may interpret to his liking.  Of course, the Germans must be the last to mock at that. For  in 1991, they pursued the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia by  using their elbows, while being comfortably aware that they --  protected by the self-imposed constitutional tie -- would not  have to bear any responsibility.    Since yesterday, Clinton's zigzag course has been pointing  again to the preparedness to use force: NATO is to threaten  with bombs in order to force the Serbs to withdraw heavy  weaponry from the surroundings of the six protection zones. Can  this intimidate the Serbs once more after their unhindered march  to Gorazde? Sam Nunn, a powerful figure in the U.S. Senate, is  right: ""Pinpricks will not work any longer.

How else  could a young man under the age of 37 who has not even mastered  the externals of religious subjects move ahead so swiftly?  Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, who has no social assets, has set no  precedent by formulating independent interpretations of  theological questions and has not risen to any level in his  thinking. And yet, he rose swiftly from serving as a group  official in al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party to serving as an  official in the Amal Movement. Then he became Hizballah's  mobilization officer in al-Biqa', served as commander of the  party's fighters against the Amal Movement in Iqlim al-Tuffah,  and [eventually] became the secretary general of Hizballah in  Lebanon. Nasrallah managed to move ahead of outstanding scholars  as well as leading formulators of independent theological  interpretations, masters of thought, and our predecessors in the  quest for Islam. How was he able to move ahead of all these  people so swiftly?    Let us mention the following facts to support our  allegations:    1. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, group official in al-Da'wah  Party,  managed to persuade people that he had never joined the  aforementioned party. Some people in the Islamic Republic of  Iran fell for that ploy and believed him. Sayyid Hasan thus  became the clean man whose personal and social history was  untarnished. It is worth noting that Sayyid Nasrallah's name was  cleared by key figures of al-Da'wah Party who denied his  affiliation with the party because they knew how much the young  people who were fond of Imam Khomeyni's approach, may God be  pleased with him, hated al-Da'wah Party. They hated it because  the party had made fighting Imam Khomeyni's approach its  strategic goal. That had been the party's goal ever since the  Holy Imam Khomeyni arrived in the holy city of al-Najaf  following his exile from Turkey, where he had lived after the  late Shah exiled him from Iran in 1963. By clearing Nasrallah's  name the key figures of al-Da'wah Party were able to set the  stage for Nasrallah to gain access to the decisionmaking  position. Nasrallah would gain such access after gaining the  confidence of sincere young people and after officials in the  Islamic Republic of Iran were persuaded that his background was  spotless.    2. Sayyid Hasan has held in Hizballah, ever since it was  founded, a position from which he could deal directly with the  party's elements. He became the mobilization officer in the  party, and that gave him the opportunity to present himself to  those elements as a humble person and to portray himself as  someone who empathizes with the dispossessed and their concerns.  But it was the cadres of al-Da'wah Party who had penetrated  Hizballah who took part in polishing Sayyid Hasan's image and  presenting it to these gullible youths. Consequently, a large  segment of the party's elements became fond of Sayyid Hasan  because they believed he was a humble man, indifferent to the  objects of this world, and troubled by the concerns of the  toiling classes. Some of these young people even preferred  Sayyid Nasrallah to his professors, the late Sayyid 'Abbas  al-Musawi, may God have mercy on his soul; Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli; and Shaykh Muhammad Yazbak. These were the men who  preceded Nasrallah in associating themselves with the blessed  Islamic Revolution after its victory in 1979. In this regard  suffice it to point out that after Sayyid Nasrallah received a  majority of the votes of the members of the Consultative Council  in the elections, which followed the expiration of Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli's term as secretary general, he yielded to the late  Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, claiming humility as his motive.  Nevertheless, he held control of the party's finances and  military matters, thereby restricting the movement of the  secretary general completely and turning himself in to the real  decision maker.    3. Sayyid Nasrallah went to Iqlim al-Tuffah to lead  Hizballah's fighters against the Amal Movement. He assumed an  ultra-extremist position, and he showed so much enthusiasm for  the fighting to continue that he refused to adhere to Ayatollah  Khomeyni's unequivocal order, banning fellow Muslims from  fighting each other. That turned him into a symbol of the  resistance in the eyes of the party's elements who had strong  feelings of hostility for the Amal Movement. In fact, Sayyid  Nasrallah even traveled to Iran after the agreement between the  party and the movement [to express] his objection to stopping  the war between fellow Muslims. But his aim in going to Iran was  to create some distance between himself and the media under the  pretext of seeking knowledge in Qom, the center of learning.  When he was in Iran, however, he tried to project the image of  someone who was in full compliance with the wishes of officials,  and he expressed his willingness to do everything that he was  asked to do. When Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, may God have mercy on  his soul, was killed by the criminal Zionists, everyone acted  quickly so that Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah could be installed  secretary general and Shaykh Na'im Qasim blocked from that  position. Shaykh Na'im Qasim, who served as deputy secretary  general during the lifetime of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, is known  for his affiliation with al-Da'wah Party. That is how Sayyid  Hasan Nasrallah, a key figure in al-Da'wah Party, got to the  position of secretary general of Hizballah. And yet, it was  generally believed that al-Da'wah Party had actually been driven  out of the primary decisionmaking position in Hizballah.    4. Sayyid Nasrallah vehemently attacked the Lebanese  Maronite  regime in his speeches, and he described it in the ugliest  terms. He got many people to think that he was sincere when he  disavowed the infidel regime, but then he would turn into an  apologist for it and rationalize joining it. When he found no  precedent in Shiite history to justify a person's public  involvement with infidel entities and oppressive governments, he  worked hard in the hope that he might get Ayatollah Khamene'i,  may God protect him, to give him legal cover. When he failed to  do that, he took one sentence from the leader's statement that  dealt strictly with internal Iranian matters, and he published  it in the center of the front page of AL-'AHD Newspaper. That  sentence had nothing to do with the outside world, and it had  nothing to do with the elections in Lebanon. Nasrallah published  that sentence to let people believe that Iranian leaders, acting  according to a fatwa [formal legal opinion] from Imam Khomeyni,  may God sanctify his secret, had pushed him to join the Lebanese  regime. Nasrallah then started making various charges against  those who hesitated to go to the polling stations or those who  did not vote for the candidates he had nominated. After bringing  the matter to a [words indistinct] doing that by blatantly  falsifying the facts right and left, Nasrallah started leaking  information through his mouthpieces, indicating that no one had  been legally commissioned by the Islamic leadership, but that  the decision to participate had been made in the so-called Shura  Council.    5. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah wants people to forget that he  lied  to them about the parliamentary elections. He wants them to  forget that he forced Muslims to recognize the Lebanese regime  when he became a member of that regime's legislative authority.  Today, Nasrallah is venting his wrath against the government,  loudly proclaiming that, ""We will not let the blood of our  martyrs be spilled in vain."" According to our information,  however, he is trying hard via numerous and different channels  to get one of his followers accepted as a government minister.  This would be the price for the blood of martyrs who died in  Airport Square. This time too the rationale is reforming the  situation from within.    We are reminding sincere believers who would not consent to  abandoning the provisions of their true religion that the basis  for disavowing infidel and oppressive governments is the same as  that for prayer and fasting. We are reminding those sincere  believers that the unequivocal verses from the Koran and the  sayings which are attributed to the prophet, may God bless him  and grant him salvation, and to the sacrosanct imams, peace be  upon them, forbid dealings of any kind with non-Islamic  entities. No person, not even the most erudite scholar, can make  permissible what God Almighty and His messenger, may God bless  him and grant him salvation, forbade. Accordingly, from now on,  no true Muslim who is a member of Hizballah may obey his leaders  so he can make money or protect a position, because by doing  that, he would be obeying a creature and disobeying the Creator.

This follows a six-month investigation into the killing of Mr Salvatore Lima, the Euro-MP, former mayor of Palermo and the most powerful Christian Democratic political figure in Sicily. Palermo magistrates yesterday announced the issue of 24 arrest warrants and said the murder of Mr Lima in March was a result of his involvement with Cosa Nostra. This is likely to be a deep embarrassment to the Christian Democrat party and those of his colleagues like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister, who have publicly defended his reputation in the wake of his murder. The magistrates, relying on information mainly supplied by 'super-grasses', claimed the killing was ordered by a number of Cosa Nostra families because Mr Lima had promised - but failed - to use his political influence to good effect. It is widely believed that Mr Lima had undertaken to ensure the harsh sentences handed out to Mafia bosses in the trials of the mid-1980s would be quashed on appeal. The great missing element in the mass trials concerned the political links of the Mafia. Such links have been widely suspected but never proven beyond vote-buying and collusion over contracts. Mr Lima, a parliamentary deputy from 1968 to 1979, had long been suspected of Mafia connections and his name appeared frequently in the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission records. Palermo magistrates suggested he had occupied a key position in the shadowy world linking organised crime with the political parties and state institutions. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, called a press conference yesterday to deny that the government was watering down taxation measures in the 1993 budget.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

BRODER and ROBIN WRIGHT, Times Staff Writers      WASHINGTON      In what American officials described as a ""very ominous"" change in tactics,  Communist rebels in the Philippines have decided to target U.S. officials  involved in counterinsurgency operations there for assassination,  Administration sources said Thursday.    The killing of Army Col. James N. Rowe in Manila last week provided the first  firm evidence of the rebel decision, which was made recently, according to U.S.  officials speaking on condition that they not be identified by name.    The Communist New People's Army has drawn up a specific list of American  military and civilian targets for assassination, according to U.S. intelligence  sources. And it has decided to attack U.S. military installations as part of a  larger plan to intimidate the government of President Corazon Aquino and drive  Americans from the Philippines, the sources said.    A special team of State Department officials and FBI agents have been sent to  Manila to investigate Rowe's murder, but intelligence sources traced the  killing directly to the high-level rebel decision to attack American targets.    The rebels are targeting ""not only people but facilities,"" one knowledgeable  State Department official said.    ""It is our belief that they have taken this decision very recently,"" declared  another Administration official. ""It is very ominous.""    U.S. officials called the Rowe killing ""part of a carefully conceived plan""  timed to coincide with difficult negotiations over leases on two major U.S.  military bases in the islands, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. A total  of 16,700 U.S. military personnel are stationed in the Philippines.    The 25-year lease on the bases expires in 1991, and renewal talks have stalled  over how much the United States should pay to retain rights to the massive  facilities. Philippine domestic politics have also slowed the talks as the  Aquino government has sought to portray itself as a bulwark against continuing  American colonialism.    The new rebel policy sends ""a heavy political message to both the Aquino  government and the U.S. -- they want us out of there,"" one senior  Administration official said. ""They don't want us to have any bases there.""    Rowe, part of the 46-member Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group, was ambushed  a week ago by gunmen who riddled his lightly armored sedan with automatic  weapons fire in a traffic circle in Quezon City near Manila.      West Point Graduate    Rowe, 51, was a highly decorated West Point graduate who spent five years as a  prisoner of war in Vietnam. He was assigned to assist Philippine government  troops with training and logistical programs and was not a military  counterinsurgency adviser, a Pentagon spokesman said.    According to U.S. estimates, the rebel army numbers about 20,000, with half or  more equipped with modern weapons that were captured from Philippine troops,  provided by foreign sympathizers or bought on the open market. The Communists  control about 20% of the former U.S. colony's territory.    The last coordinated attack on U.S. targets in the Philippines occurred in  October, 1987, when three Americans, two of them in military service and one  retired, were shot to death in ambushes outside Clark Air Base.    U.S. analysts at the time suspected that the attacks marked a change in rebel  tactics, but there were no further killings. In succeeding months, the rebels  issued numerous public threats against Americans and others helping Philippine  government counterinsurgency efforts, but the attacks never materialized.    In recent weeks, the New People's Army has begun a new campaign against  Americans installations and officials, U.S. sources said. Early this month,  rebels laid a land mine near an American firing range outside of Clark Air Base  and attacked a U.S. Navy transmitting station near Manila, damaging an antenna  and some power lines.    The rebels, in a statement, said that the raids were in retaliation for  ""escalating U.S. military intervention in the country."" The rebel statement  said that U.S. advisers are directing Philippine troops in the  counterinsurgency campaign.    ""The NPA has long made public calls for withdrawal of the bases,"" a State  Department official said Thursday.

BRODER and ROBIN WRIGHT, Times Staff Writers      WASHINGTON      In what American officials described as a ""very ominous"" change in tactics,  Communist rebels in the Philippines have decided to target U.S. officials  involved in counterinsurgency operations there for assassination,  Administration sources said Thursday.    The killing of Army Col. James N. Rowe in Manila last week provided the first  firm evidence of the rebel decision, which was made recently, according to U.S.  officials speaking on condition that they not be identified by name.    The Communist New People's Army has drawn up a specific list of American  military and civilian targets for assassination, according to U.S. intelligence  sources. And it has decided to attack U.S. military installations as part of a  larger plan to intimidate the government of President Corazon Aquino and drive  Americans from the Philippines, the sources said.    A special team of State Department officials and FBI agents have been sent to  Manila to investigate Rowe's murder, but intelligence sources traced the  killing directly to the high-level rebel decision to attack American targets.    The rebels are targeting ""not only people but facilities,"" one knowledgeable  State Department official said.    ""It is our belief that they have taken this decision very recently,"" declared  another Administration official. ""It is very ominous.""    U.S. officials called the Rowe killing ""part of a carefully conceived plan""  timed to coincide with difficult negotiations over leases on two major U.S.  military bases in the islands, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. A total  of 16,700 U.S. military personnel are stationed in the Philippines.    The 25-year lease on the bases expires in 1991, and renewal talks have stalled  over how much the United States should pay to retain rights to the massive  facilities. Philippine domestic politics have also slowed the talks as the  Aquino government has sought to portray itself as a bulwark against continuing  American colonialism.    The new rebel policy sends ""a heavy political message to both the Aquino  government and the U.S. -- they want us out of there,"" one senior  Administration official said. ""They don't want us to have any bases there.""    Rowe, part of the 46-member Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group, was ambushed  a week ago by gunmen who riddled his lightly armored sedan with automatic  weapons fire in a traffic circle in Quezon City near Manila.      West Point Graduate    Rowe, 51, was a highly decorated West Point graduate who spent five years as a  prisoner of war in Vietnam. He was assigned to assist Philippine government  troops with training and logistical programs and was not a military  counterinsurgency adviser, a Pentagon spokesman said.    According to U.S. estimates, the rebel army numbers about 20,000, with half or  more equipped with modern weapons that were captured from Philippine troops,  provided by foreign sympathizers or bought on the open market. The Communists  control about 20% of the former U.S. colony's territory.    The last coordinated attack on U.S. targets in the Philippines occurred in  October, 1987, when three Americans, two of them in military service and one  retired, were shot to death in ambushes outside Clark Air Base.    U.S. analysts at the time suspected that the attacks marked a change in rebel  tactics, but there were no further killings. In succeeding months, the rebels  issued numerous public threats against Americans and others helping Philippine  government counterinsurgency efforts, but the attacks never materialized.    In recent weeks, the New People's Army has begun a new campaign against  Americans installations and officials, U.S. sources said. Early this month,  rebels laid a land mine near an American firing range outside of Clark Air Base  and attacked a U.S. Navy transmitting station near Manila, damaging an antenna  and some power lines.    The rebels, in a statement, said that the raids were in retaliation for  ""escalating U.S. military intervention in the country."" The rebel statement  said that U.S. advisers are directing Philippine troops in the  counterinsurgency campaign.    ""The NPA has long made public calls for withdrawal of the bases,"" a State  Department official said Thursday. ""The goal appears to be one of two things:  either to drive the U.S. out or draw the U.S. into active involvement in the  counterinsurgency, which would then arouse nationalist feelings of the Filipino  people and lead them to support the NPA rather than the government.""

The ambush came two days after the Alex Boncayao Brigade  (ABB) released to media its target list of 345 lawmen, officials  and civilians allegedly involved in drug trafficking,  kidnapping, prostitution and gambling.    Killed was Carmelito G. Valmonte, 62, a retired inspector at  the Western Police District Command. He died on the spot after  sustaining four gunshot wounds, police said.    Four men and a woman reportedly opened fire with .45 caliber  automatics on Valmonte as he was driving out of the compound of  UE Automotive Manufacturing, Inc. (UEAMI) where he was security  officer.    Paulo Ramirez, ABB spokesman, told the INQUIRER over the  telephone that Valmonte was responsible for the violent  dispersal of a workers' strike at the firm last year.    He said three workers were shot during the dispersal, one of  whom was seriously wounded and his foot had to be amputated.    Ramirez said Valmonte was not on the ABB list but is  considered ""an enemy of the people and the revolution.""    Mayor Alfredo Lim denounced the killing as ""cowardly"" and  directed Senior Superintendent Hermogenes Ebdane, Manila police  chief, to place his entire police force on alert.    Superintendent Romeo Maganto, Manila police chief for  administration, said the 6,000-strong Manila Crusade for Peace  and Democracy (MPCD) will be tapped to neutralize the ABB threat.    Maganto said the MCPD will serve as an intelligence network  to gather information on the activities of suspected ABB members.    ""We are not alarmed and we are not afraid. Mga langaw lang  sila na nakadapo sa kalabaw (They are merely flies sitting atop  a carabao),"" Maganto said.    Maganto said several ABB leaders operating in Manila have  already been identified, adding it would only be a matter of  time before they are captured.    President Ramos himself has acknowledged the capability of  ABB assassins to launch a fresh wave of attacks against hundreds  of lawmen and officials allegedly engaged in crime and  corruption.    Mr. Ramos said he has ordered a close watch on the ABB.    The Communist Party of the Philippines, led by Jose Maria  Sison, ordered the ABB to disband in 1992 amid a public outcry  against its indiscriminate killings. But anti-Sison cadres in  the ABB defied the order.     "

How else  could a young man under the age of 37 who has not even mastered  the externals of religious subjects move ahead so swiftly?  Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, who has no social assets, has set no  precedent by formulating independent interpretations of  theological questions and has not risen to any level in his  thinking. And yet, he rose swiftly from serving as a group  official in al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party to serving as an  official in the Amal Movement. Then he became Hizballah's  mobilization officer in al-Biqa', served as commander of the  party's fighters against the Amal Movement in Iqlim al-Tuffah,  and [eventually] became the secretary general of Hizballah in  Lebanon. Nasrallah managed to move ahead of outstanding scholars  as well as leading formulators of independent theological  interpretations, masters of thought, and our predecessors in the  quest for Islam. How was he able to move ahead of all these  people so swiftly?    Let us mention the following facts to support our  allegations:    1. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, group official in al-Da'wah  Party,  managed to persuade people that he had never joined the  aforementioned party. Some people in the Islamic Republic of  Iran fell for that ploy and believed him. Sayyid Hasan thus  became the clean man whose personal and social history was  untarnished. It is worth noting that Sayyid Nasrallah's name was  cleared by key figures of al-Da'wah Party who denied his  affiliation with the party because they knew how much the young  people who were fond of Imam Khomeyni's approach, may God be  pleased with him, hated al-Da'wah Party. They hated it because  the party had made fighting Imam Khomeyni's approach its  strategic goal. That had been the party's goal ever since the  Holy Imam Khomeyni arrived in the holy city of al-Najaf  following his exile from Turkey, where he had lived after the  late Shah exiled him from Iran in 1963. By clearing Nasrallah's  name the key figures of al-Da'wah Party were able to set the  stage for Nasrallah to gain access to the decisionmaking  position. Nasrallah would gain such access after gaining the  confidence of sincere young people and after officials in the  Islamic Republic of Iran were persuaded that his background was  spotless.    2. Sayyid Hasan has held in Hizballah, ever since it was  founded, a position from which he could deal directly with the  party's elements. He became the mobilization officer in the  party, and that gave him the opportunity to present himself to  those elements as a humble person and to portray himself as  someone who empathizes with the dispossessed and their concerns.  But it was the cadres of al-Da'wah Party who had penetrated  Hizballah who took part in polishing Sayyid Hasan's image and  presenting it to these gullible youths. Consequently, a large  segment of the party's elements became fond of Sayyid Hasan  because they believed he was a humble man, indifferent to the  objects of this world, and troubled by the concerns of the  toiling classes. Some of these young people even preferred  Sayyid Nasrallah to his professors, the late Sayyid 'Abbas  al-Musawi, may God have mercy on his soul; Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli; and Shaykh Muhammad Yazbak. These were the men who  preceded Nasrallah in associating themselves with the blessed  Islamic Revolution after its victory in 1979. In this regard  suffice it to point out that after Sayyid Nasrallah received a  majority of the votes of the members of the Consultative Council  in the elections, which followed the expiration of Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli's term as secretary general, he yielded to the late  Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, claiming humility as his motive.  Nevertheless, he held control of the party's finances and  military matters, thereby restricting the movement of the  secretary general completely and turning himself into the real  decision maker.    3. Sayyid Nasrallah went to Iqlim al-Tuffah to lead  Hizballah's fighters against the Amal Movement. He assumed an  ultra-extremist position, and he showed so much enthusiasm for  the fighting to continue that he refused to adhere to Ayatollah  Khomeyni's unequivocal order, banning fellow Muslims from  fighting each other. That turned him into a symbol of the  resistance in the eyes of the party's elements who had strong  feelings of hostility for the Amal Movement. In fact, Sayyid  Nasrallah even traveled to Iran after the agreement between the  party and the movement [to express] his objection to stopping  the war between fellow Muslims. But his aim in going to Iran was  to create some distance between himself and the media under the  pretext of seeking knowledge in Qom, the center of learning.  When he was in Iran, however, he tried to project the image of  someone who was in full compliance with the wishes of officials,  and he expressed his willingness to do everything that he was  asked to do. When Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, may God have mercy on  his soul, was killed by the criminal Zionists, everyone acted  quickly so that Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah could be installed  secretary general and Shaykh Na'im Qasim blocked from that  position. Shaykh Na'im Qasim, who served as deputy secretary  general during the lifetime of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, is known  for his affiliation with al-Da'wah Party. That is how Sayyid  Hasan Nasrallah, a key figure in al-Da'wah Party, got to the  position of secretary general of Hizballah. And yet, it was  generally believed that al-Da'wah Party had actually been driven  out of the primary decisionmaking position in Hizballah.    4. Sayyid Nasrallah vehemently attacked the Lebanese  Maronite  regime in his speeches, and he described it in the ugliest  terms. He got many people to think that he was sincere when he  disavowed the infidel regime, but then he would turn into an  apologist for it and rationalize joining it. When he found no  precedent in Shiite history to justify a person's public  involvement with infidel entities and oppressive governments, he  worked hard in the hope that he might get Ayatollah Khamene'i,  may God protect him, to give him legal cover. When he failed to  do that, he took one sentence from the leader's statement that  dealt strictly with internal Iranian matters, and he published  it in the center of the front page of AL-'AHD Newspaper. That  sentence had nothing to do with the outside world, and it had  nothing to do with the elections in Lebanon. Nasrallah published  that sentence to let people believe that Iranian leaders, acting  according to a fatwa [formal legal opinion] from Imam Khomeyni,  may God sanctify his secret, had pushed him to join the Lebanese  regime. Nasrallah then started making various charges against  those who hesitated to go to the polling stations or those who  did not vote for the candidates he had nominated. After bringing  the matter to a close, however, and getting approval for what he  wanted approved, doing that by blatantly falsifying the facts  right and left, Nasrallah started leaking information through  his mouthpieces, indicating that no one had been legally  commissioned by the Islamic leadership, but that the decision to  participate had been made in the so-called Shura Council.    5. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah wants people to forget that he  lied  to them about the parliamentary elections. He wants them to  forget that he forced Muslims to recognize the Lebanese regime  when he became a member of that regime's legislative authority.  Today, Nasrallah is venting his wrath against the government,  loudly proclaiming that, ""We will not let the blood of our  martyrs be spilled in vain."" According to our information,  however, he is trying hard via numerous and different channels  to get one of his followers accepted as a government minister.  This would be the price for the blood of martyrs who died in  Airport Square. This time too the rationale is reforming the  situation from within.    We are reminding sincere believers who would not consent to  abandoning the provisions of their true religion that the basis  for disavowing infidel and oppressive governments is the same as  that for prayer and fasting. We are reminding those sincere  believers that the unequivocal verses from the Koran and the  sayings which are attributed to the prophet, may God bless him  and grant him salvation, and to the sacrosanct imams, peace be  upon them, forbid dealings of any kind with non-Islamic  entities. No person, not even the most erudite scholar, can make  permissible what God Almighty and His messenger, may God bless  him and grant him salvation, forbad. Accordingly, from now on,  no true Muslim who is a member of Hizballah may obey his leaders  so he can make money or protect a position, because by doing  that, he would be obeying a creature and disobeying the Creator.

The Mexican attorney general's office announced late Monday the opening of a  special affairs office that will ""review in its totality"" the investigation  into the torture and murder of Enrique Camarena in Guadalajara. A special  prosecutor is to be named today.    Mexican officials privately have expressed concern that the Camarena trial will  be sensationalist and possibly implicate current or former government officials  in drug trafficking. They fear that the U.S. government will use the trial to  pressure Mexico to hand over other suspects.    In a hint of what lies ahead, the prosecution released a memo earlier this  month alleging that Mexico City Police Chief Javier Garcia Paniagua, once head  of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, had attended an October, 1984,  meeting to plan Camarena's murder.

Mexico's drug czar, Javier Coello  Trejo, said last week that the government has had no reason to suspect Garcia  Paniagua or to investigate him.

The Mexican attorney general's office announced late Monday the opening of a  special affairs office that will ""review in its totality"" the investigation  into the torture and murder of Enrique Camarena in Guadalajara. A special  prosecutor is to be named today.    Mexican officials privately have expressed concern that the Camarena trial will  be sensationalist and possibly implicate current or former government officials  in drug trafficking. They fear that the U.S. government will use the trial to  pressure Mexico to hand over other suspects.    In a hint of what lies ahead, the prosecution released a memo earlier this  month alleging that Mexico City Police Chief Javier Garcia Paniagua, once head  of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, had attended an October, 1984,  meeting to plan Camarena's murder.    Mexican officials were angered by the public allegations, noting that Garcia  Paniagua has never been indicted in the case. Mexico's drug czar, Javier Coello  Trejo, said last week that the government has had no reason to suspect Garcia  Paniagua or to investigate him.

0,FT932-11110 ,"FT932-11110 _AN-DEFCSAA1FT 930506   FT  06 MAY 93 / Japan shocked over death in Cambodia      By CHARLES LEADBEATER      TOKYO   JAPAN'S commitment to play a wider role in United Nations operations is facing its stiffest test as the nation reacted with shock to the killing of a Japanese policeman on peacekeeping duty in Cambodia. Mr Haruyuki Takata, a 33-year-old civilian policeman, was killed on Tuesday in an ambush on a six-vehicle convoy of peacekeepers. Nine other personnel with the UN transitional authority in Cambodia (Untac) were wounded in the ambush, four of them Japanese. The ambush is being blamed on the Khmer Rouge, which is boycotting elections to be held on May 23-27. Japan's involvement in Cambodia followed a painful political debate over the conditions in which it would join UN peacekeeping operations. The killing threatens to reopen that debate. Leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic party tried to calm alarm about the risks to unarmed peacekeepers. Tele-vision news programmes were specially extended to discuss the killing, which dominated coverage in most newspapers. Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary, tried to head off calls for the government to consider withdrawing Japan's personnel, a move which the leadership recognises could cause political embarrassment with Japan's international partners. Mr Kono said the 1991 Paris peace accord for Cambodia was still in force even although it had been violated by the incident. The peace accord is the basis for Japan's involvement in peacekeeping operations in Cambodia. Mr Kono, speaking after the first meeting of a government task force set up to decide Japan's response to the killing, said the government was calling on Untac to strengthen security for Japanese personnel, relocate civilian police officers to safer areas and gather all Japanese volunteers in Phom Penh, the capital, to discuss security. However, the government announced that more than 50 Japanese monitors for the election would be sent as planned next week. Japan is also sending an 11-strong team to investigate the killing. It is likely to press the UN to review the character of the peacekeeping operation in Cambodia in the light of increasing Khmer Rouge violence in rural areas. Japan has 600 military personnel in southern Cambodia, mainly building roads, and 70 civilian police volunteers.   Countries:-  KHZ  Kampuchea, Asia.     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

At the same time Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reiterated that autonomy in Gaza and the Jericho area of the West Bank might be delayed 'one or two weeks' after the December 13 target date while details were finalised. On a visit to Rome, he appealed to 'responsible' Palestinian leaders to help end the spreading violence. Guerrillas from the Fatah Hawks, a military wing of the PLO, are openly rebelling against Mr Arafat's commitment to a renunciation of violence. They are angry at the killing of one of their members by Israeli troops on Sunday and the arrest of several of their leaders on Monday. In clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip yesterday, Palestinians said more than 60 people were wounded. The Israeli army put the number at 24. The latest surge in violence is causing deep concern both in Jerusalem and at PLO headquarters in Tunis. Last night's meeting broke up with both sides promising to try to calm tension. But the Israeli generals rejected the Fatah leaders' request for the immediate release of Fatah Hawks commander Taisir Bardini. They said Mr Bardini, captured in a shootout with undercover troops on Monday night, was wanted for murder. Before approving the meeting, Brig Gen Ehud Barak, Israel's army chief of staff, took the equally unusual step of publicly apologising for the killing of Fatah Hawk member Ahmed Abu-Rish in a Gaza refugee camp on Sunday. He said an Israeli undercover unit had come under fire and had returned fire, but had not intended to hit Abu-Rish. The deputy commander of Israel's forces in Gaza stressed in a radio interview 'Israel is not at war' with Fatah and other supporters of the autonomy deal. He said Israel stood by its promise to free 'wanted' Fatah Hawks who turn in their weapons.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala.      The U.S. Marshals Service on Sunday warned federal judges throughout the nation  to be on their guard in opening mail and packages after a package bomb killed  federal appeals court Judge Robert S. Vance and seriously injured his wife,  Helen.    FBI Director William S. Sessions immediately dispatched technicians from the  bureau's laboratory to assist in the investigation of Saturday's bombing at  Vance's home in this affluent Birmingham suburb.    Late Sunday, the area around Vance's white-columned, two-story brick home was  cordoned off, guarded by a single police cruiser, and a half-dozen vehicles  belonging to federal and local investigators were parked in the driveway.  Residents of the quiet neighborhood were stunned, and expressions of shock and  sympathy poured into the community.    At a news conference here, FBI officials said they and postal officials had  questioned Vance's wife, who remains hospitalized in serious but stable  condition. She ""has provided information that will be helpful,"" said Allen P.  Whitaker, FBI special agent in charge. He refused to be more specific.    FBI Special Agent Tom Moore described her as ""coherent and helpful."" He added  that she had telephoned a neighbor after the explosion, which occurred at 2:51  p.m. Saturday, and was outside the house in her van when paramedics arrived.    She had been in the house when the bomb exploded in the kitchen.    The device was far too powerful to be a letter bomb, Moore said. ""You can  deduce from the force and thrust"" that it was much larger, he said, adding that  it had seriously injured Helen Vance even though she was in another room.  Authorities believe the package bomb was delivered by the regular mail carrier,  Moore said.    Asked about security for other federal judges, Moore said: ""They have been  warned."" He would not say if any were under guard. One federal judge in  Birmingham, giving interviews to the news media, did not appear to be  accompanied by security personnel.    While there was speculation that Vance's murder may be linked to the heavy  volume of drug cases handled by the 11th judicial circuit on which he served,  an official involved in the probe termed it ""very unusual"" for an appellate  judge to be attacked because he is fairly remote from defendants, compared with  trial judges.    However, Moore said that Vance, 58, ""does handle many drug cases,"" adding that  possible retaliation against him is among other possibilities that  investigators are probing.    If Vance's killing did turn out to be drug-related, it would be particularly  ominous because of the possibility that the Colombian drug cartels' war on  judges had spread to the United States.    Vance, a moderate named to the bench in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter,  died instantly Saturday when the package, said by one source to be a ""nail  bomb,"" exploded.    The warning to judges reiterated cautionary advice the marshals have given to  jurists in the past, a marshals official said. Vance was under no special  protection by the marshals and had received no threats, he added.    In addition to the FBI, Marshals and Postal Service, the federal Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local police and sheriff's deputies are  taking part in the investigation.    Vance was only the third federal judge to be killed this century.    U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco was shot to death at his home in May, 1988,  by a former New York City police officer unhappy over the judge's dismissal of  a sex discrimination suit filed by the ex-policeman's daughter. Charles Koster,  the former officer, killed himself after shooting Daronco.    In 1979, U.S. District Judge John H. Wood Jr. was killed by a sniper outside  his San Antonio home. FBI Director Sessions, then a federal judge in Texas,  presided over the trial of Charles V. Harrelson, who was convicted of the  drug-related contract killing and is serving two life sentences.    In 1986, there was an attempt to kill Chief U.S. District Judge Paul Benson  with a pipe bomb in Fargo, N. D., but a law clerk became suspicious about the  package containing the bomb and it was successfully deactivated. The bomb  appeared similar to one that exploded two days earlier at a nearby post office,  injuring four workers.    The Benson case has not been solved.    In the Vance neighborhood, where Christmas decorations adorn huge homes and  roadside mailboxes, residents expressed outrage at the killing and praise for  Vance.    ""He was extremely well thought of,"" said Mary Dean Gray, who lives around the  corner. ""You don't hear about things like this in Mountain Brook. Maybe in New  York, Philadelphia or L.A., but not Mountain Brook.""    ""I couldn't believe it,"" said her husband, Jim Gray. Both said many here  believe the bombing was connected with drug cases the judge had handled.    Frank Lindstrom, who lives two houses away from the Vance home, called the  bombing shocking. Vance, he said, was ""just a nice guy.""    Neighborhood lots are spacious, filled with trees, giving residents privacy and  isolation. Lindstrom said he knew nothing about the bombing until he heard  sirens at about 3:30.    Vance and his wife raised show dogs, and several were said to be on the  spacious grounds surrounding his home when the bomb exploded. The judge often  was at home Saturdays, neighbors said.    In Washington, several colleagues and friends praised Vance's dedication to the  law.    ""He was very bright and very committed,"" said Charles Morgan Jr., a college  classmate who practiced law in Birmingham in the 1960s. ""I had great respect  for his skills.""    Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Sessions, who had just returned from meetings in  Europe on counterterrorism, expressed outrage over Vance's killing in a  statement.    Thornburgh said acts such as the bombing ""are at odds with the underlying  belief of our nation and the rule of law.""    Sessions described the attack as ""an affront to the very strength of our  democratic society, our justice system.""    Vance, who served as a congressional page as a teen-ager and later became  student body president of the University of Alabama, was chairman of the  Alabama Democratic Party from 1966 to 1977.    As a loyalist of the national Democratic Party during the presidency of Lyndon  B. Johnson, Vance was often at odds with former Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace,  who sought repeatedly but unsuccessfully to purge him from the party  leadership. Vance was a moderate, while Wallace fought for segregation and  states' rights.    There was ""never a time when Bob was on the side of the basest elements of  Alabama,"" Morgan said.    May reported from Mountain Brook, and Ostrow from Washington.      Photo, U.S. Judge Robert S.

Mr Kriel said in a statement there had been a ""major  breakthrough"" in the police investigation and the matter should  now be taken up by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) ""as  a matter of urgency"".    ""Investigations have established a direct link between the  perpertrators of the Heidelberg tavern atrocity and the  territory of the Transkei. Furthermore, these investigations  have also established that the Heidelberg tavern and other  attacks could indeed have been planned and executed from the  Transkei,"" Mr Kriel said.    The minister said ballistic tests had confirnmed that the  weapons used in the Heidelberg attack and the weapons used in  the St James Church massacre were identical. Gunmen burst into  the tavern last Thursday night, killing three women and a man.    In the St James Church attack early last year, armed  attackers killed 12 people, including several Russian sailors.    Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa has said he  is  prepared to hand over suspected attackers if the South African  authorities can identify them.    Mr Kriel said on Wednesday: ""Investigations have reached the  stage where a joint investigation between the South African  Police [SAP] and Transkei Police be considered a top priority.  This would include the formation of a joint SAP/Transkei Police  investigation team as rapidly as possible and the SA Police is  ready to implement this.""    South Africa last year sent soldiers into Transkei to pursue  suspects in several attacks in South Africa. The soldiers  attacked a home of a Pan-Africanist Congress member, killing  four youths. The incident sparked a political and diplomatic row  in which South Africa's ambassador to the homeland was expelled.    In his statement on Wednesday, Mr Kriel said: ""Intensive  investigations have resulted in a major breakthrough by the SA  Police which now makes it essential that this matter be taken up  as a matter of urgency by the Transitional Executive Council.  It is a matter of extreme urgency that the TEC...Give advice on  how to deal with the problem of dealing with suspects who take  refuge in independent states. Speedy action is vital if the  perpertrators are to be brought to justice without delay. It  would be obstructive for the Transkei to insist on adhering  strictly to a rigid and formal process of extradition in these  areas.""     "

It was the deadliest guerrilla attack in five years. Last night, a second bomb attack on Israeli forces in the security zone in southern Lebanon killed another soldier and wounded two. The US said it deplored the attack on the Israelis and described it as a 'calculated attempt by extremists to derail the (Arab-Israeli) peace process'. Hundreds of Lebanese civilians, fearing another Israeli shelling offensive, fled their homes in the south, and the Lebanese army was placed on maximum alert. Eight Israeli aircraft struck at positions of the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah (Party of God) militia in Lebanon's Bekaa valley killing two Hizbollah fighters. The Israeli raid came hours after Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the dawn attack on Israeli soldiers in the zone Israel occupies in southern Lebanon. Observers in Jerusalem said the Israeli strike on targets 3km west of the Syrian border was also meant as a warning to Damascus, which has thousands of troops stationed in the Bekaa valley, and which Israel blames for allowing the Hizbollah attack. Israeli and Lebanese security officials issued conflicting accounts on the attack. Israel said seven soldiers had been killed and two wounded from the Golani brigade in a single bomb blast. The Lebanese version claimed that Hizbollah had exploded three bombs and fired machine guns against an Israeli foot patrol near the village of Shinin, killing eight soldiers and wounding four. The Hizbollah raid was the most deadly since a 1988 suicide car bomb attack and it brought Israeli casualties in the zone this year to at least 16 dead and 29 wounded. Yesterday's resurgence of violence came less than three weeks after a US-arranged ceasefire ended a devastating seven-day Israeli air and artillery bombardment of villages in southern Lebanon. For years, Syria has allowed Hizbollah to mount attacks on Israeli forces inside Lebanon. Israel had hoped that the ceasefire agreement laid the ground for improved relations with Damascus and progress in peace talks.

We now present the exclusive interviews with these  Palestinian personalities:    Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, the secretary general of the Islamic  Jihad in Palestine, elaborated on the organization's stance on  the killing of dozens of Palestinian Muslims in the mosque of  the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon bim) in Hebron in an  exclusive interview with our correspondent in Damascus.    He said: This massacre was not at all unexpected, as the  criminal Zionists have been perpetrating the most heinous crimes  in the past 50 years against the Muslim Palestinian nation.    He added: The criminal Zionists believe they can achieve  their unholy objectives by martyring the greatest number of  Palestinian Muslims and by driving the Palestinian nation out of  the country.    Regarding the joint plot by the Zionist armed forces and the  Jewish settlers in carrying out the massacre, Dr. al-Shiqaqi  stated: Naturally, the Zionist armed forces jointly carried out  this crime, because, in the past, 40 soldiers have been on guard  at the mosque round the clock. But at the time this crime was  committed, only two or three soldiers were at the scene of the  crime. They assisted the attacking settlers and provided them  with the necessary arms and equipment to kill the greatest  number of worshippers.    He said: After committing the catastrophic crime, the  criminals easily fled the scene with the help of the Zionist  armed forces. He blamed the government of Yitzhaq Rabin for the  crime and said: There is no doubt that the Rabin government had  all the information on this crime before it was perpetrated and  even prepared the conditions for killing the Palestinian Muslims.    On the condemnation of the crime by Yasir 'Arafat, he said:  It is absurd that Rabin and Clinton also condemned the crime,  when they are accomplices to the crime, the natural result of  the treasonous PLO accord with the Zionist regime plotted by the  United States.    On the future response by the Palestinian organizations to  this atrocity, Dr. al-Shiqaqi stated: Our nation does not fear  intimidation or martyrdom and will continue the intifadah. The  Palestinian guerrillas will, helped by almighty God, very soon  deliver a shattering blow to the Zionists and those who have  compromised with them. We will soon avenge the blood of the  martyrs of the Hebron Mosque.    Referring to the stances of international organizations on  this crime, al-Shiqaqi stated: Our nation pays no attention to  these organizations' stances, as the United States is  supervising them and using them. The international  organizations claim to condemn the crime but have taken no  important step to condemn the Zionist regime. The United States  will never exert pressure on Israel for committing this crime.    Commenting on the possibility of 'Arafat capitalizing on the  crime at the mosque, the secretary general of Islamic Jihad in  Palestine said: Instead of taking a stance against the Zionist  regime, 'Arafat has agreed to accept the U.S. Government's  invitation to continue talks with Rabin to rein in the  intifadah. On principle, 'Arafat has become an agent for the  policies of the United States and the Zionist regime to pave the  way for killing more Palestinian Muslims.    Concluding, he alluded to the stances of the United States  and some of the Western and regional countries asking the  Palestinian organizations not to carry out guerrilla operations  and to confine themselves to political measures and stated: The  United States and the countries above wish to draw our nation  into a compromise and will not give the Palestinian  organizations permission to take any political action. But the  Palestinian nation is determined to continue its struggle and  soon, the flames of our nation's fury will descend upon the  Zionists and upon those who have compromised and lethal blows  will be dealt by means of armed struggle against the Zionist  regime. The PLO accord with the Zionist regime will be thrown  in the dustbin of history.    In his remarks to the KEYHAN correspondent, Nayif Hawatimah  stated: The Zionist regime is the element behind the crime of  killing the worshippers in al-Khalil and 'Arafat paved the way  for its occurrence. According to Hawatimah, 'Arafat has made a  two-faced statement. First, he claimed that a demented Israeli  had committed the crime; he did this to prevent clashes from  erupting and the intifadah from continuing. Second, 'Arafat  openly held talks with Clinton and Rabin and accepted the  Rabin-Clinton plan for reining in the Palestinian guerrilla  operations. Hawatimah added: This atrocity has been committed  as a result of the accord among the United States, Israel, and  'Arafat and this compromise has been the catalyst for the  heinous atrocity in Hebron.    Answering a question on whether he will only confine himself  to political actions at this stage, Hawatimah declared: The DFLP  has faith in political means and armed operations and will  utilize every means to inflict a blow on the Israeli regime. He  called on the Western countries to revoke all negotiations with  the Zionist regime and asked the Arab countries to continue  their economic siege of Israel. On the need for coordination  among the Palestinian groups opposed to the trend of compromise,  Hawatimah said: This coordination will continue without heeding  the existing difficulties and the Palestinian organizations will  continue to prepare the Palestinian nation for the intifadah and  general strikes.    According to Hawatimah, the United States does not  comprehend  the real internal problems of Palestine and 'Arafat has no  standing in the Palestinian nation. He cannot direct or rein in  the intifadah. He added: The Zionist regime's massacres must be  halted and the UN forces should be sent to the West Bank and the  Gaza Strip for this purpose.    Hawatimah stated: Extensive demonstrations continue on the  West Bank, in Gaza, and in the Palestinian camps in Syria,  Lebanon, and Jordan and general strikes have been announced for  three days inside the occupied territories. The Zionists have  given no privileges to 'Arafat and merely prepared themselves  for committing more crimes against the Palestinian nation. Such  crimes will continue to be perpetrated under the cover of the  'Arafat-Rabin accord.    He also announced that the DFLP accepts UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 and that the United Nations must send  its troops to supervise the conditions inside the West Bank and  Gaza Strip and should treat the occupied areas like those in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He appealed to Russia, the United States,  and other countries to prevent new crimes against the  Palestinians.     "

0,FT932-5377 ,"FT932-5377 _AN-DFDB5AAYFT 930604   FT  04 JUN 93 / Salinas pledges crusade against drug traffickers      By LUCY CONGER      MEXICO CITY   MEXICO'S President Carlos Salinas has called for a 'national crusade' against the drugs trade, promising to establish an elite anti-narcotics unit to fight the war on all fronts, including money laundering and arms trafficking. His call on Wednesday came nine days after the killing of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, who was shot, apparently by drug traffickers, at Guadalajara airport. The new unit, to be formed by the Attorney-General's office, is to be equipped with the latest technology and trained in the most sophisticated investigation techniques. Mr Salinas also said he would launch constitutional reforms aimed at toughening penalties against drug criminals and tightening procedures to confiscate their property. Meanwhile, the investigation into the murder of Cardinal Posadas unearthed a large tunnel on Wednesday, apparently designed as a conduit for passing drugs under the Mexico-US border. The tunnel begins under a large warehouse by the Tijuana international airport and runs for 350 metres towards a building site on the US side of the border. The tunnel was found as police combed Tijuana looking for gangsters who fled to the border city after the Guadalajara killing. Growing scepticism over the official explanation of the shootings at Guadalajara, which claimed seven victims, is increasing pressure on the Salinas administration to produce results. Roman Catholic bishops, opposition politicians and political analysts challenge the government's claim that the cardinal, who died from 14 bullet wounds in the chest, was the accidental victim of drug traffickers who mistook him for the leader of one of Mexico's most powerful drug gangs. Mr Federico Estevez, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said such scepticism fuelled doubts about the government's ability to reign in drug traffickers as well as to control rogue former or present members of the security apparatus. Drug-related violence has increased sharply in recent months, claiming the lives of a former state prosecutor and magistrate and dozens of others killed in shoot-outs between rival gangs. Some observers speculate the cardinal's killing may have been a message from elements in the security forces irritated by recent measures aimed at combating corruption linked to drugs.

Power changed hands several times between the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, the South African Defence Force and thousands of paramilitary rightwing whites who had taken control of the capital Mmabatho and its twin town, Mafikeng. But by early this morning the South African Defence Force appeared to have the homeland largely under control. Among those killed in yesterday's fighting were two rightwing whites executed by a Bophuthatswana soldier as they begged for mercy. South African government officials said the defence force had been deployed in strength to take control after local police and soldiers joined a popular revolt against President Lucas Mangope who said he wanted Bophuthatswana to remain as a separate state and refused to participate in South Africa's first all race election in April. Last night South African officials said Mr Mangope might be allowed to remain titular head of state, but the homeland would in effect come under martial rule from Pretoria. At first only 150 troops were deployed but government officials said later 1,500 troops were being sent in with a large back-up force to remain nearby. A foreign ministry official said 57 bodies were reported at Victoria Hospital in Mmabatho and 10 bodies elsewhere after two days of looting and bitter fighting. Yesterday's events represented a humiliating defeat for the right wing, which had sent thousands of supporters to shore up Mr Mangope's failing regime, and a victory for the ANC, which has achieved its goal of ensuring Bophuthatswana will be reincorporated into South Africa and that its 2m citizens can participate in next month's elections. Mr Mangope's status remained unresolved last night, with the chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, which is supervising the conduct of the poll, flying to Mmabatho to insist on guarantees from him that Bophuthatswana will participate in the poll. Earlier, Mr Mangope issued a statement saying he had registered a political party, the Northwest Christian Democrat party, to contest the elections but government officials said this statement did not go far enough to satisfy Pretoria and the ANC on election participation. Late yesterday afternoon, South African President FW de Klerk met Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC, to decide the fate of President Mangope after the police and army revolted against his rule. Mr Mandela has urged joint administration of the homeland, through the Transitional Executive Council, the body which oversees government in the run up to elections. As dusk fell three black bodies lay in the main street of Mafikeng, apparently shot by whites, while South African armoured personnel carriers escorted whites beyond the border into South Africa. Villagers cheered as the South Africa troops chased the rightwing whites out. Earlier, outside the headquarters of the Bophuthatswana police, three whites were killed after a group in trucks being chased by Bophuthatswana Defence Force soldiers opened fire on black bystanders, provoking a gun battle. Three men were wounded. As they fell from their vehicle, one was shot immediately, and two others lay on the ground, begging for mercy before a Bophuthatswana soldier shot them dead.

The situation is further  aggravated by the entry into effect of the new Value-Added Tax  (VAT), which also starts operating as of today.    Reports on the market situation across the country create a  picture of complete chaos. This situation was brought about by  the traders' ignorance as to the VAT in spite of the large-scale  promotion campaign, rather than by the tax itself. Most regions  are witnessing a considerable price rise. In others, like the  Turgovishte region (northeastern Bulgaria), prices are still  unchanged but the shops are closed waiting for the new prices to  be set. A report from Petrich (southwestern Bulgaria) says the  shop shelves have been emptied in spite of the fact that the  prices fetched dramatic heights compared to other regions and  one would have difficulties in providing even goods of prime  necessity.    Prices have not yet gone up in most Sofia shops. Demand  today is tending down from its peak in the past days, when  people were buying virtually everything. An opinion poll found  that Sofianites are stocking up goods: 27 percent of the  respondents said they were stocking foods, 5 percent household  appliances, and another 15 percent other commodities. About 38  percent did not stock anything only because of financial  difficulties.    According to figures of the Consumers' Federation, 70  percent  of Bulgarians are living under the social minimum. The data  also said that a month ago the monthly cost of living for an  adult was 1,468 leva; for a child of 14 to 18, 1,492 leva; and  for elderly people 1,219 leva. At the same time the average  December pay was 3,900 leva, and the minimum pay, 1,565 leva.  The entry into effect of the new VAT and the higher  electricity, heating, coal and liquid fuel prices will directly  hit consumers and push up the figures cited above, says  Consumers' Federation expert Iveta Minkova.    According to analysts, the new prices of fuels and  electricity and the high exchange rate of the dollar against the  lev will be felt in the next few months. In practice, however,  shopowners marked up prices a couple of weeks ago, not waiting  for the official markup. Household appliances and audio-visual  equipment were the first to go up, followed by a substantial  price markup for staple foods. Dairy prices reported the  steepest rise, with yellow cheese soaring nearly twofold and  white cheese more than 50 percent.    The National Statistical Institute said the retail prices of  goods monitored and controlled by the Government climbed up 5.37  percent between March 15 and 31.    Chicken rose 16.40 percent, cow's cheese 15.24 percent, veal  9.77 percent, and yoghourt 8.18 percent.    The government, parliament and President's Office have 4  million children, elderly people and unemployed to take care of  who cannot be left at the mercy of fate, says Velichka Rangelova  of the National Statistical Institute. According to her, urgent  steps have to be taken to fend off an inflationary spiral and  hyperinflation.    IMF resident representative Gregory Dahl also warned of such  a danger yesterday. According to him, the new energy source  prices, VAT and high dollar rate are three factors that will  have a one-time impact on the price level. In his view it is  very important that government incomes policy does not  immediately respond to the price rise, as it would render the  fuel and electricity markup meaningless.     "

The justices, filing four separate opinions, upheld the conviction but, by a  vote of 4 to 3, ordered a new penalty trial for Peter Edelbacher, 33, found  guilty of murder for financial gain in the slaying of Lela Schwartz-Edelbacher,  25, in April, 1981.    Only weeks before the woman was fatally shot in the back, Edelbacher, a  painting contractor, had been acquitted of spousal rape in the first such trial  of its kind in the county under a new state law making the act a crime.    The court majority concluded Monday that the trial judge's instructions and  arguments by the prosecution may have misled the jury as to its discretion and  personal responsibility in deciding whether Edelbacher should be sent to the  gas chamber or receive the alternative penalty, life in prison without parole.    Statements by the prosecutor indicating that jurors should not exercise their  ""moral judgments"" in deciding the sentence were ""gravely misleading,"" Justice  Marcus M. Kaufman wrote in the court's lead opinion.    The justices, however, rejected Edelbacher's contention that he should not have  had to face the capital charge of murder for financial gain merely because he  was trying to avoid the financial obligation of paying money owed in the  settlement. Such a murder charge, he argued, should be limited to cases  involving hired killers, murder for an inheritance or a killing for insurance  benefits.    But the court, reaffirming past rulings, said the issue was only whether the  murder had been committed in the expectation of obtaining a ""desired financial  gain.""    ""It has been widely recognized that murder for financial gain is an especially  vile crime for which the death penalty may appropriately be imposed,"" Kaufman  wrote.    ""The (ruling) urged by the defendant would result in an arbitrary and  irrational distinction . . . since a killing to avoid a loss is as basely  motivated and repugnant as a killing for a positive reward or profit.""    The decision marked the 19th reversal in 66 capital rulings by the court since  the departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court members  defeated in the fall, 1986, election.    In an unusual series of votes, all seven justices agreed that the charges and  Edelbacher's conviction should be upheld. The narrow majority to overturn the  death sentence was provided by Kaufman, writing a 90-page lead opinion; Justice  Stanley Mosk, joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard in a separate concurring  opinion, and Justice Edward A. Panelli, writing another separate concurring  opinion.    In dissent, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, joined by Justices John A.  Arguelles and David N. Eagleson, contended that any procedural errors in the  penalty phase of the trial were harmless and that Edelbacher's death sentence  should be upheld.    Edelbacher was married in 1977, but after the birth of a son the two separated  and Lela Edelbacher filed for divorce. In May, 1980, Lela Edelbacher reported  that he had raped her and Edelbacher was arrested and released on bail. A few  days later, witnesses said, Edelbacher threatened to ""blow her . . . head off.""    Later, Edelbacher was acquitted in the locally well-publicized rape case.  Meanwhile, a dissolution settlement was reached in which Edelbacher retained  the couple's 44-acre ranch but agreed to pay her $48,730.50 for her interest in  the property.    On the night of April 3, 1981, Lela Edelbacher, while in the bedroom of her  parents' home, was struck in the back with a shotgun blast fired through the  window.    Edelbacher was charged with murder while lying in wait, murder for financial  gain and solicitation to murder another woman who allegedly ""knew too much""  about the crime. (Edelbacher later pleaded guilty to that charge; there was no  attempt on the woman's life.) The prosecution charged that Edelbacher killed  his wife in the belief that he could avoid his debt to her, as well as sidestep  a child-support payment of $700 by gaining custody of their son.    In Monday's ruling, the court concluded that there was a ""reasonable  possibility"" that the jury was misled as to how it should weigh the favorable  and unfavorable factors in deciding whether the defendant should live or die.    Kaufman said the trial judge, then-Superior Court Judge Hollis G. Best, had  failed to make clear the jury was not to ""mechanically"" weigh aggravating  factors against mitigating factors. Jurors should have been told that they have  discretion to ""assign whatever value they deem appropriate"" to such factors and  to take personal responsibility for their individual decisions, the justice  said.

The probe is being organized by the Environmental Protection  Committees of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the State  Council.    All violators will be punished and their actions released to  the media, said Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing  committee.    Wang said some people still work against State laws and  stipulations on environmental protection.    New industrial projects have been built without reporting to  the local environmental departments and some have caused large  amounts of pollution.    The poaching, killing and sale of endangered animals under  national protection is still rampant in some places.    And inspectors will be looking to get rid of small cement  plants, paper mills, petrochemical works and smelting furnaces  that have been banned but are making a comeback.    The new effort will target 10 provinces and autonomous  regions: Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan,  Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi.    The inspections will check on law enforcement, environmental  controls and wildlife protection, in addition to the  implementation of STate regulations on forestry, water and soil  preservation.    Song Jian, Director of the State council's Environment  Protection Committee, called for changes in the law to include  criminal penalties as severe as those faced by smugglers and  drug traffickers.    Such penalties should include jail, he said.    Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental  Protection Agency (NEPA), reported the illegal poaching, killing  and smuggling of protected wild animals had survived despite  repeated government sweeps.    Some hotels and restaurants still make a fortune out of  dishes based on rare animals.    Xie said some regions have brought in foreign projects that  fall short of Nepa requirements, while others have imported  harmful waste.    Technologically poor equipment and a lack of  counter-pollution measures in many rural enterprises account for  severe pollution and ecological disturbance in a wide range of  areas, he said.    City residents most often complain about pollution from  waste  water, waste gas and trash and noise.    Some areas have eagerly launched high energy and  pollution-prone projects at the expense of the environment as  they greedily pursue short-term economic benefits, the official  said.    Air quality in only a few of the 500 major cities has  reached  the State's first-grade standard, he added, and acid rain has  spread from South China to some hinterland districts.     "

At the least, the terrorists  committed a crime by killing a Thai and putting his body in a  water tank that contained explosives. Imagine how serious the  damage would have been if the highly destructive bomb had really  exploded. The damage would not only have affected the target of  the terrorists' revenge, but also Thai people who were not the  target of their vengeance at all.    Therefore, we must not let this savage act pass like a  trivial issue. At least their colleagues in the movement will  realize that committing terrorist acts, killing our people, and  causing damage in our country are unacceptable to us. They will  never gain the Thai people's sympathy or support for their  fight. Therefore, this terrorist act in our country has ruined  any chance for friendship and understanding from the Thai  people. They must keep this fact in mind.    Whatever the target of the terrorist act was -- whether it  involved the Palestinian-Israeli problem, the Arab-Israeli  conflict, or any religious or political dispute -- if they  cannot love each other the way human beings should help and  sympathize with one another, and if they remain vengeful rather  than reaching an understanding with each other, let them carry  out their revenge somewhere else. They must not use Thai  territory as a battlefield for their vengeance and destruction.    Thailand is friendly with all countries. Our country is open  to people of all nations in compliance with our policy of  promoting tourism, which is a way to bring money into the  country and encourage the country's economic growth. We do not  want this open door policy to make our country a battlefield for  people from one country to take out revenge and kill people from  other countries, or for a follower of one ideology to harm  someone who holds different beliefs. We do not want our country  to be a venue for revenge.    We hope they understand the Thai people's desires. They must  know that committing crimes in other countries will cause them  to be hated. At the same time, it will also isolate them from  the world community. An isolated struggle, without sympathy  from the world community, will never bring victory -- only  defeat. Those who commit terrorist acts in other countries will  be denied entry. Thailand is ready to deny entry and not welcome  these kinds of people.     "

HANDWRITING SAMPLES OF SUSPECTS WILL BE  SOUGHT.      By RONALD L. SOBLE and JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Authorities believe they have discovered the shop where Lyle and Erik Menendez  allegedly purchased shotguns used to murder their parents in Beverly Hills, and  they are attempting in court to obtain handwriting samples that would establish  the link, The Times has learned.    While sources familiar with the investigation said that the murder weapons have  not been found, detectives have discovered in a San Diego County gun shop paper  work that could turn into important evidence to establish that the brothers  purchased two 12-gauge shotguns used to slay their parents.    Lyle, 22, and, Erik, 19, were arrested last March 8 in the murders of their  parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, and are being held without bail. Each faces  murder charges with special circumstance allegations -- multiple murders,  killing for financial gain and lying in wait -- that could result in the death  penalty if convicted.    The two defendants have pleaded not guilty. No date has been set for their  preliminary hearing.    The Menendez couple were slain while watching television in the family room of  their mansion on Elm Drive on the evening of last Aug. 20. Menendez, 45, was  chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a video and music  distributor.    The murder weapons, two 12-gauge shotguns, were purchased in a gun store in San  Diego County shortly before the murders, the sources said. The name of the shop  was not immediately known.    The prosecutor in the case, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Eliott E.  Alhadeff, has asked for new handwriting samples from the brothers. Alhadeff  would not comment on why he wants the samples, but sources said it was in  connection with the sale of the shotguns.    Neither attorney for the defendants, Gerald Chaleff nor Leslie Abramson, would  comment on the case Tuesday.    Several gun shop owners along the Interstate 5 corridor in San Diego County  told The Times that investigators canvassed the area for the weapons about a  month ago.    Under federal law, to purchase a weapon, an individual must fill out a ""4473""  form for the gun shop owner. It requires the buyer to provide name, address and  other vital information and has to be signed by the purchaser, who must also  provide an identification card with a picture, usually a driver's license.    Separately on Tuesday, Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht  ordered the county coroner to release autopsy reports on the slain couple,  based on motions filed by lawyers representing two television networks, NBC and  ABC.    According to the reports, the killers used two types of shotgun ammunition,  large pellets and birdshot. Five blasts hit Jose Menendez, 10 blasts hit his  wife, wrote Dr. Irwin L. Golden, who performed the autopsies.    Sources have said knowledge that two types of ammunition were used in the  slayings could be important evidence at trial, lending credence to the belief  that two killers were involved. Previously, it was revealed that a former  Princeton classmate of Lyle Menendez turned over an expended shotgun shell  allegedly found in one of Lyle's jackets to detectives last fall.    According to the coroner's reports, apparently one of the killers came up  behind Jose Menendez and fired a round that blew off the back of his head,  killing him instantly.    Early in the murder investigation, it was believed that a shotgun had been  fired in the victim's mouth, because of the nature of the fatal wound. It led  to assumptions by some that the double killing was mob-engineered. But,  according to the autopsy report, the trajectory of the blast was ""back to  front.""    Jose Menendez, dressed in a sweat shirt, shorts and leather shoes, according to  the report, also was hit in both arms and the chest.    ""There was evidence of close-range firing . . . ,"" the report said.    Kitty Menendez, dressed in a sweat shirt, jogging pants and sneakers, was  struck by 10 blasts, according to Golden's report. Fatal blasts of birdshot  pellets hit her in the face and chest, he said.    Investigative sources have said that Kitty Menendez was found a few feet from a  sofa on which the couple were sitting. The angle of the shotgun blasts,  according to the autopsy, support investigative theories that she was slain  while attempting to flee.    William Eckert, a nationally known forensic expert who examined the autopsy  reports at the request of The Times, said it appeared the killings were done by  amateurs.

HANDWRITING SAMPLES OF SUSPECTS WILL BE  SOUGHT.      By RONALD L. SOBLE and JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Authorities believe they have discovered the shop where Lyle and Erik Menendez  allegedly purchased shotguns used to murder their parents in Beverly Hills, and  they are attempting in court to obtain handwriting samples that would establish  the link, The Times has learned.    While sources familiar with the investigation said that the murder weapons have  not been found, detectives have discovered in a San Diego County gun shop paper  work that could turn into important evidence to establish that the brothers  purchased two 12-gauge shotguns used to slay their parents.    Lyle, 22, and, Erik, 19, were arrested last March 8 in the murders of their  parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, and are being held without bail. Each faces  murder charges with special circumstance allegations -- multiple murders,  killing for financial gain and lying in wait -- that could result in the death  penalty if convicted.    The two defendants have pleaded not guilty. No date has been set for their  preliminary hearing.    The Menendez couple were slain while watching television in the family room of  their mansion on Elm Drive on the evening of last Aug. 20. Menendez, 45, was  chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a video and music  distributor.    The murder weapons, two 12-gauge shotguns, were purchased in a gun store in San  Diego County shortly before the murders, the sources said. The name of the shop  was not immediately known.    The prosecutor in the case, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Eliott E.  Alhadeff, has asked for new handwriting samples from the brothers. Alhadeff  would not comment on why he wants the samples, but sources said it was in  connection with the sale of the shotguns.

Eric Cunningham pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree murder for killing  Walter Bickly Hackman, 23, of Palm Desert during a drug deal gone sour on April  21, 1989.    According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman, Cunningham sold cocaine in  Pacoima and fatally shot Hackman after Hackman decided to buy drugs from  another dealer. Hackman drove his van several hundred yards from the shooting  and collapsed.    Vaughn Grant, a 39-year-old house painter from San Fernando, was arrested on  suspicion of murder after being pulled over while driving Hackman's van, which  carrying the dying victim. Police had stopped the car because it matched a  description given by a witness.    When he was arrested, Grant told authorities that, while he was walking home,  he happened to see the van with Hackman slumped over in the driver's seat.  Realizing that Hackman needed emergency medical treatment, he got in the van  and began driving Hackman to a hospital, he said.    Authorities found no evidence to tie Grant to the murder, and did not charge  him with it, but said they believed he was trying to steal the van and the  victim's money.    Charged with grand theft, Grant pleaded no contest a month later. He said in a  subsequent interview that he entered the plea because authorities told him they  would release him from jail if he did. He was given a six-month suspended  sentence.    By the time Grant was sentenced on June 1, detectives conducting further  investigation said they had found evidence that Cunningham was the killer.    Richman said Thursday that the district attorney's office has no plans to  reopen Grant's case because prosecutors still believe that even though he was  not involved in the shooting, he was attempting to steal the dying man's truck  and money.    Officers who halted the van and ordered Grant out said that he dropped a bloody  $50 bill, which they said he had taken from Hackman.    Grant denied that he meant to steal anything. He never had any bloody money, he  said.    Cunningham was arrested the day after Grant was sentenced. He originally was  charged with first-degree murder with the special circumstance that the killing  occurred during a robbery, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison  without possibility of parole.    Prosecutors said they offered Cunningham a plea agreement -- under which he  will be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison -- because it would be too  difficult to prove special circumstances.

Timothy Scott Roman told police he and his mother had been arguing on the night  of Dec. 10, 1986, when she came at him with a scalpel, Detective Philip  Quartararo testified in Van Nuys Superior Court.    Roman told police he took the scalpel from his mother and hit her on the head  with a dumbbell in self-defense, Quartararo said. ""He said he didn't remember  how many times he hit her,"" he testified.    Quartararo's testimony came during cross-examination by Roman's attorney,  Chester Leo Smith. It was the first time in the week-long trial that a witness  testified that Roman had admitted the slaying.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone said outside the courtroom that Roman's  confession was not used by the prosecution because it was offered after the  defendant had asked to speak to an attorney, which under court rulings made it  inadmissible.    Stone said he could not explain why Roman's own attorney would want to put the  confession on the record, unless it was for some unknown tactical reason.    Smith could not be reached for comment.    Last week jurors heard a tape recording of detectives interviewing Roman about  the slaying of his 59-year-old mother, a leading actress in 1950s action  movies. During the 90-minute interview, Roman denied killing his mother. ""I had  nothing to do with it. I swear to God!"" he shouted to his interrogators.      Treated at Hospital    At the conclusion of the interview, Roman asked to speak with an attorney.    Under Smith's questioning, Quartararo testified Tuesday that after Roman was  interviewed by police he was taken to Humana Hospital-West Hills, where he was  treated for minor injuries he said were sustained during a fight with a  burglar.    Police testified earlier that officers found no evidence that anyone had broken  into the house.    Quartararo said Roman admitted killing his mother after they left the hospital  and were returning to the Encino home the defendant shared with his mother. At  the house, Roman showed police where he hid the weapons used during the fight,  Quartararo testified. The scalpel, a knife and a dumbbell were found inside a  detergent box in the laundry room, Quartararo said.    Charged with first-degree murder, but without the special conditions that could  bring the death penalty, Roman faces a possible life term in prison.    He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If he is convicted, his  insanity claim will be heard by the same jury.

The child, a 13-year-old girl, was taken by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall  Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where she was in critical condition and  breathing with the help of a respirator late Thursday afternoon, hospital  spokeswoman Jane McCue said. The girl's name and the identities of the other  victims, a man and two women, were withheld until relatives could be notified.    The plane, a Trinidad TB-21 four-seater en route from Sacramento to Van Nuys  Airport, crashed at about 2:10 p.m. in rugged terrain west of Sierra Highway  and south of Placerita Canyon Road, said Federal Aviation Administration  spokeswoman Elly Brekke.    Eyewitnesses said the pilot appeared to have been trying to land on Sierra  Highway, when the plane hit a high-voltage power line and plummeted to the  ground.    Four minutes before the crash, the pilot had radioed the Van Nuys tower to  report engine problems and ask for directions to the nearest airport, airport  spokesman Bob Hayes said. The plane crashed moments after an air traffic  controller gave directions and told the pilot to switch to a ""Mayday"" radio  frequency, Hayes said.    The pilot was operating under visual flight rules and was not being guided by  ground controllers, Brekke said.    Eyewitness John Stephens was taking pictures of a nearby auto accident and,  after seeing the plane crash, went to check on the victims. Stephens said the  pilot was a man who appeared to be in his 60s. The two women who died also  appeared to be in their 60s, he said.    The injured girl lay on her back in the brush after apparently having been  thrown several feet from the red-colored plane, Stephens and other eyewitnesses  said.    ""There was no engine noise at all,"" said Jason Moore, 22, who saw the crash  while working at a nearby construction site. ""It was just gliding. It made a  hard right turn . . . and then it clipped a wire and we heard it crash.""    ""It looked like it didn't have any power,"" said Scott Fiscus, 26, another  construction worker. ""The pilot was coasting and trying to get his nose up. We  saw it clip the wire and part of the plane flew off.""    Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board  remained at the crash scene late Thursday.    Times staff writer Hector Tobar contributed to this article.

""There was no engine noise at all,"" said Jason Moore, 22, who saw the crash  while working at a nearby construction site. ""It was just gliding. It made a  hard right turn . . . and then it clipped a wire and we heard it crash.""    ""It looked like it didn't have any power,"" said Scott Fiscus, 26, another  construction worker. ""The pilot was coasting and trying to get his nose up. We  saw it clip the wire and part of the plane flew off.""    Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board  remained at the crash scene late Thursday.    Times staff writer Hector Tobar contributed to this article.

An officer was shot in the wrist and a police dog was killed in the Culver City  incident; a bystander was wounded in the head by a fragment from a police  bullet in the Hollywood shooting.    Both episodes occurred Wednesday night.    The first began about 9:30 p.m., when Hollywood Division Sgt. Richard Dedmon,  39, was flagged down by a bail bondsman at Yucca Street and Whitley Avenue,  police said. As Dedmon and the bondsman spoke, they were approached by  Catherine Hernandez, 32, who appeared to be drunk, according to police reports.  Dedmon ordered her to leave, but Hernandez instead pulled out a large folding  knife and allegedly threatened the officer.      Eight Shots Fired    Dedmon called for backup and, when other officers arrived, they shot Hernandez  with a Taser gun, a device that fires electrically charged darts that  temporarily incapacitate a person. Hernandez, however, pulled out the darts and  jumped onto the hood of a parked car, police said.    When she allegedly lunged at Officer Julie Boyer, 30, she, Dedmon and Officer  Joan Leuck, 29, fired a total of eight rounds, striking Hernandez in the left  leg, both arms, and the lower back.    Hernandez was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was in stable  condition Thursday afternoon. Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Hernandez  sustained eight wounds.    Another woman walking across the street at the time of the shooting, Peggy  Erickson, 18, was grazed in the left temple by a bullet fragment. She was  treated at a hospital and released.    The Culver City shooting occurred about 11 p.m, two hours after motorcycle  officers from West Los Angeles chased two suspects in what turned out to be a  stolen car. The pursuit ended at Washington Boulevard and Bledsoe Avenue in  Culver City when the car crashed into a curb.    After jumping out of the car, the driver, identified as Jorge Jaramillo, 17, of  Silver Lake, fired once at officers, missing them, according to police. After  other officers arrived, a house-by-house search was begun.      Officer, Dog Shot    K-9 Officer John Hall, 41, and his dog, Liberty, were searching a garage in the  4100 block of Bledsoe Avenue when they were hit by gunfire from a storage room.  Hall was shot in the right wrist; Liberty, a female Rottweiler, was struck in  the chest. Although wounded, Hall returned fire and took up another position  near the front of the garage.    According to a Police Department press release, Jaramillo suddenly emerged from  the storage room and Hall fired several more shots from his 9-millimeter  pistol, fatally wounding him.    A second K-9 officer, Sgt. Mark Mooring, 38, then sent his German shepherd,  Friday, into the garage and found another suspect, Amir Abedi, 18, a San  Fernando Valley resident. When he allegedly pointed a handgun at Mooring, the  officer fired his pistol three times, killing Abedi. A .22-caliber revolver was  recovered from the suspect, police said.    Hall was in good condition at UCLA Medical Center where he was treated for a  fractured arm. Liberty, who had participated in 250 searches and was credited  with 103 arrests in two years on the force, died at a local veterinary office.    Wednesday's shooting was not the first for Mooring and Hall, both 17-year  veterans of the department, records show.      Suspect Killed    Last June, both officers participated in the killing of a 16-year-old burglary  suspect, who had fatally shot a rookie police officer minutes earlier. After  the suspect was found in the attic of a North Hollywood house, Hall and Mooring  were among four officers who shot the suspect three times in the face when he  repeatedly tried to reach for a gun, according to police reports.    Two years before that shooting, Hall participated in the hunt for three men who  had allegedly fired on police officers during a chase. After finding one of the  suspects hiding in a carport in South-Central Los Angeles, Hall and another  officer killed him after the suspect allegedly reached for a gun.    Wednesday's shooting was Mooring's fourth since 1985, records show.    In September, 1985, he and another K-9 officer confronted a suspected auto  thief who was hiding under a pickup truck in Van Nuys. After the suspect  announced, ""I ain't going back"" and ""rapidly moved his left arm"" as if to arm  himself, Mooring and the other officer wounded him in the shoulder, hips and  legs.    In April, 1987, Mooring and his dog attempted to flush a prison escapee from  the crawl space of a house on Mt. Washington. According to reports, when the  escapee appeared to reach for a revolver, Mooring fired three rounds at the  escapee and two other officers fired a total of four shots, killing the  escapee.

The  one who betrays his country cannot appreciate others because he  lacks all feelings of citizenship in both heart and mind.  Likewise, the one who plots to fragment his country will not  hesitate to send all the sons of the country to the crematorium  of death and annihilation. Every criminal who commits such  crimes will not hesitate to perpetrate the ugliest of crimes  toward others, be they men, women, youths, elderly, or children.  Thus, the mania of crime and grudge led traitor agent 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, the initiator of war and killer of children and  women, to cherish the idea of killing children with trickery and  cheap games in a bid to distort the citizens' feelings toward  the future of the homeland. As for their present, unity has  triumphed to the point of no return. The immortal existence of  unity has been baptized for ever by the sacrifices of the brave  heroes of the Armed and Security Forces. Otherwise, what is the  meaning of criminal al-Bid's distribution of booby-trapped pens,  toys, and watches in Aden streets and suburbs so that children  can pick them up and get blown up under the claim that the one  who distributed them and dropped them from planes are the forces  of unity and legitimacy? They will then portray those  victimized children to the world public as victims of the  missiles which they falsely claim the forces of unity and  protection of legitimacy are using to shell the city suburbs.  It is easy to tell such lies and make such fabrications before  us and the world. They are cheap lies about an ugly crime of  killing children in such a vile and cowardly manner.    While revealing this bitter fact about the latest innovation  of the criminal secessionists, we appeal to fathers and mothers  and all citizens in the suburbs of the city of Aden--in  (Kiraytar), al-Mu'alla, al-Tawwahi, (Hawr Makthar), al-Shaykh  'Uthman, al-Qallu'ah, al-Burayqah, al-Mansurah, al-Sha'b city,  and other suburbs--to prevent children from picking up any pens,  watches, toys, or housewares from the streets in front of their  houses so that their lives will be saved and no distortions be  sustained.    As for the criminal secessionist butchers, they will sooner  or later receive their punishment. Our people will never be  deceived by all their criminal methods and vile, treacherous  actions. Tomorrow is close at hand for all to see.     "

A  transitional government based on a peace agreement signed on  August 4 last year was to include members of the insurgent  [Rwandan] Patriotic Front (RPF) most of whose members are from  the Tutsi minority. But the ethnic bloodshed which broke out  after President Juvenal Habyarimana's death on April 6 in a  suspicious plane crash put paid to the plan.    ""The soldiers wanted to stage a coup but they realised a  coup  would not win support and instead installed a government which  would do what they wanted,"" said Twagiramungu, who has fled to  Kenya where he is living at an undisclosed location. He said  Monday [25 April] the ""strongman"" behind the alleged coup was a  chief of staff at the Defence Ministry. [passage omitted]    Twagiramungu, 49, a member of the Republican Democratic  Movement (MDR) - the main opposition party to the Habyarimana  regime - is a Hutu. He was to have taken over as prime minister  from Agathe Uwilingiyimana, also from the MDR. However Hutu  hardliners in the presidential guard murdered Uwilingiyimana and  would have killed Twagiramungu if he had not fled his home and  left the country, he said. He said he had ""jumped over the  wall"" into a neighbour's home from where he was taken aboard a  United Nations armoured vehicle to the headquarters of the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). He stayed there until  April 19.    Twagiramungu said he had had to leave his family at the home  of another neighbour because there was only room in the UN  vehicle for himself and his eight Bangladeshi bodyguards.  Soldiers looted and machine-gunned his home after he left, he  told journalists here. In the doomed plane carrying Habyarimana  were also several of his closest aides including the Army chief  of staff. The president of neighbouring Burundi Cyprien  Ntaryamira and two of his ministers were also aboard, though  Twagiramungu said that in his view ""for the Burundians, it was  an accident. No one knew they would be there.""    Twagiramungu said the RPF had ""nothing to gain"" from killing  the president and that it was more likely that Hutu extremists  in the Army had done it to ""revive the civil war"" because they  resented sharing power with the Tutsis. Twagiramungu accused  these soldiers of having made several previous attempts to  revive the fighting. One involved the murder of the minister of  public works Felicien Gatabazi, who was shot dead in Kigali on  February 21, he said.     "

0,FT931-16992 ,"FT931-16992 _AN-DADBPAALFT 930104   FT  04 JAN 93 / The Year Ahead: Taking sights at prosperity - and for some merely survival      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   After 12 months of setback and disappointment, most people in the industrialised world will be hoping that 1993 will be a year of economic recovery and prosperity after slowdown and recession in 1991 and 1992. Many millions more outside that relatively small group of most favoured nations will have their sights set lower - on mere survival and an end to conflict. The new year begins with some favourable aspects. With luck, the start of the European single market and the inauguration of president Bill Clinton later this month may boost business confidence in Europe and the US and so help restore growth. But the uncertainties are daunting and cover the globe. Many industrial countries are still shackled by high real interest rates. Further tensions are likely in the European exchange rate mechanism, threatening the EC's ambitious plans for economic and monetary union. Germany, supposedly Europe's economic powerhouse, has difficulty finding the right mix of budget and wages policy to tame inflation. Japan is held back by debt deflation. Constitutional problems beset Canada. Little wonder, therefore, that late in 1992 the International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for industrial country growth this year to 2 per cent from the 3 per cent forecast less than three months before. Such growth will not stop further increases in unemployment. Problems abound elsewhere. 1993 will see a continued struggle to bring economic reform to Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union. But eastern Europe's experience since communism's collapse holds out little hope that victory for reform will swiftly bring prosperity. Large parts of Africa face further economic decline. It is unlikely that harrowing pictures of famine will be banished from the television screens of the developed world. Where prosperity beckons, as in China, political freedoms often remain chained. Yet there are glimmers of hope. A rush of upbeat statistics and confidence indicators at the end of last year could signal a clear recovery phase for the US economy after many false dawns. The UK, now freed of the need to hold its interest rates at German levels, stands a good chance of escaping from its longest recession since the second world war. But both countries will need strong political leadership if they are to reduce their swollen budget deficits and make recovery a prospect for the long term. The world will still face difficulties adjusting to the end of the cold war: both the industrialised democracies and the former communist powers have yet to convert their military-industrial complexes to peaceful uses. But local wars apart, the globe is becoming a safer place. Nuclear disarmament continues apace. Elections will be frequent in 1993, testifying to the strength of democracy and its growing importance in the third world. If the IMF is to be believed, developing countries as a whole will grow by a creditable 5.75 per cent, largely because some countries, notably in Latin America, have adopted the free market policies and principles that their industrialised competitors are spurning at their peril. But this year, like 1991 and 1992, will be one in which world leaders find they are at the mercy of unpredictable developments.

C. Thomas McDonald, in closing remarks in the two-month-long death penalty  hearing, relied heavily on defense psychiatric tests that showed Kraft suffered  from brain abnormalities.    ""If we stand for anything that is real, we don't kill people who have brain  damage,"" McDonald argued in a Santa Ana courtroom.    The jurors, who convicted Kraft three months ago of 16 Orange County murders,  today will begin their first full day of deliberations on a verdict of death or  life in prison without parole. Their ruling will end the year-long trial that  many believe could be one of the most costly in the state's history.    Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin sent them into the jury room Tuesday  afternoon to begin deliberations. But after choosing a foreman, they told the  judge that they preferred to go home and start fresh in the morning. McCartin,  who sequestered the panel at an area hotel during the trial's guilt-phase  deliberations, chose not to sequester them this time.    The jurors had heard closing arguments Monday from Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F.  Brown, who told them that Kraft killed his victims for his own evil, sexual  pleasure.    Kraft, now 44, a computer consultant from Long Beach, has denied killing  anyone.    All of the victims were young men, most between the ages of 18 and 25. The  bodies of most of them showed signs of sexual mutilation or sexual abuse and  were dumped along freeway ramps or in remote areas. Besides the 16 murders in  the guilt phase of the trial, the prosecutor linked Kraft to eight more  homicides in the penalty phase: six in Oregon and two in Michigan.    On Tuesday, both McDonald and defense co-counsel James G. Merwin argued to the  jurors that they couldn't help but think that there had to be questions left  unanswered about Kraft's guilt on some of the homicides.    Merwin's role was to raise doubts about Kraft's guilt in the Oregon and  Michigan homicides, which were added to the case in the penalty phase to help  support the prosecution's request for the death penalty.

C. Thomas McDonald, in closing remarks in the two-month-long death penalty  hearing, relied heavily on defense psychiatric tests that showed Kraft suffered  from brain abnormalities.    ""If we stand for anything that is real, we don't kill people who have brain  damage,"" McDonald argued in a Santa Ana courtroom.    The jurors, who convicted Kraft three months ago of 16 Orange County murders,  today will begin their first full day of deliberations on a verdict of death or  life in prison without parole. Their ruling will end the year-long trial that  many believe could be one of the most costly in the state's history.    Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin sent them into the jury room Tuesday  afternoon to begin deliberations. But after choosing a foreman, they told the  judge that they preferred to go home and start fresh in the morning. McCartin,  who sequestered the panel at an area hotel during the trial's guilt-phase  deliberations, chose not to sequester them this time.    The jurors had heard closing arguments Monday from Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F.  Brown, who told them that Kraft killed his victims for his own evil, sexual  pleasure.    Kraft, now 44, a computer consultant from Long Beach, has denied killing  anyone.    All of the victims were young men, most between the ages of 18 and 25. The  bodies of most of them showed signs of sexual mutilation or sexual abuse and  were dumped along freeway ramps or in remote areas. Besides the 16 murders in  the guilt phase of the trial, the prosecutor linked Kraft to eight more  homicides in the penalty phase: six in Oregon and two in Michigan.    On Tuesday, both McDonald and defense co-counsel James G. Merwin argued to the  jurors that they couldn't help but think that there had to be questions left  unanswered about Kraft's guilt on some of the homicides.    Merwin's role was to raise doubts about Kraft's guilt in the Oregon and  Michigan homicides, which were added to the case in the penalty phase to help  support the prosecution's request for the death penalty.    The jurors will not return verdicts on Kraft's guilt in any of those homicides.  But under the law, they can consider those eight other homicides in deciding a  death verdict if they are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Kraft is  guilty of them.

0,FT924-277 ,"FT924-277 _AN-CL2BCAB8FT 921229   FT  29 DEC 92 / Lebanon blocks UN mercy visit: Israel says 10 stranded Palestinian deportees can return      By HUGH CARNEGY      JERUSALEM   LEBANON said yesterday it would prevent a United Nations envoy from crossing its territory to visit 415 Palestinians stranded in severe winter conditions for 11 days in no man's land in the south of the country. Mr James Jonah, a special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, travels on to Beirut from Jerusalem today for talks with the government of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister. Lebanon still refuses to co-operate with Israel over the deportations and says Israel must take back the men. The Israeli army said early today that 10 of the deportees could return. It said the decision to deport the 10 had been found to be incorrect but some would have to face trial in Israel for hostile activities. Officials have also stressed that the deportees can appeal individually to the High Court. The High Court ruled against moves to stop the deportations last week, but has yet to rule on the overall legality of the expulsions. In spite of Mr Jonah's efforts, there were few signs of any substantive breakthrough in the crisis which has convulsed Middle East peace negotiations. Palestinian leaders, frustrated that Israel has repeatedly escaped reprisals for ignoring UN resolutions, told Mr Jonah at a meeting in Jerusalem yesterday that it should be forced to implement a Security Council resolution calling for the return of the deportees - alleged by Israel to be militant Islamic fundamentalists - to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'We demanded that they should be returned immediately, that Israel should apply UN Sec-urity Council resolution 799 immediately,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman. 'Unfortunately, we explained, so far Israel has been given preferential treatment by the world community.' However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, ruled out any reversal of the deportations, undertaken after a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers by Moslem extremists, when he met Mr Jonah on Sunday. The deportees, camped in south Lebanon in an area between Israeli and Lebanese forces, have been forced to endure heavy snowfalls and freezing temperatures without adequate supplies of food and water, or access to proper medical care, as both Israel and Lebanon have refused to take responsibility for their welfare. Mr Rabin has maintained wide support within his government for the deportations. But his refusal to allow humanitarian aid to be taken to the camp through Israeli-held territory has come under strong opposition. Yesterday, France requested permission to do so and said it was awaiting a response. The Israeli government has acknowledged that the deportations have shattered the favourable international image fostered by Mr Rabin since he came to office in July. The military said deportees who were expelled due to mistaken identity could return if they appealed to a special army committee or the High Court. A meeting of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians at the weekend decided to seek UN action to enforce resolution 799. But it did not rule out a return to the peace talks after the new US administration takes over next month. Editorial Comment, Page 10  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

Ministers said the Government would publish a ""commentary""  on  the declaration. They insisted that it would not amount to a  clarification, but it would put pressure on the IRA to enter the  peace process. A statement is expected in the Commons by Sir  Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.    Meanwhile, two Catholic building workers were gunned down as  they sat having their lunch on a building site in the Protestant  North Queen Street area of Belfast. In the attack, claimed by  the Ulster Volunteer Force [UVF], the gunmen opened fire with an  automatic weapon, killing the two men almost instantly. A third  man escaped with cuts.    The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] later made arrests and  recovered firearms. A police officer condemned the killings as  blatantly sectarian. The two men, both commuters from rural  areas, were easy targets working in a strongly loyalist area.  One was a 44-year-old father of five, the other was 24 with one  child. Friends denied UVF claims that they were active  republicans. SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party] councillor  Ignatius Fox said: ""Neither of the two was involved in anything.  They were trying to rear their families and do a day's work.""  The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland is due to continue  the work today on the response to a series of questions  submitted by Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein. The aim  is to answer the questions in a ""dead-pan"" manner, without  shifting the joint position that Sinn Fein can only enter the  talks process after renouncing violence.    ""An end to violence is the bottom line. We are not getting  involved in negotiations,"" one ministerial source said. Ulster  Unionists have been assured that it will be a ""one-off"" exercise.    Mr Adams said yesterday he was disturbed and concerned at  reports that the Government's answers to Sinn Fein's questions  would not amount to clarification of the Downing Street  declaration.    Mr Adams claimed there was growing concern among  nationalists  that the Government ""may squander yet another opportunity to  advance the peace process."" He called for ""comprehensive,  unambiguous and honest"" responses.    Neither London nor Dublin believes that the Government's  responses stand any change of bringing about a cessation of IRA  violence. The prevailing Northern Ireland Office view is that  Mr Adams has painted himself into a corner and cannot deliver  the republican movement.     "

Killers is set in the north of England during the Gulf war and traces the fortunes of two brothers. On the day that the elder, David Shand (Mark McGann), is sent to fight for Kuwait, the younger, Jonathan (Stephen McGann) murders a man with whom his girlfriend has had a casual affair. The rest of the action concerns the effect of the double-trauma on the family, especially Mrs Shand (Rowena Cooper). The relationship between the parents, unable to face the pity and horror of their neighbours at the civilian killing and at the absence of their other son in a war they do not understand, eventually snaps. The tone is anti-war, anti-prison and anti-establishment. What else would you expect from a writer who juxtaposes killing for your country and civilian crime? Yet there are also ironies. As the real war goes on, father (Sam Kelly) and sons wage their own private war for control of the stereo system. Even in the depths of parental misery, where mother and father seek refuge at the allotment, there are acts of comic violence. As Mrs Shand bears the brunt of her husband's disappointment with his life, she suddenly hits back, sweeping away the row of vegetables he has just meticulously planted - again perhaps a reflection of the wider anarchy. The character of the mother is a study in the English inability to put feelings into words. She disapproves of herself for feeling proud of her sons and is unwilling to admit her fears for them. The play suggests that parents who legitimise their own powerlessness through aspirations of their children's glories run a serious risk of disappointment. Maternal pride is a heavy burden, perhaps too heavy, for young people to bear. There is passion and poignancy. The real life brothers McGann deliver strong performances as both sons are haunted by the ghosts they have created. They fail to come to terms with what they have done, but do come to terms with each other. Their mutual understanding is based on both being killers. In the end they have a deeper relationship than any other in the play. Pernak is only 22 and Killers is part of the 20th young writers' festival. Of course, the play has flaws. The attempted equation between the two killings is ambitious, perhaps pretentious and does not completely come off. David kills because it is his professional duty to do so: Jonathan kills merely in a fit of pique. Nevertheless, the excitement is sustained throughout. Direction is by Ian Rickson and there is an effectively unobtrusive set designed by Lucy Hall. Royal Court Theatre Upstairs (071) 730 1745  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "

DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NEW YORK      The Boeing 707 that crashed here Thursday night was a 23-year-old plane with  far fewer flight hours than other jets of its vintage.    The Avianca plane was the 592nd model to come off the 707 assembly line at  Boeing. It was delivered to Pan American World Airways on June 30, 1967, and  sold to Avianca on Feb. 25, 1977.    The doomed plane had flown 61,193 flight hours and landed 22,764 times. Most  707s of that vintage have averaged 80,000 flight hours.    Boeing said Friday that it did not know if the plane had recent problems. The  National Transportation Safety Board is expected to investigate that question,  and Boeing sent a safety investigator, a pilot and a fuel systems expert to  help the NTSB in its overall probe.    The Colombian radio network RCN reported that the plane had been plagued by  mechanical problems recently, having been sent to the maintenance shop 37 times  in the past four months. The radio did not say what the maintenance was for.    Known as a reliable and durable workhorse, the 707 is nevertheless no longer  flying passengers in this country with two notable exceptions: Air Force One,  the President's plane, and its backup are 707s.    The 707 fell into disuse in the United States largely because of noise  restrictions and the introduction of more fuel efficient and wider-bodied  aircraft. Many 707s still fly elsewhere.

DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NEW YORK      The Boeing 707 that crashed here Thursday night was a 23-year-old plane with  far fewer flight hours than other jets of its vintage.    The Avianca plane was the 592nd model to come off the 707 assembly line at  Boeing. It was delivered to Pan American World Airways on June 30, 1967, and  sold to Avianca on Feb. 25, 1977.    The doomed plane had flown 61,193 flight hours and landed 22,764 times. Most  707s of that vintage have averaged 80,000 flight hours.    Boeing said Friday that it did not know if the plane had recent problems. The  National Transportation Safety Board is expected to investigate that question,  and Boeing sent a safety investigator, a pilot and a fuel systems expert to  help the NTSB in its overall probe.    The Colombian radio network RCN reported that the plane had been plagued by  mechanical problems recently, having been sent to the maintenance shop 37 times  in the past four months. The radio did not say what the maintenance was for.    Known as a reliable and durable workhorse, the 707 is nevertheless no longer  flying passengers in this country with two notable exceptions: Air Force One,  the President's plane, and its backup are 707s.    The 707 fell into disuse in the United States largely because of noise  restrictions and the introduction of more fuel efficient and wider-bodied  aircraft. Many 707s still fly elsewhere.

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful [preceding phrase in Arabic]. The main problem is the  lack of mutual understanding, which has been available since the  very beginning of negotiations. But this problem needs time to  be solved. I mean, if we want to solve this problem we need  more time. If you take a look at the result of the talks that  they had in Moscow and also the preliminary statement that they  had in ceremonial session, you will see that may be there are  some progress. As I said in my interview, at the beginning they  were not ready to talk together. And both of them used to be  very angry against another one. Now the nature of their  presence is a positive step which has been taken by them. So we  can say that cautiously we are optimistic and we do hope that  after few days of talks they can reach some more positive  points. This is the national desire of the people of  Tajikistan. They want to put an end to these internal conflict  because they have lost many lives and they are facing, the  people of Tajikistan are facing a national disaster. They have  difficulties even for providing the raw material for their very  simple life. Lack of sanitation, lack of food, lack of  transportation, continuation of killing and slaughters and  assassination have made the people of Tajikistan frustrated.  People are very disappointed. That is the national desire that  now the time is ripe for a national reconciliation.    [Correspondent] It seems no specific plan for restoring  peace  in Tajikistan has been offered. Do you think a clear peace plan  will come under discussion in the current round of negotiations  in Tehran?    [Velayati] Of course, this is the task of the special envoy  of the secretary general of the United Nations. But as far as  we could understand of what he has said he has tried to make a  cease-fire at the beginning as a fist step; because the  establishment of the cease-fire will give opportunity to both  sides for continuation of talks and decreasing of tension; while  the continuation of assassination and killing and slaughters  will increase tension. And if tension is increased or is being  increased they cannot stop the hostility. So, the cease-fire is  the first step that should be established unconditionally,  without any precondition. That is what we could understand from  the special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations.     "

The state government ordered police to guard rest areas off main highways 24 hours a day and to patrol trunk roads. It also set up a free telephone number for tourist safety tips, and asked for Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) of emergency federal aid to pay for police surveillance around Miami. The police search for the killers of Mr Gary Colley, murdered outside Tallahassee in northern Florida, intensified yesterday. Police found the getaway car in Monticello, near Tallahassee. They believe the killers are still in the area and are rounding up teenagers who fit the description. Mr Colley was the ninth foreigner to be killed in the state in the past year, and his murder came less than a week after a German tourist was shot outside Miami airport. Mr Uwe-Wilhelm Rakebrand and his pregnant wife were driving their rented car when it was hit from behind. The tourists drove on, but assailants opened fire from their car, killing the 33-year-old German. Travellers arriving at Miami airport at night are advised to stay in hotels close by, and those who rent a car and take the road from the airport to Miami Beach are given detailed instructions on how to arrive safely. The Avis rental agency has large signs inside its cars advising drivers not to stop on the way from the airport under any circumstances, especially if bumped from behind. Mr Greg Farmer, state commerce secretary, said about 25 per cent of European package bookings were now being cancelled. 'There is no question that the European market will be affected,' said Mr Mayco Villafana, of the Miami Convention  Visitors Bureau. The Florida tourism industry is worth about Dollars 31bn a year, employs about 650,000 people - 12.4 per cent of the non-farm workforce  - and is the state's largest industry. About 40m tourists visit Florida every year, 17 per cent of them from abroad. Florida has the worst violent crime rates in the US, slightly ahead of New York, though crime rates have recently fallen. Dr John Crotts, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, says an out-of-state visitor has a 91 in a 100,000 chance of becoming a victim of crime - better odds than for Honolulu in the 1980s.

In Amman, the Jordanian branch of the Moslem Brotherhood  fundamentalist organisation urged the Arabs to ""pull out of the  peace negotiations"" with Israel.

Jordan has called for three days of national mourning  starting on Saturday for those killed in Hebron.    Leaders of Christian communities in Jordan, quoted by PETRA  NEWS AGENCY, also ""firmly condemned"" the killing and called for  UN protection for the Palestinians.    The leader of Egypt's Coptic Christians Patriarch Shanudah  III likewise condemned the killing and urged Christians to  consult the Moslems before making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to  show solidarity with the Palestinians.

But the streets of Mogadishu were quiet and UN officials appeared to indicate a low-key approach to Gen Aideed after the turmoil and killings of the past fortnight. With his military stronghold destroyed in the UN action, Gen Aideed was reported to be hiding with a group of his most loyal followers in a 'safe house' in the capital. UN military sources said they would move in and arrest him before long 'in a way that will minimise civilian casualties'. US Army Lt Col Kevin McGovern said that detaining Gen Aideed had not been a goal of the air and ground assaults aimed at crippling his capability to wage war against UN peacekeepers. 'If we got him, fine. If we didn't, fine,' Col McGovern said. 'We're not out to make him a martyr.' UN special envoy Admiral Jonathan Howe said Thursday's operation, which included a 12-hour ground assault, was 'totally successful' despite casualties on both sides. Five UN soldiers - four Moroccans and a Pakistani - were killed and 46 wounded. Hospitals said more than 60 Somali civilians were killed and more than 100 injured. At his White House press conference on Thursday night, President Clinton declared the military action over. It was to undermine Gen Aideed's ability to 'wreak military havoc' in Mogadishu and to show that the killing of 23 Pakistani UN troops on June 5 would not go unpunished. During Thursday's fighting, a missile fired by a US attack helicopter hit the compound of a French aid agency, International Action Against Famine, killing a Somali worker and wounding seven. Mr Gregoire Goodstein, the agency's logistical co-ordinator in Somalia, questioned the wisdom of the UN assault. 'I don't think it was necessary,' he said. 'I don't think they needed anything that big. It doesn't solve anything.' In an ambush yesterday a French television sound technician was killed by gunmen.

A moral Rubicon was crossed. A responsibility was  accepted, finally.    The Atlantic Council involves not just Europe. The  Alliance's three non-European members played a key role in the  tormented Brussels discussions: the United States and Turkey  for, Canada against. And undoubtedly because the principal  product of the decision was a new European firmness. By France  in particular. But also by Italy, the first to demand a  ""concrete reaction"" to the [Sarajevo] market massacre. The  others followed. The Russian threats, offered in Moscow, not  only by nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and by a Duma at the  mercy of every whim, but also by Boris Yeltsin in person, were  ignored. The vicious circle of reasoning, which always imagined  that military action would be followed by a worse reaction and  which ended up taking no action at all, has been broken.  Something has shifted: too late, perhaps, but for once, not  too little.    Of course, a 12-hour meeting is not enough to change Europe.  The idiosyncrasies, the tactics, and the hidden agendas remain.  National interests are guiding governments. Greece is no less  against any anti-Serb policy than before. Britain does not hope  less than before that nothing will be done. Nonetheless, the  NATO Council decided unanimously. And yesterday, whether out of  conviction or out of opportunism, everyone voted yes.    What will happen now? The Brussels communique is not the  last word. The final decision, the final go-ahead to order an  attack by the Alliance's fighter bombers, lies with  Butrus-Ghali. The ""Bosnian operation"" is in fact being carried  out under the UN blue banner, not under the 12-starred one of  the European Union, or under NATO's pink one. Yesterday's will  only be a typed piece of paper placed in full view on the  secretary general's desk on the 38th floor of UN Headquarters,  alongside the reports of the blue helmets' field commanders and  of ""special envoy"" Yasushi Akashi. After 10 days, they will  report whether the Serbs have effectively withdrawn their heavy  artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and whether the UN contingent  will or will not be overly exposed to any reprisals. The  inscrutable Butrus will get up from his desk, look out of his  window over the East River running at his feet, will weigh up  the pros and cons -- possibly more concerned with his own  political fortune than the fate of peace and war -- and will  pronounce his decision.    For this reason it is possible that yesterday's decision  will  remain a dead letter. Maybe, at the moment of decision in the  Atlantic Council's meeting chamber, more than one representative  calculated this way. To know how things will end up, one can  only wait and see. But whatever happens, yesterday's date marks  a point of no return. It will now be difficult for Sarajevo's  martyrdom to be relegated to the darkness of indifference,  cynicism, and abject inaction. One does not lose one's  credibility twice.    The 16 ambassadors who laboriously concluded the Atlantic  Council's communique, while acting under instructions from their  governments, had good reason to rejoice yesterday evening. Many  hours before the conclusion of the session, Serbian and Bosnian  military chiefs in Sarajevo had granted UN General Michael Rose  and the Bosnian army a cease-fire and intimated their readiness  to withdraw their heavy artillery. It is not the first time  such a pledge has been made, and there is no reason to believe  it will be kept this time any more than other times. But it is  a sign that firmness pays, and that the West's determination is  worrying Sarajevo's besiegers. In the words of French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe: ""If the Serbs withdraw, I would like to  twist their arm a little more.""     "

BUT SOCIETY'S LACK OF SUPPORT IS WHAT CAUSES THEIR DESPAIR.      By BILL BOLTE, Bolte is a Los Angeles writer who uses a wheelchair as a result  of polio when he was an infant.      The decision by Michigan prosecutors to file first-degree murder charges  against Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- the proud inventor of a machine that makes  suicide push-button easy -- revives a debate that we severely disabled people  both welcome and dread. Mos of us welcome the filing of charges, yet dread that  the trial will provide a platform for the hidden prejudices against disabled  people -- and end with a judicial imprimatur for killing us.    Kevorkian is not being tried for inventing the death machine, but for applying  it. He hooked up a middle-aged woman, Janet Adkins, who had become convinced  that she had Alzheimer's disease. Though she had consulted only one doctor  before asking Kevorkian to connect her to his invention, he agreed to do it  after spending part of an evening over dinner with her.    The killing machine is a copy of a machine used in some state execution  chambers, except that the victim pushes the button rather than a prison  official.    My dread concerning Kevorkian's trial is that both the prosecution and the  defense will agree on assumptions about the lives of disabled people, as seen  by people who have never had a severe disability. The undisabled too often  assume that people would rather die than have a life-altering disability.    Disabled people like me know that there is nothing natural about the desire to  die. We know, also, that two things drive us to death. One is fear of the  unknown. What will happen to me now that I am disabled? The other is not being  able to get the material and psychological support necessary to sustain our  lives. Who will feed me now that I can't feed myself? How can I bear being  dependent on others for things I used to do for myself? These are nearly the  same as the factors that drive the so-called able-bodied to attempt suicide.

BUT SOCIETY'S LACK OF SUPPORT IS WHAT CAUSES THEIR DESPAIR.      By BILL BOLTE, Bolte is a Los Angeles writer who uses a wheelchair as a result  of polio when he was an infant.      The decision by Michigan prosecutors to file first-degree murder charges  against Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- the proud inventor of a machine that makes  suicide push-button easy -- revives a debate that we severely disabled people  both welcome and dread. Mos of us welcome the filing of charges, yet dread that  the trial will provide a platform for the hidden prejudices against disabled  people -- and end with a judicial imprimatur for killing us.    Kevorkian is not being tried for inventing the death machine, but for applying  it. He hooked up a middle-aged woman, Janet Adkins, who had become convinced  that she had Alzheimer's disease. Though she had consulted only one doctor  before asking Kevorkian to connect her to his invention, he agreed to do it  after spending part of an evening over dinner with her.    The killing machine is a copy of a machine used in some state execution  chambers, except that the victim pushes the button rather than a prison  official.    My dread concerning Kevorkian's trial is that both the prosecution and the  defense will agree on assumptions about the lives of disabled people, as seen  by people who have never had a severe disability. The undisabled too often  assume that people would rather die than have a life-altering disability.    Disabled people like me know that there is nothing natural about the desire to  die. We know, also, that two things drive us to death. One is fear of the  unknown. What will happen to me now that I am disabled? The other is not being  able to get the material and psychological support necessary to sustain our  lives. Who will feed me now that I can't feed myself? How can I bear being  dependent on others for things I used to do for myself? These are nearly the  same as the factors that drive the so-called able-bodied to attempt suicide.

She was addressing a joint news conference along with  the visiting prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Haris  Silajdzic, in Karachi today. The prime minister in her  statement said:    [Begin Bhutto recording] [Words indistinct] we feel strongly  about Bosnia, not only because we are Muslims. We feel strongly  about Bosnia because we believe in freedom, we believe in human  rights, and we believe in the sanctity of life. The rape of  Bosnian women, the death of Bosnian men, the plight of Bosnian  orphanages [as heard] is not just the rape of Bosnia, of the  killings in Bosnia, of the plight of the children of Bosnia. It  is indeed the rape of the world's conscience, the killing of the  world's conscience, and it is a common plight of the world  itself. I would like to take advantage of the visit of the  prime minister of Bosnia to assure him that Pakistan stands  fully behind his government and it's efforts to end the killing  in Bosnia and the suffering of the people of Bosnia. We are  prepared to assist in every effort within Pakistan and without  at international forums to bring an end to what we call a stain  on the conscience of mankind.

Pakistan is a prominent supporter of our  cause in the United Nations, in the Organization of Islamic  Countries [as heard] and other international forums.

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful [preceding phrase in Arabic]. The main problem is the  lack of mutual understanding, which has been available since the  very beginning of negotiations. But this problem needs time to  be solved. I mean, if we want to solve this problem we need  more time. If you take a look at the result of the talks that  they had in Moscow and also the preliminary statement that they  had in ceremonial session, you will see that may be there are  some progress. As I said in my interview, at the beginning they  were not ready to talk together. And both of them used to be  very angry against another one. Now the nature of their  presence is a positive step which has been taken by them. So we  can say that cautiously we are optimistic and we do hope that  after few days of talks they can reach some more positive  points. This is the national desire of the people of  Tajikistan. They want to put an end to these internal conflict  because they have lost many lives and they are facing, the  people of Tajikistan are facing a national disaster. They have  difficulties even for providing the raw material for their very  simple life. Lack of sanitation, lack of food, lack of  transportation, continuation of killing and slaughters and  assassination have made the people of Tajikistan frustrated.  People are very disappointed. That is the national desire that  now the time is ripe for a national reconciliation.    [Correspondent] It seems no specific plan for restoring  peace  in Tajikistan has been offered. Do you think a clear peace plan  will come under discussion in the current round of negotiations  in Tehran?    [Velayati] Of course, this is the task of the special envoy  of the secretary general of the United Nations. But as far as  we could understand of what he has said he has tried to make a  cease-fire at the beginning as a fist step; because the  establishment of the cease-fire will give opportunity to both  sides for continuation of talks and decreasing of tension; while  the continuation of assassination and killing and slaughters  will increase tension. And if tension is increased or is being  increased they cannot stop the hostility. So, the cease-fire is  the first step that should be established unconditionally,  without any precondition. That's what we could understand from  the special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations.     "

0,FT933-10803 ,"FT933-10803 _AN-DHBCDAC9FT 930802   FT  02 AUG 93 / Breakthrough for a broken land / Assessing the peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina drawn up at the weekend      By LAURA SILBER   The United Nations at the weekend signalled a breakthrough in the search for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina when Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic grudgingly endorsed a broad framework for a settlement. The plan, unveiled by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, claims to preserve Bosnia's sovereignty as a union of three constituent republics. In reality, this plan amounts to Bosnia's partition along ethnic lines. Serbian and Croat leaders welcomed the constitutional agreement as the means to end the 16-month war which has killed tens of thousands of people and driven 2m from their homes. The agreement if it sticks - and even last night Mr Izetbegovic was threatening to pull out - sanctions a Serbian victory. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his main backer, have won their war. They have succeeded in destroying Bosnia and replacing it with a loose confederation of ethnic states. The war was about territory. First the Serbs, then the Croats and finally the Moslems tried to grab as much land as possible. Mr Izetbegovic finally succumbed to international and domestic pressure, abandoning his insistence on preserving a united, federal state. At the weekend he told Radio Sarajevo that the 'younger generations will be left to realise the dream of Bosnia'. Serb forces currently claim to control 72 per cent of Bosnia and the Croats about 19 per cent. They expanded their territory at the expense of the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group, which comprised 44 per cent of the pre-war 4.35m population. Mr Karadzic calls the war 'inevitable' because Serbs could not live under Moslem rule after 500 years under the Ottoman empire. He claims the war was the combustion of centuries of suppressed ethnic hatreds. But the jumble of mosques, Orthodox and Catholic churches - many of which are now in ruins - reflected the centuries of co-existence. 'If everyone really hated each other so much, why were (there) so many mosques left to destroy?' asks Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister. General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has masterminded the Serbs' path of destruction - burned villages, looted houses, and bombed-out factories. The Bosnian Serbs have tried to erase any vestige of Moslem heritage in Bosnia. Hundreds of mosques and graves have been systematically destroyed. When the war began in earnest, Serb fighters, then backed openly by the Yugoslav People's Army, expelled hundreds of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia. But their campaign passed nearly unnoticed as international outrage focused on the Serbian encirclement of Sarajevo. Few Moslems remain in eastern Bosnia, where they once comprised a majority. They are confined mostly to isolated government strongholds: Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa. These towns, three out of six 'safe areas' proclaimed by the United Nations, are at the mercy of their Serb besiegers. The war was waged mainly in towns where Moslems, according to the 1991 census, comprised the majority. Mr Milosevic and his proxies have nearly succeeded in achieving the ethnic division of Bosnia. This was unthinkable when the war began in April, 1992. Moslems, Serbs and Croats lived together in apartment blocks. In Sarajevo, the cosmopolitan capital, one-third of all marriages crossed ethnic lines. But the international community, under the stewardship of the peace envoys, has now sanctioned the creation of ethnic states by force. Even Mr Izetbegovic at the weekend publicly admitted he was now defending 'the Moslem nation'. Pushed into a corner, Mr Izetbegovic had little choice. The mediators first re-invented Bosnia's multi-ethnic 'presi dency' (the collective leadership elected in 1990), and then exploited already existing divisions within it. The 10-member body now remains split over the agreement. The three Serb representatives oppose any division of Bosnia, fearing the new Moslem state will have no place for ethnic minorities. Many fear that the future that awaits each mini-state of the new Bosnian union is one of ethnic dictatorship and violent racism - the opposite of the harmony promised by the peace envoys. The west, which so pompously adopted the principle of a multi-ethnic Bosnia at last August's London conference, has now unceremoniously abandoned it. The document adopted in London pledged to end the violence and reverse 'ethnic cleansing', reaffirming Bosnia as a sovereign independent state. Bosnian politicians, except for the three Croat members of the presidency, have criticised the new agreement. 'Europe is abandoning the struggle to stop the rise of fascism, be it from any ethnic group,' said Mr Selim Beslagic, the mayor of Tuzla, who is struggling to preserve his democratically elected multi-ethnic leadership. 'It rewards the aggressors and punishes the victims,' he adds. Lord Owen has been opposed to the republic's partition, saying it is not an ideal solution. While he has promised to fight on behalf of the Moslems to secure a viable state for them, he has so far failed to come up with the goods. Mr Milosevic hailed the agreement because it 'totally affirms Srpska republika', the self-styled Serb state. Mr Izetbegovic stressed that the agreement was 'preliminary', explaining that the fate of Geneva talks hinged on negotiations over the maps. The biggest challenge remains. In their relief at breaking the impasse, Serb and Croat leaders appeared to forget that all three sides in January also endorsed the constitutional principles of the Vance-Owen plan. If Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to salvage any pretence of negotiating a fair and stable settlement to the war, then they will have to ensure that the Moslems are granted, as promised, at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory in future negotiations over the details of a peace settlement. They must also ensure that the Moslems have guaranteed access through hostile territory to vital ports on the northern River Sava and the Adriatic. In the current phase of negotiations, which produced this weekend's plan, there have been some ludicrous offers, among them Mr Karadzic's suggestion to build a tunnel out of Sarajevo, besieged and heavily bombarded since the beginning of the war, for the 380,000 inhabitants to travel to other parts of their 'state'. The co-chairmen reportedly are upset that Mr Karadzic has so far refused to withdraw heavy artillery, and break the siege of Sarajevo. The Serbs have not offered to make any concessions. If the Moslems, are to have any chance of preserving a Bosnian state, then they must have control over the corridor leading to strategic ports and not be at the mercy of their Serb and Croat adversaries. The plan does not give control over the external borders of the entire new Bosnian union to the weak central government. It also leaves open the number of currencies to be circulated. The plan calls for demilitarisation of the Union, but it does not specify how this will be achieved. 'There are huge armies in Serbia and Croatia that are directly involved in the conflict,' says Mr Nijaz Durakovic, an opposition deputy who is part of the Bosnian delegation. The recognition of the collapse of a multi-ethnic Bosnia means the passage to ethnically-based states. Anti-nationalist Serb leaders are now asking where will they live.

It was the second bomb to be aimed at Lebanese Christians in the past two months. In December, a car bomb exploded outside the Phalange party headquarters, killing three and injuring more than 130. Witnesses said dozens of people were taking Communion when the 82mm mortar bombs exploded. They had been placed by the first row of pews. The priest, Father Antoine Sfeir, was seriously wounded in the blast. No group claimed to have carried out yesterday's attack and Beirut was rife with speculation over what the perpetrators' motive may have been. Many Lebanese linked the killing to the massacre at Hebron in the West Bank on Friday, when 43 Palestinians were gunned down by a Jewish settler while praying at a mosque. A former prime minister, Mr Salem Al Hoss, said: 'The link with the Hebron tragedy is suspect, yet inevitable. It is beyond me why anyone would respond this way.' However, Mr Michel Samaha, Lebanese minister of information, suggested that the bomb might have been an act of protest against Pope John Paul's proposed visit to Lebanon at the end of May. 'It could be aimed against the pope's visit, and we hope it was not carried out by those who were against this visit,' Mr Samaha said. He also pointed his finger at Israel, saying it was an attempt to divert international attention from the Hebron massacre. Several of Lebanon's Moslem fundamentalist groups have condemned the pope's plans to visit the Middle East, which will include stops in Lebanon and Israel. But a diplomat in Beirut said it was more likely that the bomb was the result of a dispute among the Lebanese Christians themselves. The pope, speaking in St. Peter's Square in Rome yesterday, denounced the bombing. Referring to Lebanon's 17-year civil war, between 1975 and 1992, he said: 'That country has already suffered too much.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the bombing as an 'outrage' and said the extremists who committed the act were promoting division and war. Meanwhile, in south Lebanon, clashes between the Israeli army and its south Lebanon army allies, and pro-Iranian and Palestinian resistance, erupted intermittently throughout the day. The SLA said it had killed four guerrillas. One SLA militia man was seriously wounded, and died in an Israeli hospital.   Countries:-  LBZ  Lebanon, Middle East.

The appeal called on them not to pick up any of these  items wherever they may be found. The following is the text of  the appeal:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The one  who betrays his country cannot appreciate others because he  lacks all feelings of citizenship in both heart and mind.  Likewise, the one who plots to fragment his country will not  hesitate to send all the sons of the country to the crematorium  of death and annihilation. Every criminal who commits such  crimes will not hesitate to perpetrate the ugliest of crimes  toward others, be they men, women, youths, elderly, or children.  Thus, the mania of crime and grudge led traitor agent 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, the initiator of war and killer of children and  women, to cherish the idea of killing children with trickery and  cheap games in a bid to distort the citizens' feelings toward  the future of the homeland. As for their present, unity has  triumphed to the point of no return. The immortal existence of  unity has been baptized for ever by the sacrifices of the brave  heroes of the Armed and Security Forces. Otherwise, what is the  meaning of criminal al-Bid's distribution of booby-trapped pens,  toys, and watches in Aden streets and suburbs so that children  can pick them up and get blown up under the claim that the one  who distributed them and dropped them from planes are the forces  of unity and legitimacy? They will then portray those  victimized children to the world public as victims of the  missiles which they falsely claim the forces of unity and  protection of legitimacy are using to shell the city suburbs.  It is easy to tell such lies and make such fabrications before  us and the world. They are cheap lies about an ugly crime of  killing children in such a vile and cowardly manner.    While revealing this bitter fact about the latest innovation  of the criminal secessionists, we appeal to fathers and mothers  and all citizens in the suburbs of the city of Aden--in  (Kiraytar), al-Mu'alla, al-Tawwahi, (Hawr Makthar), al-Shaykh  'Uthman, al-Qallu'ah, al-Burayqah, al-Mansurah, al-Sha'b city,  and other suburbs--to prevent children from picking up any pens,  watches, toys, or housewares from the streets in front of their  houses so that their lives will be saved and no distortions be  sustained.    As for the criminal secessionist butchers, they will sooner  or later receive their punishment. Our people will never be  deceived by all their criminal methods and vile, treacherous  actions. Tomorrow is close at hand for all to see.     "

Following the difficulties created by the Saudi Arabian  Government for the esteemed leader's mission office at Mecca  concerning the performance of the Disavowal of Polytheists  ceremony, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri wrote  a letter today to the leader of the Islamic revolution.    Referring to the provocations of Saudi security officials  and  military forces who, using war equipment and resorting to  provocative actions, prevented Iranian pilgrims from going to  the esteemed leader's mission office to perform the Disavowal of  Polytheists rites, he asked the esteemed leader to cancel the  ritual.    The texts of Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammadi-Reyshahri's letter  and  the esteemed leader's reply are as follows:    With greetings to the esteemed leader of the Islamic  revolution, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i. As you are aware,  this year, as in previous years, the committed and vigilant  pilgrims to the Holy House of God -- inspired by the guidances  of the late imam, the reviver of the Abrahamite pilgrimage, and  his competent successor and the continuer of his path -- are  once again ready to raise the sacred banner of the disavowal of  polytheism, blasphemy, and arrogance in the land of divine  inspiration. However, Saudi security officials and military  forces, using war equipment, in an irresponsible and provocative  act, have besieged the mission building since three days before  the ceremony, and by restricting the traffic of pilgrims are in  effect preventing the performance of the divine ceremony.    It is astonishing that right next to the House of  Monotheism,  Muslims cannot disavow polytheists and express their hatred and  disgust for the ringleaders of polytheism, headed by America and  usurper Israel.    The Saudi authorities must answer to the vigilant Muslims of  the world as to why the cry of disavowal of polytheists and the  call of Muslims to unity against enemies of Islam are so  unpalatable to them.    Under the present circumstances, guided by the instructions  of your eminence, to deprive the Saudi authorities of any excuse  to desecrate the Holy House of God, the Disavowal ceremony has  been cancelled.    I should point out, although military forces have prevented  the performance of the Disavowal rites, and have not let the cry  of disavowal of committed pilgrims to the House of God rise from  the center of monotheism and echo in the world, undoubtedly  their innocent silence, more than any cry, will shake the  fortresses of polytheists and the arrogant, and deliver the  message of the Islamic revolution to the people of the world.    I deem it necessary to thank and praise the dear pilgrim  brothers and sisters, especially the committed clergy, the war  disabled, freed POWs, and families of martyrs, who have  constantly demonstrated their competence and political maturity  to defend dear Islam and the Islamic revolution and to follow  the goals of the esteemed leader, for their dutifulness and  alertness.    May God make the Islamic revolution of Iran a prelude to the  global rule of Islam and continue casting your eminence's  auspicious shadow upon the world Muslims.    [signed] Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, representative of the  Supreme Jurisconsult and supervisor of pilgrims, 16 May    The text of the reply by His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i,  the esteemed leader of the Islamic revolution, to Mr Mohammadi-  Reyshahri's letter is as follows:    In his exalted name. With greetings to your excellency  Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri, may your  shadow continue. I received your message. Considering the  situation that you have reported, I endorse the cancelling of  the Disavowal of Polytheists ceremony.    May God cover your excellency and all pilgrims to the Holy  House of God, especially the dear Iranian pilgrims, with His  blessings and guidance and accept their pilgrimage.    Peace and God's mercy be upon you.    [signed] Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i.     "

Reformers fear the assassin in Mexico - The aftermath of the killing of another PRI leader      By DAMIAN FRASER   If Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's next president, had any doubts about the difficulties of reforming Mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt judicial and legal system, the assassination last week of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the party's number two official, will probably have removed them. Mr Ruiz Massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a federal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and Mr Abraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the Gulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas. The two allegedly hired the gunman, and other accomplices, according to testimony from one man who has confessed to his role in the killing. This alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedillo to reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes. According to testimony from the alleged accomplices to the assassination, the conspirators drew up a list of reform-minded politicians with plans to kill all of them. Since Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case. Mr Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, asked yesterday in a newspaper article entitled 'Who is next?' whether Mexico, like Colombia, was facing a period of sustained political violence orchestrated by drug barons. Other columnists have insinuated that more groups than currently revealed might be involved in Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder. Mr Munoz Rocha has promised to hand himself in if his safety is guaranteed, according to a statement by Mexico's Congress. Two newspapers reported yesterday that Mr Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put the responsibility on Mr Rubio Canales, who reportedly blames Mr Ruiz Massieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is currently serving. Mr Munoz Rocha said he participated in the assassination 'because I was angry that I had not been supported in my political aspirations'. The ruling party has denied that the crime reflects an internal battle between ideological factions in the PRI. Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the president of the party, declared on Monday that Mr Munoz Rocha 'never had intellectual interests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associated with making ideological pronouncements.' Mr Pichardo insisted that the reform of the PRI would go ahead. As if to underline this pledge, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the head of the PRI group in the Chamber of Deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replace Mr Ruiz Massieu as the party's secretary-general. Government officials have suggested the Gulf drug cartel may have deliberately involved Mr Munoz Rocha in the assassination to maximise the political impact of the crime. The motives of drug traffickers are uncertain. One view is they believed the assassination would weaken Mr Ruiz Massieu's brother, Mario, who is the deputy attorney general in charge of drug enforcement. If this was the motivation, the plan may have backfired. Mr Ruiz Massieu has taken charge of the investigation into his brother's death, and search for drug cartel members appears to have intensified. Another view is the cartel was seeking revenge. Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu recently had arrested Raul Valladares, top lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel and son-in-law of Mr Rubio Canales, the man in the Acapulco jail accused of jointly plotting the assassination.

Major crimes  that get a lot of attention force them to take action. But with  the passage of time, things go back to ""business as usual,"" as  exemplified by the gangs of drug traffickers who wallow in  bloodbaths in the Acari shantytown, the scene of a dispute over  drug markets.    Under the eyes of police who are in league with them, the  rival bands portray the two faces of the collusion-dependent  personality of organized crime: Parazao, the Red  Command's enforcer, accused on one occasion of having cut up a  10-year-old boy with a chain saw because he had been playing on  their turf, is the bad side, the one that encourages terrorism.  His archenemy, Jorge Luis, is worshipped as a god by the  community for maintaining an atmosphere of tranquility, as if he  were the good side. The shantytown is the stage where the gang  members cavort, always with violence.    These gangs prosper only because there is no police  presence.  Filling the vacuum, the drug traffic and the numbers game lords  take their positions, give orders, and revoke them, counting on  the complicity of the police. In last week's bloodbath, in which  12 people were killed after 30 traffickers arrived by truck and  vans, armed with machine guns and grenades--there is, as always,  a suspicion that the police were involved. Before the violence  broke out, three [police] vehicles had driven through the  favela, as if casing the area. Traffickers identify  police from the Drug Enforcement Division as being associates of  Parazao.    Thus accused of corruption and complicity, the Rio de  Janeiro  police are once again the focus of attention, in a privileged  position alongside the traffickers in their fury. That is where  one finds the examples of insubordination, corruption, abuse of  power, violence, and promiscuous collusion with organized crime.  The police complain about low wages--a pretext for  under-the-table actions. But money is not their only problem.  The cancer originates in poor training, of both civil and  military police. Society itself, at the mercy of organized crime  and corrupt policemen, has contributed to the spread of the  outrages.    When the three police forces--federal, civil, and  military--work together under pressure from public opinion, we  get some results. But normally they are rivals, very often  pursuing the same booty. The drug traffic should long ago have  been made the number one priority of the police because of its  toxic effects, the violence, its tremendous power to fragment a  society. What characterizes the Brazilian police is precisely  its failure to set priorities: its activities dissolve into  indecision, into lack of purpose. The result is a disproportion  that is less and less perceived, between the ability of the  police to curb delinquency and the increase in the security  crisis.    The Acari favela is a typical example: the police  know the gangs are there, know who the leaders are, know their  hideouts, and know what territories they are fighting over. But  the police cannot manage to get organized--or do not want to  organize--to combat them. The dispute has become so acrimonious  that it has been suggested that the army intervene to battle the  traffic in the shantytowns. Political considerations have killed  that initiative.    After the massacre, the police visited the favela.  Strategically, organized crime waited for them to leave before  going back into action. It is a vicious circle. It has come to  the point where violence not associated with any spiritual  principle has degenerated into a gratuitous force, into satanic  frolic, into violence for violence's sake, and it will  ultimately destroy everything around it. Meanwhile, the police  are still standing by, arms folded.     "

May God make your evening a  good one. I would like first of all to thank you for providing  a second chance to meet in Misratah. I am very grateful to you  for your invitation, which I received when I was in Sirte the  other day. [passage omitted]    We are now in a new confrontation. Confrontations are the  same, but the means and weapons may vary. Today, as we were in  the recent past, we are confronting the same enemy. We have the  same people, the same nation, and the same religion confronting  the same enemies, which are the West, Christianity, imperialism,  colonialism, whether it was in 1912, 1911, 1915, or now. We are  in a new confrontation. It is beneficial to browse through our  history and pause before the sacrifices made by our forefathers  and our families. [passage omitted].    Brothers, it is very important to stop before these lessons,  the lessons of our past history and the heroism of our  forefathers and their sacrifices, because they represent our  provision to face up to the new confrontation. It is very  important. Important in the Libyan information approach,  important in the Libyan educational curriculum and important  even in family discourse and the club chatter and everywhere we  are. [passage omitted]    Until now [al-Qadhdhafi pauses, interrupted by crowd  chanting] ...look at the Americans and the West. Their  calculations now are based on that the Libyan people have been  spoiled and their demands have increased; luxury goods have  become necessities. The Libyans have become accustomed to  things they did not know before. They have become used to  canned food and fashion and European and Western things. Now  when oil exports become less and imported things decrease, the  Libyans will comply with our [the West] orders and accept the  new world order, what they term as international legitimacy,  which is the legitimacy of force: the West is strong and the  others should comply. This is impossible. [passage omitted]    Before the battle, the enemy carries out preliminary actions  to weaken his adversary. When there are two armies fighting  against each other and two countries fighting against each  other, before the firing of machine-guns and the use of aircraft  (?which may be easy for the braves) begin the battle, there is  another action which is the dangerous action -- an action that  paves the way for victory in the military battle. It is a  psychological, propagandist, economic and political action.  This is a dangerous action, because you have to gain spies from  the enemy; you have to recruit them. You have to infiltrate the  enemy's front. You have to weaken the morale of the enemy. You  have to run bad propaganda which the enemy may believe; your  agents have to spread that. This is very dangerous. You have  to be aware that you are facing this weapon.    Now we are not facing aircraft or missiles, etc. This may be  easy; it could possibly be easy. No matter how many missiles  may be launched, an aircraft carrier cannot enter our desert; it  will stop when the water ends. Missiles constitute a terrorist  action which has never forced a people to leave their land; it  never put an end to a nation. The important thing is that we  should understand this. I know that your morale is high, and  that you are ready; this is great. But the important thing is  that we should understand at this meeting some of the important  things.    You are not facing aircraft carriers, or missiles, or guns.  What I want to say is that a battle could be better. A  military battle must come to an end; it does not last long.  They cannot land on our territory. No matter how long the  battle may go on, we have the fate of our land in our hands. In  the end we will evict them. But the battle which is being  fought now and the weapon which you are now facing -- the weapon  which the enemy has begun to use -- is neither the machine gun  nor the rifle. It is silent weapon. It is a weapon which  targets morale. I will tell you what these weapons are.  [2-minute break in audio reception].    Heresy is another weapon, like recruitment and treason. Now  we hear about the Takfir and Hijrah group, the Da'wah, the  Jihad, and al-Fatah -- and so on and on. Everything invented in  religion is heresy, and every heresy is a deceit, and those who  adopt deceit will rest in hell. [passage omitted] This is a  dangerous weapon; this is a dangerous stratagem to destroy the  Arabs and Islam -- these Islamic parties.    The plan was hatched in India, Afghanistan, and Iran. They  taught people and recruited them and established schools. They  called one Da'wah, another was called The Jihad, another they  called The Takfir and the Hijrah, another they called The  Tahrir, The Brothers, etc. They told them to enter the Arab  countries and cause the Muslims to blaspheme and fight each  other. [passage omitted]    Heresy is a weapon useful to America, the Israelis and  Europe. They are all hoping that the Arab nation will be  fragmented and that the Arabs will fight each other using heresy  -- Muslim brothers, the Atonement and Flight, the Islamic Call  and the Muslim Vanguards -- exactly as you have been witnessing  in Egypt and Algeria.    Some three thousand have died in Algeria. Every day  somebody dies exactly like it used to be during the war of  liberation, when the Algerians were fighting the French. Even  the policeman who used to protect you in the street can no  longer do so. Someone might just come up to him screaming: There  is no God but Allah; God is great, before knifing him. How can  anyone say such and do such a thing to a soldier who is a  Muslim. But if you ask, however, why did he have to do it, he  will say this is what he was taught. And if you ask him who  taught you this? He will say: I was taught by a Muslim who  came from Sudan or from Jordan. But when they arrest the  teacher, who is from Sudan or from Jordan, and ask him how did  you learn this? He will say I was taught by an Afghan, an  Iranian, or an Indian Muslim. Therefore, this must be a  conspiracy and a foreign invasion.    Heresy is something hard to comprehend. You should, O  brothers, warn your children against it. And in this you must  not show any compassion, because it is a very serious matter  indeed if the number of those people gets bigger. They might  then arm themselves with knives, swords, and weapons and begin  to slaughter anyone who happens to be in their way.    One of them has killed his uncle, the brother of his father  who was taking care of him. They told him: In order to prove  that you are with us you must kill your uncle because he is an  unbeliever and a police officer. You must kill him to prove to  us that you are one of us. They gave him a hunting rifle; he  waited in darkness for his uncle and shot him dead. Is this  Islam? No, this would be madness if everyone has to kill his  father, brother, and neighbor. But such a thing is taking place  in Egypt and Algeria every day. People are killing their  brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbors and sons.    We must be vigilant to this Zandaqa [Islamic movements --  the  current fundamentalism]. This is a dangerous weapon. The  Americans said that the Arabs would be fragmented from inside.  [passage omitted] They have tried it, and in Algeria people are  killing one another, and in Egypt people are killing one  another, while the West and the Jews laugh at this Islam, this  kind of Islam that has succeeded in dividing people. They have  succeeded in mobilizing an Islam and are using it to fragment  the Arab nation and destroy the real Islam. You must be aware  of this. You must be conscious of this conspiracy.    This is yet another weapon. When they recruit somebody to  the  Zandaqah movement, they have recruited a spy. What is amazing  is that they do not come to you and say: We want you to  fragment the Arab nation, to be against pan-Arabism, to fragment  Islam. They do not say to you: We are recruiting you;  Afghanistan is behind the Zandaqah movement, and America and  Israel are also behind it. No. They come to you and use Islam,  in the mosque and say: There is no God but God and Muhammad is  his prophet. They say to you: This is wrong, little by little,  until they bring you under their control and make you capable of  killing your own uncle.    Thus the battle now begins at home as I have already said.  You must be vigilant, starting at home. Everyone must watch  his children. Their teacher could be a Zindiq [an Islamic  fundamentalist] who has come from abroad; a doctor, if he has  come from abroad. You know he has treated your child, your  neighbor, your kinfolk. Perhaps while treating them he gave them  information little by little. Search and examine any books  brought home by your child or somebody else, see whether they  are very old books on Zandaqah or not. [passage omitted].    When faced with a Zindiq, have no pity or mercy toward him.  He must be finished, really. The Zandaqah is an extremely  serious sickness, and he who carries this disease must be  finished. For he who likes Islam, Islam is clear: Read the  Koran, give us a lesson from the Koran, a lesson in religion, in  morals; lead us in prayers, call for prayers, teach us and you  are welcome. But if you set up a party among us, in secret, and  you say: Kill each other, and others are infidels, then never.  [passage omitted]    From now on, everyone must be vigilant to their families,  their children. Islam is clear. If somebody wants to observe  religious rules, he is free to do so. But the movements I have  mentioned to you, they have knives, guns, pistols, bombs and  America is behind them. All the leaders of the Zandaqah  movement are to be found in Germany, America, Britain, and  France. All the movements you are hearing about in Egypt,  Algeria, Syria, and Tunisia, and those who were members of the  Libyan Islamic Brotherhood movement, you have seen them, they  are all in America, Britain, France, and Germany. Western  intelligence is funding them.    What kind of Islam is an Islam funded by Christianity, the  Christians, and the West? Is this Islam? Is this reasonable  Islam, funded by the West, funded and encouraged by their  intelligence services? Is this Islam? We do not want an Islam  whose paymaster is America. We do not want this sort of Islam.    Another weapon is drugs. Orders were given by America and  the Western states to the Israelis to plant hashish in occupied  Palestine, export it secretly to the Arab countries, dump it on  the shores of the Arab countries from Egypt to Morocco in return  for billions of dollars paid by America and the Western states  as a compensation to the Israelis for planting hashish. America  is however fighting hashish everywhere in the world, and is  prepared to go to war against any state planting hashish, except  the Israelis. Why? Because the hashish in occupied Palestine is  meant for the Arab youths, for the Arab countries, to lull the  Arab nation. You must be vigilant to this. Brothers, this is  not a matter for the law or the police. It is a matter for the  family, a matter of education. You are all shepherds and every  shepherd is responsible for his community. Every one must look  after his children and family. [passage omitted]    As I have said, if tomorrow something wrong appears in  Misratah, it will affect the morale of us all, it will affect  the morale of Libya and the Arab nation. They will say here is  an important city, a Mujahid city upon which we rely that has  come out in angry demonstrations about the sewage, for example,  or angry about housing or angry about petrol, or heresy appeared  in it. You must be conscious of these things. I have spoken to  the people in Tripoli, al-Zawiyah, Misratah, Benghazi and  Darnah. There are some cities that should be jealous about the  reputation of Libya. Be aware and do not let the enemy gloat  over our misfortune. Persevere. If the electricity supply is  interrupted for a time or public utilities or transportation are  disrupted in a city such as Misratah, you must persevere and do  not complain, because this will be very important to Libya's  reputation before the West. [passage omitted]    People in places and cities other than those I have  mentioned  can be cross. If something is in shortage, they have the right  to be cross. However, we in the cities I have mentioned have  obligations to avert the enemy's gloating over our misfortune  and because of our past history and our reputation we have to  endure. However, first of all nothing wrong will happen, God  willing. I am telling you this only to remind you. May nothing  wrong happen at all and may everything move forward and  progress. However, these are probabilities. When something  happens in Misratah, we should not be cross.    All the things I have mentioned come and go. Take poverty,  rain, money, houses, pavements, streets, homes and animals, they  all come and go. These are things that can be good at times and  bad at another. We must not let our future rely on them nor  distort our history. [passage omitted]    Brothers, you should be aware of these issues. This is the  confrontation: high morale, mobilization, anger and popular  revolution. These should be translated into a material action  on Libyan land which proves the will of confrontation and  convinces the enemy that these people are determined to live and  to live free. This is what will make them retreat. This is what  made the enemies retreat. But if we only talk and then put our  hand to them and beg them for a dollar, or trade in currencies,  or smuggle medicine, smuggle food products, smuggle Libyan  products, trade in the Libyan dinar, ask them to give us their  canned foods, or ask them to give us their cigarettes or their  drugs, they will laugh at us. They will say: These people only  talk, but in the end they put out their hands to us and beg. We  should reject this. [passage omitted]    The last subject is concerned with the family of Ja'akah.  First of all, you are aware that there is someone with the name  of Ja'akah; however, I do not know his first name. We heard the  Americans say that they would give 1 million American dollars,  300 Libyan dinars [as heard], to anyone who would give them  information about who brought down the Pan Am plane over  Lockerbie.    Ja'akah used to work in Malta; he went over to the Americans  and told them give me the 1 million dollars, I have information  for you. They told him: All right, just give us the  information. They kept him as a prisoner at the American  intelligence; they did not, of course, give him the $1 million  or anything else. He is still under arrest at the American  intelligence. They asked him: What information have you got?  He told them: That plane was brought down by such and such  person who used such and such thing. He concocted a story; the  story they are now repeating. They are saying that they have  confirmed information, but they have only Ja'akah as a witness.    If they have a trial abroad, they will bring him to face  [the  accused] to whom he will say: Yes, you did bring it down; you  put the case aboard and this and that. You did so because you  wanted revenge. The Libyans wanted to avenge the raid of 1986;  they wanted to take their revenge on Britain and America who  killed their children. He will say now they have killed your  children with such a bombing. They wanted to hit two birds with  one stone; they dealt a blow to America and Britain at the same  by bombing one plane which they brought down over Lockerbie, a  British town, he will add.    He said the Libyans did so to avenge the raid. The Americans  and the British have believed his story; they are trying to  convince the world with such a story by using Ja'akah. Ja'akah  is now with the American intelligence; he will lose his life...  [pauses] his liberty forever. He will always remain under their  control; they will never release him.    We started to ask who was Ja'akah? We were told Ja'akah was  someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah, and suddenly everybody started  crying this is very bad news for Suk al-Jumu'ah. Why is the  latter involved in such a scandal? Why did that someone from  Suk al-Jumu'ah put Libya in the mouth of a cannon? Why did that  someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah create such problems for Libya? Was  he a spy?    As soon as Suk al-Jumu'ah heard such a news they were angry.  They said: We must destroy whoever tries to embarrass us; this  one is a spy and we must set fire to his house and farm; we must  destroy the houses of his family. They had a meeting, then I  went to see them in Saradiq. I told them, O brothers, before  you start destroying and setting fire to things, let us hear  their story. Let them come and explain. So they came and said:  We are the family of Ja'akah. We asked them does this one  belong to you? They said yes, he is our son. His father came  and made a speech which you have all heard. He said that anyone  could take his [son's] life; anyone could kill him and that he  will kill him, if he finds him. He added: We, his family, his  father and close family, will kill him if we find him, because  he is an agent who has harmed us.    However, his uncle read to us a report that Ja'akah was in  an institution for mental illnesses. His testimony will,  therefore, not be valid in a court of law. Had he been a sane  person, he would not have been a spy against his country nor  would he have harmed it like this for $1 million. He must be  insane. That is how his uncle construed it.    I remember that people went after them and tried to take  them  apart. Had it not been for the guards, they would have been  killed. We told the people: Please do not touch them; they have  washed their hands of him. However, they told me that this  family was not from Suk al-Jumu'ah; it came from Zawiyah  al-Mahjub. Once the people at Zawiyah al-Mahjub heard the story  they said: If there is any treason in Zawiyah al-Mahjub, we  will have to do what Suk al- Jumu'ah would have done. We must  find this family in order to destroy it and burn it. And you  were told about the feelings of the people over there some time  ago by that Haj [someone in the tent].    Now, as soon as they heard the story, they went over to Suk  al-Jumu'ah and contacted the family of Ja'akah who told them  that there was no relation with between them. They told them  that the spy came from, in fact, the Ja'akah family in Suk  al-Jumu'ah. The Ja'akah here has nothing to do with that  Ja'akah. The only thing they shared was the name. Ja'akah was  a first name here and not a family name like in Zawiyah  al-Mahjub.    That is it, things are now clear. The day before yesterday  the population of Gmatah sent an emissary to me and said: We  heard that the people of Zawiyat al-Mahjub said that this  Ja'akah family is from Gmatah, but the family in Zawiyat  al-Mahjub has the surname of al-Jurushi. Al-Ja'akah is a name,  but the surname is al-Jurushi. Now the al-Jurshi family has had  martyrs and mujahidin. And indeed as the emissary showed us,  this family is a family of mujahidin and martyrs, and surely it  would not do anything wrong.    Now the population of Gmatah is angry and they said: If we  find that the family of this spy Ja'akah is in Gmatah we will  burn and destroy it. Naturally, this is in one way disturbing,  but this is also very useful. The Libyan people have now laid  down a rule, neither a written law nor a decision, all the  Libyan people have laid down a rule which says: Treason will be  hunted down, besieged and destroyed. They have reached the  point where they might have to burn families to death, destroy  homes. This is a frightening matter which we may be able to  prohibit, but in fact no one can prevent it. They said to me:  Even if you install guards around a treasonous family, we will  consider the guards as traitor themselves and we will burn them.  If thousands of people storm a house, who can stop them.  Neither Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, nor police nor anyone can do so.  If people attack treason, by God I will not be able to touch  them, even if they burn down a house or burn a family to death.  Now, thanks be to God, treason is indeed besieged.

City police and the City corporation favour making the traffic restrictions a permanent feature in the belief that they have improved safety, cut serious crime and brought environmental benefits. However, senior ministers are believed to be opposed to using the traffic control scheme to combat terrorism on the grounds that it has been a propaganda coup for the IRA. City of London police commissioner Owen Kelly said yesterday that the traffic control scheme had been 'a key element in keeping the terrorists off balance'. He told a City seminar on security that the cordon had contributed to an 18.2 per cent drop in serious crime, mainly burglaries, in the City this year and helped to improve safety in the wake of the car bomb attacks. But he added that the cordon had not been universally popular and some members of the government were thought to be against it. He had the authority to run the scheme for six months and could renew it for a further six months but 'after that it is up to the government'. However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who also addressed the seminar, declined to say whether he would support the continuation of the scheme. He said it would be up to the transport secretary 'to adjudicate at the time'. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee of the City of London Corporation said his understanding was that opposition came from the Department of Transport. 'It has improved security but it has also had good environmental benefits,' Mr Cassidy said. Metropolitan Police commissioner Paul Condon told the seminar, which was organised by London First, a private sector pressure group of leading bankers and insurers, that there was a need for greater vigilance, more use of closed circuit television and a change in the law to allow more random searches of individuals and vehicles. The cordon was set up three months ago after a bomb exploded in Bishopsgate near the NatWest tower and Hongkong and Shanghai bank in April killing one person and injuring more than 40. In April last year a bomb exploded at St Mary Axe killing three people and injuring up to 90. Editorial Comment, Page 19   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In Cuito, capital of  Bie Province, UNITA troops yesterday resumed attacks on  government forces to conquer the city in order to influence the  talks tomorrow in the Zambian capital.    Reports from Cuito say that UNITA has once again used  everything at its disposal to take over the city. To achieve  its aims it is indifferent to the fact that its actions cause  more innocent victims. Dozens of bodies are already spread out  on the roads of the martyred and destroyed city of Cuito. Our  correspondent Abel Abreu reports from the area:    [Begin Abreu recording] A total of 48 people were killed and  62 others wounded, mostly children, the elderly, and women in a  number of houses which became [word indistinct] is the  preliminary figure of the shellings by UNITA since yesterday in  the martyred city of Cuito. Cuito is once again dressed in  black. The capital city of the province [word indistinct] is  characterized by blood, powder, and mourning. The number of  shells launched by UNITA against the afflicted Cuito residents  is estimated at more than 4,000. The smile, which was beginning  to show on the lips of thousands of people who survived the  recent nine-month war, was abruptly extinguished yesterday with  the renewed sound of 120, (B30, 106), B12 cannons [words  indistinct], and 60-mm and 81-mm mortars from UNITA.    The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA], the National Police, and the  civilian defense caused considerable losses to the enemy,  killing 47 UNITA bandits and capturing assorted war materiel.  The great victory scored by the government forces is not  limited to the killing of UNITA soldiers and the capture of war  materiel. The FAA, the National Police, and the civilian  defense went further and were able to take over more than 85  percent of the city. They also occupied some outlying wards --  namely, Camacuto, Pinguita, Guija, and Gabreio, areas which  until yesterday were under UNITA control.    In an exclusive interview with our reporters, [name  indistinct] 2d commander of FAA in Bie, said his troops are more  than ever prepared to teach the enemy a lesson and finish them  off. He said, quote, the story of Huambo, Uige, and Soyo will  not be repeated here in Cuito.

0,FT934-5936 ,"FT934-5936 _AN-DK1ACAAQFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / Israelis kill another Hamas leader      By DAVID HOROVITZ      JERUSALEM   Less than 48 hours after killing the military commander of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist group in Gaza, Israeli forces yesterday shot dead another leading Hamas militant. News of the death of Khaled Zer was suppressed yesterday by the Israeli military censor, presumably in an effort to avoid further infuriating Palestinians angered by Wednesday's killing of Imad Akel, commander of the Izzedine al-Qassem military wing of Hamas, of which Zer was also a member. Jerusalem police sent reinforcements to the Temple Mount yesterday morning, where 20,000 Palestinians gathered for Friday prayers, and extra troops were deployed, too, in the Gaza Strip. Although there were reports of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops, the violence was tame by comparison with Thursday's disturbances, in which one man was killed, another critically wounded and more than 30 others hurt. Israeli officials said Zer had been shot dead after seeking to escape his Israeli pursuers early yesterday in the village of Surbaher outside Jerusalem. They said a rifle was found by his body. Military sources said he had been involved in the murders of two Israeli soldiers and a civilian. The Israeli army also released news last night that troops shot and killed another Palestinian militant, Salim Sabah, several days ago. Sabah is alleged to have killed a Jewish settler in the West Bank earlier this month. This spate of killings of 'wanted' Palestinian militants underlines the determination of the Israelis to track down the most extreme opponents of the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord, in advance of its scheduled implementation on December 13. But the intensified Israeli military activity is causing growing hostility to the accord among Palestinians, while Hamas leaders, far from being deterred, are vowing to avenge the deaths by kidnapping and murdering Israeli soldiers in the coming days. Against the backdrop of escalating hostility, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a television interview that he did not regard December 13 - the date agreed by Israel and the PLO for the start of Israel's troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho - as 'sacred'.

0,FT942-5430 ,"FT942-5430 _AN-EFEASACVFT 940604   FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close strongly in higher trading volume - Market Report      By TERRY BYLAND, UK stock market editor   A turbulent trading session yesterday saw UK equities extend the recovery of the previous day but only after moving through successive ranges totalling more than 50 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. The driving force came from the gilt-edged market where long-dated British government bonds ended with gains of around 1 1/2 points, also after a volatile performance as Frankfurt returned from Thursday's holiday closure. By the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 17 points ahead at 2,997.8. After an uncertain start, the Footsie showed a gain of 23.6 at mid-session, standing at 3,004.4. This successful recapture of the 3,000 mark came just as a leading Swiss investment house cut its Footsie year-end forecast from 3,500 to 3,000, according to market traders; if so, the timing was unfortunate, for the market quickly turned tail, running back to 2,968.4 to show a net fall of 12.2. The setback reflected an uncertain start to trading in New York where Federal bonds at first reacted sharply to a fall in May unemployment which appeared to threaten action from the Federal Reserve. But US bonds, and Wall Street, soon turned higher and the UK gilts followed suit. Firmness in sterling helped the mood in the UK markets. Further selective buying by the institutions was indicated yesterday by Seaq volume of 725.6m shares, nearly 18.5 per cent on Thursday's total. Traders said that the big funds have become more willing to buy equities at current levels, although they are still alarmed by the instability of the government bond market. It was clear that UK share prices remain at the mercy of developments in bond markets. After falling heavily earlier this week, the FT-SE 100 Index closed last night with a gain of 31.14 points over the four day market week. But the extended three week equity account which also closed last night has seen a fall of nearly 4 per cent in the Footsie as investors have reacted to fears that the downward cycle in European interest rates may be nearing its end, while the US authorities are under presure to raise rates again. With the UK seen as further into recovery than other European economies, the stock market's hopes for a base rate cut have vanished, to be replaced by fears that rates will be forced higher before the year-end. Next week brings a relatively light calendar of economic news on both sides of the Atlantic and some market strategists believe that this will offer UK share prices the opportunity to extend their recovery. Across the broader range of the market, recovery has been less significant. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained only 1 point to 3,557.3 yesterday, leaving a loss of 15 points on the week and around 4.4 per cent over the three week account. Yesterday's rally was somewhat uneven, with share gains more often reflecting bargain-hunting following losses earlier in the week than longer term investment views. Financial stocks, with fortunes closely linked to the performance of securities markets, advanced sharply. Strong gains in short-dated government bonds again suggested that recent selling has been overdone and that investors hope that the widely-predicted rise in UK interest rates will be postponed for as long as possible. Consumer stocks, which have been badly hurt in the market shakeout, attracted support. Food retailers, pharmaceuticals, and leisure stocks were all higher.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The jury found Radke guilty of murder in the death of 16-year-old Jeffrey  Rudiger, whose beaten body was found in a Scripps Ranch alley in January, 1988.    Immediately after the verdict, Judge J. Richard Haden sent Radke to San Diego  County Jail, revoking $200,000 bail. Radke could draw 25 years to life in  prison when he is sentenced Sept. 24.    The jury could not, however, reach a decision on a second count that alleged  that Radke used a deadly weapon in the killing. That meant at least some jurors  believed a second person may have hit Rudiger repeatedly with the weapon,  Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel G. Lamborn said.    Although the beginning of the case was delayed for months with legal  maneuvering over whether most of the evidence was legally obtained, prosecutors  first mentioned the possibility of an accomplice when the trial began late last  month. No other person has been implicated in the killing and the chances of  finding that second person are remote, Lamborn said.    Rudiger's family, however, expressed a measure of relief at the verdict.  Jeffrey Rudiger's sister, Kelly, who has served as the family's spokeswoman,  exclaimed, ""Yes!"" as the murder verdict was read, then sobbed.    Hurriedly walking out of the courtroom, however, Kelly Rudiger said she was not  yet satisfied. ""Not until sentencing,"" she said.    Radke appeared impassive as the jury's verdict was read and as he was led away  by marshals. His father said he believes his son is innocent.    ""I never will change my mind,"" Elmer Radke said. ""That's all I have to say.""    Defense lawyer Douglas C. Brown promised an appeal.    ""The jury apparently found that Mr. Radke did not wield the weapon in this  particular case, so I question how they could find him guilty of the murder,  especially a brutal murder like this, without a finding that he used the  weapon,"" Brown said.    Brown also said that though Radke appeared dispassionate, he was upset at the  verdict.    ""He was aware he could have been convicted,"" Brown said. ""Both of us are aware  there are a lot of battles left to be fought on this one. He hasn't given up  hope, is a better way to put it.""    Jurors were escorted out the back door of the courtroom and were not available  for interviews.    Jeffrey Rudiger, a junior at Mira Mesa High School, disappeared after work on  the night of Jan. 21, 1988. His body was found the next day near a Scripps  Ranch commercial center, dressed only in underwear and a T-shirt.    Rudiger was wearing handcuffs, had been bludgeoned on the head with a blunt  object and had cuts on his body. Brown said at the trial that it appeared  Rudiger was hit 26 times with a tire iron or similar object.    Radke, now 24, was arrested after Rudiger's friends told police that he and  Radke were working together on a secret project. Radke and Rudiger both worked  at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Scripps Ranch, near where Rudiger's body was  found.    Before the case made it to trial, it generated three separate appeals over  whether police had acted properly in detaining Radke for questioning after a  traffic stop.    At one point, a state appellate court ruled that police were overzealous and  violated Radke's constitutional rights by placing him in handcuffs and by  drawing a revolver. That decision appeared to make virtually all evidence in  the case off limits to prosecutors.    But last September, San Diego Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes said officers  had probable cause -- or a ""strong suspicion"" -- to arrest Radke before they  ever saw him. A state appellate court upheld that decision in January, meaning  all the evidence that officers later found was obtained legally.    At the trial, Brown contended that police took footprints at the scene and,  when they compared the prints to Radke's sneakers, found they were not his  size.    Two bloody knives found at the scene have not been linked to Radke or anyone  else, and no fingerprints could be taken off them, he said.    But Lamborn said blood spots that matched Rudiger's blood type were found in  Radke's car trunk, in the wheel wells of his recently cleaned car and on his  jacket.    He also said that Rudiger's body had been dragged twice -- once a distance of  70 to 80 feet, and again about 13 feet. He also said it had been dragged by two  people.    Lamborn said blood spattering indicated one person held Rudiger's legs while  another held his head.    According to testimony, Rudiger told friends he had received wine coolers for  taking part in the first phase of the purported project. But in an interview  with police that was taped and played at the trial, Radke said he knew nothing  about a ""project"" or ""mission.""    Lamborn said after the verdict that a motive -- like so many other aspects of  the case -- remained uncertain.    Radke ""had a secret. I don't know what the secret is,"" Lamborn said.

He had used the  name ""Marc"" to sign a three-page suicide letter that police retrieved from his  pocket.    Canadian Broadcasting Corp., which reported that police had confirmed his  identity through his mother, said little was known about the gunman's  background. The broadcaster described him as being about 5-foot-9 inches tall  and weighing about 160 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.    In his letter, ""Marc"" said that he was going to have to die on Dec. 6, then  blamed his problems on ""feminists who had always ruined his life,"" according to  Jacques Duchesneau, head of the Montreal police organized crimes unit. The  letter, which has not yet been released in full, also included a list of women  in Montreal. Police declined to reveal their names or speculate on why they  were mentioned in the letter.    On Wednesday, the lone gunman walked into the Ecole Polytechnique of the  University of Montreal and went on what witnesses described as an anti-feminist  rampage. He fired shots into the ceiling and at students, then burst into a  classroom during an oral presentation and ordered the male students and teacher  out the door. One student said he heard the gunman say, ""I want women.""    According to survivors, the man then shouted an obscenity and called the women  ""feminists"" in French, and opened fire on them, killing six. He then left the  classroom and roamed the corridors, pausing to fire and reload as he went.  Eight women were fatally shot elsewhere in the building. One policeman arriving  at the scene discovered his own daughter among the dead.    As of Thursday, one of the injured was still in critical condition, and the  other 12 were said to be ""stable."" It was the worst mass killing ever in Canada  -- a country that tends to look upon senseless, violent crime as an American  phenomenon -- and the third worst in North America.    Duchesneau said the man's suicide note claimed he had ""political reasons"" for  committing the massacre but didn't explain what these were. The officer said  the letter further complained of a life of unhappiness, and especially the  unhappiness of the man's final seven years.

He had used the  name ""Marc"" to sign a three-page suicide letter that police retrieved from his  pocket.    Canadian Broadcasting Corp., which reported that police had confirmed his  identity through his mother, said little was known about the gunman's  background. The broadcaster described him as being about 5-foot-9 inches tall  and weighing about 160 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.    In his letter, ""Marc"" said that he was going to have to die on Dec. 6, then  blamed his problems on ""feminists who had always ruined his life,"" according to  Jacques Duchesneau, head of the Montreal police organized crimes unit. The  letter, which has not yet been released in full, also included a list of women  in Montreal. Police declined to reveal their names or speculate on why they  were mentioned in the letter.    On Wednesday, the lone gunman walked into the Ecole Polytechnique of the  University of Montreal and went on what witnesses described as an anti-feminist  rampage. He fired shots into the ceiling and at students, then burst into a  classroom during an oral presentation and ordered the male students and teacher  out the door. One student said he heard the gunman say, ""I want women.""    According to survivors, the man then shouted an obscenity and called the women  ""feminists"" in French, and opened fire on them, killing six. He then left the  classroom and roamed the corridors, pausing to fire and reload as he went.  Eight women were fatally shot elsewhere in the building. One policeman arriving  at the scene discovered his own daughter among the dead.    As of Thursday, one of the injured was still in critical condition, and the  other 12 were said to be ""stable."" It was the worst mass killing ever in Canada  -- a country that tends to look upon senseless, violent crime as an American  phenomenon -- and the third worst in North America.    Duchesneau said the man's suicide note claimed he had ""political reasons"" for  committing the massacre but didn't explain what these were. The officer said  the letter further complained of a life of unhappiness, and especially the  unhappiness of the man's final seven years. ""Marc"" also wrote that he had tried  to enter the armed forces and been rejected as ""anti-social,"" Duchesneau said.

Scientists fear the plague may prove as devastating as that  which wiped out most of England's elm trees 20 years ago and is  now killing the new elms that sprung from the root systems of  the old.    Fungi is believed to be attacking the alders' roots and  causing the branches to die back, but experts disagree over the  seriousness of the disease. The most alarming case is at the  National Grid Company's environmental education centre near  Canterbury, Kent, which includes a 20-acre nature reserve built  around a water filled former gravel quarry.    Tony Harman, the centre's manager, began noticing two years  ago that the tips of alder branches were dying, particularly at  the top of trees. ""Since then it has got a lot worse,"" he said.  ""We reckon we have now lost about 40 percent of our alders.""    Some of the trees, their roots weakened, toppled over into  the water and others have been turned into leafless skeletons.  Some had to be cut down because falling branches endangered  school children visiting the reserve.    Alders account for up to 30 percent of tree cover on  riverbanks. Georges Dusart, a senior lecturer in ecology at  Christ Church College in Canterbury, said: ""Alders not only look  attractive; they are also important for fish life by providing  river shade and food in the form of insects that fall from their  leaves.    ""I have been walking along riverbanks for 25 years and I  have  never seen so many alder deaths before.""    In an article in Farmers Weekly earlier this  summer, Dr. Dussart asked farmers with diseased alders to  telephone him. He soon received calls from all parts of England.    The Forestry Commission is more cautious about the extent of  the disease. David Rose, a tree pathologist at the commission's  Alice Holt research station near Farnham, Surrey, said: ""There  does appear to be a recurring fungal problem with alders. It is  locally serious, but there is nothing yet to indicate we are  facing a national epidemic on the scale of Dutch elm disease.""  The preliminary results of analysis of tree samples from the  Canterbury site suggest that the fungus attacking the roots of  the alders belongs to the phytophthora family, which  also cause potato blight, Mr. Rose said. The fungus may have  migrated northwards from sub-tropical climes.    Dutch elm disease destroyed 25 million elms, including 90  percent of those in southern England in the 1970's. The fungus  which attacked them was spread by bark beetles. The fungus is  still present in the roots of the destroyed trees and new elms  that have grown from the remains of the old are now mature  enough to sustain populations of the beetles which renew the  attack.

The man then turned the gun on himself and committed  suicide.    One Hebron doctor said 16 Palestinians were certified dead  in  a Hebron hospital and another two in a hospital in east  Jerusalem. More than 70 other were wounded.    The killer apparently disguised himself in an Israeli Army  uniform before opening up with an automatic rifle on the Moslem  faithful who turned out in large numbers for Friday prayers  during the fasting month of Ramadan.    The army imposed a curfew on Hebron and closed off the area  of the Tomb, which is holy to Jews and Moslems alike and crowded  every morning. Scuffles broke out in the complex on Thursday  evening as Israelis celebrated the start of Purim, a holiday  marking the deliverance of Jews from a massacre in Persia.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal condemned the slaughter.    ""I condemn in the strongest possible way these murders,  whatever the nationality of the person who committed them,"" he  said.    Palestinian militants declared a strike on the Gaza Strip in  memory of the dead and the Koran, the Moslem holy book, was read  out in the mosques, a correspondent reported.    It was the worst killing ever by Jewish settlers, who in  July  1983 shot dead four Palestinian students in Hebron. Border  police shot dead 20 Palestinians on Temple Mount in the Old City  of Jerusalem in October 1990.    The Tomb complex, which houses a mosque, fell under Israeli  control in the 1967 Middle East war and has since been shared by  the two religions.    Hebron has always been one of the tensest of Palestinian  towns where 500 Jews live among 70,000 Arabs. Another 5,000  Jews live in the adjacent settlement of Qiryat Arba'.    In Hebron, Palestinian protestors smashed an AFP  photographer's car with rocks.    Before Friday's killings, 1,180 Palestinians had died from  Israeli bullets since the intifadah or uprising began in  December 1987. Over the same period 203 Israelis have been  killed by Palestinians.    An anonymous telephone caller to AFP in Jerusalem claimed  responsibility for the killing in the name Jewish extremists.    The caller said the massacre was to avenge the December 6  shooting by Islamic fundamentalists of an Israeli settler and  his son, Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid, in Hebron.    The caller said he represented the ""Zealots of the God of  Israel"", an unknown group.    An AFP photographer reported that violent clashes erupted in  Hebron between Palestinians and soldiers who had opened fire.    At the city's Al-Ahli hospital dead bodies were still  arriving.    ""The dead and wounded are still being brought in,"" said  photographer Patrick Baz. ""A small child was just brought in  dead from bullet wounds. He was wrapped in a blood-stained  blanket.""     "

By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN DIEGO      With two jurors seeking a manslaughter conviction and 10 pressing for murder,  the trial of La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick, accused of  killing her ex-husband and his new wife, ended abruptly Tuesday with a hung  jury and no verdict.    San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan declared a mistrial when the  panel reported Tuesday afternoon, after four days of deliberations, that it  could not decide between murder and manslaughter. The deadlock means that the  case resulted -- like five other high-profile San Diego trials in recent years  -- in indecision.    Betty Broderick smiled briefly as the judge declared the mistrial.    In court, jurors did not disclose the details of the deadlock. But one juror  who asked not to be identified said Tuesday night that two of the people on the  panel were seeking a manslaughter conviction, while 10 others pressed for  murder.    The voting started off at 7 to 5 in favor of murder, said juror Michael A.  (Mickey) Byrd, 39, of Rancho Bernardo, an industrial project manager.    By Monday, the count had reached 10 to 2, he said, and the panel stuck there.  The sticking point, Byrd said, was over the issue of ""malice,"" or whether Betty  Broderick had the premeditated intent to kill.    By Tuesday, said Byrd, who supported a murder conviction, ""all agreed that we  had reached a point of no return, basically.""    The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, said she was ""very  disappointed"" and that Betty Broderick is likely to go to trial again in the  Nov. 5, 1989, killings of her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his  second wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick.    A new trial date is to be set next Tuesday. San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin  Miller said Tuesday night that he and Wells will decide in the next few days  whether to go forward with a second trial.    Betty Broderick's daughter, Kim Broderick, 20, a sophomore at the University of  Arizona who testified against her mother at the trial, said she was ""frustrated  and mad."" She added: ""I just wanted this to be behind us.""    Defense attorney Jack Earley said the hung jury was ""not a real surprise"" and  added that he plans now to ask that Betty Broderick be freed on bail. He also  said he is amenable to plea bargaining.    In the meantime, Earley said, ""This has been a vindication that Betty Broderick  is not what she has been pictured to be.""    Saying Betty Broderick had been successful at the trial in persuading at least  some jurors that she had been a victim, too, and contending that she was guilty  at most of manslaughter, Earley said it was ""obvious"" that jurors ""saw some of  the things she saw and felt some of the things she felt.""    Betty Broderick declined to comment, saying: ""I'm still in custody. I'm not  supposed to talk.""    Betty Broderick, 43, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the  shooting deaths of her ex-husband and his second wife. She has been held  without bail at the Las Colinas Jail in Santee since she surrendered to police  only hours after the killings.    Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and  a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Kolkena Broderick,  who was 28, was his office assistant.    After 16 years of marriage, Daniel and Betty Broderick separated. During and  after a bitter divorce, Betty Broderick accused him of using his legal  influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual income.    Betty Broderick admits firing the shots that killed her ex-husband and his  second wife.    Testifying in her own defense, she contended at the trial that she did not have  the premeditation the law requires for first-degree murder because she intended  only to confront him and to kill herself last Nov. 5, when she stole into his  house before dawn.    Prosecutor Wells contends that Betty Broderick fully intended the killings and  executed her ex-husband and his new wife after years of rising rage that  stemmed from the divorce.    Jurors had five options in the case -- first- and second-degree murder,  voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and not guilty on any charges.    First-degree murder means the murder was premeditated -- or considered  beforehand -- while second-degree lacks that deliberation.    Voluntary manslaughter means a killing was committed after a sudden  provocation. Involuntary manslaughter describes a killing that occurs while  doing something else without due caution.    After passing a note saying that the jury was ""unable to reach a unanimous  decision,"" foreman Lucinda L. Swann, 26, of San Diego, a county air pollution  inspector, told Whelan in court Tuesday that the panel could not decide whether  the case was about murder or manslaughter.    Whelan sent the panel back for more talks but, 29 minutes later, the jury  returned, saying that it was unable to break the deadlock and that further  talks were unlikely to help.    Swann said that the panel took ""three or four"" votes but, after conferring with  others on the jury, said the others ""seem to feel it was more than half a  dozen.""    Whelan then declared a mistrial, telling the panel it was ""a shame that you  can't have a final resolution, but that's the way things sometimes end up.""    In interviews later Tuesday, jurors declined to explain whether the 10 who  favored murder believed it was first- or second-degree. Similarly, jurors did  not say whether the two urging a lesser charge sought voluntary or involuntary  manslaughter.    Wells said the outcome was ""hugely frustrating.""    ""Well, obviously there were a lot of emotional issues in this case, a lot of  opinions going both ways,"" she said. ""Finding 12 people who were going to agree  was going to be difficult.""    Wells also said she did not know what she would do differently in a second  trial because she wanted to talk to jurors to find out what worked and what  didn't the first time around. She said she would rethink tactical decisions she  made, like not asking Betty Broderick on cross-examination about the act of the  killings.    ""Obviously I'll be open to thinking about lots of different things,"" she said.    Earley said a second trial would be burdensome.    With no income and limited assets, Betty Broderick might not be able to afford  a second trial, Earley said. Still, he said, ""I will be there. She wants me as  her attorney and I like her as a client.""    Tactically, he said, the difficulty for the defense the second time around is  that prosecutors know the strengths and weaknesses of the defense case. ""It's  just distressing to know you're at square one again,"" he said.    In recent years, five other high-profile San Diego criminal trials have  resulted in a hung jury on some or all charges -- among them the cases against  Roger Hedgecock, Sagon Penn, Craig Peyer and Richard T. Silberman. In the case  of Nancy Hoover Hunter, the jury was hung on the vast majority of charges.    Like their cases, Earley said, the frustration is in realizing that a lengthy  trial has not yet yielded closure in Betty Broderick's case.    ""It seems like it's been going on forever,"" he said.    Times staff writer Michael Granberry contributed to this story.

The voting started off at 7 to 5 in favor of murder, said juror Michael A.  (Mickey) Byrd, 39, of Rancho Bernardo, an industrial project manager.    By Monday, the count had reached 10 to 2, he said, and the panel stuck there.  The sticking point, Byrd said, was over the issue of ""malice,"" or whether Betty  Broderick had the premeditated intent to kill.    By Tuesday, said Byrd, who supported a murder conviction, ""all agreed that we  had reached a point of no return, basically.""    The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, said she was ""very  disappointed"" and that Betty Broderick is likely to go to trial again in the  Nov. 5, 1989, killings of her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his  second wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick.    A new trial date is to be set next Tuesday. San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin  Miller said Tuesday night that he and Wells will decide in the next few days  whether to go forward with a second trial.    Betty Broderick's daughter, Kim Broderick, 20, a sophomore at the University of  Arizona who testified against her mother at the trial, said she was ""frustrated  and mad."" She added: ""I just wanted this to be behind us.""    Defense attorney Jack Earley said the hung jury was ""not a real surprise"" and  added that he plans now to ask that Betty Broderick be freed on bail. He also  said he is amenable to plea bargaining.    In the meantime, Earley said, ""This has been a vindication that Betty Broderick  is not what she has been pictured to be.""    Saying Betty Broderick had been successful at the trial in persuading at least  some jurors that she had been a victim, too, and contending that she was guilty  at most of manslaughter, Earley said it was ""obvious"" that jurors ""saw some of  the things she saw and felt some of the things she felt.""    Betty Broderick declined to comment, saying: ""I'm still in custody. I'm not  supposed to talk.""    Betty Broderick, 43, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the  shooting deaths of her ex-husband and his second wife. She has been held  without bail at the Las Colinas Jail in Santee since she surrendered to police  only hours after the killings.    Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and  a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Kolkena Broderick,  who was 28, was his office assistant.    After 16 years of marriage, Daniel and Betty Broderick separated. During and  after a bitter divorce, Betty Broderick accused him of using his legal  influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual income.    Betty Broderick admits firing the shots that killed her ex-husband and his  second wife.    Testifying in her own defense, she contended at the trial that she did not have  the premeditation the law requires for first-degree murder because she intended  only to confront him and to kill herself last Nov. 5, when she stole into his  house before dawn.    Prosecutor Wells contends that Betty Broderick fully intended the killings and  executed her ex-husband and his new wife after years of rising rage that  stemmed from the divorce.    Jurors had five options in the case -- first- and second-degree murder,  voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and not guilty on any charges.    First-degree murder means the murder was premeditated -- or considered  beforehand -- while second-degree lacks that deliberation.    Voluntary manslaughter means a killing was committed after a sudden  provocation. Involuntary manslaughter describes a killing that occurs while  doing something else without due caution.    After passing a note saying that the jury was ""unable to reach a unanimous  decision,"" foreman Lucinda L. Swann, 26, of San Diego, a county air pollution  inspector, told Whelan in court Tuesday that the panel could not decide whether  the case was about murder or manslaughter.    Whelan sent the panel back for more talks but, 29 minutes later, the jury  returned, saying that it was unable to break the deadlock and that further  talks were unlikely to help.    Swann said that the panel took ""three or four"" votes but, after conferring with  others on the jury, said the others ""seem to feel it was more than half a  dozen.""    Whelan then declared a mistrial, telling the panel it was ""a shame that you  can't have a final resolution, but that's the way things sometimes end up.""    In interviews later Tuesday, jurors declined to explain whether the 10 who  favored murder believed it was first- or second-degree. Similarly, jurors did  not say whether the two urging a lesser charge sought voluntary or involuntary  manslaughter.    Wells said the outcome was ""hugely frustrating.""    ""Well, obviously there were a lot of emotional issues in this case, a lot of  opinions going both ways,"" she said. ""Finding 12 people who were going to agree  was going to be difficult.""    Wells also said she did not know what she would do differently in a second  trial because she wanted to talk to jurors to find out what worked and what  didn't the first time around. She said she would rethink tactical decisions she  made, like not asking Betty Broderick on cross-examination about the act of the  killings.    ""Obviously I'll be open to thinking about lots of different things,"" she said.    Earley said a second trial would be burdensome.    With no income and limited assets, Betty Broderick might not be able to afford  a second trial, Earley said. Still, he said, ""I will be there. She wants me as  her attorney and I like her as a client.""    Tactically, he said, the difficulty for the defense the second time around is  that prosecutors know the strengths and weaknesses of the defense case. ""It's  just distressing to know you're at square one again,"" he said.    In recent years, five other high-profile San Diego criminal trials have  resulted in a hung jury on some or all charges -- among them the cases against  Roger Hedgecock, Sagon Penn, Craig Peyer and Richard T. Silberman. In the case  of Nancy Hoover Hunter, the jury was hung on the vast majority of charges.    Like their cases, Earley said, the frustration is in realizing that a lengthy  trial has not yet yielded closure in Betty Broderick's case.    ""It seems like it's been going on forever,"" he said.    Times staff writer Michael Granberry contributed to this story.

0,FT942-1456 ,"FT942-1456 _AN-EFXC1ABMFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / French troops poised to enter Rwanda      By LESLIE CRAWFORD and DAVID BUCHAN      NAIROBI, PARIS   French troops flew into eastern Zaire yesterday in readiness for Operation Turquoise - the controversial military expedition to rescue civilians trapped in Rwanda's genocidal war. Transport aircraft landed the first soldiers of a 2,500-strong force at airfields in Bukavu and Goma on the shores of Lake Kivu. From there, the military intends to make short forays into western Rwanda, where thousands of persecuted Tutsis are herded in concentration camps guarded by Hutu militias. France won the UN Security Council's blessing for its mission of mercy despite international scepticism, a shortage of allies on the ground and the bitter opposition of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which believes France is intervening to deny them an outright victory in the civil war. Yesterday, however, the RPF seemed to be softening its opposition to French intervention. 'If the French stick to their humanitarian mandate, and do not interfere in our struggle, then we will have no quarrel with them,' Dr Emmanuel Ndahiro, the RPF's military spokesman, said from the capital, Kigali. 'But we still have misgivings about the French operation. We cannot exonerate them from the crimes committed by the Rwandan government.' The rebels distrust Paris because of its military and financial support for the government of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana until his death in an air crash on April 6. Having bolstered Rwanda's crumbling army with military advisers, weapons, armoured cars and helicopters, France is regarded as an accomplice to the slaughter of Tutsis and Hutu opponents of the Habyarimana regime which followed his death. France plans to lead quick missions into Rwanda to rescue endangered civilians, but has pledged not to make deep raids or to be drawn into fighting between government and rebel forces. The UN mandate authorises French troops to use force if attacked. In Paris Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, yesterday sought to downplay the military and political risks for France intervening almost alone in Rwanda, in the face of hostility from rebels controlling two-thirds of the country. 'Senegalese soldiers will be at our side and discussions are in train with Guinea-Bissau,' he told the French Senate yesterday. Senegal is apparently to send troops it had already agreed to contribute to the planned UN force due in Rwanda in late July, at which point France has said it will pull its troops out. Mr Juppe said he hoped European countries would give France the logistic support the US has already pledged. France will be pressing its European Union partners for backing when the Twelve start their summit in Corfu later today, Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said yesterday, adding that while 'there might be 10 good reasons for not intervening, the one essential reason for doing so is that a whole people is in the course of dying'. The French are setting up field hospitals on the Zaire border. But it is not clear whether they will just seek to evacuate refugees and wounded to the hospitals, or try to set up safe zones as they and other UN peacekeepers have sought to do in Bosnia. Although Operation Turquoise is meant to be a bridging operation until the UN can muster a multinational force, it has inadvertently undermined the work of the 400 UN military personnel who remained in Kigali after the majority of UN troops and all foreigners were evacuated in April. Thousands of Tutsis have also demonstrated against the French expedition in Bujumbura, the capital of neighbouring Burundi, which is bristling with the tensions of the Rwandan conflict. With anti-French sentiment rising in the RPF-controlled areas of the capital, the UN decided to relieve 42 French-speaking African soldiers from their duties. They were flown to Uganda on Wednesday.   Countries:-  RWZ  Rwanda, Africa.     FRZ  France, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0," FR940712-0-00019   FR940712-0-00007        Comments       NMFS received four sets of comments on the proposed harvest estimates and the proposed rule.       Comment:     One commenter opposed the proposed amendment to the existing fur seal regulations. The commenter stated that NMFS continues to allow the wasteful taking of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, and that the proposed rule change would place NMFS in the position of endorsing and authorizing wasteful take for an extended period. The commenter asserted that rather than addressing the wasteful seal killing that has persisted on those islands for years, NMFS, to the contrary, now proposes to institutionalize this improper conduct for 3 years without further question.   Another commenter voiced support for the regulatory amendment. The commenter reasoned that the take has been relatively stable and the upper and lower limits of the estimate range were wide enough to allow change, and, therefore, as the populations of animals and people vary, so can the target goals for future harvests.       Response:     Regulations on subsistence taking of northern fur seals have been devised to limit take to a level providing for legitimate subsistence needs of the Pribilof Natives while minimizing negative effects on the seal population. These regulations are intended, thus, as preventative measures against wasteful taking and improper conduct within each harvest season. (Wasteful taking is discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993.) The rationale behind the 3 year estimate of subsistence need versus an annual estimate was explained in the proposed estimates of subsistence need (59 FR 25024, May 13, 1994). NMFS has recognized the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence (57 FR 34081, August 3, 1992). As a first step towards addressing this need, NMFS proposed that 215.32(b) of the fur seal regulations be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. The regulatory amendment is based on the fact that the actual number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent, and the fur seal take has never exceeded the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest. NMFS anticipates that the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Island residents may increase during the next 3 years. However, based on historical evidence to date, the year-to-year subsistence needs are not expected to increase to levels exceeding the range established in this final estimate.       Comment:     One commenter supported the implementation of a cooperative management plan as a means of protecting the fur seal. The cooperative plan would expand governmental conservation efforts, and involve local people on the islands to a larger extent in fur seal management issues. The commenter requested that particular effort be made to establish a structure that will enable the residents of the Pribilof Islands to more actively participate in the monitoring and regulating of the harvest.       Response:     NMFS agrees with the commenter's suggestions. Section 119 of the recently reauthorized MMPA allows for NMFS to enter into cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations to conserve marine mammals and to provide for a co-management of subsistence use by Alaska Natives. NMFS intends to pursue the development of such a program that would further the goal of cooperative management and monitoring with the Alaskan native organizations.       Comment:     One commenter stated that the 1994 subsistence estimates are too high because they are based on historically wasteful seal killing practices carried over from the period of commercial harvest when only the choicest cuts of meat were taken for human consumption. The commenter continued by stating that through the adoption of these estimates, NMFS further institutionalizes waste and sanctions a level of seal killing known to reflect wasteful practices.       Response:     This comment is similar to the one presented and discussed in the final subsistence estimates for 1993 (58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993). In that final notice, a commenter maintained that the present harvest level did not reflect the true subsistence need on the Pribilof Islands. However, available information indicates that the present number of fur seals taken for subsistence on the Pribilof Islands is not higher than necessary to provide for subsistence needs. During one of the last periods when fur seals were taken solely for subsistence purposes on St. Paul Island, 191216, the number of fur seals taken each year (range 1,7643,483) was significantly higher than it is at present, even though the human population on St. Paul Island at that time was less than one-half of the present population. Therefore, the commenter has inaccurately assumed that practices carried over from the commercial harvest have resulted in a level of subsistence use greater than that used historically on the Pribilof Islands.       Comment:     A commenter stated that there is no basis for setting the lower end of the estimated subsistence range based on the greatest number of seals killed during any year over the past 6 years.       Response:     NMFS believes that the present range of fur seal subsistence estimates used on St. Paul and St. George Islands are justified. During the past 3 years the number of seals taken in the subsistence harvest has stabilized, ranging from 1,482 to 1,645 takes each year on St. Paul Island and from 194 to 319 each year on St. George Island. Generally, the lower limits of the estimate ranges for the islands have been approached during each of the past 3 years, but a difference of 1 or 2 actual days of harvest between years can result in the difference observed between the estimated number and actual number of seals taken within any one season. The apparent trend toward stability in the harvest totals on St. Paul and St. George Islands indicates to NMFS that the proposed estimates of annual need accurately reflect the actual subsistence requirements on the islands.          "," FR940712-0-00019   FR940712-0-00007        Comments       NMFS received four sets of comments on the proposed harvest estimates and the proposed rule.       Comment:     One commenter opposed the proposed amendment to the existing fur seal regulations. The commenter stated that NMFS continues to allow the wasteful taking of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, and that the proposed rule change would place NMFS in the position of endorsing and authorizing wasteful take for an extended period. The commenter asserted that rather than addressing the wasteful seal killing that has persisted on those islands for years, NMFS, to the contrary, now proposes to institutionalize this improper conduct for 3 years without further question.   Another commenter voiced support for the regulatory amendment. The commenter reasoned that the take has been relatively stable and the upper and lower limits of the estimate range were wide enough to allow change, and, therefore, as the populations of animals and people vary, so can the target goals for future harvests.       Response:     Regulations on subsistence taking of northern fur seals have been devised to limit take to a level providing for legitimate subsistence needs of the Pribilof Natives while minimizing negative effects on the seal population. These regulations are intended, thus, as preventative measures against wasteful taking and improper conduct within each harvest season. (Wasteful taking is discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993.) The rationale behind the 3 year estimate of subsistence need versus an annual estimate was explained in the proposed estimates of subsistence need (59 FR 25024, May 13, 1994). NMFS has recognized the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence (57 FR 34081, August 3, 1992). As a first step towards addressing this need, NMFS proposed that 215.32(b) of the fur seal regulations be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. The regulatory amendment is based on the fact that the actual number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent, and the fur seal take has never exceeded the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest.

Others feel that they are at the mercy of fate.    New research shows that some of those feelings are in the genes.    Psychologists long have known that people confident in their ability to control  their destinies are more likely to adjust well to growing old than others.    Two researchers who questioned hundreds of Swedish twins report that such  confidence, or lack of it, is partly genetic and partly drawn from experience.    They also found that the belief in blind luck -- that coincidence plays a big  role in life -- is something learned and has nothing to do with heredity.    The research was conducted at the Karolinska Institute, which annually awards  the Nobel Prize for medicine, by Karolinska's Nancy Pedersen and Margaret Gatz,  a psychology professor at the University of Southern California. Their results  recently were published in the United States in the Journal of Gerontology.    The study of twins, who have identical or similar genes, eliminates genetics as  the explanation of differences, said Richard J. Rose, professor of psychology  and medical genetics at Indiana University. Variances in twins must then be  attributed to their distinct environment and experiences.    The result of the Gatz-Pedersen study ""is consistent with other world  literature on the subject"" but has the added importance of being based on a far  larger and more representative sample than previous research, Rose said.    ""The belief in your ability to control your life direction, or the belief in  your own competence, is 30% something you are born with,"" said Gatz,  interviewed during a consultation visit to Sweden.    People who are confident of their ability to control their lives have an  ""internal locus of control"" and a better chance of being well-adjusted in old  age, said Pedersen.    An ""external locus of control"" -- believing that outside forces determine the  course of life -- has been linked to depression in later years, she said.    ""This is one of the windows on the aging process,"" said Pedersen, who has  published a series of studies on the genetics of personality traits based on  interviews with twins. The study on life control involved 554 pairs of twins.    ""We are trying to understand what makes people different. What makes some  people age gracefully and others have a more difficult time?"" she said.  ""Whether people feel independent is an important standard for service  institutions and how they treat the elderly.""    The study showed that while people have an inborn predilection toward  independence and self-confidence, about 70% of this personality trait is  affected by a person's environment and experiences.    Pedersen's studies, with various collaborators, probe the aging process by  comparing sets of twins, identical and fraternal, many of whom were separated  at an early age.    The subjects were drawn from a roster first compiled about 30 years ago  registering all twins born in Sweden since 1886. The complete list, which was  extended in 1971, has 95,000 sets of twins.    Rose said the registry, based on the whole population, is ""an unusually  powerful tool."" U.S. researchers have nothing comparable and normally rely on  twins who respond to advertisements.    Karolinska professor Anders Ahlbom, who runs the registry, said 80% to 85% of  twins typically respond to questionnaires sent by researchers.    Pedersen said that studies of twins who were reared separately but have  identical or nearly identical genes, compared to twins reared together, can  yield a unique measure of nature-vs.-nurture in human development.    Earlier research by Pedersen showed that a variety of other characteristics are  30% to 40% determined by a person's genetic makeup, including many of those  traits that make up what has become known as Type A behavior.    The Type A person -- the hard-driving worker who brings home his work from the  office, eats too fast, keeps his foot on the clutch at traffic lights and makes  a point of being on time -- has been found to have a higher risk of heart  disease before age 65.

This can result in  India taking a lead over Pakistan not only in the nuclear  program but also in the field of conventional weapons, thereby  causing difficulties for Pakistan's defense.    The discriminatory treatment meted out by the United States  to Pakistan does not beggar description. In spite of the fact  that Pakistan has been tied up with the United States through a  defense agreement since 1959, Washington never felt it necessary  to maintain its friendship with Islamabad, except for a brief  period during the Afghan war when the U.S. realized the danger  that the advancement of the former Soviet Union toward the hot  waters would have jeopardized the global power equilibrium.  However, Washington turned its eyes away from Pakistan after  the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan and its  subsequent disintegration, and the same Pakistan, which was said  to be a cornerstone of the U.S. foreign policy during the Afghan  war, discovers itself being called a ""fundamentalist,""  ""terrorist"" state and the standard bearer of the ""Islamic bomb.""  The United States then not only stopped its own aid to Pakistan  but also began efforts to persuade the entire world to follow  suit. Japan, which has been the largest aid donor to Pakistan,  also stopped providing assistance under the influence of the  U.S. propaganda and pressure, and categorically stated to the  then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in December 1992 that it  would be difficult for Islamabad to receive any Japanese aid if  it did not forgo its nuclear program, reduce military  expenditure, and create a favorable atmosphere for the purpose.  Two days ago, Japan once again reiterated its conditions and  showed a red signal to the new Pakistani Government as well.    It is ironical that India has also openly declared itself to  be a nuclear power in the Indian Subcontinent, but neither the  United States nor Europe nor Japan has objected to India about  this. New Delhi, actually, enjoys complete freedom in  stockpiling enriched uranium, making advances in the development  of delivery systems, and in amassing conventional weapons.  Thus, deliberate attempts are being made to weaken Pakistan's  defense, which is apparently aimed at leaving us on the mercy of  New Delhi and forcing us to accept India's supremacy.    Pakistan's nuclear scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan has said  that weakness in any country's defense is tantamount to inviting  enemy's aggression. He has suggested that we should manufacture  our own weapons, so that we can become a nuclear power by  achieving self- reliance in defense equipment and defend our  sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The  Pakistan Government should also urge the United States to  forsake its discriminatory and biased attitude toward Pakistan  and tell Washington that if it desires to help end the nuclear  arms race in the Indian Subcontinent, then it should adopt a  realistic and equitable policy and also pressure India, along  with Pakistan, to roll back or freeze its nuclear program. It  is the moral duty of the valiant United States to ensure the  supply of F-16's and other equipment for which it has already  received payments, so that Pakistan can be able to defend itself  from India at least in the field of conventional weapons. Trade  ethics also demand that we must get the items for which we have  already made payments. We have been emphasizing in these  columns that the country's real strength lies in its internal  unity and national solidarity. We will have to turn ourselves  into an impregnable (?wall) to defeat the enemy. Our leadership  should therefore pay attention to this issue as well.     "

By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BAGHDAD, Iraq      The Iraqi government Wednesday laid the groundwork for releasing hundreds of  foreign women and children, among them about 250 Americans, but diplomats said  President Saddam Hussein's decision Tuesday night to free them was so sudden  that logistical problems delayed their departure.    Most are expected to leave today. Sources in Iraq's Information Ministry said a  ceremony is scheduled this morning for the foreign media to meet some of the  departing hostages, whom Hussein had said he was holding in Iraq as ""guests"" to  discourage attack by Western forces.    Ambassadors from nearly a dozen countries that have sent military forces to the  Persian Gulf -- and whose citizens have been held here since Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait on Aug. 2 -- spent much of the day with Foreign Ministry officials in  Baghdad attempting to organize an orderly departure.    There was, however, considerable confusion about precisely who would be  permitted to leave. It was unclear whether Hussein's announcement covered women  and children in Kuwait or just those in Iraq and whether it included women with  no children here as well as mothers.    Many of the foreigners in Kuwait are reportedly in hiding, and U.S. officials  said they do not know how many of the estimated 2,500 Americans there are women  and children. They said ""around 250"" of the more than 500 Americans in Iraq  will be covered by the order. It also will include at least 700 Britons in  Iraq, as well as scores of French, Germans, Italians and other Europeans.    The logistics of moving so many people also bogged down the process. At least  one international air carrier, Virgin Airways of Britain, offered to run mercy  flights to Baghdad.    As of Wednesday, state-owned Iraqi Airways was the only commercial airline  flying into or out of Baghdad, and its only regular flights were between  Baghdad, Kuwait and Amman, Jordan. In Amman, two Iraqi passenger jets arrived  during the day, but neither carried foreign women and children.    In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat said Iraq will release male  hostages, as well, if the United States pledges not to attack Iraq.    ""Now we have permitted women and children of all nationalities to leave if they  wish to leave,"" he said Wednesday. ""Once America gives us assurances that they  are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq, or aggress upon Iraq, then we  are going to let even men out.""    Mashat asserted that Baghdad cannot be blamed for the delays in freeing the  women and children.    ""It is not possible administratively that everyone go on the same day, is it?""  he asked.    At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler characterized Hussein's  announcement as a significant step ""if implemented.""    ""We have heard statements like this before, and we hope Saddam Hussein will  have the human decency to live up to his word,"" she said.    She rebuffed Mashat's proposal about the male hostages, saying, ""We reject any  notion that there should be any conditions attached to the immediate safe  departure of all foreign nationals. . . .""    U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad said Wednesday night that they still had not  met with the more than 41 Americans who are known to have been taken to key  Iraqi strategic sites up to 10 days ago, although they said they expect to do  so today.    ""At the moment, I think the bureaucracy is trying to interpret the president's  order and work out the difficult logistics involved in getting all these people  together and getting them out,"" one diplomatic source said. ""It certainly seems  to have been a spur-of-the-moment decision (by Hussein).""    Meanwhile, Iraqi pressure on foreign diplomats and civilians continued,  American, French and Japanese diplomats reported. At least nine Americans are  missing and believed seized by Iraqi security agents in the last two days, and  French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said 40 more French citizens  have been rounded up in Baghdad. Bernard said authorities in Paris do not know  where they were taken.    Western officials estimate that more than 300 of the more than 12,000 citizens  of Western nations who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait have been taken from  their homes and hotel rooms by Iraqi forces. Hussein's government says some  will be housed at vulnerable military targets as a ""human shield"" against  attacks.    Meanwhile, Japanese officials reported Wednesday that their last two diplomats  abandoned their embassy in Kuwait. Without food, water or electricity since  Saturday, the ambassador and his top aide left for Baghdad. But the Japanese  Foreign Ministry insisted that ""in principle, the embassy remains open.""    The U.S. and British embassies in Kuwait remained defiant, with skeleton  staffs, as did more than 25 other European, Arab and Asian embassies, despite  Iraq's attempts to force them to shut down and move their operations to Iraq.    Despite the daylong confusion in Baghdad on Wednesday, there were a few lighter  moments. The Italian hostages, for example -- who were made available for  television interviews from their hotel rooms in Baghdad -- were all instructed  to report to the cultural center of their embassy, where they were shown the  film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" while awaiting further word from Iraqi  authorities.    Analysts in the Iraqi capital said there appeared to be several reasons for  Hussein's announcement concerning the release, which occurred less than an hour  after an internationally televised meeting between the president and a group of  Western hostages.    Several Western and Asian diplomats said they believe Hussein felt genuine  sympathy for the hostages. Yet, most added that the surprise announcement also  appeared to be a shrewd political move to gain a higher moral ground before  today's scheduled meeting in Jordan between Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz  and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.    On the eve of the crisis talks, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  insisted that there is no room for mediation.    Winding up a two-day state visit to Finland, Thatcher, who has been unbending  on the basic issues of the Persian Gulf confrontation, told reporters that the  U.N. Security Council resolutions ""were clear and must be enforced."" These  resolutions demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and empower foreign forces to  do whatever it takes to block supplies to Iraq. ""The policy has been laid down  by the Security Council. . . . The question is implementation,"" Thatcher said.    Taking an even harder line was Bahrain's foreign minister, Sheik Mohammed ibn  Mubarak al Khalifa. Speaking to British reporters with touring Defense  Secretary Tom King, the Bahraini sheik declared: ""What we want now is a free  Kuwait. . . . We have the right to defend it, and the military option is open  because others do not want to listen to withdrawal.""    Officials of Bahrain, whose government 10 days ago approved deployment of  Western forces on its soil, have supported the U.N. stand, but the foreign  minister's remarks, as reported on British television, were unusually tough.    ""There must be action to liberate Kuwait,"" he said. ""We will not let Kuwait be  occupied for long. . . . If the sanctions do not materialize, we have the  legitimate right to regain Kuwait.""    Although the exodus of hostages did not materialize Wednesday, Asian and Arab  refugees from Kuwait and Iraq continued to pour across the border into Jordan.  At Ruweished, the frontier crossing, the Jordanian government set up a tent  city on an asphalt parking lot, and hundreds of impoverished workers sought  shelter from the blazing sun while awaiting transportation to Amman -- and,  with luck, an airplane home.    Egyptian citizens, the most numerous group, generally were whisked away by bus  to the southern port of Aqaba for an airlift or ferry back to Egypt. But a host  of refugees heading for the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan  and Indonesia were kept waiting because a backlog of compatriots has built up  in Amman.    ""I have been here for four days, and no one tells me what to do,"" said Doy  Gutierrez, a Filipino laborer who worked in Kuwait for a year.    Food is scarce in Ruweished although health problems have been surprisingly few  -- mostly heatstroke. Water is being provided from a hose at the immigration  crossing and by tank truck inside a neutral zone where hundreds more refugees  are waiting passage into Jordan. In this no-man's-land, the Jordanians have  also set up tent cities to protect the refugees from the heat.    At Saudi Arabia's coastal-road border crossing with Kuwait, guards said  Wednesday that they had received no word of the new Iraqi announcement on  releasing foreign hostages. The border post, which a month ago waved as many as  3,000 cars and trucks through its gates per day, remained desolate as  foreigners inside Kuwait stayed put.    At the frontier's final checkpoint, four Saudi soldiers in desert camouflage  manned a 50-caliber machine gun mounted on a Chevy truck, and a number of  green-suited border guards watched through binoculars for signs of life across  the border.    There was little movement there, and no foreign hostages arrived. But a band of  Bangladeshis sitting in the shade of the border house told reporters that their  group arrived Monday, after surviving a seven-hour flight on foot across the  desert.    According to the group's leader, 25-year-old Mohammed Nasser, Iraqi soldiers  had robbed and plundered their homes in the diamond-shaped ""neutral zone"" along  the Saudi-Iraqi border, where they were employed as farm laborers.    As they fled, the Bangladeshis were stopped by Iraqi soldiers in trucks  demanding food and water, Nasser said. When some young farmers said they had  none, Nasser said the Iraqis turned their machine guns on seven, apparently  killing all.    The Bangladeshis were awaiting the arrival of their country's diplomatic  representative.

0,FT921-8280 ,"FT921-8280 _AN-CBRBMAFEFT 920218   FT  18 FEB 92 / Musawi mourners vow revenge: Westerners advised to leave Beirut as kidnap threat increases      By HUGH CARNEGY   WESTERN embassies in Beirut yesterday advised the few hundred remaining expatriates to leave the city in case the Israeli killing of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader, prompted renewed attempts by his supporters to kidnap westerners. Lebanese police said they had tightened security at western embassies and other foreign interests in Beirut. However, Iran said it expected the kidnappers holding two German hostages to respond 'reasonably'. The security warning came as thousands of Lebanese Shia Moslems thronged the streets of south Beirut vowing revenge against Israel and the US for Sunday's attack on the motorcade of Mr Musawi in which his wife, six-year-old son and five bodyguards also died. 'Oh God, wipe Israel and America out of existence,' chanted an estimated 50,000-strong crowd which turned out, led by Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah the spiritual leader of Hizbollah, to mourn the death of Sheikh Musawi, secretary-general of the organisation. Mr Musawi's deputy, Mr Naeem Qassem, told the rally: 'Do you think, enemy of God (Israel), that you have won? No, we are waiting for you ..the earth will shake beneath your feet.' In southern Lebanon, Hizbollah gunners launched a wave of rocket and artillery attacks on the 'security zone' north of the Israeli border occupied by Israeli troops and their local militia allies. Some rockets fell harmlessly into Israel itself. Israeli forces responded with artillery barrages. Lebanese army units were also reported to have been involved in the artillery exchanges in southern Lebanon, a rare and potentially dangerous direct confrontation with Israeli forces. The Lebanese government, although at odds with Hizbollah which defies its authority, called on the United Nations Security Council to discuss the killing of Sheikh Musawi. The European Community yesterday supported the US call for all parties to show restraint, reflecting fears that the increase in violence could threaten the Middle East peace talks next week. It also called for a stronger European role in the peace process. In a statement EC foreign ministers meeting in Lisbon urged 'all parties to refrain from taking any action which could endanger the (current peace) negotiations or undermine the establishment of a climate of confidence, including the pursuit of the current settlement policy'. The Israeli government said it would go ahead with the Washington talks, a position already confirmed by Syria and Lebanon. The other parties involved, Jordan and the Palestinians, have given no indication that they will reverse earlier decisions to attend. But in a further complication Israel confirmed it had arrested two men added by the Palestinians to their delegation for the peace talks. The Musawi attack followed the killing of three soldiers in Israel by Palestinians on Friday and two retaliatory Israeli air raids on Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in which at least four people died. The attack on Mr Musawi was greeted by the Israeli government and defence establishment as a timely re-assertion of the army's effectiveness.

A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated for five days before finding Maureen  McDermott guilty of first-degree murder in the April 28, 1985, death of Stephen  Eldridge. The jury also convicted McDermott of attempted murder in a failed  effort to kill him on March 21, 1985.    McDermott flinched and put her hand to her forehead as the verdict was  announced.    McDermott, who works at County-USC Medical Center, faces the death penalty or  life in prison without possibility of parole because the jury found that she  was guilty of the special circumstances allegations -- lying in wait and  killing for financial gain. Judge Alan B. Haber ordered jurors to return on  March 19 for the penalty phase of the trial.    Eldridge, 27, was stabbed 44 times and his penis was cut off. His body was  discovered in the Van Nuys home he shared with McDermott after she called the  911 emergency line to report that three intruders had knocked her unconscious  as she took a bath, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader.    Investigators grew suspicious of McDermott because her injuries were minor,  expensive items in plain view in the house had been left untouched and the bath  water was still tepid hours after she said she had been attacked, Mader said.    In addition, they discovered that Eldridge had been injured in a knife attack  by two intruders in the house barely a month earlier.    Mader contended that McDermott set up the killing and faked her own injuries so  she could collect on a mortgage insurance policy that she and Eldridge took out  when they became co-owners of a house on Killion Street in Van Nuys.    McDermott hired James Flores Luna, a hospital orderly, to kill Eldridge and  mutilate his body in hopes of making it look like a homosexual crime of  passion, which she thought would be less likely to be thoroughly investigated  by police, Mader said.    Luna, 36, was the key witness in the trial, which began in October. Also  testifying against McDermott were Marvyn and Dondell Lee, brothers from Los  Angeles who helped with the killing, according to prosecutors. The two received  immunity in exchange for testifying.    Luna pleaded guilty to murder with special circumstances after being promised  that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty against him if he cooperated.  His sentencing is pending.    McDermott's two court-appointed attorneys, Joe Ingber and Carl Burkow, told the  jury that police did a shoddy investigation, and they attacked the credibility  of Luna and the Lee brothers.    Prosecutors alleged that after the March 21 attempt on Eldridge's life -- which  McDermott herself arranged -- McDermott comforted him while secretly plotting  to kill him.    Eldridge confided to a friend that he felt far more secure when McDermott was  home with him, Mader said.

Judge Alan B. Haber ordered jurors to return on  March 19 for the penalty phase of the trial.    Eldridge, 27, was stabbed 44 times and his penis was cut off. His body was  discovered in the Van Nuys home he shared with McDermott after she called the  911 emergency line to report that three intruders had knocked her unconscious  as she took a bath, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader.    Investigators grew suspicious of McDermott because her injuries were minor,  expensive items in plain view in the house had been left untouched and the bath  water was still tepid hours after she said she had been attacked, Mader said.    In addition, they discovered that Eldridge had been injured in a knife attack  by two intruders in the house barely a month earlier.    Mader contended that McDermott set up the killing and faked her own injuries so  she could collect on a mortgage insurance policy that she and Eldridge took out  when they became co-owners of a house on Killion Street in Van Nuys.    McDermott hired James Flores Luna, a hospital orderly, to kill Eldridge and  mutilate his body in hopes of making it look like a homosexual crime of  passion, which she thought would be less likely to be thoroughly investigated  by police, Mader said.    Luna, 36, was the key witness in the trial, which began in October. Also  testifying against McDermott were Marvyn and Dondell Lee, brothers from Los  Angeles who helped with the killing, according to prosecutors. The two received  immunity in exchange for testifying.    Luna pleaded guilty to murder with special circumstances after being promised  that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty against him if he cooperated.  His sentencing is pending.    McDermott's two court-appointed attorneys, Joe Ingber and Carl Burkow, told the  jury that police did a shoddy investigation, and they attacked the credibility  of Luna and the Lee brothers.    Prosecutors alleged that after the March 21 attempt on Eldridge's life -- which  McDermott herself arranged -- McDermott comforted him while secretly plotting  to kill him.    Eldridge confided to a friend that he felt far more secure when McDermott was  home with him, Mader said.

It is natural that the resumption of the  negotiations should be linked with the degree of seriousness in  Israel's answers to the basic questions Secretary of State  Christopher carried from Damascus after he held detailed talks  with President Hafiz al-Asad.    It is also natural that progress or stalemate in the peace  process should be linked to real change in Israel's position.  No one would disagree that the establishment of peace needs  action rather than sweet talk on the importance of and the need  for achieving that peace. The U.S. Administration has sensed  Syria's true intentions, and President Bill Clinton has not  concealed this. Moreover, he has reiterated on many occasions  his belief in Syria's credible position and its serious trend  toward peace. Christopher did the same during his tour of the  region last week.    Syria's concern for pushing the peace process forward,  however, does not at all mean any relinquishment of its  constants or any bargaining over territory, rights, and  sovereignty. These are matters that Syria will never reconsider  under any circumstances. President Bill Clinton's  administration, as well as Israel, knows this fact.    Total withdrawal from Golan is the basis for negotiations on  the Syrian track. This occupied Syrian territory should return  completely to the motherland, as it used to be before the June  aggression of 1967. Syria's right to sovereignty over its  territory is a fact that cannot, and will not be bypassed. What  applies to Golan also applies to the occupied part of southern  Lebanon and to Jordanian territories occupied by Israel. Hence,  the importance of continued coordination among the Arab parties  involved in the peace process. This coordination will be a  guarantee for the Arabs and will constitute a weapon that will  enable them to regain their usurped rights and their occupied  territories and to avoid the Israeli trap of unilateral deals  and partial settlements.    Experience has shown that such settlements will not achieve  peace, but will undermine the chances of achieving a  comprehensive and just peace. The best example is the  disappointment of the Palestinians in the occupied Arab  territories following the signing of the fragile self-rule  accord, which will keep the Palestinian people subject to  Israel's mercy and domination.    Syria is working to establish a comprehensive peace and  durable peace that will not create disappointments. Such a  peace cannot be achieved without the implementation of the  relevant UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which  former President George Bush's administration proposed, and on  which the Madrid conference was launched under the U.S. and  Russian sponsorship, and to which current President Clinton's  administration committed itself after pledging to play a fair  and complete partner in the peace process.    Those who seek such a peace will find every cooperation from  Syria. But if talk about peace is merely an Israeli maneuver,  no new tour by Washington will achieve anything to save the  peace process from the crisis in which the Israeli rulers have  placed it.    Syria has repeatedly asserted that peace falls within the  strategy it has adopted for many years. But the other side,  Israel, has been talking about peace at a time when it places  obstacles, mines, and thorns on the road. Today, we say that  the opportunity to achieve peace is available if intentions are  sincere and if statements turn into action on the ground.  Otherwise, the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace  will remain out of reach. This fact will be sensed by the head  of U.S. diplomacy, Warren Christopher, when he returns to the  Middle East. He should deal with facts and deeds to succeed in  his new mission and so that the peace process can witness a real  move toward its desired goal.     "

0,FT931-3560 ,"FT931-3560 _AN-DCPCCABAFT 930316   FT  16 MAR 93 / Amnesty plan for Salvadoran abuses      By DAMIAN FRASER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS at the UN      MEXICO CITY, NEW YORK   EL SALVADOR'S President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an amnesty for active and former high-ranking military officers blamed by a United Nations report for some of the worst atrocities of the country's 10-year civil war. The report, released yesterday, cites 'substantial proof' that General Rene Emilio Ponce, who resigned as defence minister on Friday, and four other military officers ordered the killing of six Jesuit priests in 1989. It says the late Mr Roberto D'Aubuisson, extreme right-wing leader of the Arena party, ordered the murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980. The US-trained Atlacatl battalion was held responsible for the massacre of a thousand civilians at El Mozote in 1981. The murders, assassinations and other human rights abuses were committed during a civil year that pitted the US-backed army and civilian government against left-wing guerrillas. The US gave the army and government around Dollars 6bn in aid during the 1980s, despite accusations by human rights observers that the Salvadoran military was guilty of the crimes now described in the report. The two sides reached a peace agreement last year, with the Salvadoran government agreeing to give the rebels land, purge the military, and reform the police and judiciary, and set up a commission to investigate the worst acts of violence. The UN report was written by Mr Belisario Betancur, former Colombian president, Mr Reynald Figueredo, former Venezuelan foreign minister, and US jurist Mr Thomas Burgenthal. They also accuse leaders of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of killing and kidnapping civilians, mayors of cities under government control, dissidents in the rebel movement, judges and US military personnel. The commission urged that those named in the report be barred from public office for 10 years, and be prohibited from ever holding military or security responsibility. It called for a special investigation into the death squads that killed tens of thousands of Salvadorans in the 1980s, believing that they continue to be a 'potential menace'. According to the commission Gen Ponce, Gen Juan Orlando Zepeda, deputy defence minister, and Gen Juan Rafael Bustillo, former air force commander, met on the eve of the murder of the six Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter and ordered Colonel Guillermo Benavides to have them killed 'without any witnesses'. Col Benavides was convicted of the Jesuits' murder, and is serving a 30-year prison sentence. At a ceremony in New York to release the report, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, appeared to offer some support to Mr Cristiani's amnesty proposal. Observing that the country had made great strides, but that peace-building was far from over, Mr Boutros Ghali said Mr Cristiani deserved the international community's encouragements in his efforts.

Daniel J. Montecalvo's face reddened, but he sat motionless as Pasadena  Superior Court Judge Jack Tso outlined the sentence and told him that the  evidence that led to his first-degree murder conviction was overwhelming.    Montecalvo, 49, was found guilty Nov. 5 of fatally wounding his wife, Carol, in  1988 despite his claim that a burglar had shot her after being discovered  ransacking their Burbank home.    Prosecutors said Montecalvo, who moved to Glendale after the murder, shot  himself in the back with a small-caliber pistol to make it seem as though the  burglar had also attacked him.    Montecalvo, a convicted bank robber, killed his 43-year-old wife to collect on  her $600,000 insurance policy in order to settle gambling debts, said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Robert Cohen, who prosecuted the case.    At his sentencing Monday, Montecalvo, who has acted as his own attorney  throughout the trial, denied the allegations and accused Cohen of misleading  the jurors and the judge.    He also said the Police Department focused on him as the murder suspect after  he sued the department for negligence, charging that his wife, a Pacific Bell  supervisor, died of her wounds because the officers did not respond fast enough  to an emergency call.    ""This is a frame-up,"" said Montecalvo. ""Everything (Cohen) has said has been  unfair. He has lied to the court.""    In a nearly hourlong statement before he was sentenced, Montecalvo asked Tso  for a retrial on the grounds that new evidence had surfaced that would clear  his name.    ""The only way I can grant a retrial is if it can be demonstrated that you have  not had a fair trial,"" said Tso. ""There is substantial evidence to show you are  guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. The evidence has been overwhelming.""    Prosecutors admitted that most of the evidence against Montecalvo was  circumstantial. There were no eyewitnesses to the slaying, and a murder weapon  was never recovered.    The case was so difficult to assemble, prosecutors said, they waited nearly two  years before charging Montecalvo of murder last March 14.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Penny Schneider, the original prosecutor, sought later to  have the murder charge dropped, but was overruled by her superiors. She was  replaced by Cohen.    Eighty-five witnesses, 163 exhibits and 8,600 pages of investigative reports  painted Montecalvo as a bar-hopping womanizer and a habitual gambler desperate  to pay off his gambling debts.

""The only way I can grant a retrial is if it can be demonstrated that you have  not had a fair trial,"" said Tso. ""There is substantial evidence to show you are  guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. The evidence has been overwhelming.""    Prosecutors admitted that most of the evidence against Montecalvo was  circumstantial. There were no eyewitnesses to the slaying, and a murder weapon  was never recovered.    The case was so difficult to assemble, prosecutors said, they waited nearly two  years before charging Montecalvo of murder last March 14.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Penny Schneider, the original prosecutor, sought later to  have the murder charge dropped, but was overruled by her superiors. She was  replaced by Cohen.    Eighty-five witnesses, 163 exhibits and 8,600 pages of investigative reports  painted Montecalvo as a bar-hopping womanizer and a habitual gambler desperate  to pay off his gambling debts.

Even if their predictions are true, astrologers do not mean  to tell the truth. Their predictions are lies based on  probability, which could, by sheer coincidence, be true on  certain occasions.    By the same token, traitors are also liars, even if they  tell  the truth. One might hear nice words and admire them. However,  once one finds out who uttered these words, their sense is lost  and their beauty turns into insults and vulgar expressions.    ""We have fought honorably, and we make peace honorably.""  Beautiful words, right? You will laugh when you find out who  said these words and when. The speaker is Hafiz al-Asad and the  occasion is his meeting with his new lord, Clinton.    It is common knowledge that Hafiz al-Asad had no honor on  two  occasions during which fighting was truly honorable. The first  is the June war, when al-Asad was defense minister, and gave the  Golan as a gift to the Zionist entity. The second is the  October war when Damascus was about to be captured had it not  been for the chivalrous Iraqi leadership and its heroic army  that came to the rescue. The Iraqi army removed the enemy and  drew up a plan for attack and infiltration into the enemy's  defenses. However, only hours before carrying out the plan, it  was surprised that the ""honorable fighter"" had accepted a  cease-fire, because its premeditated objective was ""provocation""  rather than liberation.    We do not want to do injustice to the man. Therefore, we  testify that he displayed ""honor"" on many occasions in which  fighting was not honorable.    He had the ""honor"" of destroying the city of Hamah and  killing 25,000 of its people and supervising the massacre of the  Tadmur desert prison.    He had the ""honor"" of killing Palestinians and the national  movement in Lebanon since the 'Ayn al-Rummanah events in 1975  and up until now.    He had the ""honor"" of watching, and sometimes assisting in,  the Zionist army's attacks on Lebanon.    He had the ""honor"" of watching the massacre of the  Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila.    The highest order of ""honor"" won by Hafiz al-Asad was  through  two stands in which he expressed his ""national honor"" which he  brags about more than extremist nationalist leaders.    The first, when he ""honorably"" sided by the Iranian  aggression against Iraq for eight years. The second, when he  had the ""honor"" of participating, along with the allied forces,  in the 30-state aggression against Iraq.    A person displaying all this ""honor"" in his fights will  definitely have the ""honor"" of throwing himself into the lap of  the cousins (Rabin and Peres). Even if the Golan returns  through a disgraceful settlement, al-Asad still bears the  disgrace of surrendering it and leaving it for 27 years without  liberation. We are here talking about usurped Syrian Arab  territory, and not Jerusalem, Baysan, or Nazareth.    Indeed, traitors are liars, even if they tell the truth.     "

THE MURDERERS OFTEN ARE INVOLVED IN A  TEMPESTUOUS LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP -- THEY CANNOT LIVE WITH THE PERSON AND  CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT HIM OR HER.      By GEORGE ESPER, ASSOCIATED PRESS      HARTFORD, Conn.      To his neighbors, John Cotter Jr. was a wealthy real estate developer who had  it all, the son of a retired state Supreme Court chief justice, himself the  patriarch of an elegant family, a loving father who took his son hunting.    But inside, Cotter was tortured by ""monsters,"" tormented by his business  failures, shattered by the recent discovery that his son had epilepsy.    Hopelessness overtook him and in the end he shot himself -- but not before  taking the lives of his wife, son and daughter.    The tragedy recalls other cases in which people bent on killing themselves have  taken innocents, even bystanders, with them -- people like Joseph Wesbecker,  the former mental patient who in September killed nine, including himself, in a  Louisville, Ky., printing-plant rampage.    Psychologists and physiologists are only beginning to isolate possible reasons  for such perplexing behavior. Besides personal pressures that seem unbearable,  they cite perverse love-hate relationships between some killers and victims,  and in many cases a deficiency in a message-carrying chemical in the brain.    The details of Cotter's final act provide a dim light down the foreboding  tunnels of the mind.    ""There was nothing strange about them,"" said Jane Longley-Cook, a neighbor who  was in a car pool with Cotter's wife, Anne.    Anne Cotter, 44, was a patron of the arts and a caring mother so thoughtful  she'd hand out trick-or-treat candy in advance of Halloween if she was going to  be away. The daughter, Julia, 21, graduated from college last spring with a  degree in French and planned to spend some time in England. The son, John III,  17, was enrolled in a private school.    ""It probably was the biggest shock of my life,"" Jane Longley-Cook said of the  July killings in the three-story brick house across the street. ""I don't think  we'll ever know what causes people to do things like that.""    Cotter, a shy, private man of 47, had started seeing a psychiatrist about a  month before. According to police reports, he indicated to the therapist that  he was depressed because of, among other things, financial problems and the  illness of his son, a loner who had few close friends.    About a year earlier, the son suffered a seizure while driving, which led to  the discovery that he had epilepsy.    The psychiatrist, who prescribed antidepressant drugs for Cotter, would not  comment on the case, but police said he indicated Cotter never talked about  taking his own life, let alone killing his family. Just a week or two before  the shootings, he told the therapist his difficulties seemed to be  straightening out, according to investigators.    But apparently pressure began to build in a mind psychiatrists say might have  crossed the line from reality to exaggeration. His last thoughts were scribbled  on a single page of paper in disjointed and unpunctuated notes:    ""Depression    ""Shaking uncontrollably inside    ""Destitute    ""No hope    ""No hope for family    ""No good insurance    ""Epilepsy    ""John III is depressed from Tegretol (medication to control seizures) and . . .  walks the house at night as I do He worries about another seizure and accident,  becoming a closeted person    ""Death, nervous breakdown depression is everywhere    ""The monster shakes my body each night and I wake trembling.""    The page ended with a reference to his wife, who was mourning the recent loss  of her mother:    ""No future, no hope, suffering for all of us -- she suffered in the past and  can't suffer again.""    Cotter also left an eight-page letter alleging payoffs and the mishandling of  funds and grants in the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, which makes  loans for projects, including low-income housing. Although Cotter did not  implicate himself, he alleged that the purported scheme to defraud the  authority involved real estate he had owned. The state is investigating.    Cotter himself was facing a half-dozen civil suits filed by tenants of one of  his developments seeking more than $2 million in damages from a fire. At a  probate hearing, a judge said Cotter's estate might not be enough to cover his  debts.    Dr. Alan L. Berman, a professor of psychology at the American University in  Washington, said Cotter's notes are an expression of tremendous anxiety, fear  or threat he felt and an inability to separate himself from his family.    Some suicidal people in a twisted state of mind may see those they murder as  themselves. ""They are so fused, so incapable of distinguishing that this other  person is a separate human being, the suicidal motive extends to having to kill  this other person as well,"" said Berman.    The most typical murder-suicide is one in which two partners depend on and  abuse each other for affection in a love-hate relationship marked by  separations, threats and accusations of infidelity, he said.    ""They cannot exist separate from each other and they really can't live with  each other without being abusive. So it's sort of a final act that communicates  just that and that is: 'I am so despairing because you're threatening to leave  me. I hate you so much and I love you so much, I have to take you with me and I  have to go.' ""    Berman told of a Baltimore man who shot his lover three times in the head, then  bent over and kissed her before killing himself.    Nancy Allen, a Los Angeles counselor, found in a study of 104 murder-suicides  that 71% of the murderers were husbands or boyfriends of the victims. In half  of the cases, the couple had been drinking.    Studies since 1976 link such violent and impulsive behavior to a decrease in  the chemical called serotonin, which carries messages between brain cells.    ""Serotonin has been found to be the lowest in murder-suicides,"" said Dr. Susan  J. Blumenthal, a psychiatrist and chief of the Behavioral Medicine Program at  the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville, Md. ""It's also very low  in arsonists who then kill themselves or attempt suicide.""    Some who commit murder-suicide fall victim to depression or psychosis, unable  to distinguish reality from fantasy, hearing voices telling them to hurt  themselves and others. They blame others, including family members or their  work supervisors, for their failures and their hurt, often exaggerated in the  exhaustion of the mind.    ""These are people . . . who feel helpless in the face of being victimized by  someone else,"" said Dr. Ronald S. Ebert, senior forensic psychologist at McLean  Hospital in Belmont, Mass.    Such was the case with Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman who was put on  disability leave last year. A manic depressive, he had attempted suicide three  times. Co-workers said he carried a grudge because he was laid off and feared  his disability benefits were going to be stopped.    ""You're dealing with a man who perceives a miscarriage of justice and he's  going to correct it,"" said Dr. Martin Symonds, chairman of the American  Psychiatric Assn.'s Task Force on Victimization.    Many murderers then take their own lives because they despise what they did and  cannot to live with themselves after killing someone, particularly someone  close.    The National Institute of Mental Health's Blumenthal said that in more than 90%  of suicides there is some humiliating life event in the recent past. ""There's a  breakup in a relationship. They've lost a job. They've lost some financial  status. They're about to be confronted by the law.""    No one knows for sure what was going through John Cotter's mind that fatal  summer day on Woodside Circle.    ""I think everybody wishes they knew because you could say, 'Well, it happened  because of this and we can put it behind us,' "" said Longley-Cook, a mother of  three.    ""I think that's what's very frightening to children. They see this happy family  across the street and then suddenly they hear the father murdered everyone and  killed himself. That's pretty devastating for children. Every time I see the  house, I just can't believe that's happened there.""

The National Institute of Mental Health's Blumenthal said that in more than 90%  of suicides there is some humiliating life event in the recent past. ""There's a  breakup in a relationship. They've lost a job. They've lost some financial  status. They're about to be confronted by the law.""    No one knows for sure what was going through John Cotter's mind that fatal  summer day on Woodside Circle.    ""I think everybody wishes they knew because you could say, 'Well, it happened  because of this and we can put it behind us,' "" said Longley-Cook, a mother of  three.    ""I think that's what's very frightening to children. They see this happy family  across the street and then suddenly they hear the father murdered everyone and  killed himself. That's pretty devastating for children. Every time I see the  house, I just can't believe that's happened there.""      Wire    "

0,FT944-12822 ,"FT944-12822 _AN-EJ4DUAB2FT 941031   FT  31 OCT 94 / Business Travel: In S Korea, it is better to arrive  ..      By Our Travel Staff   Bridges fall apart. Boats catch fire. Aircraft crash. Trains collide. Ferries capsize. The past year in South Korea has been bad enough to make any traveller nervous. But the frequency of disasters during 'Visit Korea Year' is especially grim news, writes our Travel Staff. The collapse of one of Seoul's main river bridges, the Songsu, during the morning rush hour on October 21 killed at least 32 people and cast a shadow over South Korea's reputation as a world leader in construction. As the embarrassed government expressed contrition for lax safety procedures, a pleasure boat packed with local tourists caught fire on Chungju Lake south of Seoul three days later, killing at least 25. Yet the combined toll from these two accidents pales in comparison with the numbers killed on the roads during an average long holiday weekend. The latest accidents have reinforced a widespread impression that travelling anywhere in South Korea - by any type of transport - is exceptionally dangerous. Ask Yoo O-kun, a bank employee who went to Chungju Lake to recover from the Songsu Bridge nightmare - he lost his closest friend - and ended up helping to rescue people from the burning boat. 'I now reckon there's no safe place in our country,' he said. 'How could disasters take place in succession like this? I'm too scared to travel now.' The boat disaster happened just over a year after a ferry capsized off the west coast, killing 292. Those who think that train or air travel might be more reassuring are wrong. In August, 160 passengers and crew aboard a Korean Air Lines Airbus had a remarkable escape when it crash-landed in a rainstorm on the southern tourist island of Cheju. In July last year, 64 were killed when an Asiana Airlines Boeing crashed on the south-west coast. And air force chief General Cho Kun-hae was among six people killed when a helicopter crashed south of Seoul last March. Two months ago, three were killed and 50 hurt when two express trains collided head on. A driver had ignored a signal. Last March, 79 were killed in a train accident in the southern city of Pusan. Observers blame lax safety standards, non-enforcement of regulations - and corruption - for many accidents in South Korea. Korea plans to spend Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) on infrastructure over the next eight years. However, MPs, the media and engineers warn of more bad accidents to come. The lesson is clear: in South Korea, it is always better to arrive than to travel.   Countries:-  KRZ  South Korea, Asia.   Industries:-  P7999 Amusement and Recreation, NEC.

The ruling, handed down Dec. 21, has caused an uproar in El Salvador,  escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the  Christian Democrats of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the rightist  Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), the main opposition party.    ""In fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked,"" said Roberto  Giron Flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was  fired Dec. 23 by the Arena-controlled National Assembly.    U.S. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by  the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political  sources say the Americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the  case.    Romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military  repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on March 24, 1980,  while saying Mass. It was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out  by the death squads, and Duarte had vowed to punish those responsible.    Former U.S. Ambassador Robert E. White asserted that the killing was ordered by  Roberto d'Aubuisson, a founder of Arena and currently a legislator in the  National Assembly. D'Aubuisson has denied the allegation.    In November, 1987, Duarte made public testimony given to investigators by Amado  Garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. Garay said  that he worked for Alvaro Saravia, a cashiered Salvadoran air force captain and  protege of D'Aubuisson. Garay said that after the killing, Saravia reported on  the success of the operation to D'Aubuisson.    D'Aubuisson declared at the time that Garay was lying and rejected the  allegations.    Based on Garay's testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and  other elements of his testimony were investigated, the Salvadoran government,  with U.S. help, asked for Saravia's extradition from Miami, where he was living  illegally.    Saravia was arrested in Miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been  held since, as the extradition request proceeded. He was to have been  extradited in early January, according to legal sources.    But the Salvadoran Supreme Court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and  Christian Democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled Dec. 21 that there  were no grounds for arresting Saravia if he returned to El Salvador and that  the extradition request itself was illegal.    The court ruled that delay in presentation of Garay's evidence, after ""seven  years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his  testimony"" and resulted in no evidence linking Saravia to the killing.    ""The problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been  totally dominated by Arena, which blocks the investigation and application of  justice,"" said Antonio Morales Erlich, secretary general of the Christian  Democrats. ""I want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented  in the Romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order.""    On Dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the  Arena deputies supporting the move, fired Giron Flores as attorney general,  alleging ""incompetence and immorality,"" and named Arena sympathizer Roberto  Garcia Alvarado to replace him.    ""The truth is that I was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because  the Romero case was about to be resolved,"" Giron Flores said. ""Saravia was  about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . The  Romero case is now closed, and I was fired so the case could be closed.""    Knowledgeable observers say that Giron Flores is correct, because, by ruling  that the testimony was too old -- although no Salvadoran law places time limits  on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown  out on the same grounds.    ""On legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead,"" said one person familiar  with the case.    Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, after a Mass on  Christmas Day, said, ""In the church, we think (Saravia) has valuable  information on this act which convulsed the country.""    Arena's presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, said that Giron Flores was  fired for ""demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office,""  and Cristiani accused the Christian Democrats of throwing up a ""smoke screen""  and ""politicizing"" the matter by trying to link the firing to the Romero case.    The investigation into Romero's killing was being handled by a special  investigative unit that had received U.S. training. According to two people  involved in the investigation, Saravia was also to be charged upon his return  here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of Carlos Guerra Campos, a wealthy  coffee grower. Investigators said that they planned to use the Guerra Campos  case to force Saravia to give evidence in the Romero case.    ""It was to be our checkmate move,"" one investigator said.    Investigators also said that Garay had identified Dr. Hector Antonio Regalado,  a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was  no hard evidence other than Garay's statement linking him to the shooting.    Regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the Constituent Assembly  when D'Aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s.    Earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that  Regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.

The investigations also revealed that 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, the  terrorist who was killed in a fight with policemen on al-Bahr  al-A'zam street in al-Munib on 4 April, had been assigned by  fugitive terrorist Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al-Jihad  Organization, to lead the organization's military wing and to  act as coordinator between the terrorist leaders abroad and in  Egypt. Dr. al-Zawahiri supplied him with the money to buy  weapons and ammunition in order to carry out terrorist  operations. Organization members were to have assassinated UN  Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt,  but failed due to a change in his route. They had also planned  to assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif.    The interrogation of al-Jihad's military wing members also  indicated that terrorist Siyam had planned the aborted attempt  on the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. For that  operation, he rented a house for terrorists Diya'-al-Din Mahmud  Hafiz, Nazih Subhi Rashid, Ahmad Faruq, and Muhammad Rashad  'Abd-al-Hamid in the Kafr al-Manfa area in al-Haram. He then  persuaded terrorist Diya'-al-Din Hafiz to carry out the suicide  mission, while he personally watched the interior minister's  motorcade.    Members of the organization, including terrorist Muhammad  'Abd- al-'Alim Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil  'Awad, admitted to killing witness Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya and  three others at his car showroom in Shibin al-Qanatir on 4  February. He was murdered for reporting to the police on their  terrorist colleague Sayyid Salah. Salah was sentenced to death  in connection with the assassination attempt of Prime Minister  Dr.'Atif Sidqi. They also admitted to placing an explosive  device at al-Jazirah Youth Center in 1993 so it would detonate  during a training course of State Security Intelligence  officers, and to killing their dissident colleague 'Adil Anwar  in Saray al-Qubbah area.    The investigations revealed that terrorist Siyam had been  using seven stolen cars to move around in and to pass  instructions to organization members. A report by the criminal  laboratory identified the weapons found in possession of the  terrorists as those used in the Shibin al-Qanatir terrorist  operation, in which Sayyid Abu-Yahya and three others were  killed and a police officer, who chanced to be in the showroom,  was injured. The investigations showed that terrorist 'Adil  Siyam had received funds from abroad, for a receipt from a  foreign currency transfer in Italy was found. The organization  members used to disguise themselves in police, armed forces, and  municipality workers' uniforms to place the explosive devices in  strategic areas. The investigations revealed that terrorist  'Adil Siyam and his brother-in-law Muhammad Khalifah had trained  the terrorists how to prepare explosives. The organization  members led prosecutors to nine dens in al-Basatin, al-Munib,  al-Qalubiyah, where weapons and ammunition had been stored, as  well as an underground tunnel which led to Bilbays in al-  Sharqiyah Governorate.

I am just just the  secretary who records things."" I would like to ask if Vietnamese  society today has such a secretary in such works as ""Noi Buon  Chien Tranh"" [The Sorrows of War], ""Ly Than,"" ""Noi Loan"" [To  Rebel], ""Bi Kich Nho"" [A Small Tragedy], ""Chuyen Lang Cuoi"" [The  Story of Chuoi Village], and so on. Naturally, in fictional  literary works, imagination plays a very important role. I am  not naive or simple-minded like the woman who looked at a  painting by Matisse and then said: ""He painted this woman with  unequal arms."" To which the famous painter responded: ""You are  greatly mistaken! This is not a woman but a painting.""    The act of creation, how the artist subtracts or adds  things,  starts from the guiding idea of the artist, because each artist  must obtain the ""materials to construct"" his works from real  life. Two-hundred years ago, Goethe said that the materials used  to create a work have things in common with the author that they  can easily see, grasp, and write about or create. Thus, the  plots may have something in common with the author, but that is  not true for the majority of readers. Three centuries ago, a  talented French writer who was a social realist, Boileau,  commented that the best poem or the loftiest idea cannot make a  person happy if that person's ears are damaged.    I think that the ears of many people were damaged when they  read ""To Rebel,"" ""A Small Tragedy,"" and a number of other recent  works even though, in the words of Goethe, they perhaps had many  things in common with the mood of the author. In ""To Rebel,"" the  detailed descriptions in the rooms or beneath the waters off the  coast of Vung Tau and the ""collapse"" of the degenerate writers  in former Saigon all ""salute defeat."" I remember that the  ""forces to defend national culture"" at that time condemned the  immorality of a number of those works. ""A Small Tragedy"" is  another immoral work. Actually, the motive resembles that of  ""Hon Vong Phu"" as portrayed in several Taiwanese videos, which I  have seen recently: Two siblings have the same father but  different mothers. Because of historical events, they do not  recognize each other. They fall in love and intend to marry. But  in Taiwan, the writer did not dare allow the characters to  engage in incest. As for the concept that the family is  ""lasting,"" when the young man arrives from mainland China, he is  constantly portrayed as stupid and rustic. In ""A Small Tragedy,""  Quang, an overseas Vietnamese who is now a French citizen,  returns to his native country. He is wealthy, well-educated, and  polite. Uncle Ca likes him very much and says: ""Vietnamese  should be polite like him. For several decades, we have been  waging a revolution and have forgotten how to be polite. That is  very important."" (Page 36)    At the beginning of ""A Small Tragedy,"" the author devotes an  entire page to write the one sentence: ""I offer my great love.""  Reading the book, I looked for the target of ""my great love.""  Was it a person? The fatherland? Or a system to constantly  improve mankind that we can respect? I had been very careless,  because the author had clearly provided the answer on page 34  (line 6): ""If you have loved, will you encounter great love like  Cay? That is not easy.""    Based on the examples cited, recent short stories and novels  in our country are filled with falsehoods. As the philosopher  Jean Paul Sartre would say, I hope that in the coming period,  these ""falsehoods do not become beliefs"" that writers want to  transmit to readers. In my view, all writers have their own  ideas about life. When they write something, they want to  construct a world of man and things in order to represent those  ideas.    Thus, after reading a short story or novel, I usually try to  understand what secret ideas the author really wanted to present  through his characters and scenes.    Even though I know that Vu Ngoc Phan, in his book ""Modern  Writers,"" has divided Vietnamese novels into ten categories and  that the researcher Thanh Lang has organized works by their  creative tendency (emotion, struggle, realism, humor, memoirs,  and so on), I want to divide the works that I have read into two  types: the constructive type that fosters confidence in people  and the type that sows doubts in people. I would like to share  this viewpoint with readers.    Unfortunately, it must be noted that recently, many short  stories and novels of the second type have appeared on the  market.    Naturally, writers will counter by saying that ""my intention  in portraying the evils in society is to help improve society.""  I don't want to waste time arguing but would simply like to cite  an observation made by a well-known aesthetician: ""Distortions  of reality and the truth certainly follow propagating unethical  principles and lead to nullifying what is beautiful. Even though  this may not be the intention of the writer, refusing to portray  social life as it is is a defense for base instincts, a  beautification of many evils in the hottest selling  publications, and a manifestation of what is called serving mass  literature."" (Avener Ziss, ""Elements d'Esthetique Marxiste,""  Progress Publishing House, 1977, page 60]    This phenomenon has existed in literary circles recently.  Without going into too much detail, I will limit my thought to  two works, ""Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien"" [The Upright Murderer] and  ""Noi Buon Chien Tranh.""    After finishing ""Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien,"" I felt as if I  had  read a work steeped in the philosophy of ""L'homme Revolte"" [The  Rebel] by Albert Camus, ideas that he wanted to convey to  European youths following the world war. According to Camus, man  seeks the exalted in revolt, because this is the task of the  ""present"" of everyone. This is existentialism. In our society  today, not all murderers can be viewed as upright people. Isn't  there another way of revolting if we still believe in the system  and place ourselves among the people of the system? In the old  society, there may have been upright murderers. Such as Chi  Pheo, whom Thi Mo viewed as ""at times being as mild as a dove""  but who later stabbed Ba Kien to death before killing himself.  In the story ""Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien,"" the system has never  rejected the main character's position as a human being. He has  never suffered injustices as great as those mentioned in the  press for so long without anything being done. Or we could ask  any elderly cadre who left home after 23 September 1945. They  could tell several stories about their old homes (the homes of  their parents or homes that they purchased being leaving), which  they have not demanded be returned to them. Instead, with  confidence in the system that they helped build with their sweat  and blood, their ""revolt"" has followed a different course. No  one has become a murderer. Instead, various medals are pinned on  their chests.    I would also like to say something about ""Noi Buon Chien  Tranh."" The great emotions that the author wanted to portray are  contained in the final section. Absurdly, ""during the  Vietnamese-American war, people shared the same fate with ups  and downs, victories and defeats, happiness and suffering, death  and life."" (page 281)    After finishing the book, I thought about a number of the  works of the great existentialist Jean Paul Sartre and his  arguments about the ""nausea"" of human existence.    The materialistic philosophers of Marxism-Leninism have  commented a lot on existentialism. Here, I will simply quote  Jules Romains, a very progressive writer: ""In taking up arms in  war, no one can say that he is a victim or that he is naive or  uninvolved."" Thus, people must think hard before deciding  whether to desert or enlist. Desertion? The person will lose  honor among people of his own generation and others in his  native village, and he may even lose his loved ones. Thus, he  must elect to ""enlist,"" hoping for the day there is peace. After  the war, desires may not be fulfilled or they may be fulfilled  only partly. Thus, there is sadness.    As a doctor, I have had a chance to attend the ""inventories  of individual assets"" of many northern youths who went to B and  later died of malaria or hematuria. I have read the very private  diaries of a number of these people before the diaries were  turned over to their unit before being returned to the family. I  can assure you that none of these diaries contained any thoughts  about ""the sorrows of war.""    Meeting a number of cadres who were wearing military  uniforms  and handling B-52 bombs in the forests, I asked them their  feelings about past events. All of their views can be summarized  by a poem by the French poet Alfred de Vigny, who wrote a poem  in praise of the heroism of those who fight and make sacrifices  in self-defense: ""Signs, tears, and cries for mercy are all  insignificant."" Or as Goethe wrote: ""If the suffering enables us  to gain happiness, what does the suffering matter?""    Someone will surely ask: How much does happiness cost? My  response is, We have already discarded two layers of ""rock"" that  pressed the heart and mind of Phan Boi Chau his entire life.  Those are the disgrace of losing the country and the nation's  poverty in the eyes of the world. We have replaced that with the  rose of wonderful hopes for the future of the country and men of  humanism.    Are there negative aspects in society today? Of course there  are. President Ho said: ""There is nothing more precious than  independence and freedom."" But because they were slaves for so  long, many people are not yet awake enough to realize that they  are the masters of their homeland and that they are free. I  would like to use the title of one of the novels by Albert  Camus. People mistakenly view themselves as ""the stranger"" in  their own land.    Our party knows that freeing mankind from unjust oppression,  poverty, backwardness, and corruption is very difficult. Thus,  it has called for a resolute struggle by all people. I think  that writers, more than anyone, should be aware of this.     "

Evidence shows that just before her death, the 21-year-old Duerr got in an  argument with boyfriend, Clyde Spontak, about drug-dealing -- a subject of  prolonged friction between the pair that had prompted Duerr to consider leaving  him, Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan C. Lough said Monday.    The heated argument appears to have turned deadly, Lough said, when Duerr was  stabbed to death in the garage of her apartment building at the hands of  Spontak and another man.    The first suggestion of a motive in the killing came as Spontak, 22, and  Cameron Seaholm, 22, a high school friend of Spontak and Duerr who had been  staying with them, were arraigned Monday in Riverside County Municipal Court in  Corona. Both are charged with murder.    Both pleaded not guilty. A preliminary hearing was scheduled in June.    ""My client, Mr. Spontak, has maintained his innocence and is shocked by this  situation. He has absolutely no idea how his girlfriend was killed,"" said  defense attorney Thomas L. Brown of Westminster after the arraignment.    Seaholm has told officers that he stole Duerr's car, but that only after he had  a flat tire did he discover her body in the trunk, police said. They said  Seaholm has told them that he did dump the body in a remote area near Corona,  insisting he had nothing to do with the killing. ""It appears that both of the  defendants were clearly involved in the murder itself -- not just in a  cover-up, as Mr. Seaholm claims,"" Lough said Monday. Investigators, basing  their conclusions on the reports of witnesses, believe that Duerr returned home  on Sunday night, April 16, found cocaine in the apartment, and became upset  with Spontak, Lough said.    ""There was a dispute about drugs being present in the apartment. As far as we  know, there was no violent altercation then . . . but it appears that she was  killed later that night or early the next morning in the garage,"" he said.    Duerr was stabbed 20 times, perhaps with an ice pick, investigators have said.    Police said Seaholm has told them that on the weekend of the killing, he and  Spontak had a quarter-kilo (about half a pound) of cocaine for sale.    But defense attorneys for both Spontak and Seaholm said they have seen no  evidence linking the killing to an argument over drugs.    Told of the prosecutor's comments, Brown said that Spontak and Duerr ""seem to  have been getting along pretty well (in the period preceding the killing).

And Brown, noting that Duerr and Spontak had been dating off and on for the  last 6 years, added: ""Even if he were a drug dealer -- and I'm certainly not  saying he is -- it seems that she would have known that a long time ago -- not  just 2 weeks ago.""

0,FT933-3290 ,"FT933-3290 _AN-DIOCVAAHFT 930915   FT  15 SEP 93 / Florida cancels tourism campaign after murder      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   FLORIDA'S state tourism office yesterday cancelled its domestic and international advertising campaigns in the wake of the killing of a British tourist - the ninth foreign visitor to be murdered in the state in the past year. Florida police said Mr Gary Colley, aged 34, was killed and his friend Ms Margaret Jagger wounded when they were attacked in a lay-by near Tallahassee, the state capital, in the early hours. Ms Jagger was later released from hospital. Governor Lawton Chiles announced a Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,500) reward for information leading to Mr Colley's killers, and he asked the federal government for help in the effort to crack down on crime. He also announced plans to enlist up to 500 game wardens, agriculture inspectors and marine officers to strengthen patrols on major roads. Mr Colley's death follows the killing last week of Mr Uwe-Wilhelm Rakebrand, a German tourist, in a highway shooting in Miami. Holidaymakers are cancelling trips to Florida because of the attacks. Mr Greg Farmer, the Florida state secretary of commerce, said cancellations at hotels and resorts were running at around 20 per cent after Mr Rakebrand's killing, and the latest attack would probably inflict more damage on the state's Dollars 31bn a year tourism industry. 'It is going to be just catastrophic. This is going to have a very, very negative impact,' Mr Farmer said. Mr Ken Fortune, the county sheriff, said he believed the couple had been chosen at random, and not targeted as foreigners. The British and German governments already issue warnings to tourists about the dangers of travelling in Florida, but travel agents in Europe have generally distinguished Miami from the rest of the state, and advised their customers to pick destinations such as Orlando or St Petersburg. Six of the foreign visitors who have fallen victim to Florida's violence in the past year were attacked in the Miami area, but yesterday's shooting took place in the state's quieter northern panhandle. Tallahassee is a quiet town festooned in Spanish moss, more akin to neighbouring Georgia or Alabama than to the brasher Miami coast. Florida's murder rate of 10.7 per 100,000 population, however, is lower than Georgia's and well below the rate in states such as Louisiana, New York and Texas. Mr Colley and Ms Jagger, from Wilsden, near Bradford, in West Yorkshire, were sleeping in their car in a rest area about 25 miles from Tallahassee when two teenagers approached their car and banged on the windows. The two assailants opened fire when the pair tried to drive away. An attendant at the rest area gave police a description of the attackers. About 40m tourists visit Florida every year, and some 17 per cent are foreigners, including an estimated 800,000 from the UK.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT934-12693 ,"FT934-12693 _AN-DJZDHAA3FT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / Israel begins to free Palestinians      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   ISRAEL yesterday freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners at the beginning of a mass release aimed at bolstering the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and winning over Palestinian opponents. However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, cancelled the release of members of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements, after the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip on Sunday by the Hamas' military wing. Both groups reject the peace accord and have vowed to fight against it. Mr Rabin also told a parliamentary committee that 'prisoners with blood on their hands will not be released'. By the end of today Israel plans to have freed up to 700 prisoners, mostly the sick, women, youths and men over 50, as a first step in the phased release of up to 14,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Most of those released this week have been imprisoned on minor 'offences' such as membership of a banned or 'hostile' organisation, demonstrating and throwing stones. Thousands of relatives crowded at the Eretz checkpoint crossing into Gaza and cheered as buses delivered prisoners to their freedom. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza closed stores and observed a one-day strike to press for further releases. The Palestine Liberation Organisation sees the release of prisoners as key to confidence-building between the two sides in talks on implementing the peace accord which resume in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today. The PLO is demanding a much swifter release of all prisoners held on non-life threatening charges and is calling for the release of prisoners of all groups, including Hamas and its leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The release of Hamas activists, however, has drawn a barrage of criticism from the Israeli public. Opposition to the freeing of Hamas prisoners is likely to grow after the incident in Gaza on Sunday and release yesterday of a leaflet by Hamas which called the killing of the two soldiers their 'gift to the peace process' and proclaimed: 'There is no peace between us and the Israelis except in the cemetery.' Despite the PLO's insistence on the release of all prisoners regardless of their political affiliation, Israeli officials believe there is a growing opportunity to drive a wedge between moderate and secular Palestinians, who support the peace process, and the rejectionist and Islamic fundamentalist groups opposing it. Mr Rabin also told the parliamentary committee yesterday that Palestinian attacks against Israelis had fallen dramatically since the signing of the peace accord last month. Attacks in Gaza were down this month to 30, from 60 in September, and in the West Bank to 44, from 59 last month.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Jeanette Hughes, 36, was discovered missing about 9 p.m. Sunday, when visiting  hours ended, said Ross Dykes, associate warden at the women's prison.

Fascist-minded separatists, who have encroached upon the  territorial integrity of Georgia, have provoked an armed  conflict that has been maintained to a significant degree by  external forces. Having temporarily achieved a military victory  in the region, the separatists set about conducting operations  aimed at the elimination of the Georgian population in Abkhazia,  while violating the elementary norms of international  humanitarian law and carrying out the practice of genocide and  ethnic cleansing. World opinion, however, has not given a  proper assessment of these facts.    A special state committee was established and entrusted with  gathering materials testifying to the fact that the policy of  genocide and ethnic cleansing is continuing to be implemented.    The process of gathering facts has already begun. This  special investigative body attached to the General Procurator's  Office, which is now conducting a criminal investigation into  facts of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Georgian  population in Abkhazia, has carried out a huge amount of work.  The materials that have been collected contain proof that  genocide against the Georgian population carried out by  Abkhazian separatists and their associates was planned in  advance.    There exists convincing evidence of a deal between the  organizers and perpetrators of these heinous crimes and their  accomplices, whose ultimate aims are violation of the  territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and the  elimination of thousands of innocent people who have been  condemned to this terrible fate only because they are Georgian  by nationality.    In spite of convincing evidence to the contrary, certain  sides are stubbornly continuing to deny that genocide is taking  place in Abkhazia and are vainly asserting that it is a question  of the ""usual cruelties of war."" Such an assessment of this  concrete phenomenon is nothing other than an attempt to deceive  the world community.    There exists a multitude of evidence indicating that  preparations for carrying out ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia had  been going on for many years. The Abkhazian mass media,  scientific journals, and other sources had been constantly  accusing the Georgians of artificially reducing the size of the  local Abkhazian population. It became all too obviously clear  that the Georgian population was doomed to annihilation.  However, who was to fill that huge vacuum formed as a result of  the expulsion of a group of people numbering more than 200,000?  The answer was received during the course of the conflict when  Mr. V. Ardzinba [leader of the rebel Gudauta grouping] and his  associates publicly proposed to the inhabitants of the North  Caucasus and adjoining countries to the east that they join  their side and fight against the Georgians, promising them as a  reward ""a place to live and citizenship.""    As a result of this treacherous plan, hundreds of thousands  of Georgians were banished from their homes and became the  victims of indescribable physical and moral suffering and  blatant outrages: Their homes and property were destroyed and  their cattle and cars stolen. The treatment to which the  Georgian population was subjected made it impossible for them to  live any longer in Abkhazia as they were facing the threat of  physical elimination.    The results of the current investigation will provide  irrefutable evidence to all the interested parties that the  ethnic cleansing conducted in Abkhazia was premeditated.    Almost immediately after the fall of Sukhumi on 27 September  1993, hostilities between the opposing sides ceased. However,  the investigation has established that the extermination of  noncombatants continued on a large scale even after the  cessation of combat operations; it has proof of this.    There exists convincing evidence that cynical monstrous  crimes are continuing to be committed against the peaceful  population: A great many women have been raped and savagely  tortured and there have been cases of women having their breasts  cut off while still alive. Even these terrible facts would  already be sufficient to press charges. However, one cannot  refrain from saying that it has not only been women, but also  children and teenagers who have become the victims of these  atrocities. The nipples of victims collected by the  perpetrators of these monstrous crimes in matchboxes are the  terrible trophies of these heinous deeds. Greeks, Armenians,  Russians, and people of other nationalities, along with  Georgians, are raising their voices as testimony to these  actions and I am making a statement with full responsibility  regarding these facts.    In order that the world has a clearer idea of the aims of  the  Abkhazian fascists and has a true picture of the tragedy brought  about by their actions, it is necessary, as a matter of urgency,  to direct the attention of international organizations to these  facts in all their cruelty.    According to the testimony of witnesses, there have been  many  cases of innocent people who have been killed having the  following inscription carved on their bodies: ""Don't eat so  much, Georgians. Don't get fat. It's difficult dragging your  corpses.""    It is impossible to read without a shudder the testimony of  witnesses regarding the agony experienced by the Georgians who  remained in Sukhumi after it was captured by Abkhazian  separatists.    Listen to the fate of engineer Nugzar Dzhimsheleyshvili who  worked in the Council of Ministers. His father Varlam  Dzhimsheleyshvili was captured. His house was destroyed and his  grandmother, Babutsa Pipiya, and mother-in-law, Mziya Kalandiya,  were tortured and then killed.    Listen to the fate of the helpless L. B. (for  understandable reasons, I am only using his initials) who was  brutally murdered. One of his students buried him. This  student, whose nationality was Russian, suffered the same fate  simply because he had buried a dead person in the proper manner.    Listen to the fate of 60-year old V. Moniya who hid in his  neighbors' house; he was found and killed.    It is beyond the scope of this document to relate the tragic  fates of M. Mirtsklava, the married couple Kvaratskheliya, V.  Argobliani, A. Gadeliya, T. Gegechkori, Yu. Kvartskheliya, D.  Dgebuadze, S. Kakuberi, and T. Kakuberi-Gvakhariya. All of them  were Georgians and neighbors on Tsereteli Street and, to their  misfortune, remained in Sukhumi after its fall; no one now knows  where they lie.    What about the fate of other Georgian residents of Sukhumi  --  D. Darchemeliya, the Zakradze brothers, S. Karchava, Ye. and Z.  Abramiya, F. Kalandiya, T. Shariya, V. Kvachakhiya, A.  Kintsurashvili, D. Kopeliani, and M. Kvirchkhaya?    Behind each name is a person who, at the end of the 20th  century, encountered the surge of fascism and who was shown no  more mercy than the victims of fascism at all other times.    According to the testimony of witnesses gathered during the  course of the investigation, official representatives of the  Government of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic became the  victims of isolated and group murders. It should be emphasized  that there are a great many such cases of which there is  documentary proof.    Materials relating to the murder of Zhiuli Shartava,  chairman  of the Council of Ministers, and his aides are also relevant to  the question under examination. The evidence gathered during  the course of the investigation has enabled us to establish that  Mr. Shartava and his aides were seized in Sukhumi and subjected  to particularly cruel torture. A postmortem examination has  revealed that, before being murdered, they were tortured in a  monstrous way.    The murder of Shartava and many other senior employees in  the  apparatus of the Abkhazian Council of Ministers was sanctioned  by the same group that provoked the armed uprising against the  Georgian state and its citizens.    The policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing continued to be  resolutely implemented even during the period when negotiations  were proceeding in Geneva. Although the aim of these  negotiations has been to find an acceptable peaceful settlement  to the conflict, they have served only as a smoke screen for the  Abkhazian side, hiding behind which they have continued to  implement their barbarous policy. Instead of supporting the  peace process, the Abkhazian side is continuing to create an  atmosphere of fear in order to hinder the safe return of  displaced persons and refugees to their homes. This is borne  out by the events that took place quite recently in Gali rayon  in Abkhazia.    On 2-3 February 1994, Abkhazian forces, supported by heavy  artillery and tanks, launched an offensive against villages in  Gali rayon. During the following 10 days, all buildings in  Okumi, Mikhumi, Tsarche, Pirveli, Gali, Rechkhi, Tskhiri,  Gumprishe, Konstitutsiya, Kokhora, and other villages were razed  to the ground. According to information in our possession, the  modern ""Grad"" artillery system was used and poisonous gas was  used in the village of Gumurishi. More than 800 houses were  destroyed and hundreds of people taken hostage. The killing and  intimidation of the peaceful population forced people to abandon  their villages and seek refuge in the mountains. Thousands of  women, children, and elderly persons attempted to escape the  terror: They fled along snow-blocked paths, leaving behind them  mothers frozen to death along with their children and old men  and women who were unable to endure the severe conditions  created both by nature and man. More than 2,000 exhausted  people managed to avoid death and find refuge in Zugdidi,  Tsalenjikha, and other towns in western Georgia; many of them  were taken to hospital suffering from frostbite.    We are witnesses to the implementation of the typical policy  of ethnic cleansing that is one form of genocide.    It should be pointed out that the Gudauta separatists did  not  allow UN observers based in Sukhumi to visit the region where  the repressions took place.    Are these brazen actions not an open challenge to the UN  that  is conducting peace-making efforts and even to the whole  civilized world?    During the course of this investigation, the identity of  those who, under the patronage of the Abkhazian separatists, are  carrying out genocide against the peaceful population has been  clearly established. The materials gathered testify to the fact  that the tragedy in Abkhazia constitutes a crime against  humanity.    [Signed] Committee Chairman Professor Levan Aleksidze  This letter was distributed as an official document in the  UN Security Council.     "

After the Muslim artillery had pounded Novi  Travnik this morning, particularly the suburb of Donji Rastovci,  Muslim artillery attacks spread in the course of the afternoon  to other parts of the Lasva river valley. The centre of Vitez  and all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] positions in that area  are coming under particularly heavy fire. Shortly after 1300  the parish church in Vitez was hit. After the Croatian  artillery had retaliated, the shelling of this area subsided,  although it has not completely stopped. At the same time Muslim  infantry forces launched an attack from Sivrino Selo against the  village of Dubravice east of Vitez and HVO positions east of  Travnik. The HVO command in Vitez has reported that the HVO  forces are firmly holding their positions. [passage omitted]    The political department of the Defense Ministry of the  Croat  Republic of Herceg-Bosna, expressing its regret over the tragic  killing of the three members of an Italian RAI Uno television  team from Trieste yesterday and extending condolences to their  families, has issued an extraordinary communique explaining the  circumstances surrounding the killing of the three journalists.    Shortly before 1600 yesterday Muslim forces fired four  mortar  rounds on a very busy street in the western [Croat-held] part of  Mostar, the communique says. The shells were fired from Muslim  positions situated near the Muslim army fourth corps command  headquarters; three people in the western part of Mostar  sustained injuries. In order to neutralize the attack the HVO  retaliated, firing on the fourth corps command headquarters  whence the shells had been fired against the western part of the  city. That was when the three Italian journalists who were  filming at that time in the vicinity of the command headquarters  were killed.    After the Spanish UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] battalion  interpreter had called and stated that the three journalists had  been killed and one woman wounded, HVO troops immediately  ceased fire, the communique says. The bodies of the journalists  are still in a hospital in the eastern part of Mostar, from  where they are expected to be transported by a UNPROFOR vehicle  to Split to be flown to Trieste this evening.    The Spanish UNPROFOR battalion had warned the journalists to  postpone their visit by a few days, but, having joined the  International Commitee of the Red Cross, they came at their own  risk. At the same time two other teams of journalists, a group  of German journalists, a group of Dutch journalists, and two  Turkish journalists [as received] sought permission to visit  Mostar. They had set off for Mostar, but having been warned by  HVO soldiers at the last checkpoint before entering Mostar that  to visit this town would be risky, they gave up their trip and  waited for UNPROFOR to take them back to Medjugorje, Colonel  Antonio Castro, UNPROFOR spokesman in Medjugorje, said. Col.  Castro added that in his talks with the Italian journalists he  had been asked whether it was risky to visit Mostar, and had  replied that to visit either the eastern or the western part of  Mostar was always risky.

0,FT924-2281 ,"FT924-2281 _AN-CLNB1AA8FT 921214   FT  14 DEC 92 / Kidnap raises security stakes in Israel: Fundamentalists who seized policeman demand release of leader      By HUGH CARNEGY      JERUSALEM   THE ISRAELI government is facing its severest security challenge since taking power in July following the kidnap of a paramilitary police officer yesterday by an Islamic fundamentalist group demanding the release of its jailed leader. The kidnapping inside Israel of the Border Police officer came on a weekend when three Palestinians and a soldier were killed in the continuing surge of armed attacks and violent demonstrations coinciding with last week's fifth anniversary of the intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. The government's reaction to the abduction, in the central city of Lod, will be closely scrutinised by the opposition Likud party and its right-wing allies which had already strongly criticised Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, over the recent spate of violence. Qassam, military wing of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement, announced it was holding Sgt-Major Nissim Toledano and would kill him if Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, jailed for life in 1991 for ordering the killing of Palestinian collaborators, was not freed by 9pm local time last night. The deadline passed without word from the kidnappers, who were the subject of an intense manhunt by the security forces. In an interview from prison, Mr Yassin said he hoped the kidnappers would give the authorities more time to respond. The government, however, said it viewed the kidnapping with the 'utmost gravity' and warned the perpetrators against harming Sgt-Major Toledano. Qassam also claimed responsibility for death a soldier in an armed ambush near the West Bank town of Hebron yesterday. It was the fifth such killing by Qassam in less than a week and brought to 24 the number of soldiers killed during the uprising. Hamas, which strongly opposes the current Middle East peace talks, has grown in strength since it was founded by Sheikh Yassin exactly five years ago. In the Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were shot dead and more than 100 injured in clashes with troops yesterday and on Saturday. Another was killed in the West Bank. Mr Moshe Katsav, leader of Likud's parliamentary group, said there was a direct link between the government's relatively conciliatory stance in the peace talks and the rise in violence. But Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said only a political solution would end the violence.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Over and over, numbing in its repetition, a gang member in a car shoots someone  on a street; shoots them dead.    In time, a gang member is arrested. Looking either defiant or hangdog, he is  delivered into the slow trammels of the trial courts. By the time he emerges  from the other end, often convicted and sentenced, the crime has all but passed  from memory.    On Friday night, the ending was different. Swifter. More basic. It had  something of the Old Testament about it: eye for eye, young life for young  life, Ashley Johnson, killed at age 5, for Rance Benson, a suicide at age 18.  The little drive-by shooting victim and the man police suspect of shooting her.  Both dead. Both, it seems, by the same hand.    Rance Benson, ""Little Popeye,"" was on the Los Angeles Police Department's short  list of two suspects in the killing of Ashley, the child shot in the back Nov.  10 as she capered outside at a family birthday party.    One suspect, a 17-year-old gang member whose name is being withheld, was  already in custody.    On Friday night, police went to an apartment in South-Central Los Angeles  looking for the other one. As they were at the door, Benson shot himself in the  head, officers said.    Which image, in the end, was with Benson when he pulled the trigger -- the  thought of a little girl dead in her party clothes? Or of himself, locked down  in a prison cell?    Thedra Cullors lives upstairs from where Benson killed himself. She is as  disgusted as anybody about what happened to Ashley. But she will give Benson  this: ""At least he did have a conscience. It did bother him. He couldn't rest  at all.""    Terrence Hall is 16 and Cullors' son. He had gotten into the habit of saying  hello when he saw Benson coming and going from the apartment downstairs.    ""I just seen him (Friday),"" said Hall. ""I said, 'What's up, man?' He put his  head down and shook it and said, 'Man, I don't know.' He was depressed. He was  like that all week.""    Why? Hall did not know -- until shortly after 10 Friday night.    ""We were in there watching a movie, we heard a helicopter going by. I said  nothing's happening, it's just flying over.""    It did not fly over, it stayed over. Hall looked out the back window and saw  police. Then he looked out the front.    ""All of the police was just running up with guns and everything and telling us  to get back in the house,"" he said.    At 10:04 p.m., an anonymous caller had told police where they could find Little  Popeye.    The two officers sent to Apartment 4 saw a woman sitting on a sofa and asked  her to tell the man inside to come out.    ""Hey, Popeye,"" she yelled, ""the police want to talk to you!""    It was her yelling that name that clued the officers in. They went inside  Apartment 4, and Benson, surely knowing their mission, went in farther; into  the bedroom.    The police backed off and called for more officers.    Benson's girlfriend was with him in the bedroom, Hall said, ""and he pushed her  out of the way and shot himself."" From the bedroom, the police heard a woman  call out, ""He shot himself! Popeye shot himself!""    Police found the suspect dead on the bedroom floor.    In the wakeful hours, after police and the coroner had left, neighbors in the  complex on South Avalon Boulevard stood restlessly in their doorways, talking  about the dead child they had all heard about, and the dead man they all knew.    ""They told me he was just talking about killing himself earlier,"" said Cullors,  ""walking around talking about it all day.""    ""They said he was sad about killing the girl,"" Hall said. ""He was scared to go  to jail, so he just took his own life. Some people said they wouldn't have  killed themselves. But you really can't say what you'd do, if you'd killed a  little girl and you were gonna go to jail and you don't know for how long.""    It was local gang members who first tipped them to Little Popeye's identity,  police said. His death Friday night was what Southeast Division Sgt. Eric  Coulter said is referred to as a ""self solver.""    To the suicide downstairs, Cullors reacted like a mother.    ""I just hope, I just wish some of these kids would think about it.""    In another upstairs apartment, through it all, Linda Cook and her five children  stayed put. Their door remained shut. It usually does. Her children always come  in at dusk, and stay in, she said.    Friday night's incident convinced her she is right, Cook said. Saturday  morning, 12 hours later, did not change her mind, either.    ""I've got gangbangers right now, out in front of the house,"" she said. ""It's a  tragic thing the boy killed himself. But it shows you it's not nothing, being  in a gang. It's his conscience. How do you deal, day after day, with knowing  you killed a child?""    Cook said she moved to the apartment in July and feels ready to move again.    ""But then, I'm saying, where is there to go? I ran all the way to Pomona, and  it's the same thing there. So where can we run to?    ""We have to face up and deal with where we are. There's no more hiding places.""

Eric  Coulter said is referred to as a ""self solver.""    To the suicide downstairs, Cullors reacted like a mother.    ""I just hope, I just wish some of these kids would think about it.""    In another upstairs apartment, through it all, Linda Cook and her five children  stayed put. Their door remained shut. It usually does. Her children always come  in at dusk, and stay in, she said.    Friday night's incident convinced her she is right, Cook said. Saturday  morning, 12 hours later, did not change her mind, either.    ""I've got gangbangers right now, out in front of the house,"" she said. ""It's a  tragic thing the boy killed himself. But it shows you it's not nothing, being  in a gang. It's his conscience. How do you deal, day after day, with knowing  you killed a child?""    Cook said she moved to the apartment in July and feels ready to move again.    ""But then, I'm saying, where is there to go? I ran all the way to Pomona, and  it's the same thing there. So where can we run to?    ""We have to face up and deal with where we are. There's no more hiding places.""

The investigations also revealed that 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, the  terrorist who was killed in a fight with policemen on al-Bahr  al- A'zam street in al-Munib on 4 April, had been assigned by  fugitive terrorist Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al-Jihad  Organization, to lead the organization's military wing and to  act as coordinator between the terrorist leaders abroad and in  Egypt. Dr. al-Zawahiri supplied him with the money to buy  weapons and ammunition in order to carry out terrorist  operations. Organization members were to have assassinated UN  Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt,  but failed due to a change in his route. They had also planned  to assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif.    The interrogation of al-Jihad's military wing members also  indicated that terrorist Siyam had planned the aborted attempt  on the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. For that  operation, he rented a house for terrorists Diya'-al-Din Mahmud  Hafiz, Nazih Subhi Rashid, Ahmad Faruq, and Muhammad Rashad  'Abd-al-Hamid in the Kafr al-Manfa area in al-Haram. He then  persuaded terrorist Diya'-al-Din Hafiz to carry out the suicide  mission, while he personally watched the interior minister's  motorcade.    Members of the organization, including terrorist Muhammad  'Abd- al-'Alim Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil  'Awad, admitted to killing witness Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya and  three others at his car showroom in Shibin al-Qanatir on 4  February. He was murdered for reporting to the police on their  terrorist colleague Sayyid Salah. Salah was sentenced to death  in connection with the assassination attempt of Prime Minister  Dr.'Atif Sidqi. They also admitted to placing an explosive  device at al-Jazirah Youth Center in 1993 so it would detonate  during a training course of State Security Intelligence  officers, and to killing their dissident colleague 'Adil Anwar  in Saray al-Qubbah area.    The investigations revealed that terrorist Siyam had been  using seven stolen cars to move around in and to pass  instructions to organization members. A report by the criminal  laboratory identified the weapons found in possession of the  terrorists as those used in the Shibin al-Qanatir terrorist  operation, in which Sayyid Abu-Yahya and three others were  killed and a police officer, who chanced to be in the showroom,  was injured. The investigations showed that terrorist 'Adil  Siyam had received funds from abroad, for a receipt from a  foreign currency transfer in Italy was found. The organization  members used to disguise themselves in police, armed forces, and  municipality workers' uniforms to place the explosive devices in  strategic areas. The investigations revealed that terrorist  'Adil Siyam and his brother-in-law Muhammad Khalifah had trained  the terrorists how to prepare explosives. The organization  members led prosecutors to nine dens in al-Basatin, al- Munib,  al-Qalubiyah, where weapons and ammunition had been stored, as  well as an underground tunnel which led to Bilbays [in al-  Sharqiyah Governorate].

Innocent  people, blameless civilians riding a civilian bus were murdered  on their way from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. Murder is murder, and I  repudiate this in no uncertain terms. Even if I ignore  everything that happened before, murder is murder. Yet we  should all remember that both sides are paying with precious  blood. What started with the Hebron massacre and continued in  'Afula and in Hadera and Jericho today should motivate us all to  prevent murderers from both sides from achieving their one and  only purpose -- harming the peace process and the chance for  compromise between the two nations. [passage omitted]    I see no option other than sitting down and completing the  agreement as soon as possible, in order to reduce the level of  violence and terror to a minimum.    As for condemnation, it must come from both sides. As I have  condemned today's event, I expect to hear a condemnation of what  happened in Jericho today; of the cold-blooded killing yesterday  of a pregnant woman in al-Jib; of the appalling demolition of a  house belonging to a senior PLO official in Ramallah, which was  also intolerable, although no one was hurt. Appalling things  happen on both sides, and they merit a second look even when  they are carried out by the authorities.    [Friedman] Dr. al-Tibi, we ran a seemingly astonishing  report this morning about an ongoing dialogue in Gaza between  the moderate, peace-seeking Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], which is usually seen as an enemy of peace. There is  talk of cooperation when autonomy is implemented there. Can you  confirm it?    [Al-Tibi] Local-level meetings have been held in Gaza  between people from all elements. The purpose of these meetings  was to avert conflicts and bloodshed among Palestinians in the  Gaza Strip. No one expects the Palestinians to start killing  each other, and therefore the statement issued today by one of  the Hamas leaders, saying they will respect and defend the  Palestinian police, is a step in the right direction. I welcome  it.    [Friedman] Except that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is not a party  to this dialogue.    [Al-Tibi] There are clear discrepancies between the stands  of the Palestinian leadership, namely the PLO, and Hamas, on the  political process. It is no secret that the PLO favors  continuing the political process, while Hamas is opposed to it  and is even fighting it.    [Friedman] Will the Palestinian police and the Palestinian  security services relentlessly fight the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  peace opponents?    [Al-Tibi] Whenever I hear people call for a Palestinian  civil war, I reject it categorically.    [Friedman] A relentless struggle is a determined fight  against those who are out to kill you too, not just me.

Virgil Byers, 28, of Los Angeles, was found guilty of two counts of  second-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon by a  Superior Court jury of six men and six women.    However, Byers was acquitted of first-degree murder and attempted murder  charges stemming from the same shootings.    Jurors also acquitted Byers of special circumstance allegations that would have  made him eligible for a death sentence if he had been convicted of first-degree  murder.    Byers, scheduled to be sentenced May 29, faces a maximum prison term of 30  years to life for the murders and an additional 20 years for the assault  charges.    Byers' case became one of the oldest criminal trials to wend its way through  the courts in Los Angeles County largely because he succeeded in delaying his  trial over the years by switching lawyers.    ""It's about time,"" Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren Naiman said of the guilty verdicts.  ""The victims died eight years ago. Their families sit in utter amazement that  the system could drag on this long.""    Byers was convicted of the murder of a rival gang member, Cornelius Harris, who  was killed by shots fired from a passing car while a passenger in another  vehicle on May 3, 1982. The slaying occurred in Southwest Los Angeles.    Another rival gang member was wounded in the attack. Naiman said Byers was  either the gunman or the driver of the car in the assault.    Minutes later, Byers fired into a second car, killing a 17-year-old girl, Jody  Hayes, and wounding two other rival gang members, prosecutors said.    Defense attorney Joel Isaacson argued at the trial that Byers was under the  influence of PCP when he telephoned police three months after the shootings and  confessed.    Isaacson is the sixth attorney to represent Byers since his arrest in August,  1982.    He was appointed to represent Byers in March, 1988, over the objections of  Naiman, who argued that Byers kept changing defense attorneys as a  trial-delaying tactic.    ""This is a case where the defendant controls the system, not where the system  controls the defendant,"" Naiman said at the time.    Naiman said all of Byers' previous attorneys were relieved of the case because  of conflicts Byers claimed he had with them.    Byers' fifth attorney, Lee Brewster, was taken off the case on grounds that he  could not adequately defend Byers because of threats he had received. Brewster  did not say who made the threats.    Byers finally went on trial in late 1987, but a mistrial was declared in  January, 1988, when jurors deadlocked 11-1 in favor of conviction. He was then  retried.    ""Mr. Byers wanted to test the system,"" Naiman said. ""He always wanted to test  the system. And now he has his result.""    Byers was manacled during the trial because of his propensity for violence,  Naiman said.

It said that reported police instructions to 'shoot to kill' militants who resist the security forces 'looks like an official licence to kill with impunity.' In a statement which also condemned arbitrary killing by Islamic groups, Amnesty said: 'The human rights situation in Egypt has suffered a serious deterioration' in the past year.

From Associated Press      LONDON      Gale-force winds struck Western Europe on Monday, tearing down roofs and power  lines, disrupting transportation on land, sea and air and killing at least 35  people.    Winds were clocked at 100 m.p.h. at Aberporth along the Scottish border, while  Leeds in central England reported winds up to 98 m.p.h.    It was the second major storm to strike Europe this year.

Twelve deaths were reported in Britain, seven in West Germany and two in East  Germany, five in Belgium, seven in France and one each in Ireland and the  Netherlands.    The dead included a driver whose double-decker bus hit a fallen tree, an  elderly man killed by a falling chimney and an elderly woman struck by a slate  blown from a roof, police and rescue workers said.    A policeman on patrol in suburban Brussels was killed and a colleague was  injured when a tree was blown onto their car. In northeastern Damme, Belgium,  the roof of the tourism office collapsed, killing one worker and injuring  another. Two people died when their home collapsed in Bekkevoort, Belgium. A  motorist was also killed by a tree in Embourg near Liege.    In Hamburg, West Germany, a 76-year-old woman was killed when winds pushed her  in front of a moving car. In France, a 3-year-old girl was killed by a falling  branch in Avesnes sur Helpes.    Police imposed a 50-m.p.h. speed limit in some areas in Britain, and the  Automobile Assn. advised motorists to stay home.    The winds disrupted ferry service between Ireland and Wales, as well as between  the British mainland and the Isle of Wight and Northern Ireland.

In the opinion of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, ""the president's  speech signifies, to some extent, a new stage in the development  of intra- state relations: the Russian parliament received for  the first time a presidential message called upon to give  guidelines in political, economic and social construction for  1994"".    ""Legislators,"" the TRUD newspaper notes, ""were waiting for  the president's response to a decision taken by the lower house  to pardon members of the state emergency committee (eds: they  attempted an abortive coup in august 1991) as well as people  involved in riots on May 1, 1993 and ringleaders of the coup in  September-October 1993.    ""But Yeltsin refrained from a direct appraisal. However, his  speech contained the following idea: you can display mercy only  if it does not contradict rules of law and morality.""    ""After reading the presidential message,"" the PRAVDA  newspaper writes, ""one is apt to ask the following question: is  the country really changing the political, social and economic  course in the interests of the majority of Russians or has Boris  Yeltsin launched an election campaign for a new term of the  presidency with his speech?""    The message, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes, ""had  to  contain specific strategic plans of the president. However, the  tradition of former reports on guidelines"" which general  secretaries of the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union  liked to deliver, remained.    ""Mr. Yeltsin limited himself to the enumeration of existing  problems and general phrases on what direction should be taken  to resolve them.""    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper examines reasons for the  arrest of CIA agent Aldrich Hazen Ames and his wife Maria del  Rosario by FBI officers, to which American television was  invited.    ""Russia acted more confidently in the international arena in  the recent past,"" the newspaper stresses. ""Our diplomatic  success in Bosnia and Herzegovina evidently exhausted the U.S.  Administration's patience: Americans were snubbed there.    ""Therefore, Ames's scandal broke out exactly at this time.  It is precisely at this time that Washington wants to stop  Moscow and to remind it who is master in the world.    ""In good old times when a Western power fell into fits of  hysteria about Soviet spies, Moscow replied with the principle  of 'tit for tat': arrest for arrest, expulsion for expulsion.    ""Even Mikhail Gorbachev acted the same way at the beginning  of his rule. Later, political will weakened. Then, the Soviet  Union collapsed. If Russia wants to display firmness, spies can  be found in Moscow too.""    TRUD runs its own material on the state's delays with  payment  of wages. The newspaper notes that ""the Russian Statistics  Committee reported: wage arrears more than doubled in january,  totalling a sky-high sum of 1,681.3 billion roubles. Over 30,000  enterprises in industry and agriculture did not pay wages and  salaries to their employees.""    The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper forecasts the dollar's  exchange rate to the rouble in 1994. The newspaper believes that  the dollar's rate will reach 2,650-3,190 roubles by the end of  the year.    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper prints a sensation that a  Russian scholar designed an instrument for liaison with...  Ghosts. ""It would seem that talk about miracles is out of  question in our era of pragmatism and scientific discoveries.       ""But actualities of life beat our imagination. In any case,  Gennadiy Markov of Novosibirsk invented an instrument for  liaison with a supreme outer space intellect and carriers of its  information -- ghosts.""    St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak sent a proposal to  Finnish Housing Minister Pirjo Rusanen: To complete the  establishment of a joint stock society in the shortest possible  time in order to implement a joint housing project in St.  Petersburg -- ""Northern Valley-Pargolovo"".    The project is worth 15 billion Finnish marks and will be  financed with credits from international banks and personal  savings of future condominium owners, reports the VECHERNYY  PETERBURG newspaper.

The  victims were taken from a church at Nyamirambo where over 190  had taken refuge. Government troops and militias attacked the  church with machine guns and grenades. The 170 people were  mainly Tutsis who were forced into trucks and taken for  slaughter.    The continued killing of innocent civilians by government  forces is an indication of the refusal by the government to  accept conditions given by the Rwandan Patriotic Front for  cease-fire negotiations.

Citizens, men and women. Following the conclusion of the  presidential and legislative elections campaign, polling begins  on 20 March, the anniversary of Independence Day. In the  context of my own following up of the electoral campaign and  preparations for polling day, I noticed two things:    First, some political parties have designated only a few  monitors in polling stations despite the fact that we extended  the official deadline by 24 hours for them. What is regrettable  is that they have not remedied the situation.    As for the second matter, for which municipalities and  sub-municipalities are responsible, it concerns the distribution  of voting cards. I gave firm instructions that citizens be  informed of the need to register their names in the electoral  lists, and to enable them to ascertain this registration in the  reviewing period so as to avoid any mistake, overlooking or  omission. I also ordered that they be given enough time beyond  the registration deadline to register and remedy the situation.  Furthermore, I instructed the relevant authorities on the  municipal and sub-municipal level to be careful to prepare the  voter registration cards properly, so as to avoid all types of  mistakes with names and addresses, and to make sure that it is  sent or handed to them within the deadline, before voting  starts. It has come to my attention that some voters have not  received their cards either because their names are not on the  lists -- in spite of their assurance that they had registered  their names previously -- or because of a mistake with the names  and addresses, or merely because of a failure in distribution.    Cases like this contradict our desire to enable everyone who  has the right to take part in the elections to carry out that  right, which is guaranteed in the constitution and the law. It  also does not give a positive image of the work of the  municipalities -- which I have always reaffirmed are the first  school for democracy, and for the development of the civic  spirit, and for the kindling of the sense of citizenship in the  nation -- in addition to it hurting the image of the  administration in the mind of the citizen.    I place full responsibility for any failure, if this is  proved to be the case, on the municipal leaders and their  general secretaries. To avoid such a situation, I have given  instructions to the Interior Ministry to take note of this  matter in the time remaining before the beginning of voting by  taking the necessary measures to enable all voters to receive  their cards.    Fellow citizens, to vote is not a mere formality nor is it  an  obligation, but it is a patriotic duty and a civil right  represented by the casting your vote in favor of whoever you see  as eligible to represent you at the House of Deputies. It is  also a right and a duty to underline the involvement in and  positive response to the national cultural project -- a large  part of which we have accomplished -- and a great deal is  expected from it due to the legitimate aspirations and the  challenges which we should overcome with God's help.    The joined daily effort to which we adhered as a principle  and a value, begins from the voting process itself. To let our  people practice this responsibility, having reached a high  degree of maturity, rationality, and eligibility for an  organized and developed political life, the administrative  bodies should facilitate the performance of this duty and the  practice of this right to everyone by providing them with the  legal means namely the electoral card.    It is, at the same time, the main precondition for the  involvement of everyone with renewable impetus, sincere resolve,  and a high spirit of responsibility in the new take-off with  which we are preparing our country to occupy the highest status  in continuation of what we started on 7 November [1987].    Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you.     "

The population is very worried about this political and tribal  genocide perpetrated by the MPLA-PT. We will give further  details later on. [end recording]    The central hospital of the city of Bie [Cuito] has been  burning since 1300 yesterday, when incendiary and chemical bombs  were dropped by Jose Eduardo dos Santos' aircraft. The  residents, who are tired of war, request the international  community to help end this hideous MPLA-PT massacre of  defenseless civilians, in which children and women suffer the  most as a result of the Futungo de Belas absurdity.    The central city of Bie is suffering violent clashes, and  yesterday evening considerable blood was shed. The main targets  of Eduardo dos Santos' organizations are [word indistinct] and  Hotel Cuito, where attacking People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] are losing lethal materiel, as well  as its best commanders and a high number of soldiers. Jardim  Prata reports:    [Begin Prata recording] Over the past 48 hours, the glorious  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] counterattacked  MPLA soldiers and killed 57 FAPLA soldiers, including four  officers, an unidentified lieutenant colonel and three majors  named Lito, Joao, and Pedrito, respectively the commanders of  the first and second FAPLA battalions [as heard]. UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] forces  captured 21 AK-47 weapons, 11 RPG-7's, 11 PKM submachine guns  with 40 ammunition belts, 3 R-4 weapons, and a considerable  quantity of AK and PKM ammunition. Meanwhile, FAPLA are still  [word indistinct] FALA defense lines. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the situation is not very different in Lunda  Norte  Province. The Luanda regime also has its criminal apparatus in  the area and is bent on exterminating the civilian population at  all costs. An Su-25 aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs  over the Luzamba mining post in Cafunfo by 1130 on 31 May. Four  hours later, by 1500, a similar aircraft raided the Muquelele  ward in the Cafunfo commune, as well as the Luremo commune,  killing two civilians and wounding many others, two seriously.    Americo Tomas, Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel  reporter in Cabinda Province, reports that the Luanda regime is  waging an offensive in Necuto, Beira-a-Nova, Chapa, and Ganda  Cango areas, north of the province. Over the past 72 hours, 53  civilians were killed and about 100 others wounded, causing many  people to take refuge abroad. The FAPLA operations are run by  General Jose Pedro, a man without scruples, who in 1991 ordered  the massacre of Choa, which spread all over the province killing  more than 1,000 civilians.    In view of yet another MPLA military offensive, FALA's  command in Cabinda yesterday said it would not fold its arms  when lives of civilians are at stake.     "

0,FT932-6105 ,"FT932-6105 _AN-DE3ARAEBFT 930529   FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Distressed governesses - Jane Eyre was the exception not the rule, says Anthony Curtis / Books      By ANTHONY CURTIS   THE VICTORIAN GOVERNESS by Kathryn Hughes The Hambledon Press Pounds 25, 256 pages 'READER, I married him'. According to The Victorian Governess - an informative account of this much exploited member of the domestic workforce  -frequently she did not succeed in marrying anyone. Jane Eyre was the fictional exception, not the rule in real life. At around the age of 40 - the normal cut-off point for enforced retirement, but it could easily come when a governess was still in her early thirties - she became an isolated old maid, worn out by her exacting years ministering to the spoiled brats of the aristocracy or of the newly rich merchant class. She would be put to grass with nothing to live off except her meagre savings, the financial support of her own family and such handouts as her former employers might send her from time to time. Her likely fate was a home for distressed gentlewomen or the dreaded alternative of the workhouse. Much more typical of the conditions and expectations of the average Victorian governess were those endured by sweet-tempered, God-fearing Agnes Grey in the novel of that name by Charlotte's least famous literary sister. We observe Agnes in two equally awful posts before she finally escapes into a happy marriage with the curate (the optimum end to the governess story). It is from Anne Bronte that we receive a full picture of the daily round of humiliation experienced by someone who by birth and up-bringing was a lady but who could never rely on being treated like one. Agnes became a governess at 18 and was, like her creator, a clergyman's daughter, motivated by the spirit of adventure but also by economic necessity. In that respect she was very typical Kathryn Hughes documents the 'plight' of the governess with a great deal of material drawn from contemporary social history, fictional portraits, memoirs of former governesses and advice books for aspiring governesses that abounded throughout the Victorian era. As well as the three Rs the governess was expected to provide her pupils with a rudimentary understanding of French and German, and also tuition in music. To be expert in the latter accomplishments increased her marketability and could help her to command Pounds 15 to Pounds 20 a year for the novice to an exceptional Pounds 80 to Pounds 100 at the linguistic and musical top of the scale. Though she played a key part in a prosperous entrepreneurial society, freeing its adult members from day-to-day parental responsibilities, the governess totally lacked any economic or social clout. However great the demand for governesses might become, it was always grossly exceeded by the supply of new ones coming onto the market. The new governess soon discovered that her status was painfully ambiguous - a gentlewoman, a mother-substitute, employed on account of her refinement and breeding, but just as much at the mercy of the whims of all the family as were the servants below stairs. The most famous governess of the later period - the narrator of The Turn of the Screw - was quite exceptional in that she was given sole responsibility for her charges in a household where her employer was completely absent and where she was able to form an alliance with the housekeeper. The relationship between her predecessor Miss Jessel and the upper servant Peter Quint would have been a most unlikely occurrence.

Sentencing for David Scott Smith, 27, could come as early as today but most  likely will be postponed until early next year, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry  Diamond, who prosecuted the case.    Smith faces 26 years to life in prison for the Feb. 21, 1989, stabbing of  Robbyn Panitch, a 36-year-old psychiatric social worker. If he had been ruled  insane at the time of the killing, he would have been committed to a state  mental hospital.    ""I am pleased as punch,"" said a relieved Gloria Panitch, the victim's mother.  She and her husband, Allan, maintained a front-row vigil inside the courtroom  each day of the monthlong trial.    The Panitches had said they feared Smith would be released in a couple of years  if he were sent to a hospital.    ""It's a big relief (because) he'll be off the streets,"" Gloria Panitch said.  ""We won't have to worry about another killer out there.""    Ending 2 1/2 days of deliberation, the seven-man, five-woman jury determined  that Smith was legally sane and could distinguish right from wrong when he  repeatedly stabbed Panitch at a small, county-operated mental clinic in Santa  Monica.    The sanity verdict came in the second phase of Smith's trial. He was convicted  of first-degree murder Dec. 4.    Smith, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, told authorities he believed he was  killing the ""Antichrist."" The slaying outraged the county's mental health  community and led to calls for better security for counselors who work with  increasing numbers of mentally disturbed transients.    Smith's public defender, Carol Clem, had argued that the ""delusions and demons""  that tormented Smith robbed him of any capacity to understand that his actions  were morally wrong. Two court-appointed psychiatrists testified that Smith was  legally insane when he killed Panitch.    But several jurors said Smith's behavior before the murder as well as  statements he made to police, indicated he understood society's rules but chose  not to follow them.    While the jurors said they did not dispute that Smith is a paranoid  schizophrenic, they decided that his ability to understand rules -- for  example, he followed terms of probation from an earlier crime and sought help  from authorities before killing Panitch -- showed he could distinguish right  from wrong.    Several jurors, who asked not to be named out of fear of Smith, said they  focused on one of his statements in particular: ""I thought I could get away  with it,"" he told detectives after he was arrested.    But they said the verdict of sanity was not easy to reach because Smith is  clearly mentally ill. One juror said the issue almost deadlocked the panel.

Witnesses to the arrests said they believed the four, all men, were of Arab descent. The bomb destroyed the embassy and injured 225 people. Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior minister, said last week that investigators believed a remote control device detonated 100kg of explosives packed in a truck parked in front of the embassy. Lebanon's pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, said it planted the bomb to avenge Israel's killing last month of Hizbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SANTA ANA      In a critical blow to murder defendant David Arnold Brown, a judge decided  Thursday that a jury can hear about the Anaheim Hills man's alleged jailhouse  plot to hire a hit man to kill three key figures in his prosecution.    Gary Pohlson, the attorney defending Brown on charges that he orchestrated his  wife's 1985 murder and pinned it on his own daughter, said the ruling makes his  job ""an almost impossible task.""    As part of yet another failed attempt to get evidence thrown out of court,  Brown took the witness stand for the first time in his 19 months of legal  troubles.    Brown, 37, claimed he ""wasn't really aware of what was going on"" when he agreed  to talk with police without an attorney present shortly after his Sept. 22,  1988, arrest. Brown said he had gotten very little sleep and was under the  influence of medication at the time.    But Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin called the police interview ""about  as voluntary and free as it could be.""    In the police tape, played at Brown's preliminary hearing last year, he denied  having orchestrated the shooting of his wife, Linda, as she slept in their  Garden Grove home on March 19, 1985.    But he did acknowledge telling his daughter, Cinnamon, that she should take the  blame for the killing -- because her youth would preclude a long prison  sentence -- and showing her how to write a suicide note and concoct a drug  mixture to feign suicide after the killing. Cinnamon, convicted in the murder,  remains in prison and is now a key witness against her father.    Earlier in the hearing, Pohlson pleaded with McCartin to throw out of court a  series of tape-recorded phone conversations from early 1989 between Brown and  another former jail inmate detailing their alleged plans to kill Deputy Dist.  Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson, Investigator Jay Newell and Brown's current wife,  Patti Bailey -- another key witness against him.    Bailey, the victim's sister, married Brown after Linda Brown's murder and the  pair lived in Anaheim for more than three years after the killing -- in part by  means of $835,000 they had collected from Linda Brown's insurance -- until  Cinnamon recanted her story in 1988.    Pohlson told McCartin the jailhouse plot only showed that Brown was scared --  not that he had killed his wife -- and that no jury would believe him innocent  after hearing about the scheme.    ""I honestly can't conceive of a more damaging piece of evidence to come into a  case,"" Pohlson said. ""If this comes in, we roll over -- the jury's going to  roll over us.""    The judge conceded it was damaging and added: ""It's relevant. . . . I don't see  any way I could rule it out unless I lost my sanity.""    Lawyers will begin picking a jury for the case on Monday and trial will start  the next week. If convicted, Brown could face life in prison without the  possibility of parole -- but not the death penalty.

Charles appeared to win the hearts of the townspeople as he walked through the  streets of Lockerbie, visited their homes and even stopped in a pub for a shot  of whiskey.      Brief; Wire    "

No casualty figures were immediately available but APS reported 'deaths and wounded' in the operation in the town of Blida on Sunday night and said 'an important armed group had reportedly been neutralised.' The authorities have recently stepped up their battle to crush Islamic fundamentalists, blamed for killing about 200 members of the security forces since last February. Last week, troops killed 13 fundamentalists in a sweep of mountains near Algiers and in two eastern suburbs.  The Financial Times   International Page 3  "

By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Bobbie Owens lived the nightmare of California's worst measles epidemic in two  decades.    Last summer, the Pomona mother was about to have her 11-month-old son  vaccinated -- about the earliest recommended age for measles vaccination --  when he caught the highly contagious virus.    ""That still runs through my head, over and over: If he could have just hung on  for a few days for that shot,"" Owens, a 37-year-old single mother, said last  week.    For seven days she tried in vain to break his fever, bathing him in a small tub  of cold water. Almost as soon as the measles began dotting his stomach, they  turned black from the heat of his tiny body.    Once hospitalized at Childrens Hospital of Orange County, Nathan Timothy --  named after Owens' brother who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- was  heavily sedated, and clung to life for a month.    ""He never opened his eyes again after we got him there,"" said Owens, whose baby  died at the hospital on July 10, 1989. ""It got to a point where all I hoped for  was for him to open his eyes just one more time, so we could look at each other  one more time.""    ""This is not easy for me to talk about even now,"" she added. ""I'd just like to  say how important these vaccinations are. I wouldn't want any mother to go  through what I've been through. Nobody ever thinks they will lose their baby to  the measles. My two oldest kids had them and (the measles) were gone in a few  days.""    The Owens family's story underscores how devastating and arbitrary the measles  epidemic has been for the handful of Southern Californians who have lost loved  ones to a virus that for years seemed a little threat.    Californians have been suffering from measles since 1987, in what state health  officials say is the longest running outbreak in the country. Nationwide,  public health officials say the epidemic is the worst since an immunization  shot was developed in 1963.    Measles outbreaks have been reported in at least 23 states this year, and the  number of reported cases is running 70% ahead of last year's record pace,  health officials said.    Before 1963, most American children caught the measles.    The vast majority of measles victims recover without specific treatment beyond  fever-reducing medicines and liquids. But in some cases, complications develop,  including vomiting, dehydration, pneumonia and encephalitis, and sometimes  patients die.    For reasons that are unexplained, there have been a higher percentage of  serious complications and deaths in the current California epidemic than in  previous epidemics in the state. California's measles outbreak has been  compared by one national health official to that of a Third World nation.    In Orange County this year, measles has struck 141 people, killing two -- a  7-month-old Santa Ana boy and an 10-month-old Anaheim girl. Both children were  too young to be immunized, say health officials, who recommend vaccinations at  12 months.    In Los Angeles County, health department officials say that measles have struck  1,500 people this year, killing six. The dead are a 43-year-old, a 29-year-old,  a 16-year-old, a 10-year-old cancer patient, and two children less than 3 years  old. Statewide, the measles have afflicted 1,800 people, killing 24.    Poor, inner-city children of preschool age -- primarily Latinos -- have been  hit hardest by the epidemic. Lack of government funding has crippled efforts by  public health officials to curb the outbreak, also known as red measles or  rubeola.    Surveys indicate that as many as 30% of California's children -- and 50% of  minority children -- have not been vaccinated by age 2. Pediatricians generally  advise inoculating babies at 12 to 15 months and again when they reach  kindergarten age.    So Bobbie Owens was ahead of schedule when she made a mid-June appointment last  year for Nathan's measles shot. Separated from her children's father, she was  living on state aid and having her medical bills paid by Medi-Cal.    ""He had just started learning to walk, saying a few words, like 'Mama,' and  'Dada' and 'Digga Digga.' All those baby goo-goo noises,"" Owens said during an  interview at her Pomona apartment. She did not know that measles vaccinations  do not always take in children less than a year old.    In a way, Owens had already lost one son -- to Los Angeles gangs. When her  eldest son, Terrell, was 13 and began saluting his junior high pals with gang  signs, Owens feared that the peer pressure to join would be too great for a  teen-age boy with no big brother or father at home. So she sent him to live  with his grandparents in Louisiana. He would never see his only brother.    These and other thoughts filled her head as she sat beside Nathan's hospital  crib each day, 15 or 20 hours sometimes, talking and cooing to her baby.    ""They kept telling me there was nothing I could've done. But still, you  wonder,"" Owens said. Her 10-year-old daughter, Lacreshia, a second mother to  Nathan, has been devastated, too. She sometimes wanders out of the room when  Nathan's name comes up. She will only occasionally mention missing her brother.    Owens and her family have handled the ordeal by going to church frequently.  There are plenty of pictures of Nathan around their apartment, among the other  family photographs and an illustration of the Last Supper.    ""I couldn't have got through this without praying,"" Owens said. ""I have to  think that for some reason this was meant to be.""      Photo, Bobbie Owens holds toy of 11-month-old son, Nathan Timothy, who died of  measles. Daughter Lacreshia, 10, works on school project.

Prosecutors attacked the new statement as coerced and meaningless.    Von Staich, who a jury found was justified in escaping from Orange County Jail  because he feared for his life, is also seeking to overturn the murder that put  him in jail in the first place.    In appealing for a new trial earlier this month, Von Staich submitted the new  statement from Cynthia Topper that would appear to support Von Staich's  contention that he acted in self-defense in killing her husband, Robert Totter,  on Dec. 7, 1983.    But this week, investigators with the district attorney's office interviewed  Cynthia Topper themselves and said they heard a different story.    The investigators said that Topper denied the alleged recantation as ""all lies""  and that Von Staich or his investigators may have somehow coerced the woman  into signing the declaration. She suffered severe brain damage when Von Staich  attacked her after the shooting, prosecutors said.    ""We don't believe it is true,"" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard King. ""It's  totally inconsistent with the facts that came out at Von Staich's trial."" He  declined to provide access to investigators' taped interviews with Topper, and  she could not be reached for comment.    ""This woman is a very confused and vulnerable victim,"" King said. ""Because of  him, she now has the mental capacity of a fifth-grader, and this is just  another example of his capitalizing on his brutality to victimize her yet  again.""    Von Staich, 32, was convicted of breaking into the Toppers' Santa Ana home in  1983 and shooting and killing Robert Topper, 29. Von Staich then repeatedly  beat 25-year-old Cynthia Topper, his former girlfriend, with a claw hammer,  sending her into a coma that required brain surgery.    Sentenced to 37 years to life in the attack, Von Staich escaped from Orange  County Jail in January, 1986. But last week, a jury astounded county officials  by finding that Von Staich was justified in his escape because he was beaten by  jail guards and had to flee for his life.    Von Staich has already been turned down by the 4th District Court of Appeal in  Santa Ana on an earlier motion for a new murder trial. But in papers filed Feb.  6 with the court, he urged yet another reconsideration of his case based on the  allegedly new evidence from Topper.    Topper was not called to testify at Von Staich's trial because of a memory loss  caused by her beating. But in the signed declaration that Staich gave the  court, Topper said that she invited Von Staich to her house that night to pick  up some old clothes and that her husband, Robert Topper, in fact, provoked the  attack by threatening to kill Von Staich.    Topper's declaration ends: ""My conscience has been bothering me real bad, so I  just want everyone to know the truth about the night of Dec. 7, 1983.

0,FT942-14299 ,"FT942-14299 _AN-EDUD3ABKFT 940421   FT  21 APR 94 / House hangs tough on crime bill      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   The House of Representatives is expected to complete its version of a crime bill today after a week of debate on the right blend of punishment and prevention. In an election year in which crime has soared to the top of many voters' list of concerns, most members of Congress have preferred to err on the side of toughness. They even voted to ban weightlifting equipment from federal prisons. Already, the House has voted to reject measures to streamline the appeals process for prisoners facing a death sentence - which opponents said would actually allow prisoners to drag out their appeals for longer - as well as an attempt to substitute life in prison for all the death sentences in the bill. The appeals overhaul would generally have allowed prisoners to make one appeal to the federal courts within a year of exhausting their state appeals. It would thus overturn the effect of some recent Supreme Court decisions which have limited the right to appeal to the federal courts on the basis of new evidence or a new legal ruling. The House voted, however, to allow defendants to use statistics to prove racial discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty against them. Statistically, black Americans are three to four times as likely as whites to be sentenced to death for a given crime. Statistically, a black American is more than twice as likely to be sentenced to execution for killing a white victim than for killing a black victim. It has also voted to expand the 'three strikes and you're out' proposal, which would impose a mandatory life sentence for someone convicted of a third violent felony, to include certain non-violent drug offences. Critics feared this expansion of the 'three strikes' measure, which has been endorsed by President Bill Clinton, could dilute its effect and possibly even put the whole crime bill at risk. However, Congressman Gerald Solomon of New York, who sponsored the measure, argued that there was no such thing as a non-violent drug trafficking offence. It is hard for members of Congress to restrain themselves when it comes to voting for anti-crime measures, even when they know very well that they will probably not provide the money necessary to carry many of them out. The version passed by the Senate last year already carried a price tag of Dollars 22.3bn, including Dollars 8.9bn over five years to help local governments hire 100,000 new police officers, and Dollars 3bn to build at least 10 new federal prisons for violent offenders. The cost of the House version has already risen above Dollars 28bn. Although it provides for fewer new police officers, it adds an extra Dollars 10.5bn to help states build more prisons of their own.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS      When you're ready to redecorate, don't put yourself at the total mercy of an  interior designer -- even if you think you don't have a creative bone in your  body.    ""Don't say 'I am not creative, so I can't decorate my own home.' Say 'I'm not  sure, but I will try,' "" says Prof. Morris Stein, a psychologist at New York  University who specializes in human creativity.    Stein says there is no proof that creativity is an innate quality or a learned  skill, but it is known that motivation is a powerful stimulus. Therefore, get  moving; act as if creativity can be increased. It might awaken what is there or  add to your store.    Stein says you can get your creative juices flowing by starting with a  metaphor. Inventors often use metaphors in their quest for something new. The  metaphor of the human inner ear ultimately led Alexander Graham Bell to the  telephone. The Wright Brothers studied buzzards before coming up with the  airplane.    Some metaphors liken the home to a castle, palace, museum, cave or shell. A  room suggested by the opulence of a castle is going to be quite different from  that suggested by a cave, a dark refuge.    The metaphor of a cave might be translated into a bedroom with low light  levels, enveloping window coverings and a bed draped in fabric and piled with  pillows.    People who spend most of their time and energy away from home might prefer  impersonal surroundings such as those found in a first-class hotel --  comfortable yet easy to care for.    For some, home is a place where worldly success can be reflected with  possessions on display, rich fabrics and plenty of room for entertaining.    Stein made use of a metaphor when he designed his weekend home. ""I grew up in a  tradition in which the kitchen is warmth and family,"" he says, ""so I can feed  20 people in my kitchen.""    He says the kitchen is the social center of his home. When friends come for  dinner, they pitch in and help with the cooking because the kitchen encourages  working together while socializing.    Creativity is enhanced by knowledge, so in addition to metaphoric thinking,  Stein advises exploring the marketplace. ""Let your looking stimulate you to  write down ideas,"" he says.    Another way to stimulate the imagination, he says, is to change a noun into a  verb. ""Don't think about the bedroom -- a static concept. Instead, think of  bedrooming, kitchening, dining and instead of a shower, think of the meaning of  showering.""    For example, if the meaning of showering is rejuvenating, you will naturally be  led to think of whether controls are in the right place and if there should  there be more than one shower head.    Not only should spaces and furnishings support your specific activities, you  should also try to involve all the senses in your design. Too often, we  emphasize the visual and auditory senses and minimize touch and smell. Very few  people pay attention to the kinesthetic sense, which is the body sense that  operates when you sit in a chair and it feels good, says Stein.    Stein's views on creativity are shared by Ted Pappas, a decorator from  Westport, Conn., who has been teaching decorating skills for about 14 years.    ""Everyone has an innate sense of style and design about what they like,"" Pappas  says. ""Some have to work a little harder and others are more adept, but anyone  can learn how to decorate a home better.""    As an instructor in adult education courses in interior decorating at the New  Canaan YMCA, Pappas covers how to lay out a floor plan, window treatments,  furniture styles, how to combine furniture and accessories from more than one  period and how to shop.    To help students understand what he calls their well-formed but unarticulated  personal tastes, he has them create a picture book of colors, room arrangements  and furnishings they like.

What could awaken feelings anesthetized by injections of  Israeli deception more than images of innocent blood shed in the  holy place in Hebron? What sanctities do those -- who claim to  be the descendants of Abraham -- believe in while they shed  innocent blood in the Ibrahimi mosque? What act of  international terrorism can be compared with what was committed  by the sinful Zionist hand against innocent Palestinians in  Hebron today?    This is one of a series of similar Zionist terrorist acts  that have continued since before 1948. They will not stop as  long as Zionists continue their arrogance and sin without  meeting deterrence from anyone in the name of humanity,  international legitimacy, or international determination to stop  their recklessness. They will not stop as long these Zionists  continue to see the world's silence about their crimes as  collusion giving them a free hand to desecrate anything, with no  deterrence of their oppression, terrorism, ambitions, and  violations of all noble and honorable human values coming from  anyone.    What is the reaction of the NATO members, who were justly  shocked by the market crime against scores of innocent people in  Sarajevo almost two weeks ago? Then, they issued a warning to  the killers and delivered an ultimatum, and the killers bowed to  the warning. Doesn't Arab blood incite any reaction from them,  or even any feeling of sympathy or mercy? It should not be  understood from this that Arabs are begging for sympathy or  mercy from anyone, or that they are waiting for another  international condemnation or denunciation statement. All the  international condemnation statements have not restored any of  their rights and have not stopped the violent onslaught of  Zionist terrorism and aggression. So far, all the international  resolutions have failed to enable Palestinians and Arabs to  restore any of their rights, because those who control the  international will lack the firm determination to force Israel  to pay attention to these resolutions.    Moreover, rather than employing effective international  pressure on Israel to heed international legitimacy's  resolutions and principles, we have seen acts of collusion  represented by silence or carelessness in order to circumvent  this legitimacy. The result of this is the daily horrible  massacres and crimes Zionists commit against innocent  Palestinians, without concern for values, norms, or principles.    The Israeli Government cannot dissociate itself from the  crime of massacre committed at the Ibrahimi mosque today by  claiming it was the act of an extremist or a deranged Zionist,  or that of a Zionist with any other adjective that may be  attributed to him in order to cover up the ugliness of the crime.    Direct responsibility for this crime, and for any other  crime  committed by Zionist settlers or occupation forces, is  shouldered by the Tel Aviv rulers who insisted, and are  insisting, on keeping the Arab land they usurped, and who  encouraged, and are encouraging, the settlers to remain on this  land.    The Tel Aviv rulers, who fabricated and ignored the facts of  history and geography, rejected the principles of justice and  disrespected the resolutions of international legitimacy, and  considered occupied Palestinian land a disputed land to which  Zionist settlers have more right than its original owners --  these rulers are the ones who planted, and are planting, the  seeds of terrorism that were terribly manifested today in the  Ibrahimi mosque massacre.    We have said and warned more than once that what Israel is  doing in the name of the so-called peace that it is hiding  behind is nothing more than aggravating elements of tension and  explosion, spreading terrorism, and endangering stability and  security in the region.    What happened today is only one part of these elements. This  will continue as long as Israel remains unrestrained and free  from any control that deters its extravagance and stops its  crimes and terrorism.    Will the world wake up and pay attention before it is too  late, before Israel pushes the entire region, by its antipeace  positions and practices, to the edge of an explosion?     "

The number of deaths resulting from overcrowding at the  Jamarat on Monday afternoon reached 270 cases including 6  Saudis, 11 Egyptians, 2 Sudanese, one Yemeni, 6 Algerians, one  Jordanian, 7 Moroccans, 5 Turks, 8 Nigerians, 18 Indians, 6  Bangladeshis, 44 Pakistanis, 6 Indonesians, one Iranian, one  Ghanian, one Afghan, one Dutch, one Mauritious, one Denmark and  143 of unknown nationalities until this date.    The names of the dead persons which were found out until  Thursday have been communicated to the Saudi Press Agency to  carry them through the media both inside and outside the  Kingdom, the source said.    The source said hundreds of thousands of people headed for  Jamarat on Monday afternoon thereby neglecting the instructions  given to them by Mutawifs and broadcast by the mass media over  the previous ten days.    He added that most pilgrims raced to the Jamarat to finish  this final ritual early even before noon and many of them were  carrying their luggage on their backs which led to the  overcrowding, the falling of some and tripping of others in  addition to the haste by all.    Despite the existence of huge bridges built by the state to  facilitate the movement and despite continuous expansion work on  the roads leading to the three Jamarat, the large number of  security personnel around the area and early warnings announced  on loud speakers in various languages, terrible overcrowding  occurs at each Jamrah and lives are lost.    The source stressed that if we count the deaths of a city  with two-million population in 15 days under normal  circumstances, we will find more deaths than the cases which  occurred during this Haj season in Mecca and the holy places.    And if we take into consideration the number of pilgrims who  performed pilgrimage this year, which is more than 1.5 million  people, we will find that the percentage of deaths during this  season was a mere 0.05 percent which is a normal one.    The source wondered what is with those who race to defame  and  doubt everything that the Saudi Government has offered and still  offers to pilgrims every year when the Kingdom has spent  billions and exerted intensive efforts to provide comfort for  pilgrims.    The source said the motives of those who exaggerate the  facts  and figures and wrongly insult the Kingdom because of their  hatred and sickness of the heart which reappears for the  slightest of reasons, were known and so are the sides which  recruit those hired persons in various arenas who will be sad to  hear that the Haj season has succeeded to a great extent, thanks  to Allah, and the Moslems who came to perform Haj have done so  and returned home safely.    The source concluded that for those whose lives were taken  by  God while they were performing rituals to him obediently, we ask  Allah to have mercy on them, send them to heaven and count them  among the pious martyrs.

W. McGARRY, Times Staff Writer      When a woman reporter told Parole Officer Hugh Alcott that she wanted to  interview convicted murderer Raymond George after his release to a North  Hollywood neighborhood two weeks ago, Alcott responded in horror:    ""I think you're crazy as hell if you do. He likes to chop up women.""    The next day, Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger Kelly, who successfully prosecuted  George for killing a state police officer and permanently crippling a college  student with a machete, said he wanted to know where George was living on  parole ""because I don't want to be anywhere around there."" Kelly described  George as ""one of the most dangerous individuals I've ever encountered, a real  clear and present danger to society.""    From the Los Angeles Police Department, which sent North Hollywood officers a  circular warning them to use ""extreme caution"" with George, to George's  neighbors, who were frightened by the cautionary circular after it was leaked,  to those in the criminal justice system who have known him for years, George's  new freedom evokes a common response: Alarm.    It is usually followed by some form of the question: Why isn't he locked up?    The explanation for what happened in the case of George, 36, is both simple and  complicated.    The simple version, as state corrections authorities have stressed repeatedly,  is that the law requires that George be turned loose, under certain conditions.  One of them is that he take a daily dose of a drug that is supposed to control  what a parole supervisor called ""a delicate psychiatric condition"" of paranoid  schizophrenia.    The complicated answer lies in changes in the laws, going back 20 years,  regarding sentencing of criminals and locking up mental patients against their  will. It is those changes that enabled George to slide through the system, the  beneficiary of a series of breaks because of the timing of his case.    The publicity given George's North Hollywood address and protests from  neighbors prodded parole authorities to move him Tuesday to a new, secret  location, which they describe only as a ""staff-operated facility"" where he is  under 24-hour surveillance, in Los Angeles but outside the San Fernando Valley.    George was originally convicted of second-degree murder for the Oct. 21, 1974,  killing of David Jack, 21, a state police officer who was guarding a state  building in downtown Los Angeles. Paroled after eight years and four months, he  was rearrested three years later and imprisoned for carrying a concealed knife.    The killing climaxed a series of four assaults in 1974 in Los Angeles County.  In the first, George attacked a 21-year-old college student with a machete,  leaving her permanently disabled and disfigured, according to police records.    Five days later, when he was stopped by two police officers, he disarmed one of  them and shot him four times with his own gun. The officer survived after  extensive surgery.    Later that year, George was stopped by two sheriff's deputies on suspicion of  stealing car parts, fought with them and tried to take their guns. He was  arrested and released on bail. Fifteen days later, he killed Officer Jack.      Indeterminate Sentence    George was sentenced in 1975 to 22 1/2-years-to-life. Under the system then in  force, George's sentence was for an indeterminate period, leaving his release  to be determined by a parole board responsible for weighing evidence of  rehabilitation against a prisoner's danger to society.    But the system was being revised. Between 1971 and 1978, California converted  from one philosophy of criminal justice, which stressed rehabilitation, to  another predicated on punishment. The purpose was to give parole boards less  voice in determining how long prisoners remained behind bars. Only first-degree  murderers remained subject to parole board discretion, and George's conviction  was for second-degree murder.    Under the transitional system, prisoners such as George were given new, fixed  terms by a sentencing board, but became eligible for parole before completing  them.    George received a fixed term of 12 years and 4 months, probably well short of  what he would have served under the old system, said Pat Kenady, assistant  director of the state Department of Correction's liaison office to the  Legislature. That made George eligible to be paroled after eight years and five  months.    Even though the board had been instructed to give prisoners the benefit of  lower terms, with allowances for special circumstances such as having previous  convictions, ""sometimes it's hard to understand how they came up with these  (new) sentences,"" Kenady said.    ""A lot of people were let out. I don't have an accurate figure but it was  probably a couple of hundred for second-degree murder.""    In the years after the conversion, sentences for virtually all major crimes  were lengthened and the parole board's discretion over second-degree murderers  was restored. But in the meantime, George ""escaped both systems,"" Kenady said.    ""If he had been sentenced after 1978 for that, he would have gotten 15 years to  life,"" Kenady said. ""Today he wouldn't be eligible for parole for at least 10  years, and there would be discretion all the way up. The board could decide  whether he was a danger to the public, and if they decided to release him, now  the governor could intervene.""    That is because the timing of George's case also eluded the strictures of  Proposition 89, a constitutional amendment passed in November, which took  effect this year. The new law empowers the governor to revoke the paroles of  first- or second-degree murderers within 30 days of the parole board's  decision.    That law would not have applied to George's latest parole on the weapons law  conviction, but he would have been subject to it if he were still imprisoned on  his original murder conviction.    Corrections officials say that because his case was handled during the  sentencing ""gap,"" George was allowed to go free on parole on his first murder  conviction, be rearrested, convicted again, sent back to prison and paroled  again -- all during a period when under current law he might otherwise have  been behind bars on the first conviction.    George was not alone in benefitting from what some state correctional officials  now refer to as the ""sentence gap"" or ""interregnum"" of the mid-1970s.    ""We have some real anomalies coming out of this period,"" which created an  entire generation of prisoners who served comparatively short sentences, Kenady  said, including many who figure in controversies about the system, such as  Lawrence Singleton, Theodore Streleski and Archie Fain.      'Confusing Period'    ""The Raymond Georges of this world, the Streleskis, Singleton, the problems  with them all date from that confusing period,"" he said.    Singleton, convicted of raping a young woman and chopping off her forearms, was  paroled in 1986 after serving eight years. Officials had to move him repeatedly  as his location was revealed, setting off protests in one Northern California  community after another.    Streleski served seven years for killing his Stanford University mathematics  professor by hammering his skull in 1978. He left prison saying he felt no  remorse. Authorities said he had been given the maximum term possible at the  time.    Fain was originally sentenced to death for killing a 17-year-old boy and raping  two high school girls in rural Stanislaus County in 1967.    The sentence was overturned on appeal and converted to life in prison. During  the changeover in the system, however, Fain obtained parole dates, provoking an  outpouring of protest, including a 62,500-signature petition. Deukmejian's  efforts to block the parole led to a showdown between the judicial and  executive branches that the courts won in 1983, setting the stage for passage  of Proposition 89.    George was paroled on the murder and assault convictions in 1983. In 1986, he  was convicted of carrying a concealed knife and was sentenced to four years.  With credit for working and for good behavior, he served three years and was  automatically paroled this month.    State law required that George be returned to the county where he was  convicted, said Jerry DiMaggio, regional administrator of the parole division.    His release this month was subject to psychiatric treatment for mental problems  diagnosed in prison. There are indications that those problems extended back at  least to 1985, when shortly after his first parole expired, Los Angeles police  officers found him wandering in the street, naked, with a steak knife plunged  into one of his eyes. He had tried to blind himself, police said, but his sight  survived.      Complex Review System    Again, George may have benefited from timing. At one time, such conduct could  have gotten him committed to a mental hospital. But experts say it has become  far more difficult to commit anyone to a mental hospital involuntarily in  California since the landmark Lanterman-Petris-Short Act went into effect in  1969 with the aim of eliminating past abuses.    Because the law now provides a complex array of judicial reviews of patients'  rights and limitations on authority, it is tough today to commit mentally  disturbed people. In Los Angeles County, judges reject about 20% of commitment  requests, according to the county Department of Mental Health. The number of  patients has fallen from 37,500 held in 10 state mental hospitals in 1959 to  about 5,000 in five hospitals today.    In George's case, a condition of parole is that he take daily doses of drugs  that are intended to calm the urge to violence.    Alcott, his parole supervisor, said a psychiatric examination in prison, where  George was undergoing therapy, found him ""totally in remission and  cooperative."" He said George ""seems calmer today, and he understands he's got  to keep a low profile and stay on his medication.""    Daily supervision by parole agents will ensure that George takes the drugs,  Alcott said. However, the supervision will stop when his parole expires in  about a year.    Mental health officials would not discuss George's case specifically. But Dr.  Paul Grossman, a UCLA psychiatry professor, said the odds are not high that  someone being treated forcibly with the drugs will continue taking them  voluntarily.    Studies show that at least 25%, and perhaps 50%, of young males stop taking the  drugs when supervision ends, he said.    ""The drugs are inherently unpleasant,"" he said. ""They produce a syndrome called  akathesia, a disturbing restlessness, a compulsion to stay in motion which  cannot be easily quelled. At the same time, they make you sleepy, sleepy but  unable to sit still -- a very unpleasant sensation.""    He said they also have side effects, such as tremors, muscle rigidity and fixed  eyes. ""The tongue gets stuck and protrudes out of the mouth and you can't get  it back inside. Your eyes stare upward and you can't make them stop. It  frightens them.""    Also, he said, schizophrenics find it humiliating to admit they have a mental  problem. ""Taking the medication is a daily acknowledgement that you're mentally  ill, a constant reminder of your humiliation. Patients go off the drugs to deny  their illness.""    When George will be allowed to move into an apartment of his own, and what will  happen next, are undecided, said DiMaggio, the parole supervisor.    ""It depends on what happens once the interest dies down,"" he said.

Fifteen days later, he killed Officer Jack.      Indeterminate Sentence    George was sentenced in 1975 to 22 1/2-years-to-life. Under the system then in  force, George's sentence was for an indeterminate period, leaving his release  to be determined by a parole board responsible for weighing evidence of  rehabilitation against a prisoner's danger to society.    But the system was being revised. Between 1971 and 1978, California converted  from one philosophy of criminal justice, which stressed rehabilitation, to  another predicated on punishment. The purpose was to give parole boards less  voice in determining how long prisoners remained behind bars. Only first-degree  murderers remained subject to parole board discretion, and George's conviction  was for second-degree murder.    Under the transitional system, prisoners such as George were given new, fixed  terms by a sentencing board, but became eligible for parole before completing  them.    George received a fixed term of 12 years and 4 months, probably well short of  what he would have served under the old system, said Pat Kenady, assistant  director of the state Department of Correction's liaison office to the  Legislature. That made George eligible to be paroled after eight years and five  months.    Even though the board had been instructed to give prisoners the benefit of  lower terms, with allowances for special circumstances such as having previous  convictions, ""sometimes it's hard to understand how they came up with these  (new) sentences,"" Kenady said.    ""A lot of people were let out. I don't have an accurate figure but it was  probably a couple of hundred for second-degree murder.""    In the years after the conversion, sentences for virtually all major crimes  were lengthened and the parole board's discretion over second-degree murderers  was restored. But in the meantime, George ""escaped both systems,"" Kenady said.    ""If he had been sentenced after 1978 for that, he would have gotten 15 years to  life,"" Kenady said. ""Today he wouldn't be eligible for parole for at least 10  years, and there would be discretion all the way up. The board could decide  whether he was a danger to the public, and if they decided to release him, now  the governor could intervene.""    That is because the timing of George's case also eluded the strictures of  Proposition 89, a constitutional amendment passed in November, which took  effect this year. The new law empowers the governor to revoke the paroles of  first- or second-degree murderers within 30 days of the parole board's  decision.    That law would not have applied to George's latest parole on the weapons law  conviction, but he would have been subject to it if he were still imprisoned on  his original murder conviction.    Corrections officials say that because his case was handled during the  sentencing ""gap,"" George was allowed to go free on parole on his first murder  conviction, be rearrested, convicted again, sent back to prison and paroled  again -- all during a period when under current law he might otherwise have  been behind bars on the first conviction.    George was not alone in benefitting from what some state correctional officials  now refer to as the ""sentence gap"" or ""interregnum"" of the mid-1970s.    ""We have some real anomalies coming out of this period,"" which created an  entire generation of prisoners who served comparatively short sentences, Kenady  said, including many who figure in controversies about the system, such as  Lawrence Singleton, Theodore Streleski and Archie Fain.      'Confusing Period'    ""The Raymond Georges of this world, the Streleskis, Singleton, the problems  with them all date from that confusing period,"" he said.    Singleton, convicted of raping a young woman and chopping off her forearms, was  paroled in 1986 after serving eight years. Officials had to move him repeatedly  as his location was revealed, setting off protests in one Northern California  community after another.    Streleski served seven years for killing his Stanford University mathematics  professor by hammering his skull in 1978. He left prison saying he felt no  remorse. Authorities said he had been given the maximum term possible at the  time.    Fain was originally sentenced to death for killing a 17-year-old boy and raping  two high school girls in rural Stanislaus County in 1967.    The sentence was overturned on appeal and converted to life in prison. During  the changeover in the system, however, Fain obtained parole dates, provoking an  outpouring of protest, including a 62,500-signature petition. Deukmejian's  efforts to block the parole led to a showdown between the judicial and  executive branches that the courts won in 1983, setting the stage for passage  of Proposition 89.    George was paroled on the murder and assault convictions in 1983. In 1986, he  was convicted of carrying a concealed knife and was sentenced to four years.  With credit for working and for good behavior, he served three years and was  automatically paroled this month.    State law required that George be returned to the county where he was  convicted, said Jerry DiMaggio, regional administrator of the parole division.    His release this month was subject to psychiatric treatment for mental problems  diagnosed in prison. There are indications that those problems extended back at  least to 1985, when shortly after his first parole expired, Los Angeles police  officers found him wandering in the street, naked, with a steak knife plunged  into one of his eyes. He had tried to blind himself, police said, but his sight  survived.      Complex Review System    Again, George may have benefited from timing. At one time, such conduct could  have gotten him committed to a mental hospital. But experts say it has become  far more difficult to commit anyone to a mental hospital involuntarily in  California since the landmark Lanterman-Petris-Short Act went into effect in  1969 with the aim of eliminating past abuses.    Because the law now provides a complex array of judicial reviews of patients'  rights and limitations on authority, it is tough today to commit mentally  disturbed people. In Los Angeles County, judges reject about 20% of commitment  requests, according to the county Department of Mental Health. The number of  patients has fallen from 37,500 held in 10 state mental hospitals in 1959 to  about 5,000 in five hospitals today.    In George's case, a condition of parole is that he take daily doses of drugs  that are intended to calm the urge to violence.    Alcott, his parole supervisor, said a psychiatric examination in prison, where  George was undergoing therapy, found him ""totally in remission and  cooperative."" He said George ""seems calmer today, and he understands he's got  to keep a low profile and stay on his medication.""    Daily supervision by parole agents will ensure that George takes the drugs,  Alcott said. However, the supervision will stop when his parole expires in  about a year.    Mental health officials would not discuss George's case specifically. But Dr.  Paul Grossman, a UCLA psychiatry professor, said the odds are not high that  someone being treated forcibly with the drugs will continue taking them  voluntarily.    Studies show that at least 25%, and perhaps 50%, of young males stop taking the  drugs when supervision ends, he said.    ""The drugs are inherently unpleasant,"" he said. ""They produce a syndrome called  akathesia, a disturbing restlessness, a compulsion to stay in motion which  cannot be easily quelled. At the same time, they make you sleepy, sleepy but  unable to sit still -- a very unpleasant sensation.""    He said they also have side effects, such as tremors, muscle rigidity and fixed  eyes. ""The tongue gets stuck and protrudes out of the mouth and you can't get  it back inside. Your eyes stare upward and you can't make them stop. It  frightens them.""    Also, he said, schizophrenics find it humiliating to admit they have a mental  problem. ""Taking the medication is a daily acknowledgement that you're mentally  ill, a constant reminder of your humiliation. Patients go off the drugs to deny  their illness.""    When George will be allowed to move into an apartment of his own, and what will  happen next, are undecided, said DiMaggio, the parole supervisor.    ""It depends on what happens once the interest dies down,"" he said.

David A. Brown, 34, also admitted to police during the taped interview after  his September arrest that he told his daughter how to write a suicide note and  concocted a drug mixture to help her feign suicide after the killing.    But the Anaheim Hills computer programmer denied orchestrating the murder of  his wife, maintaining that he never thought his daughter and sister-in-law were  serious about their plot to kill Linda Brown in March, 1985.      Final Piece of Evidence    The videotape shown Tuesday of Brown's statement to police, what could prove to  be the most damning evidence against him, was the final piece of evidence  offered by prosecutors as Brown's 3-week preliminary hearing drew to a close in  a Westminster courtroom.    This morning, Municipal Judge Floyd H. Schenk is expected to decide whether  Brown should stand trial on murder charges. Because of a special allegation  that Brown had his wife killed to profit financially from $835,000 in  insurance, he could face the death penalty if convicted.    In the interview with police, Brown's own words seemed to suggest that he had a  far greater knowledge -- and perhaps a more active participation -- in the  killing of his wife than Brown had previously acknowledged.    Brown's attorney, Joel Baruch of Newport Beach, conceded that the videotape  could prove incriminating to his client, saying in an interview: ""In any  criminal case, when a defendant talks to a police officer, and there's anything  but an outright denial, that could pose problems.""      Explanations Wait for Trial    Baruch added: ""There are explanations for the things that are said in that  tape, but those explanations will have to wait for the trial.""    He declined to elaborate, saying he did not want to reveal his defense to  Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson.    Brown is accused of persuading his daughter, Cinnamon Brown, then 14, to kill  his wife -- Cinnamon Brown's stepmother -- so he could collect on the victim's  insurance and marry his wife's sister.    On the night of the murder, Cinnamon Brown was found in the doghouse of the  family's Garden Grove home, apparently incoherent from an overdose of drugs.  She left a suicide note, saying she was sorry for shooting her stepmother to  death.    She was convicted in the killing and has spent more than 3 years in the  California Youth Authority facility in Camarillo. After remaining silent about  the case, she named her father in the plot last fall, which led to his arrest.    She initially told investigators that she had not killed Linda Brown herself,  but then admitted that she had pulled the trigger -- though only at the  prodding of her father.    After the killing, prosecutors allege that Brown collected $835,000 from  several of Linda Brown's life insurance policies and, about 16 months later,  married the victim's teen-age sister, Patty Bailey.    Bailey, living in the Browns' Garden Grove home, had been having an affair with  David Brown while her sister was alive, prosecutors say. Bailey faces separate  murder charges stemming from the alleged plot.      Prime Witness Against Father    Bailey is now a prime witness against her husband. She testified earlier during  the preliminary hearing that Brown had schemed to kill Linda Brown, although  her testimony about the murder contradicted Cinnamon Brown's on several points.    Brown was interviewed by police Sept. 22 after his arrest on suspicion of  murder. He initially maintained in the taped interview that he had loved his  wife and had nothing to do with her death. But he later acknowledged, under  sharp questioning, some knowledge of the events leading up to her death.    Brown said in the interview that Cinnamon Brown and Bailey had been convinced  that Brown's wife wanted to kill him, and the two teen-agers wanted to stop her  before she could carry out the plan. Brown said at some points during the  interview that he had not thought that Cinnamon Brown and Bailey were serious  about hurting the victim, but he maintained at other times that he had tried to  talk them out of the plan.      Would Not Stand for It    ""I told (Cinnamon) if something was going to happen to me, let it,"" he said.  ""There's no way I would stand for anything like"" the slaying.    He added: ""If I was going to stage something (like the slaying), I would stage  something a hell of a lot more sophisticated than this. . . . My imagination is  very vivid.""    Nonetheless, Brown said he discussed writing suicide notes with Cinnamon Brown  and mixed a combination of aspirin and baking soda for her to take in order to  make it seem as if she was trying to kill herself.    And, in a conversation with his daughter in the hospital after the slaying,  Brown told her that she should admit to the killing, he said in the interview,  because as a juvenile, she would get only a minimal sentence in a youth  facility.    Still, Brown insisted in the interview with police that his discussions with  his daughter had been purely hypothetical; he did not think she would go  through with the plot, he said, terming it ""a joke . . . a game.""      'I Was Shocked'    ""I was shocked that Linda was actually shot,"" he said.    Yet at another point during the videotaped interview, Brown seemed to  contradict that very assertion: ""I told (Cinnamon that) if she was going to go  through with this thing regardless of what I said, I didn't want to be there.""

Calling the massacre ""a most dastardly and cowardly attack by nefarious  people,"" Punjabi Gov. S. S. Ray declared an indefinite curfew in the area and  ordered police to capture the gunmen ""dead or alive within seven days.""    Police officials blamed the attack on a militant Sikh organization called the  Khalistan Commando Force. Khalistan is the militants' name for a hoped-for  separate Sikh state they would like to see carved out of Punjab, India's most  fertile and once most-prosperous state.    In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's minister for internal security,  Buta Singh, declared the massacre to be ""the biggest in recent times"" and said  that it is ""a very serious attempt on the part of terrorists to whip up tension  along communal (religious) lines.""    The organization targeted by the gunmen Sunday is one of India's largest and  most militant national Hindu groups, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or  National Volunteer Corps.      Martial Arts, Fervor    When the attack took place, the group's members were meeting in a park in the  Punjabi town of Moga, one of hundreds of such gatherings in which the volunteer  corps teaches martial arts and mobilizes religious fervor among India's  dominant religious group.    Police said that a van pulled up to the gathering and half a dozen men began  firing at random. Nearly an hour after they sped away, a time bomb exploded at  the scene of the shootings, killing two police investigators and a bystander.  Later, a second bomb went off in the park but caused no casualties.    In an effort to play down the religious implications of an attack that many  fear could further inflame the situation in Punjab state, where thousands have  been killed since the militant Sikh campaign began in 1982, Gov. Ray tried to  place the ultimate blame on Pakistan, which borders the Punjab.    ""The perpetrators of this ghastly crime are neither Hindus nor Sikhs, but  animals hired by vested interests, principally from across our border, to  create chaos, confusion and division in our sacred land,"" Ray said.    Despite a recent warming of relations, India has often accused Pakistan of  abetting the Sikh militants. Allegations of Pakistani involvement in the  conflict have never been proved conclusively.    After Sunday's attack, however, several analysts in New Delhi speculated that  the massacre also may have serious political ramifications for Prime Minister  Gandhi as this year's national elections approach.    Gandhi, who succeeded his mother, Indira, after she was assassinated by two of  her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, must stand for reelection before the end of this  year, and religion is likely to be one of the key issues.    The National Volunteer Corps represents a huge, nationwide voting bloc centered  in the central Indian region known as the Hindi heartland, which political  analysts say is the key to winning a national election.    Already, the Hindu militants have been speaking out against Gandhi's  government, and Sunday's massacre almost certainly will alienate the group  still further from Gandhi's secular Congress-I ruling party.

Nearly an hour after they sped away, a time bomb exploded at  the scene of the shootings, killing two police investigators and a bystander.  Later, a second bomb went off in the park but caused no casualties.    In an effort to play down the religious implications of an attack that many  fear could further inflame the situation in Punjab state, where thousands have  been killed since the militant Sikh campaign began in 1982, Gov. Ray tried to  place the ultimate blame on Pakistan, which borders the Punjab.    ""The perpetrators of this ghastly crime are neither Hindus nor Sikhs, but  animals hired by vested interests, principally from across our border, to  create chaos, confusion and division in our sacred land,"" Ray said.    Despite a recent warming of relations, India has often accused Pakistan of  abetting the Sikh militants. Allegations of Pakistani involvement in the  conflict have never been proved conclusively.    After Sunday's attack, however, several analysts in New Delhi speculated that  the massacre also may have serious political ramifications for Prime Minister  Gandhi as this year's national elections approach.    Gandhi, who succeeded his mother, Indira, after she was assassinated by two of  her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, must stand for reelection before the end of this  year, and religion is likely to be one of the key issues.    The National Volunteer Corps represents a huge, nationwide voting bloc centered  in the central Indian region known as the Hindi heartland, which political  analysts say is the key to winning a national election.    Already, the Hindu militants have been speaking out against Gandhi's  government, and Sunday's massacre almost certainly will alienate the group  still further from Gandhi's secular Congress-I ruling party.

In a news release, the Armed Forces High Command said the  killings in Raboteau resulted from an alleged act of  destabilization plotted by supporters of President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, who was toppled by the military on 30 September 1991.  According to the Army, this destabilization plot was part of an  alleged scheme concocted by Washington on 21 November 1993 at a  meeting attended by members of the government of Prime Minister  Robert Malval and President Aristide.

Based on information  from commandos who returned from the operation, the communique  confirms that the operation against the enemy forces targeted 15  Zionist paratroopers and infantrymen from the Engineering Corps.    The communique says: When the enemy patrol arrived at the  controlled area, our comrades detonated two explosive devices  that resulted in the wounding of all of the patrol's personnel.  Afterwards, our comrades ambushed the enemy patrol and showered  them with bullets, grenades, and rockets. They took full  control of the situation in which the enemy soldiers could not  fire a single bullet. Afterwards, fatal bullets were fired at  the enemy soldiers who ran away, trampling over their comrades'  heads.    More than 30 minutes later, the Zionist enemy sent out  military rescue teams to the scene of the battle in order to  remove the bodies of their soldiers. The enemy also sent out  its tanks and infantry rescue teams to surround and chase our  comrades. However, a number of antitank and antipersonnel mines  blew up in the faces of the enemy forces, which further  increased the enemy's losses.    The enemy admitted that two noncommissioned officers [NCO's]  were killed and that three of its soldiers were wounded. As it  always does, the enemy tries to hide the number of its losses  for well-known political and moral reasons. Then it attributes  the killing of their soldiers to road accidents and other  reasons.    The communique continues to say: Hours after the  al-'Ayshiyah operation, the enemy radio announced that a truck  turned over, killing two soldiers and injuring three others. It  later announced that three of its soldiers were injured when a  missile exploded by mistake in the same area as the operation.  Hours before that, it was announced that an NCO died of his  wounds.    We, in the PFLP-GC, stress that the enemy's losses exceed 15  soldiers and tanks--which like to kill women and children, to  perpetrate massacres against our defenseless civilians inside  Palestine, and to barbarically shell southern Lebanon and the  camps inside it.    Through the operations carried out in the past few days, it  has been proven that the occupation army is unable to face the  mujahidin on the battlefield and that it quickly collapses amid  the crying and screaming of its soldiers.    On this brave operation carried out by our heroic comrades  in  broad daylight, and in view of the sacrifices of our people  inside occupied territories and the strikes by the national and  Islamic resistances, we, in the PFLP-GC, reaffirm that the  option of confrontation and jihad for the sake of liberation and  of ousting the Zionist invaders is our one only option. We also  reaffirm that the treasonous and capitulatory agreements in Oslo  and Cairo will vanish. Moreover, this will also be the fate of  the one who signed these agreements as this is the fate of all  the treasonous ones in the history of the struggling nations.  The massacres being perpetrated against our people inside the  occupied territories will only add to our strength, solidity,  and determination to continue the jihad until the liberation of  land and man.

You should not be afraid of the enemy,  shortages, and hardship. You should stand against the enemy.  Ultimately you shall survive and the enemies will depart.  [shouts of approval from the congregation]    The enemy only thinks of himself. He thinks of lust, wealth,  status, and mundane matters of this valueless, untrustworthy,  and disloyal world. Divine tradition will not allow them to  survive. World creation is not based on this. The creation is  righteous. We did not create the earth, the heavens and what is  in between them in vain [Koranic verse]. They are wrong because  they are moving contrary to the objectives of creation. They  will, thus, be crushed. You, the Palestinian youth, who went  and carried out that suicidal action in revenge: First, may God  join your soul with those of all the immaculate martyrs of  Islam. [shouts of approval]    Second, we are satisfied with what you have done, and may  God  give some of the rewards of your deed to us.    Third, the enemy should understand what the problem is: When  a desperate person reaches the end of his rope, this is to what  he will resort. How can mankind tolerate injustice forever?  They might tolerate it for a year or two, or 10 or 20 years.  You have been bullying these people for the past 45 years. You  have suppressed them for 45 years. They are human beings and  not sheep to put up with everything until they are slaughtered.    God did not create mankind to put up with tyranny. God did  not create human beings to be feeble. God created mankind to be  an honor-seeking, a justice-seeking creature in search of the  truth. These virtues of mankind will work for him eventually.  But there is a limit to each individual's endurance. There is  a limit to one's patience. When one runs out of patience, the  oppressor must expect to see the consequences of his torturous  deeds.    The United States is making a mistake. The United States'  allies are wrong. Israel is wrong. They are wrong to imagine  that a handful of weak and vile individuals can solve humanity's  plight by sitting around a table to sign an accord. The United  States is committing crimes in the world today. On the one  hand, when people are killed while saying prayers, they play  dead in terms of adopting a stance. Their only response was a  feeble and tasteless move, just to silence their own public. On  the other hand, when this man took action to avenge the blood of  those martyrs by punishing them, they could not wait to hold a  session to condemn this action. Shame on you. They killed  worshipers inside a mosque during Ramadan, and you did not give  a damn. Whereas, when this young person sacrificed his own life  just to demonstrate that we are alive, just to tell you not to  go on with what you are doing and just to stop tyranny and  murder, then you sit and condemn him. [shouts of approval from  congregation] [passage omitted]    Our Bosnian brothers and sisters, and our brothers and  sisters who are the target of repression in Gorazde today -- and  with the United Nations failing to do its routine work -- they  should know that they will survive because they are righteous.  They must learn from history and be a model for the future.  They should continue to resist as they have done so well until  now. May God bless them with his victory.     "

The demonstrators, many of whom belong to a local animal-rights group called  Citizens to Save Our Pets, called on the city to fire a an employee of the  shelter whom they dubbed ""the executioner"" and to investigate the deaths of  animals at shelters throughout Los Angeles.    Department of Animal Regulation General Manager Robert I. Rush, the official in  charge of the city's six animal shelters, said that protesters' charges of  unnecessary destruction of animals throughout the Los Angeles shelter system  were unfounded.    ""If somebody's done something wrong, we'll drop the house on them,"" he said.  ""This is the best animal-control agency in the world. Period.""    Protesters charged that Dwayne Stinson, the shelter's animal-care technician  supervisor, repeatedly authorized the destruction of animals before those  interested in adopting them as pets had time to visit the shelter. Although  protesters did not accuse Stinson of violating any law, they assailed him as  lacking compassion toward animals and called for his immediate ouster.    ""The man is cruel and inhumane, and everybody who is in the movement knows Mr.  Stinson,"" protest organizer Carol Ellis said.    Stinson declined to comment.    Among Stinson's harshest critics Monday was protester Jay Tell, a Canoga Park  resident who charged that Stinson improperly permitted the killing of a stray  dog Tell brought to the shelter in early May.    Tell said he brought the dog to the facility because, three weeks after his  daughter found the otherwise docile animal in their yard, the dog bit a  neighbor while the man was mowing his lawn.    Tell's wife sought the advice of animal-control authorities, who told them that  by law they had to bring any stray dog to the shelter, Tell said. Tell left the  dog at the shelter.    At the end of the 10-day quarantine period mandated by city law for animals  which have bitten people, he visited the dog and was told by shelter officials  that his application for adoption was proceeding normally, Tell said.    Two days later, Tell received a telephone call from Stinson, who said he had  mistakenly authorized the destruction of the dog and apologized for his action,  Tell said.    Gary Olsen, the Department of Animal Regulation official in charge of the West  Valley shelter and Stinson's supervisor, said the department was investigating  the incident.    He said the department acted legally in destroying the dog, because Tell had  waited three weeks to bring the stray to the shelter and because the animal had  bitten someone. But he said Stinson should have contacted Tell before he  authorized the dog's death.    ""There was a lack of communication, and something was done about it  immediately,"" Olsen said. ""We made sure that that will never happen again.""    He said shelter officials had not fired Stinson or forced him to change jobs,  but he declined to comment on whether Stinson had been disciplined in any other  way.    Demonstrators said they will continue to protest daily outside the West Valley  shelter until the city fires Stinson.

The rare bipartisan accord came as a Moslem Shia leader warned of a bloodbath in Karachi unless the government acted in the wake of Tuesday's killing of three Shias in separate shootings.

DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS ARE UP OVER LAST YEAR, THE HIGHWAY PATROL REPORTS.      By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Traffic accidents claimed at least six lives in Los Angeles County over the  Labor Day weekend and caused more than 50 fatalities across the state -- a pace  that appeared to be slightly greater than last year.    By 6 a.m. Monday, police roadblocks and traffic stops in Los Angeles County had  already accounted for 547 arrests of suspected drunk drivers. Statewide, a  California Highway Patrol spokesman reported, there were 2,447 drunk driving  arrests by Monday morning, compared with the 2,240 arrests made over the same  period last year.    CHP Officer Andy Guitierrez attributed some of the increase in drunk driving  arrests to a recent lowering of the state's legal blood alcohol limit. In  January, after a vote by the state Legislature, the legal limit for alcohol in  a driver's bloodstream dropped from .10% percent to .08%.    Some health officials claimed Monday that abuse of liquor over the holiday  weekend also was to blame for the increase in fatalities and arrests.    Alcohol-related accidents and crimes weighed heavy at the emergency room inside  California Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles. One nurse estimated that the  weekend's patient load was 50% higher than on the rest of the year's  already-busy weekends.    ""When you get so many serious injuries, people with problems that aren't as bad  have to wait,"" said nurse Scott Aguilar. ""That means people with broken bones  and bad lacerations have to wait five, six hours before we can even start to  help them.""    Aguilar and other medical officials gathered in front of the medical center's  emergency room to decry the latest loss of state funding for Los Angeles  County's trauma care system and urge passage of a state liquor tax initiative.    ""The way things are going now, the system's going to die,"" said Dr. Michael  Trainor, an emergency room doctor and president of the state chapter of the  American College of Emergency Physicians.    Doctors were unable to save a 30-year-old Upland man who died about 1 p.m.  Sunday in Pomona after losing control of his speeding pickup truck on the  transition road from the southbound Foothill Freeway to the eastbound San  Bernardino Freeway, the CHP said.

According to the detectives, the men had gone to the nursery the day before the  Aug. 3 shooting and told employees that they had an appointment with the owner.  Employees told the men that they were not scheduled to meet McKinsey and that  the owner was unavailable.    The gunmen returned on Aug. 3 and met McKinsey in a secluded part of the  nursery, police said. While discussing a floral wedding arrangement, the men  attempted to take McKinsey's Rolex, then fired on the owner. Fatally wounded,  McKinsey reportedly staggered toward his office and collapsed, still clutching  his watch. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

""I should have known better. I didn't,"" 68-year-old Charles D. Spurrier told a  federal judge just before his sentence. ""I'm just what I say I am -- just an  ordinary guy who can't see how I got myself into this.""    But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts drew a different portrait of the  gray-haired Mormon as about four dozen relatives of Spurrier and his six  co-defendants in the tax scheme listened in silence in a Santa Ana courtroom.    ""These crimes are heinous crimes,"" Letts declared as he railed against what he  described as a tolerance on the part of some judges to white-collar crime.    On the one hand, the judge said, ""this was a scheme calculated to help  criminals achieve their objective without criminal risk."" On the other, he  added, Spurrier duped ""gullible victims"" who believed that they were joining a  legitimate tax-shelter program.    Spurrier was convicted by a federal jury in December of tax evasion, fraud and  helping others file false income statements.    With associates in his Trust Management Group, Spurrier attracted 5,800 people  into bogus and illegal tax shelters. One of his major operations took in $11.2  million in clients' income, then returned $10.1 million of that total in  nontaxable ""gifts"" and kept a fee for the company.    Spurrier maintained throughout his trial that he did not realize what he was  doing was illegal and pointed as a defense to his deep religious beliefs. He  and his attorney, William A. Dougherty, maintained that Spurrier was convinced  of his operation's legitimacy by the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints.    But the jury did not believe him. Spurrier faces a maximum possible sentence of  39 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.    Letts handed out a sentence that fell short of the maximum but exceeded the  recommendation of probation officials. He declined to impose a fine against the  now-penniless Spurrier to go along with his 10-year prison term.    The six other family members and associates implicated in the tax scheme each  received lesser sentences, ranging from a month in jail to several years in  prison.    Federal prosecutor John C. Belcher said he found Letts' sentence to be fair but  somewhat lenient -- especially in light of the sharp rebuke against  white-collar crime delivered by the judge just before sentencing.    ""He prepared everybody for very tough sentences, but it didn't really end up  that way,"" Belcher said.    Spurrier, who remained free on bond, said in an interview after the judge's  decision: ""I think it's a fair sentence. I expected to do better, but I have no  complaints. I'm not discouraged, and I'm not frightened.""    Earlier, in a pre-sentencing statement to the judge, Spurrier continued to  claim innocence, but added: ""I'm not pleading for mercy or anything else.""    Letts said he would give him none, adding that crimes in pursuit of money are  among the most dangerous to society.    Of the defendants' assertions that they were ignorant of their wrongdoing, the  judge said, ""It is not uncommon for people committing a fraud to have a very  high capability for self-delusion, as well as the ability to defraud others.""

0,FT934-6211 ,"FT934-6211 _AN-DKZBKABDFT 931125   FT  25 NOV 93 / Jordan bank deal imminent      By JAMES WHITTINGTON and REUTER      AMMAN, JERUSALEM   Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are close to signing an agreement which will give the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) wide-ranging monetary responsibilities in the occupied territories during the transitory period of Palestinian self-rule. A draft copy of the document gives Jordan's central bank the job of supervising and monitoring banks which open branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It provides for the continuation of the Jordanian dinar as legal tender during the interim period. And it gives the CBJ ultimate responsibility for control of the money supply in the occupied territories and inflation and capital flows. Mr Mohammad Nashashibi, chairman of the PLO's department of economic affairs and planning, says once the agreement is signed within the next few weeks, a joint Jordanian/Palestinian monetary and banking committee will be established to oversee the bank's policies in the territories. This will include CBJ officials and Palestinian economists approved by the PLO. The agreement is still pending approval by the PLO in Tunis which remains nervous about giving too much control to the Jordanian monetary authorities. PLO officials insist the arrangements will be temporary. Mr Michel Martou, deputy governor at the central bank, says it is happy to play the role of supervisor but before the agreement enters into force it must iron out differences with Israel over foreign exchange controls and the convertibility of the Israeli shekel. One of the first tasks of the central bank will be to help commercial banks open branches in the occupied territories. Eight banks operating in Jordan, including the British Bank of the Middle East and ANZ Grindlays, have expressed an interest in re-opening branches closed after the 1967 war. The Jordanian/Palestinian draft agreement stipulates that banks in the occupied territories will operate solely under Jordanian law. It also provides for Palestinian companies in the territories to issue shares on the Amman financial market. An official announcement is expected by mid-December. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have announced plans to establish a mixed-sector Palestinian Bank for Development and Reconstruction in the West Bank town of Jericho. Mr Nashashibi says the bank's capital will come from wealthy Palestinian businessmen and the PLO and will be used to develop housing, industry and agriculture. The Palestinians eventually want their own central bank, currency, and a Palestine stock exchange. But Mr Mohammad Saed Nabulsi, Jordan's central bank governor, recently said in a speech to Jordanian businessmen that such ideas would be unmanageable. Since the announcement of the PLO-Israeli peace accord, Jordan has been concerned about economic marginalisation by both Israeli domination of the Palestinian market and foreign aid aimed at developing the occupied territories to the exclusion of Jordan. However, monetary and banking responsibilities in the occupied territories goes some way to allay these fears. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday hailed the killing of Imad Aqel, a Hamas guerrilla considered the most wanted fugitive in the Gaza Strip, saying this would be the fate of all extremists who try to murder Israelis, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The killing took place yesterday in a shoot-out with troops.   Countries:-  JOZ  Jordan, Middle East.     ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P6011 Federal Reserve Banks.

About 200 workers were inside searching  for material when the Hong Kong-Chinese joint venture factory  collapsed. Ten people are still missing and people at the scene  said five supervisors from Hong Kong were among those still  buried under the rubble.    The injured Yu Xin Printing and Dyeing factory workers, who  asked not to be named, said they had been told to check the  six-storey building for unburnt cloth 10 hours after flames left  it a burnt-out hulk. ""About 300 workers were lined up outside  the burnt building at around 1 pm,"" one woman said. ""Our  manager told us to collect any unburnt material, otherwise our  salaries would be deducted."" A number of workers ignored the  management's order. ""Some of the workers and I were picking up  some of the unburnt cloth on the second floor,"" the woman said.  ""An hour later the building suddenly collapsed and I was  buried.""    The woman, who was admitted to the Zhuhai Municipal  Government Hospital suffering from minor head and leg injuries,  said she was lucky to escape alive. ""Nobody came to rescue me.  I climbed out from the debris by myself. I don't know how many  of my colleagues have been buried,"" she said.    According to Shenzhen Municipal Authority spokesman Yang  Shuiping, 17 bodies had been recovered by last night and the  search for other victims was to continue today. She said the  workers had heard nothing from the Hong Kong owners about  compensation for their injuries although management had sent two  people to visit the victims several times telling them to ""take  care"".    Other workers at the hospital said a Hong Kong factory  manager gave the order to enter the building to salvage cloth  and begin a site clean-up. The woman said: ""Even the factory  fire did not kill anybody. But his order did.""    The spokesman, a Mr Yang, [as received] said of the 158  people hospitalised, 101 were still receiving treatment while  another 15 were in a serious condition.    Yesterday piles of debris from the collapsed factory reached  the third floor of an adjoining building. Smoke still poured  from the rubble despite heavy rain and the fire being  extinguished more than 24 hours beforehand. Witnesses said half  the building was like ""carbon"" and believed heavy rain  contributed to its collapse.    It was the second time in as many weeks that an industrial  building in China's most dynamic region collapsed. A  partially-built Shenzhen factory collapsed earlier this month  killing 11 people. The Governor of Guangdong province, Zhu  Senlin, visited the disaster scene yesterday.    Mr Yang said the government had vowed to find those  responsible for the disaster. He said three welders had been  arrested. The workmen allegedly caused the fire when sparks  from equipment they were using to install fire safety measures  ignited cotton bales. The fire broke out on Thursday in the  factory's number three workshop. No one was injured in the  blaze which was put out by Friday morning.    The Yu Xin factory, located inside Zhuhai's Qianshan Textile  City, is a joint venture between a Hong Kong merchant and the  Zhuhai Qian-shan Industrial Co.     "

By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The defense attorney for accused murderer David Scott Harrison argued in his  opening statement Tuesday that there are more likely suspects in the 1988  killing of Harrison's ex-wife, including the victim's husband at the time.    ""It is true David Harrison was unhappy"" with victim Anne Jenkins because of a  battle with her over visitation rights of their two children, attorney Alan May  said.    Turning his gaze from Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr., who is hearing  the trial without a jury, to the victim's husband, who was sitting in the first  row of the courtroom, May added:    ""But evidence will show that Gary Jenkins had motive, opportunity and the means  to kill his wife. . . . Gary Jenkins was the last person to see her alive,  supposedly, and the first person to see her body, supposedly.""    Furthermore, May argued, there was blood on the telephone used by Jenkins when  he discovered his wife's body and called 911, even though Jenkins testified  during Harrison's preliminary hearing that he didn't touch his wife's body.    May added that Anne Jenkins' father, Harry Wanket, can also be considered more  of a suspect than Harrison. May cited the testimony of a witness to the county  grand jury that he had overheard Anne Jenkins telling a man in front of her San  Marcos home minutes before she was killed, ""We don't need your money anymore.""    That remark, May argued, was apparently intended for Wanket, who had employed  his daughter at his construction company. She quit the job four days before she  was killed on Feb. 17, 1988, a month after she and Jenkins won $727,000 in the  state lottery.    If Harrison were still angry with his former wife over their protracted custody  battle, May said, he could have simply abducted the two children during the  three days he had them in his custody the weekend before her death.    Given that there was no forcible entry into Anne Jenkins' home the day of the  killing, and given that Harrison ""is the last person she'd let in the house, it  must have been someone she trusted,"" May said, again looking toward where  Wanket and Jenkins were sitting.    May contended that the prosecution of Harrison was like ""trying to fit a square  peg into a round hole."" No evidence puts Harrison at the scene, May said;  rather, ""you'll hear plenty (of testimony) poisoning your mind about why they  want him there,"" he told the judge.    Prosecutor Larry Burns alleged that Harrison carefully planned the killing by,  among other things, studying a virtual ""catalogue of murder methods"" in various  books he owned describing how to commit ""the perfect murder.""

By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The defense attorney for accused murderer David Scott Harrison argued in his  opening statement Tuesday that there are more likely suspects in the 1988  killing of Harrison's ex-wife, including the victim's husband at the time.    ""It is true David Harrison was unhappy"" with victim Anne Jenkins because of a  battle with her over visitation rights of their two children, attorney Alan May  said.    Turning his gaze from Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr., who is hearing  the trial without a jury, to the victim's husband, who was sitting in the first  row of the courtroom, May added:    ""But evidence will show that Gary Jenkins had motive, opportunity and the means  to kill his wife. . . . Gary Jenkins was the last person to see her alive,  supposedly, and the first person to see her body, supposedly.""    Furthermore, May argued, there was blood on the telephone used by Jenkins when  he discovered his wife's body and called 911, even though Jenkins testified  during Harrison's preliminary hearing that he didn't touch his wife's body.    May added that Anne Jenkins' father, Harry Wanket, can also be considered more  of a suspect than Harrison. May cited the testimony of a witness to the county  grand jury that he had overheard Anne Jenkins telling a man in front of her San  Marcos home minutes before she was killed, ""We don't need your money anymore.""    That remark, May argued, was apparently intended for Wanket, who had employed  his daughter at his construction company. She quit the job four days before she  was killed on Feb. 17, 1988, a month after she and Jenkins won $727,000 in the  state lottery.    If Harrison were still angry with his former wife over their protracted custody  battle, May said, he could have simply abducted the two children during the  three days he had them in his custody the weekend before her death.    Given that there was no forcible entry into Anne Jenkins' home the day of the  killing, and given that Harrison ""is the last person she'd let in the house, it  must have been someone she trusted,"" May said, again looking toward where  Wanket and Jenkins were sitting.    May contended that the prosecution of Harrison was like ""trying to fit a square  peg into a round hole."" No evidence puts Harrison at the scene, May said;  rather, ""you'll hear plenty (of testimony) poisoning your mind about why they  want him there,"" he told the judge.    Prosecutor Larry Burns alleged that Harrison carefully planned the killing by,  among other things, studying a virtual ""catalogue of murder methods"" in various  books he owned describing how to commit ""the perfect murder.""    The lack of forensic evidence linking Harrison to the scene is consistent with  the very books he was reading, Burns said. Anne Jenkins' murder was the final  act against Harrison's ex-wife and was preceded by a three-year harassment  campaign he directed at the Jenkinses and Wanket because he was bitter that  Anne Jenkins' new husband and father were helping her finance her court battles  against him, according to the prosecutor.

0,FT944-2482 ,"FT944-2482 _AN-ELSBNABGFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Turbo-prop safety fears put off the passengers      By RICHARD TOMKINS      NEW YORK   Short-hop flights on small commuter aircraft are big business in the US: there are more than 12,500 a day. But many passengers dislike the propellor-powered aircraft typically used on these flights - and may be even less keen to use them after this week's fatal accident in North Carolina. On Tuesday evening a turbo-prop BAe Jetstream Super 31 on an American Eagle commuter flight crashed into a wood on its final approach into Raleigh-Durham International Airport, killing 15 of the 20 passengers. The cause is not yet known. The accident came less than two months after another American Eagle turbo-prop, an ATR-72, went down while waiting to land at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, killing all 68 on board. Ice on the wings is the suspected cause. The accidents themselves would have been enough to make some passengers jittery about flying by turbo-prop aircraft. But last month, they were given another reason to feel nervous when the International Airline Passengers Association, a Washington-based consumer organisation, said people should fly by propellor-driven aircraft only in good weather during daylight hours to minimise the chance of accidents. Further anxiety was caused last weekend when the Federal Aviation Administration banned the ATR-72 and ATR-42 turbo-prop aircraft from flying in icy conditions, causing widespread flight cancellations in the north-eastern US. Turbo-prop aircraft are disliked by many passengers because they tend to be slower, noisier and more cramped than jets. But their use is growing in the US because they provide the most economical means of picking up small numbers of passengers from local communities and feeding them into longer-distance flights at regional hubs. As big airlines face increasing competition from low-cost carriers, they are replacing jets with turbo-props on some routes. Earlier this year, for example, American Airlines replaced all its jet services in Cincinnati with turbo-prop flights. To some extent, the safety fears associated with turbo-prop aircraft are justified. Statistics show that, on US domestic flights, regional airlines suffered 0.11 fatal accidents per 100,000 flights last year - more than three times the rate of 0.029 suffered by the big carriers. Some of the reasons cited for the difference include less rigorous training standards for pilots of small aircraft, less sophisticated avionics gear, less effective de-icing gear, and vulnerability to bad weather because small aircraft tend to fly at lower altitudes. However, the Regional Airline Association, a US industry body, says the safety fears are overdone. Excluding Alaska, where operating conditions are particularly difficult, it says that the accident rate for regional airlines falls to 0.037 fatal accidents per 100,000 flights - not that much higher than the figure for big carriers. Still, Ms Deborah McElroy, the association's vice president, says it would be naive to believe that the safety concerns are not having some effect on passenger numbers. 'You read in the papers that some people are driving rather than taking a turbo-prop aircraft, which is ironic since it's nearly 100 times safer to use a regional airline than it is to make the same trip by car.'

The killing of a top tea company manager by the United  Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) activists in Upper Assam  yesterday, evoked memories of the days when this underground  insurgent outfit held the industry to ransom by killing or  kidnapping senior tea executives.    The top brass of the tea industry attended Mr. Rameshwar  Singh's cremation yesterday afternoon. The fact that the chief  minister, Mr. Hiteswar Saikia, rushed to Tinsukia from New  Delhi, speaks of the seriousness of the matter.    The last three months have witnessed a dramatic return of  the  ULFA and to some extent the Boro Security Force to the  centrestage. In the second week of December last year, 15 ULFA  activists attacked a police station in Nagaon and killed four  policemen in their sleep. A few days later, they killed a  district Congress chief. In the second week of January, the Boro  Security Force ambushed a police truck and gunned down eight  policemen.    Early this month, ULFA activists shot dead a Congress leader  and his bodyguard in Nalbari. Shortly afterwards, the officer  in-charge of the Gohpur police station in Tezpur was killed in a  bomb explosion in the police station. The bomb was planted under  his bed by a trusted constable.    Senior police officers say that the militants are trying to  demoralise the police force, which had achieved major successes  against them last year. They describe the latest spate of  killings as ""acts of desperation,"" as the police had kept up the  pressure on the insurgents.    However, the police are alarmed at the new pattern that has  emerged in the recent killings -- the infiltration into the  police force by supporters of the insurgents. Two bodyguards of  the Darrang district deputy commissioner were arrested under  TADA [expansion not given] and dismissed from service early this  month after they lost their stenguns, allegedly to the ULFA.    ""The objective of the militants is to break the force from  within by brainwashing vulnerable policemen to kill their  colleagues,"" said a top police officer. But, he added, the  militants have not made a significant dent into the force.    Perhaps the only thing which goes against ULFA is its latest  directive to leading Assamese businessmen of Nalbari district to  cough up hefty sums. While some of them paid clandestinely, most  defied the directive. ""This has not earned the ULFA much  sympathy, says Mr. Biren Dutta, a deputy commissioner.    Meanwhile the Punjab chief minister, Mr. Beant Singh, has  cleared the despatch of two Punjab police commando battalions to  Assam to combat ULFA insurgency.    Mr. Beant Singh said this today while inaugurating a two-day  all India seminar on police commandos here.    Mr. Beant Singh said that the Assam chief minister had  requested the Punjab government for police commandos and the  move had been cleared by the home ministry. The commando  battalions are likely to reach Assam and start assisting in  anti-insurgency operations by mid-March.    The Punjab police chief, Mr. K.P.S. Gill, said that the  Assam  police has only two companies of commandos which are inadequate  to meet the ULFA challenge. He said the Punjab police commando  battalions had played a crucial role in crushing militancy in  the state.    Mr. Gill said that more than 10,000 police personnel have  been trained as commandos, including 5,521 from the district  police.     "

The Los Angeles County coroner's office had determined that John T. Langlos, a  52-year-old clinical psychologist, had died of a heart attack. But his widow  waged a stubborn, six-year campaign to persuade authorities that, in fact, he  was a murder victim.    Her persistence was rewarded when Eugene Clarence Hartman was convicted in 1984  of second-degree murder and sentenced to state prison. That triumph, however,  was short-lived when Hartman was freed in 1985 because of a legal technicality.    For Langlos, it was a painful conclusion, but it appeared her odyssey was over.      Back in Court    Now, four years later, the 69-year-old Langlos finds herself back in court --  this time as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the very man once convicted of  killing her husband.    ""I am now the accused, and my husband was taken from me,"" an anguished Langlos  said from her Huntington Beach home. ""This just shows that the wheels of  justice can backfire, and I didn't think that could happen in this country.""    Langlos, who underwent triple-bypass heart surgery last spring, said she was  stunned several weeks ago when she received a court summons informing her that  Hartman was suing for ""malicious prosecution"" and seeking $500,000 from her.    ""It was devastating. I just could not believe he wanted a half-million dollars  from me,"" Langlos said. ""I was shocked. It brought everything back, all the  memories.""    Those nightmarish memories stretch back to Feb. 2, 1976, when her husband's  body was discovered wedged partly beneath an office desk. There was a gash in  his head. Three buttons were torn from his shirt and his wallet and money clip  were missing.      Cashed a Check    A few days later, Hartman, a psychologist who occasionally worked with Langlos  at the clinic, was arrested by Oakland police after he cashed a check drawn on  Langlos' account and used Langlos' credit card to buy a watch and airline  tickets.    Originally charged with murder, Hartman, 61, was released after a deputy  medical examiner ruled that Langlos had died of natural causes. Authorities  theorized that Langlos had suffered heart failure and fell, striking his head  on his desk, and that Hartman had discovered and looted the body. Hartman was  freed after serving 36 days in jail.    Still, Ruth Langlos insisted that her husband had been murdered and embarked on  her quest to prove county officials wrong. She spent $50,000 for independent  autopsies that challenged the original county findings. But then-Coroner Thomas  Noguchi refused to change the death certificate -- a required step before new  murder charges could be filed against Hartman.      Coroner's Jury Conclusion    Undaunted, Langlos took her case to a coroner's jury, which concluded in May,  1982, that her husband had died of ""undetermined causes . . . at the hands of  another."" Less than a year later, the district attorney's office filed a new  murder charge against Hartman, and in 1984, he was convicted of murdering John  Langlos.    In 1985, the state Court of Appeal overturned Hartman's conviction, ruling that  he was denied due process because the lengthy delay between Langlos' death and  the trial resulted in a loss of evidence. When the state Supreme Court later  that year declined to consider a prosecution appeal, Hartman was permanently  free.    Hartman, who now lives in Sacramento, told The Times that he was the target of  a politically motivated prosecution and filed his lawsuit to underscore his  innocence of the murder charge.    ""I think the case was so bizarre and there was so much media value and Mrs.  Langlos kept pushing (for a conviction), that put me at a disadvantage,""  Hartman said.      Whereabouts Unknown    Although he filed the lawsuit in January, 1987, Hartman said he only notified  Langlos this month because he could not determine where she lived until  recently -- a fact that terrifies Langlos.    ""I thought now I can go on with my life, but I can't,"" she said. ""He's stopped  that, and now he knows where I am.""    Hartman said Thursday he has no intention of harming Langlos, although he  blames her for his conviction. In his lawsuit, he also named Gov. George  Deukmejian, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, then-Dist. Atty. Robert H.  Philibosian and several state and county officials as defendants and accused  them of pursuing the case against him merely to ""gain political advantage and  to aid Ruth Langlos's campaign of harassment.""    In addition to the $500,000 claim against Langlos, Hartman is seeking $2  million from the county and $500,000 from the state.    But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert B. Lopez on Thursday dismissed the  state defendants from the case, ruling that as public officials they are immune  from such civil lawsuits. The judge had earlier removed Philibosian and the  county as defendants for the same reason.    Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, who filed the original case  against Hartman, said the real victim remains Ruth Langlos.    ""I think it's atrocious. I don't think there is any merit to the lawsuit at  all,"" Norris said. ""The tragedy is that she has to respond and retain a lawyer.  . . . It's a real system of injustices that needs to be addressed.""    Harry Simon, an attorney with the Senior Citizens Legal Advocacy Program of the  Legal Aid Society of Orange County, agreed and said his office has been asked  to represent Langlos. ""Mrs. Langlos has been through this for 13 long years,""  Simon said, ""and it just seems to never end.""

Coroner's Jury Conclusion    Undaunted, Langlos took her case to a coroner's jury, which concluded in May,  1982, that her husband had died of ""undetermined causes . . . at the hands of  another."" Less than a year later, the district attorney's office filed a new  murder charge against Hartman, and in 1984, he was convicted of murdering John  Langlos.    In 1985, the state Court of Appeal overturned Hartman's conviction, ruling that  he was denied due process because the lengthy delay between Langlos' death and  the trial resulted in a loss of evidence. When the state Supreme Court later  that year declined to consider a prosecution appeal, Hartman was permanently  free.    Hartman, who now lives in Sacramento, told The Times that he was the target of  a politically motivated prosecution and filed his lawsuit to underscore his  innocence of the murder charge.    ""I think the case was so bizarre and there was so much media value and Mrs.  Langlos kept pushing (for a conviction), that put me at a disadvantage,""  Hartman said.      Whereabouts Unknown    Although he filed the lawsuit in January, 1987, Hartman said he only notified  Langlos this month because he could not determine where she lived until  recently -- a fact that terrifies Langlos.    ""I thought now I can go on with my life, but I can't,"" she said. ""He's stopped  that, and now he knows where I am.""    Hartman said Thursday he has no intention of harming Langlos, although he  blames her for his conviction. In his lawsuit, he also named Gov. George  Deukmejian, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, then-Dist. Atty. Robert H.  Philibosian and several state and county officials as defendants and accused  them of pursuing the case against him merely to ""gain political advantage and  to aid Ruth Langlos's campaign of harassment.""    In addition to the $500,000 claim against Langlos, Hartman is seeking $2  million from the county and $500,000 from the state.    But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert B. Lopez on Thursday dismissed the  state defendants from the case, ruling that as public officials they are immune  from such civil lawsuits. The judge had earlier removed Philibosian and the  county as defendants for the same reason.    Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, who filed the original case  against Hartman, said the real victim remains Ruth Langlos.    ""I think it's atrocious. I don't think there is any merit to the lawsuit at  all,"" Norris said. ""The tragedy is that she has to respond and retain a lawyer.  . . . It's a real system of injustices that needs to be addressed.""    Harry Simon, an attorney with the Senior Citizens Legal Advocacy Program of the  Legal Aid Society of Orange County, agreed and said his office has been asked  to represent Langlos. ""Mrs. Langlos has been through this for 13 long years,""  Simon said, ""and it just seems to never end.""

The full right given to the settlers by the Israeli  authorities to possess weapons and open fire at Palestinian  civilians whenever they are able to do so makes these  authorities officially responsible for all crimes and organized  killing of Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories.    The international consensus to denounce the crime and  condemn  its perpetrators and the influential officials within the  Israeli leadership who stand behind them showed--though with  different degrees, that securing international protection for  the Palestinian people under occupation has become a pressing  subject which needs urgent and immediate measures to deter the  unrestrained Zionist violence. The Zionist violence is  threatening--now more than ever-- to torpedo the peace process.  Peace cannot be realized in the absence of a reasonable degree  of security and peace. The Palestinian people, who have been  and are still the victims of Zionist massacres and the  continuation of the Zionist occupation of their homeland, have  the right to live in peace and to enjoy all their human and  national rights away from terrorism and the weapons and  repressive practices of the Israeli occupation.    The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, as called  for by the international norms and charters on human rights in  times of war, require relentless efforts by all international  forces concerned with peace to realize these rights. They  should not be satisfied with acquainting themselves with  observers reports that reject Israeli violations of these  rights. The world was already acquainted with many of these  violations, which are increasing daily as as a result of the  absence of any international deterrence and because  international legitimacy does not carry out its duties, does not  shoulder its responsibilities, and does not apply a single  yardstick toward the peoples' causes.    It a time for action because the explosive situation in  occupied Palestine requires a serious position from the  international community and the United States, in particular--a  position which contributes to dissipating the imminent Zionist  danger that exposes the whole peace process to deterioration and  setback.    The United States has announced more than once its eagerness  to render the peace process successful--the process for which  the United States is the main sponsor. The United States has  repeated this positions scores of times. So can the United  States prove the credibility of its ideas by forcing the Israeli  Government to accept practical measures that secure  international protection for the Palestinian people? The United  States should be aware that the Hebron massacre has not only  exposed the falsity of Israel's eagerness to realize peace, but  has also revealed the dangerousness of the continuation of this  situation--we mean the continuation of occupation and the  continuation of settlements and settlers. This question does  not go along with the peace process, peace spirit, and the  efforts to establish peace.    It is time for the United States to be aware that this stage  requires adding deeds to words, keeping away from ambiguity, and  resorting to clarity of positions--as they are and as they  should be--active positions against crimes, terrorism, and  occupation that deter the killers, provide protection for the  Palestinian people, and keep the road to peace open until its  noble objectives are realized.

0,FT932-15585 ,"FT932-15585 _AN-DDMB0AAFFT 930413   FT  13 APR 93 / Pleas to curb South African violence      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICAN political leaders yesterday struggled to contain violent reaction to the assassination of prominent black activist Mr Chris Hani. Condemnation of the killing from across the political spectrum, coupled with pleas for restraint from black political leaders, helped to limit the violence. Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstands Beweging (AWB), while confirming that the alleged assassin was an AWB member, condemned the killing as 'atrocious' over the weekend. Meanwhile, the African National Congress attempted to channel black anger into an organised campaign of mass protest action, due to begin today. But the danger that activists will fail to heed their call was illustrated yesterday when black gunmen opened fire on police and journalists during a rally in the Katlehong black township east of Johannesburg, one of several gatherings held to protest at the assassination of Mr Hani. The mass action campaign is due to culminate with the funeral of Mr Hani, which is likely to be one of the largest political events in South African history. No date has yet been set for the funeral. ANC leaders made clear that negotiations would continue in spite of the murder. They issued a statement urging respect for whites and condemning racial attacks. 'It is true that the person who pulled the trigger that killed Hani is white . . . equally true is that a white person informed the police of the registration and the colour of the car that his murderer used and led to his arrest. Therefore colour does not play a role in this instance,' the statement said. Several townships near Johannesburg were reported tense yesterday, with looting and cars burned, but protests appeared to be under control by evening. The worst incident of apparent reaction came when blacks in a township near Cape Town burned to death three white men who had visited an illegal drinking establishment on Sunday. Attackers cut off part of the tongue of one of the men. Police said there was no evidence that the killings were directly connected to the Hani assassination, but they probably reflect worsening racial tensions. ANC Youth League officials called for armed attacks on whites at one township rally but ANC headquarters deplored the call. Mass protests begin today with a picket at the Boksburg magistrate's court, where the alleged assassin, Mr Janusz Walus, is due to appear. Police said they will charge Mr Walus, a Polish immigrant to South Africa, with Mr Hani's murder. Mr Walus appears to have links with organised white extremist groups, though no such group has claimed responsibility. He had a hit-list of 'eight or nine' assassination targets, including leaders of the ANC, the ruling National party and Hani's South African Communist party. The weapon used in the murder was stolen by white-supremacist Piet Rudolf three years ago from Air Force headquarters in Pretoria.

On Monday, the 22-year-old Garden Grove man sat in the Riverside County Jail,  accused of acting in concert with a high school friend to stab the 21-year-old  Duerr 20 times, then dump her partially clad body in the hills near Corona.    Last Thursday, authorities arrested Cameron Seaholm, a 22-year-old transient  who went to high school with both Spontak and Duerr, in connection with the  killing after he was discovered driving Duerr's car. At the time, Spontak  lamented the death of his live-in girlfriend and angrily sought to understand  what had motivated the actions of his friend Seaholm.    But investigators say they never believed the boyfriend's display of grief and  kept an eye on him from the outset as a suspect in Duerr's killing.    ""He just seemed patently unconvincing,"" Riverside Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel C.  Lough said of Spontak, who was arrested on suspicion of murder    early Sunday morning.    On Saturday evening, armed with a search warrant, Garden Grove police and  Riverside County sheriff's deputies went to the Garden Grove apartment that  Spontak had shared with Duerr, interrupting a neighborhood barbecue.    For the next 6 hours, they combed through the apartment and recovered evidence  that investigators allege links Spontak to the crime, Lough said. He refused to  discuss the evidence seized.    During the search, Spontak sat calmly on a sofa as more than a dozen law  enforcement officers scoured the apartment, an open bottle of champagne and  newspaper stories about the murder in view, Lough said.    ""He was just waiting it out until the moment we arrested him (about 3:30 a.m.  Sunday),"" said Lt. Nick Padilla of the Riverside Sheriff's Department. ""Then he  became very emotional for a minute, then suddenly regained his composure.""    Police handcuffed Spontak and led him outside in the view of shocked neighbors,  many of whom had tried to comfort him.    Investigators said that as soon as Duerr's partially clothed body was found  last Wednesday in a brush-covered area just off the Riverside Freeway at the  edge of the Santa Ana Mountains, they focused on Spontak's possible role in the  killing for a variety of reasons.    They cited apparent contradictions in his whereabouts in the hours leading up  to Duerr's disappearance last Monday, his rocky and sometimes violent 6-year  relationship with Duerr, and the fact that he may have been the last person to  see Duerr before she disappeared last week.    ""It all just made you very, very suspicious,"" Padilla said.      'A Lot Left to Figure Out'    Investigators say they have still not determined a motive for the slaying,  where she was killed, or the actual murderer. ""We still have a lot left to  figure out on this one,"" Lough said.    But law enforcement officials alleged Monday that they have enough evidence to  show that Spontak acted in concert with Seaholm to carry out the crime.    Spontak's arrest shocked neighbors at his Garden Grove apartment complex, and  even the victim's mother reacted with disbelief.    Duerr's mother, Mary Ellen Ducharme, said: ""I have a hard time believing that  he did it, unless it was an accident. . . . They had a stormy 6-year  relationship on and off, but this time, when Denise went back to live with  (Spontak), it was different. He treated her well and they didn't fight at all.""    Ducharme said that Spontak and Duerr had problems in the past and that Spontak  occasionally hit the young woman, an assertion confirmed by police  investigators.    ""He was extremely jealous of her. He didn't want her wearing short skirts and  wanted her to call him whenever she went somewhere. But she promised me that he  had changed and I think he did,"" her mother said.    Ducharme said that Spontak called her after his arrest and ""swore to me on the  telephone that he had nothing to do with it and would never hurt her.""    Spontak is scheduled to be arraigned on murder charges Wednesday in Riverside  County, law enforcement officials said.      Seahold in Court    Seaholm, who police allege was Spontak's accomplice, appeared briefly Monday in  Corona Municipal Court, but his arraignment was postponed until next Monday.    During parts of the proceeding, he appeared exasperated and shook his head as  he sat in custody in the jury box. But at other times, he flashed a brief smile  toward his mother, estranged wife and family friends in the courtroom audience.    Seaholm's family and his Santa Ana defense attorney maintained his innocence  Monday, and pointed to Spontak's arrest as affirmation that Seaholm did not  kill Duerr.    ""We know he's innocent,"" said his mother, Joanne Sandor of Santa Ana. While  declining to discuss specifics of the case against her son, Sandor said: ""She  just was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Unfortunately, Clyde (Spontak)  is a friend of his.""    Seaholm's defense attorney, Gary L. Proctor, said that Spontak's arrest should  show that his client was not involved in the murder.    Proctor acknowledged that Seaholm took Duerr's car without permission, but he  said that his client did not realize that the young woman's body was in the  car's trunk. He added that he is hopeful that laboratory tests will conclude  that stains found on Seaholm's clothing were not, in fact, the victim's blood.    Investigators already have confirmed that Duerr died as a result of 20 stab  wounds to the upper body. A full autopsy report is not expected for several  weeks, but prosecutor Lough said Monday that ""certainly the torn state of her  clothing would suggest a sexual attack.""

On Monday, the 22-year-old Garden Grove man sat in the Riverside County Jail,  accused of acting in concert with a high school friend to stab the 21-year-old  Duerr 20 times, then dump her partially clad body in the hills near Corona.    Last Thursday, authorities arrested Cameron Seaholm, a 22-year-old transient  who went to high school with both Spontak and Duerr, in connection with the  killing after he was discovered driving Duerr's car. At the time, Spontak  lamented the death of his live-in girlfriend and angrily sought to understand  what had motivated the actions of his friend Seaholm.    But investigators say they never believed the boyfriend's display of grief and  kept an eye on him from the outset as a suspect in Duerr's killing.    ""He just seemed patently unconvincing,"" Riverside Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel C.  Lough said of Spontak, who was arrested on suspicion of murder    early Sunday morning.

But the 38-year-old bartender was gay, and since the night he was mugged and  stabbed to death on Broadway, Labourdette's killing has triggered an uproar in  the local gay community almost as dramatic and unexpected as the attack itself.    Police say there is no evidence that Labourdette was killed because he was gay;  they say he was murdered while being robbed. But gay activists view the killing  as the latest example of what they perceive as a significant increase in  attacks on gays.    In the four weeks since the murder, gay activists have been holding protest  marches, distributing leaflets and forming committees that, among other things,  are considering equipping area bars with safety-oriented videotapes. They are  also establishing a 24-hour hot line to report harassment and attacks and are  organizing neighborhood watch teams to cut down on crime.    Few gays walk alone on the streets any more, and in the restaurants and bars  that cater to the gay community, there is fear and uncertainly.    ""There's always been violence against gays,"" said Mark Foster, a member of the  local chapter of ACT-UP, a militant gay organization that has taken an interest  in the case. ""But we think it's at a fever pitch right now.""    Labourdette had been dining with friends July 5 at a restaurant on Broadway  when he left to walk across the street to buy cigarettes about 9:30 p.m. He  didn't get far. Immediately outside, two men jumped from a car, stabbed him  repeatedly and rifled his pockets.    Police, who have no suspects, say the motive appears to have been simple  robbery and that the victim's selection was random.    But some gays say the unusual viciousness of the stabbings and the attack's  location in the middle of the city's most visibly gay neighborhood indicates to  them that the selection may not have been random. In fact, they say, the attack  has the earmarks of being part of a rising tide of verbal and physical  harassment of gays along the Broadway corridor -- a two-mile stretch centered  roughly on Bixby Park at Broadway and Cherry Avenue.    Police insist that the area is relatively safe, with fewer assaults, murders  and robberies on record than many other parts of the city.    ""It looks like a low-crime area, considering the city as a whole,"" said police  spokesman Melvin Gallwas, who added that crime statistics reveal no assault  upsurge in the area.    ""During the many times I've monitored the situation,"" he said, ""the place  looked (quiet) as a ghost town.""    Rick Rosen disagrees. Chairman of the police relations committee of the  gay-oriented Lambda Democratic Club for the last year, Rosen said many crimes  against gays go unreported because of the unwillingness of some gays to be so  identified and their general distrust of police.    Further, Rosen said, his own statistics seem to contradict those of the police.  Part of his job is to field calls from gays complaining of harassment.    Six months ago, he was averaging one or two calls a month, but today he is  getting up to four a week, he said.    ""There's a noticeable increase,"" said Rosen, adding that the incidents range  from name-calling to physical assaults.    In either case, the perception of danger seems to have mobilized the gay  community. A rally and protest march last weekend drew about 150 people. Local  members of ACT-UP are planning a community meeting Aug. 17, followed by another  public rally later this month. And in the bars along Broadway, fears seem  palpable.    ""We walk out in groups,"" said David Bowling, 31, a waiter who frequents the  bars. ""We kind of watch out for each other.""    ""I only live two blocks away,"" added Jim Forbes, 26, ""but I drive here now.""    Activists are not sure what has caused the increase in attacks. Some said gays  are finding themselves subjected to more abuse because society itself seems to  be more violent, because fear of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is growing  and because anti-gay hysteria is too.    Others said that even though some attackers have nothing against gays in  particular, they are more likely to act against a population that, according to  the stereotype, is less likely to fight back. And some blamed a neighborhood  action taken by the city last year for contributing to the problem:  specifically, the gating of Bixby Park.    Long known as a cruising area for male homosexuals and prostitutes, as well as  a gathering place for drug dealers and vagrants, the park was the subject of  several community meetings in 1989. Acting on recommendations from a  neighborhood coalition that included gays, the city finally increased police  patrols, enacted an anti-cruising ordinance and built gates to stem the flow of  foot traffic through the park from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.    As a result, most area residents now say there is much less criminal activity  in the park. But the same criminal element that once gathered in the park, some  activists complain, now wanders along Broadway, creating an unhealthy  atmosphere in which gay bashing is more likely to occur.    Rosen, who as a member of Lambda sat on the panel that drafted the park  recommendations, sees Bixby Park as a non-issue.    ""It doesn't matter where the crime takes place,"" he said, ""a victim is a  victim. Closing the park (at night) has not led to an increase in the number of  assaults anywhere else.""    At least one element of the community -- an ad hoc group called Community  Response Network, formed shortly after the Labourdette killing -- says it  intends to pursue the problem as a general matter of crime affecting the entire  neighborhood, gays and non-gays alike.    ACT-UP members say they have organized informal neighborhood patrols to watch  out for fellow gays.    ""Harassment is very common down in that corridor,"" said Bob Brown, who is  coordinating the group's anti-bashing effort. ""Hopefully, just our presence  will deter any (potential attacks) in our vision.""

ZVERINA, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      MLADA BOLESLAV, Czechoslovakia      Over eight decades of car building in this dreary industrial town northeast of  Prague could soon undergo dramatic change as Skoda seeks a Western partner to  boost modernization efforts and transform the state-run concern into a publicly  owned company.    Such an alliance has been under discussion with numerous Japanese and European  car makers, as well as General Motors Europe, since democratic reforms last  November began the process of liberating Czechoslovakia from 42 years of  Communist rule.    Skoda's sprawling but aging complex about 35 miles from Prague is considered by  many Western car makers to be a jewel in the rough, despite the lack of any  substantial economic reforms.    ""On one hand, we have world-class design and assembly here,"" said Jiri  Danhelka, press secretary for the auto maker, adding that just last year Skoda  scrapped its decades-old rear engine design and began producing its first  front-drive sedan, the Favorit.    Next year, Skoda also plans to introduce a larger, front-drive sedan and wagon  called the Forman. It also is under pressure to develop a new engine to meet  stricter emission standards in 1992 if it is to continue exports to about 30  countries, one of the largest outside markets being Great Britain.    ""But the government has not provided enough money for needed improvements,""  Denhelka said, noting that this is the main reason for a joint venture, which  could eventually double Skoda's output and help satisfy pent-up demand for cars  in both Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe.    ""Some auto makers see us as the best auto plant in Eastern Europe, so we can  choose our partner,"" Danhelka said, adding that Skoda will most probably  announce an alliance later this year. ""We are not at the mercy of anybody.""    Suitors include BMW and Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault and PSA, Subaru and  Mitsubishi. GM of Europe is also talking with Skoda, although it is unlikely  that the two will reach any agreement, sources said.    There are conditions attached to any such alliance, however.    ""We want to maintain final production in Mlada Boleslav and preserve the Skoda  name,"" Danhelka said. ""Another condition is the creation of social conditions  as they exist in major Western countries,"" although he said the Czech  government is likely to retain an interest in the company.    Skoda also ""wants to preserve jobs for Czechs,"" Denhelka said. But the company  appears unconcerned about the fate of 2,000 Vietnamese and Cuban workers  employed at Skoda as partial loan repayments from those countries.    Suitors also may be interested in Skoda's skilled work force, taking advantage  of lower labor rates here when compared with other Western countries, he  conceded.    Danhelka insists that Skoda ""is a modern plant and not a museum,"" as evidenced  by more than 100 West German robotic welders and a modern, final-assembly area  that puts to rest notions that Czechoslovakia, once a forerunner in industrial  excellence, is firmly in the Stone Age when it comes to making cars.    But a recent tour of the Skoda works revealed years of economic neglect, as  well as the last vestiges of Communist rule. Any Western auto maker is likely  to start anew instead of modernizing Skoda's hodgepodge of facilities, many of  which were last renovated during the 1960s.    Many facilities are in dire need of structural repairs. Some still have meshed  fences that once enclosed prisoner auto workers. The paint shop is over 30  years old, and there are virtually no safety or environmental controls in  place.    Workers may be justified in fearing that added automation under such a  partnership could jeopardize their livelihoods, even if production is doubled.  Industry analysts say Skoda's current work force of 16,500 at Mlada Boleslav is  about three times the level needed to produce the current rate of 190,000 cars  a year.    The parting of the Iron Curtain, as well as the elimination of European trade  barriers in 1992, will undoubtedly mean changes for Skoda. It has enjoyed an  85% share of the Czech market, in which there is a four-month wait for its  cars.    ""It will certainly create new competition,"" Denhelka said.

According to the letter, singling out the success of  Vientiane's fiscal and monetary reform plan (begun in 1986),  which has achieved single digit inflation, a much reduced trade  deficit, and control over foreign debt payments, the donors  urged the Lao government to press on with the pace of economic  change and aim for rapid development.    The Lao government, which was represented by Khamphoui  Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister, announced that it would  increase the rate of public investment to 14 per cent of GDP by  2000 in a bid to radically overhaul the country's poor  infrastructure and prepare the economy for full-blooded regional  integration.    As part of the Public Investment Programme (PIP) - which is  to be backed by donors to the tune of up to U.S. dollars 1.4  billion - the Lao government will irrigate more than 50,000  hectares of unused land, plant 100,000 hectares of forest, and  build 1,500 km of road.    In addition, a full-scale hydro-electric project is to go  ahead which is planned to earn substantial foreign revenues  through power export to Thailand and Vietnam, among other  neighbours.    Donors agreed that the recent opening of the Mittaphap  (Friendship) Bridge linking Laos to Thailand across the Mekong  River along the growing tide of foreign investment pledges had  all but guaranteed continuation of the country's healthy growth  rates (7.5 per cent since 1989) for the next few years.    Among the congratulations for the boldness of the Lao reform  programme, however, donors warned the Lao government that it  should not base its plans on growth for the sake of growth but  should work for a higher calibre of development.    It was also noted that least developed countries found it  easier to achieve high growth rates than more sophisticated  economies and that Laos had a particularly long way to go before  its population could taste the fruits of a modern economy.    In his address to the donors, Deputy Prime Minister  Khamphoui  recognized that his country still suffered from poor social  conditions: `national income (less than U.S. 300) is still very  low. Agricultural production is still dependent on the mercy of  nature. Ethnic groups in the mountainous areas live on  practising slash-and-burn cultivation -- a practice that  destroys forest areas of hundreds of thousands of hectares a  year,' he said.    Along with a scheme to protect the environment, the  government would invest significant donor-back sums to improve  the country's education and health soctors, he said. Resources  would also be channelled into a comprehensive training programme  to modernize the workforce. And the government would strengthen  its opium-eradication programme aiming to wipe out production of  the drug by the year 2000.    The thrust, however, of the six-year reform and  restructuring  programme would be to develop Laos' market economy and diversify  the country's rapidly growing export base. The Lao government  and donors agreed that the country should build on its success  in attracting foreign investment (U.S. dollars 126 million in  1993 and over U.S. dollars 500 million in pledges) by updating  the country's commercial law system and rationalizing its tariff  structure.    If the PIP fulfilled its ambitious targets-- a plausible  objective according to the experts at the meeting. Laos would be  well on its way towards joining the prestigious club of newly  industrialized countries in Asia by the end of the six-year  programme. The Lao government and donors will meet again in two  years to evaluate the trajectory of the reforms.    Tuesday's round-table conference was co-chaired by the  deputy  prime minister and by UNDP's acting director for Asia and the  Pacific, Ms. Elena Martinez. Participants included Australia,  Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden,  Switzerland, Thailand, the UK, the U.S.A., the Asian Development  Bank, the European Commission, the International Fund for  Agricultural Development, the OECD, the IMF, World Bank, FAO [UN  Food and Agriculture Organization], UNCTAD [United Nations  Conference on Trade and Development], UNDCP [expansion unknown],  UNFPA [United Nations Fund for Population Activities], UNHCR,  UNICEF, WFP [World Food Program], WHO, and the Swiss Red Cross.

By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Charging that the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station is violating federal  law by killing off tons of fish and kelp, an environmental group filed suit  Thursday against Southern California Edison Co. demanding a stop to the  killing.    The suit was filed about a year after a 15-year, $46-million study found that  the nuclear plant north of Oceanside is, indeed, killing tons of fish and kelp.    But since then, neither Edison nor state regulatory agencies have taken action  on the findings, according to the suit, filed by Earth Island Institute, a San  Francisco-based environmental group.    The suit, filed in federal court in San Diego, demands that Edison either fix  the plant's cooling system, which the study said is responsible for most of the  fish and kelp kills, or shut the plant.    The suit also says Edison should be ordered to establish an environmental trust  fund to restore fish and kelp levels, and asks for unspecified monetary  damages.    ""It's pie-in-the-sky until we win, which we intend to do,"" said one of Earth  Island's San Diego lawyers, Charles S. Crandall. ""But we want the plant to  comply and to make restoration for the damage it has done -- and it has done  damage, clearly.""    An Edison spokesman, David Barron, said the utility's lawyers had not seen the  suit. But he said the utility is in compliance with all federal environmental  laws.    ""The marine life offshore is thriving, despite some limited effects from  operation of plant, as one would expect,"" Barron said.    The San Onofre plant is on the beach about 12 miles northwest of Oceanside,  within the Marine Corps' base at Camp Pendleton.    Edison operates three nuclear-powered units at the plant. The first opened in  1968, while the second and third opened in 1984.    The suit alleges that Rosemead-based Edison, a subsidiary of SCECorp., has been  violating the federal Clean Water Act simply by operating the plant.    According to the suit, fish are killed when massive amounts of water are taken  in to the plant to cool the reactors. Kelp, according to the suit, dies from  particles that return with the water and either land on the fronds or block  sunlight.    Federal law requires Edison to obtain a permit to operate from the state Water  Quality Board and from the California Coastal Commission. Operation of the  plant (in such a way as to kill marine life) technically violates the water  board's permit, the suit contends.    The suit relies heavily on the study, which was ordered by the Coastal  Commission and issued in August 1989.    It found that the nuclear plant had caused a 60%, or 200-acre, reduction in the  area covered by the nearby kelp bed.    It also found that the plant's cooling system sucks up and kills 21 to 57 tons  of fish yearly, then discharges debris-filled water into the ocean, reducing  natural light levels on the ocean floor by as much as 16%.    The study was issued by a panel created in 1974 by the Coastal Commission as a  condition of its granting Edison a construction permit to expand from one  reactor to three.    The study, completely financed by Edison, was intended to provide an  independent scientific review of the plant's impact by appointing one biologist  for each special interest -- Edison, the environmentalists and the Coastal  Commission.

BUT IN ONE AREA -- THE U.S.-CANADIAN  BORDER -- THE PENDING AMERICAN CLEAN-AIR LAW HAS EVEN CANADA'S  ENVIRONMENTALISTS SOUNDING HOPEFUL.      By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TORONTO      This is one of those all-too-rare good-news stories about the environment in  our industrial age.    The subject: acid rain, a phenomenon plaguing many developed countries of  Europe and North America, and a particular sore spot for at least a decade in  relations between Canada and the United States.    Canadians believe that about 7,000 lakes in Ontario province alone have become  so acidic, largely from U.S. pollution sources, that most of the fish in them  have died. Other studies -- not all of them conclusive -- suggest that acid  rain is shrinking the eastern Canadian duck population, killing off vast  swathes of maple trees and turning proud marble edifices into spongy masses  that can be sliced with a knife.    Tourism officials have complained bitterly that in killing the fish, acid rain  is also strangling one of the few successful industries in rocky and  undeveloped north-central Canada.    Acidic lakes look unnaturally lovely -- ""like your average swimming pool,  aquamarine blue and clear,"" says Michael Perley, secretary-treasurer of the  Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain. But tourists come to this part of Canada to  fish, not to admire blue waters. And the reason the lakes look so crystalline  is that nothing can live in them. ""If you snorkel in one, there's nothing but a  mat of filamentous algae on the bottom,"" says Perley. ""At a quick glance, it  sort of looks like Astroturf.""    Research on hospitalizations in southern Ontario show that more people are  treated for emphysema, bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory problems  during the summer acid rain season than at other times of the year.    Despite such hazards, Canadians say, the United States has resisted pressure to  take corrective action for a decade.    Now, however, even some of this country's most outspoken environmental critics  have changed their tune.    ""I think that this is going to be the year for acid rain control in the United  States,"" says Perley, whose group has done more than any other to channel this  country's exasperation with the United States.    Perley and others base their optimism on pollution control measures that would  be required under the U.S. Senate's version of the Clean Air Act, which is  expected to become law this summer.    The provisions would mean that the flow of acid rain-causing emissions into  Canada would be cut in half by the turn of the century -- enough of a change  that most of this country's acidic lakes could naturally revert to their  pristine state within five to 10 years.    ""The lakes will improve spontaneously,"" says Peter Dillon, manager of the  Ontario Ministry of the Environment's aquatics research center in Dorset. ""The  chemistry will revert to its original state, and the biological organisms will  follow suit, more slowly.""    All it takes, he says, is for the polluters to reduce their emission levels,  and the process will start.    ""The movement on acid rain is encouraging,"" agrees Derek Burney, Canada's  ambassador to the United States. ""It can't help but add an element of  productivity"" to U.S.-Canadian relations, he said.    Back in the 1980s, he explains, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and  former President Ronald Reagan spent much of the time they were together mired  in unproductive haggling over acid rain. With the dispute poised to become  history, he said, Mulroney and President Bush will have more time to focus on  broader issues.    Canadians credit their own intensive lobbying, growing understanding of the  problem and dramatic differences in outlook between the Bush and Reagan White  Houses. And while optimistic, they stress that more can still be done.    Even after most of Canada's dead lakes revive, they say, one-third or more of  them will still be dangerously acidic.    ""We'll still be pushing for even more emission controls in the future,"" says  Dillon. ""We want more than two-thirds of the lakes to recover. We'd like to be  up in the neighborhood of 95%.""    Still, he says, the outlook is vastly better than it was not long ago, when  Canadians feared it would take 40 years before their waters could sustain fish  again.    Until 1986, Canadians were putting all their hopes into dumping crushed  limestone -- which neutralizes acid just like an enormous dose of Rolaids --  into their lakes. But experiments showed that the cost was impossibly high:  $80,000 for a medium-sized lake. Thousands of lakes needed treatment, and the  process would have to be repeated every few years.    Canadians have been worrying about acid rain since the 1970s. And early on,  they had American support. Scientists in both countries knew that a number of  lakes on both sides of the border were becoming too acidic to sustain life, and  they believed there was a connection between the acidity and the burning of  fossil fuels.    The scientists didn't understand the link fully, but even so, then-President  Jimmy Carter's Environmental Protection Agency was concerned enough to sign a  memorandum of understanding with Canada, appoint technical experts and begin  negotiating an acid-rain treaty.    The process went off track with Carter's loss to Reagan in 1980, however.  Reagan's EPA appointed new acid-rain negotiators, and government attention  turned from environmentalism to economics. With so much uncertainty about the  causes of acid rain, the new technicians said, it would be a mistake to spend  vast sums of money on a cleanup. What if industry were forced to lavish  millions on cleanup methods that didn't work?    The new approach definitely saved money for industry, but it cost the United  States dearly in good relations with its northern neighbor.    Reagan-era negotiators did little but go through the motions for a couple of  years, said Kai Millyard, policy director of Friends of the Earth in Ottawa.  ""Then the whole (treaty process) was shut down at the end of 1982,"" Millyard  adds.    The Americans did have a point, though, when they said there was risk in  attacking the problem with a bad solution. Acid rain is itself the result of an  earlier attempt to solve the air-pollution woes of America's rust belt.    Years ago, power plants and factories burning fossil fuels had relatively short  smokestacks; the sulfur dioxide they emitted used to hang low over the  landscape, rusting cars and ruining house paint. Pressured to solve the  problem, the power plants built very tall smokestacks in an effort to shoot the  sulfur dioxide high into the atmosphere, where it supposedly would harmlessly  disperse.    Instead of dispersing, though, the sulfur dioxide entered the massive weather  systems of the upper Midwest and was ferried across the continent for hundreds  of miles.

BUT IN ONE AREA -- THE U.S.-CANADIAN  BORDER -- THE PENDING AMERICAN CLEAN-AIR LAW HAS EVEN CANADA'S  ENVIRONMENTALISTS SOUNDING HOPEFUL.      By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TORONTO      This is one of those all-too-rare good-news stories about the environment in  our industrial age.    The subject: acid rain, a phenomenon plaguing many developed countries of  Europe and North America, and a particular sore spot for at least a decade in  relations between Canada and the United States.    Canadians believe that about 7,000 lakes in Ontario province alone have become  so acidic, largely from U.S. pollution sources, that most of the fish in them  have died. Other studies -- not all of them conclusive -- suggest that acid  rain is shrinking the eastern Canadian duck population, killing off vast  swathes of maple trees and turning proud marble edifices into spongy masses  that can be sliced with a knife.    Tourism officials have complained bitterly that in killing the fish, acid rain  is also strangling one of the few successful industries in rocky and  undeveloped north-central Canada.    Acidic lakes look unnaturally lovely -- ""like your average swimming pool,  aquamarine blue and clear,"" says Michael Perley, secretary-treasurer of the  Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain. But tourists come to this part of Canada to  fish, not to admire blue waters. And the reason the lakes look so crystalline  is that nothing can live in them. ""If you snorkel in one, there's nothing but a  mat of filamentous algae on the bottom,"" says Perley. ""At a quick glance, it  sort of looks like Astroturf.""    Research on hospitalizations in southern Ontario show that more people are  treated for emphysema, bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory problems  during the summer acid rain season than at other times of the year.    Despite such hazards, Canadians say, the United States has resisted pressure to  take corrective action for a decade.    Now, however, even some of this country's most outspoken environmental critics  have changed their tune.    ""I think that this is going to be the year for acid rain control in the United  States,"" says Perley, whose group has done more than any other to channel this  country's exasperation with the United States.    Perley and others base their optimism on pollution control measures that would  be required under the U.S. Senate's version of the Clean Air Act, which is  expected to become law this summer.    The provisions would mean that the flow of acid rain-causing emissions into  Canada would be cut in half by the turn of the century -- enough of a change  that most of this country's acidic lakes could naturally revert to their  pristine state within five to 10 years.    ""The lakes will improve spontaneously,"" says Peter Dillon, manager of the  Ontario Ministry of the Environment's aquatics research center in Dorset. ""The  chemistry will revert to its original state, and the biological organisms will  follow suit, more slowly.""    All it takes, he says, is for the polluters to reduce their emission levels,  and the process will start.    ""The movement on acid rain is encouraging,"" agrees Derek Burney, Canada's  ambassador to the United States. ""It can't help but add an element of  productivity"" to U.S.-Canadian relations, he said.    Back in the 1980s, he explains, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and  former President Ronald Reagan spent much of the time they were together mired  in unproductive haggling over acid rain. With the dispute poised to become  history, he said, Mulroney and President Bush will have more time to focus on  broader issues.    Canadians credit their own intensive lobbying, growing understanding of the  problem and dramatic differences in outlook between the Bush and Reagan White  Houses. And while optimistic, they stress that more can still be done.    Even after most of Canada's dead lakes revive, they say, one-third or more of  them will still be dangerously acidic.    ""We'll still be pushing for even more emission controls in the future,"" says  Dillon. ""We want more than two-thirds of the lakes to recover. We'd like to be  up in the neighborhood of 95%.""    Still, he says, the outlook is vastly better than it was not long ago, when  Canadians feared it would take 40 years before their waters could sustain fish  again.    Until 1986, Canadians were putting all their hopes into dumping crushed  limestone -- which neutralizes acid just like an enormous dose of Rolaids --  into their lakes. But experiments showed that the cost was impossibly high:  $80,000 for a medium-sized lake. Thousands of lakes needed treatment, and the  process would have to be repeated every few years.    Canadians have been worrying about acid rain since the 1970s. And early on,  they had American support. Scientists in both countries knew that a number of  lakes on both sides of the border were becoming too acidic to sustain life, and  they believed there was a connection between the acidity and the burning of  fossil fuels.    The scientists didn't understand the link fully, but even so, then-President  Jimmy Carter's Environmental Protection Agency was concerned enough to sign a  memorandum of understanding with Canada, appoint technical experts and begin  negotiating an acid-rain treaty.    The process went off track with Carter's loss to Reagan in 1980, however.  Reagan's EPA appointed new acid-rain negotiators, and government attention  turned from environmentalism to economics. With so much uncertainty about the  causes of acid rain, the new technicians said, it would be a mistake to spend  vast sums of money on a cleanup. What if industry were forced to lavish  millions on cleanup methods that didn't work?    The new approach definitely saved money for industry, but it cost the United  States dearly in good relations with its northern neighbor.    Reagan-era negotiators did little but go through the motions for a couple of  years, said Kai Millyard, policy director of Friends of the Earth in Ottawa.  ""Then the whole (treaty process) was shut down at the end of 1982,"" Millyard  adds.    The Americans did have a point, though, when they said there was risk in  attacking the problem with a bad solution. Acid rain is itself the result of an  earlier attempt to solve the air-pollution woes of America's rust belt.    Years ago, power plants and factories burning fossil fuels had relatively short  smokestacks; the sulfur dioxide they emitted used to hang low over the  landscape, rusting cars and ruining house paint. Pressured to solve the  problem, the power plants built very tall smokestacks in an effort to shoot the  sulfur dioxide high into the atmosphere, where it supposedly would harmlessly  disperse.    Instead of dispersing, though, the sulfur dioxide entered the massive weather  systems of the upper Midwest and was ferried across the continent for hundreds  of miles. At some point, high in the atmosphere, it underwent chemical  reactions -- this is the stage scientists don't fully understand -- and turned  into sulfuric acid. It then came raining or snowing down onto the landscape,  far from the source.    Acid precipitation has showered down on both countries, but it does more damage  to Canada than to the United States because Canada was glaciated long ago and  lacks America's abundant topsoil.

0,FT921-3256 ,"FT921-3256 _AN-CCPB5AADFT 920316   FT  16 MAR 92 / Killing turns spotlight on Mafia political links      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   THE links between Italy's ruling Christian Democrats and the Mafia have become an important issue in the Italian election campaign following last week's assassination of Mr Salvatore Lima, the party's most influential politician in Sicily. Magistrates believe the killers of Mr Lima, a European parliament deputy, were Mafia gunmen. But the motives are the subject of intense speculation. The government maintains the killing was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the campaign for the April 5 election. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, has also suggested the murder was an indirect attack on himself since Mr Lima was his pro-consul in Sicily. Indeed, for the past three days Mr Andreotti has been on the defensive, justifying his friendship with Mr Lima and protecting the latter's good name against suggestions of links with the Mafia which are highly damaging to Mr Andreotti. The affair risks bringing under public scrutiny the long-standing Christian Democrat practice of relying on Mafia votes. Another theory for the killing is that the leading Mafia families wanted to show their displeasure over the authorities' tougher attitude towards organised crime. Since the Second World War, the Mafia has been used behind the scenes in Sicilian politics by the Christian Democrats to help fight communism and to maintain the party's share of votes. The collapse of communism has thus reduced the Mafia's political role, while the spread of organised crime throughout Italy has obliged the government to devote more energy and resources to fighting the Mafia. But the most commonly held view is that Mr Lima was murdered in a Mafia settlement of accounts. He is alleged to have long acted as an intermediary in the murky world where politics and organised crime meet. As a former mayor of Palermo, Mr Lima was responsible for the city's new urban plan in the Sixties which encouraged a speculative property boom dominated by the Mafia. At least four times in the Seventies, parliament unsuccessfully tried to investigate his links with the construction business and the Mafia. But he was the Christian Democrats' most effective operator in Sicily and had powerful friends like Mr Andreotti. Indeed, Mr Lima acted as if he was 'untouchable' and was one of the few politicians who felt a body-guard unnecessary. Two magistrates are expected to leave shortly for the US to clarify Mr Lima's connections with the Mafia, questioning Mr Tommaso Buscetta and Mr Francesco Marino Mannoia. The latter are prominent former members of the Mafia, who have been co-operating both with the US and Italian authorities in return for immunity.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

His wife, Cindy,  bore the couple's third child a week after her husband's death.      No Death Penalty    Although the murder occurred during an attempted robbery -- a special  circumstance that could bring the death penalty -- prosecutors decided not to  seek Taylor's execution because they had no witnesses who saw the killing, only  the events preceding and following Lim's death.

Atty. Craig Richman. He  will be sentenced Aug. 30.    None of Lim's family, who continue to operate the restaurant, were present to  hear the verdict.    Taylor was impassive as the verdict was read, but then told Judge Ronald S.  Coen that he wanted to ""say his piece"" and tell the jurors that ""I hope they  really found in their hearts that I am guilty.""    Four witnesses -- two of Lim's employees, a customer and a woman who was in the  parking lot of the mini-mall -- testified during the 3-week trial. Richman  argued that their descriptions of Taylor's actions at the restaurant clearly  fit the pattern of a robbery, despite defense contentions that Taylor might  have killed Lim for some other reason.    Taylor entered the restaurant about 3:10 p.m. and asked employee Rajinder Kaur  for the key to a bathroom located outside the restaurant.    Augustin Dominquez, who was flown in from Guadalajara, Mexico, to testify, said  he was in the parking lot and watched as Taylor entered the bathroom, closed  the door slightly and peered out into the parking lot. Dominquez said Taylor  then went back into the restaurant.      Carried Gun    Kaur, testifying through a Punjabi interpreter, said Taylor came behind the  counter with the key in one hand and pointing a gun at her with the other. Lim  emerged from the kitchen and began shouting at Taylor, saying he was not  allowed in the employee area of the restaurant. Taylor whirled to face Lim and  Kaur fled, she said.    Lim was found with a single bullet wound in the head at the back door of the  restaurant. He died later that day. No money was taken, officers said.    Taylor was arrested by Los Angeles police more than four months later, in  March, 1988, after his palm print was found on the back of the rear-view mirror  of a car identified as the getaway car.    The car had been stolen the afternoon of the killing and abandoned afterward.  Police said they found items stolen from the car at Taylor's house.    Maria Duarte testified that she was in the parking lot when she heard shots and  saw Taylor run out of the restaurant and speed away in the car.    A second man who sat in the restaurant eating area and served as a lookout  during the robbery has not been identified.

China conceded Taiwan's demand that fishing disputes involving intrusions into each other's territorial waters should be handled by agencies with law enforcement powers, officials said. On Tuesday, China sent a letter to Taiwan, complaining that Taipei's military had opened fire on Chinese fishing boats when they entered waters around the Taiwan-held island of Quemoy, killing or injuring mainland fishermen.

Many scientists and environmental activists believe the deaths are the  inevitable outcome of large-scale dumping of toxic pollutants in the  Mediterranean by petrochemical plants.    Esteve Grau, a University of Barcelona biologist, said preliminary results of  autopsies on three of the dead mammals showed extremely high levels of  polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.    ""We're working on the hypothesis that the dolphins ate PCB-contaminated fish  and that this severely weakened their immune systems, making them susceptible  to a still-unidentified virus,"" Grau said in a telephone interview.

He said some of the dead dolphins had been found on beaches near Palma, in the  Balearic archipelago 150 miles south of Barcelona.    Grau and other scientists from the Barcelona Zoo, the Marineland Aquatic Park  and the University of Valencia have conducted 10 autopsies on dolphins. They  are trying to determine why only striped dolphin, and not fish, have been  killed, he said.    Joaquim Piza of Marineland said doubts remain about whether PCBs caused the  dolphins to die.    ""If that were the case, it's most likely dolphins of other species would have  been affected,"" he said.    ""The autopsies have not produced conclusive evidence that the PCBs are the  cause. The only thing we have been able to determine so far with certainty is  that the dolphins suffered a weakening of their immune systems.""    Piza said there was some speculation the dolphins had contracted a herpes-type  virus that attacked their immune systems.    Between 12 and 20 infirm or aged striped dolphins are found washed up every  summer on Spain's eastern beaches and on Majorca, Grau said, but there have  been more than 100 this year. He said the striped dolphin is not an endangered  species and is abundant in the Mediterranean.    Scientists fear that the presence of PCBs eventually may reduce the number of  dolphins by affecting reproduction in addition to killing the weaker ones, Grau  said.

Pastor noted that industrial and chemical companies continue dumping tons of  toxic waste, including PCBs, into the Mediterranean from plants along Spain's  Mediterranean coast from Barcelona to Algeciras, adjacent to Gibraltar.    ""We've called on Spain's autonomous regional governments and the central  government in Madrid to set up a plan to gradually, but definitively, end all  industrial toxic waste dumping into the Mediterranean by the end of 1991,"" he  said.

'The fight against terrorism has not finished, an enormous challenge lies ahead,' he said. But Escobar's killing in a big police raid should hasten surrender of rival traffickers, and representatives of some of the top Cali smugglers, rivals to the Medellin cartel, have apparently contacted the prosecutor general's office to discuss terms. Legislation passed recently makes surrender more attractive, with the possibility of minimal sentences under house arrest. Escobar was buried yesterday at a chaotic funeral punctuated by the chants of thousands of slum-dwelling mourners who considered him a Robin Hood figure.

The effectiveness of the English criminal justice system has been seriously weakened by miscarriages of justice perpetrated at times of public outrage after horrible terrorist bombings. A series of vicious attacks by dogs two years ago produced the Dangerous Dogs Act which has failed to rid Britain of killer dogs but provided lawyers with work defining breeds. There is a similar peril in the present moral panic over the killing on Merseyside of a two-year-old boy, apparently by older children. The intense media coverage has led many to suppose that the UK has become engulfed in a tide of violent crime. Several recent news stories have been cheaply and misleadingly linked to suggest that children are at the forefront of the crimewave. Recorded crime rates have certainly risen, as in almost every other advanced economy. But fear of crime has risen much faster. And there is, sadly, nothing new about children killing other children - as those with memories long enough to remember the case of Mary Bell will know. Such considerations count for little, however, when politicians scent an issue of popular concern. The parties vie to demonstrate their commitment to ever-stronger measures, with little consideration of their efficacy. The prime minister is right to call for greater condemnation of violent crime. But his corollary of less effort to understand the criminal is exactly what is not needed. Much more work is required to examine the many factors which lie behind increased crime rates. These include unemployment, which has left pockets of deprivation in many large cities where crime is seen as the only way of acquiring material wealth. There is the failure of schools which send 40 per cent of students to further education colleges with inadequate numeracy and literacy skills, along with vocational training system still very much in the throes of uncertain reform. There is the erosion of the nuclear family, which provided two adults to share the burden of parenthood. And there is the question of violence in the media, which may create an impression that violence is the norm. There is also the easy availability of drugs, trafficking in which offers financial rewards way beyond those possible through hard work. Those attractions are enhanced at a time of few job opportunities for young people with no qualifications. There will be disagreements over the weight to be assigned to each of these and to many other relevant factors. But anyone who hopes to contribute to solutions must recognise that dealing with this complex issue needs multifaceted policies managed with skill and determination over long periods. That is the note the government needs to strike in the coming days.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  GOVT  Legal issues.

GEN.;    OFFICIALS BLAME LEFTISTS, SEE PLOT TO STEM U.S. AID      By KENNETH FREED, Times Staff Writer      SAN SALVADOR      The attorney general of El Salvador was assassinated Wednesday in what  government and U.S. officials said was part of a leftist strategy to provoke a  bloody government reaction that would endanger American support and prove the  country ungovernable.    Roberto Garcia Alvarado, 53, was killed when an unknown assailant placed a bomb  on top of his car as it was stopped at a traffic light in the Don Rua section  of San Salvador at about 7:45 a.m.    Military and U.S. officials said the attorney general was on his way to work,  riding in the back seat of a Jeep Cherokee equipped with bulletproof windows  and armored sides. A driver and a bodyguard sat in front while an escort car  followed.    However, a man who had been in the back of a pickup truck walked calmly up to  the Cherokee, placed a bomb on top -- evidently attached by a magnet -- and  walked away. Garcia Alvarado's driver tried to accelerate, thinking the  movement would dislodge the explosive, but it blew up. The blast peeled away  the top of the car and killed the official immediately. The driver and  bodyguard were slightly wounded, police said.    No one took immediate responsibility for Garcia Alvarado's slaying. But  American officials, Salvadoran military officers and President-elect Alfredo  Cristiani blamed the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), a  Marxist guerrilla group, for the assassination.    Although the guerrillas neither acknowledged nor denied the assassination, the  front named him in a radio broadcast on March 17 as ""covering up for  murderers.""    Garcia Alvarado was named attorney general by the National Assembly last  December after the legislative body had removed his predecessor, Roberto Giron  Flores, for allegedly being too soft on the FMLN and its sympathizers.    Although not a member of the ultra right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance,  or Arena, party, which is headed by Cristiani and controls the Assembly, Garcia  Alvarado was a close associate of the incoming president and was known for his  hard-line views for fighting El Salvador's nine-year civil war.    He was the highest ranking civilian official killed in the strife since 1980,  when then-Atty. Gen. Mario Zamora was slain by right-wing death squads.    His death was the third killing of a right-wing figure in three months. Also,  last Friday, a powerful bomb exploded at the house of Vice President-elect  Francisco Merino, but he was not there at the time. All of the attacks have  been blamed on the FMLN, although the guerrillas denied the Merino bombing.      Pair of Killings    Last Feb. 18, the FMLN acknowledged killing Miguel Castellano, a former  guerrilla leader who had defected to the government. The rebels also took  responsibility for murdering Francisco Peccorini, a dual American-Salvadoran  citizen who once taught at Cal State Long Beach. Peccorini was targeted by the  rebels for leading a drive to oust leftists from the National University, a  stronghold of guerrilla supporters.    In addition, the guerrillas have murdered at least eight mayors in the past  year and has used death threats to force the resignation of more than 100 other  local officials. The rationale has been that mayors are legitimate military  targets because they collaborate with the government's anti-insurgency effort.    In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that since  no one had taken responsibility for the Garcia Alvarado slaying, she could not  specifically accuse the FMLN. But in San Salvador, U.S. Ambassador William  Walker did not hesitate to name the guerrillas.    ""To me,"" he told American reporters, ""it quite obviously is an attempt by the  guerrillas, the FMLN, to provoke a violent reaction, a nasty reaction, by . . .  the newly elected government or the armed forces to their acts of barbarism.""    Walker called Wednesday's killing, the deaths of Castellano and Peccorini and  the Merino bombing ""pure urban terrorism.""    The FMLN, he said, ""definitely is trying to drag this place back to the  violence of the early 1980s,"" when military- and government-supported death  squads were killing people at the rate of 800 a month.      Cristiani Blames Rebels    Cristiani learned of the attack while having breakfast with foreign reporters.  He quickly asserted that ""it was the work of the FMLN. It shows the problems of  trying to impose justice in this country."" He added that ""the attorney general  had been very hard and very clear on how he was going to make sure the law was  respected.""    Cristiani, who takes over the presidency June 1 from the centrist Christian  Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte, agreed with Walker; the rebels want to  provoke a violent reaction, he said, ""to make the nation ungovernable by the  time I take office.""    This theory holds that a bloody government retaliation would reawaken  international concerns -- particularly in the United States -- that El  Salvador's government is a collection of murderous thugs that should lose  American economic and military aid, which now averages nearly $1.5 million a  day.    The strategy, Walker, Cristiani and others assert, is also aimed at marshaling  international opinion to force the government to negotiate with the FMLN on  sharing power in order to end the bloodshed.    Garcia Alvarado himself targeted the rebels and their supporters for more  aggressive government action, saying when he took office that the army and the  government were being pressured, presumably by the United States, into paying  too much attention to the human rights of the leftists.    Although the U.S. Embassy, Cristiani and other Arena party leaders play down  the possibility, there are signs that the retaliation has already begun. In the  last few weeks, two leaders of anti-government groups accused by rightists of  being front groups for the guerrillas have been kidnaped, tortured and  murdered.    Earlier this week, Vice President-elect Merino publicly named several  civilians, including a Spanish priest, as responsible for the bombing of his  house, although he produced no evidence. In the past, such an action has been  tantamount to publishing a death list.    And late last week, the army press office issued a similar list, naming the  human rights office of the Roman Catholic Church as a guerrilla front and  running a picture of human rights advocate Maria Julia Hernandez on national  television.

Adele Kathy Rodriguez pleaded guilty earlier this month in Van Nuys Superior  Court to second-degree murder after admitting that she strangled Stanley  Wittman, 68, with a shoulder strap from a pair of overalls. The victim's  decomposed body was found Sept. 15, 1988, by the building manager in the  couple's apartment in the 5400 block of Newcastle Avenue.    The couple had been arguing about Rodriguez's romantic involvement with another  woman, Nancy Ortiz, at the time of the slaying, authorities said.

Under pressure to solve the 1984 assassination, the government last month  arrested the former commander of Mexico's secret police and accused him of  masterminding ""Operation News"" -- the killing of Buendia.    Rather than quiet the clamor, however, the arrest has unraveled a dark network  of secret-police officials implicated in everything from drug trafficking to  murder.    Seven more members of the defunct Federal Security Directorate have since been  jailed, including two who had become co-directors of the Mexico City police  department's intelligence unit. The government then dismantled the  controversial intelligence unit where, it turned out, most of the former secret  police had found work.    The Buendia case has all the elements of a thriller -- an alleged gunman  subsequently shot dead in a telephone booth, contradictory testimony from  another jailed ""gunman."" But it is unfolding in daily newspapers and magazines,  where Mexican journalists are asking very serious questions about how high the  corruption might have reached.    Did former President Miguel de la Madrid find out who killed Buendia? What  about his interior secretary, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, who was responsible for the  police force? The media suggest that Bartlett Diaz, now education secretary,  and former Mexico City Atty. Gen. Victoria Adato, now a Supreme Court justice,  may have participated in a five-year cover-up of the killing.    Delivering his final report on the case last Friday, special prosecutor Miguel  Angel Garcia Dominguez asserted the contrary.      Support Cited    ""President De la Madrid and Interior Secretary Bartlett gave me their complete  support for solving the case,"" Garcia Dominguez said.    Although many questions remain unanswered, the case has shed light on other  crimes such as the 1985 torture-death of U.S. drug agent Enrique S. Camarena  and a San Diego-to-Mexico City car theft ring. Like the Buendia killing, both  involved members of the Federal Security Directorate.    A police source explained: ""The commanders had become powerful. They controlled  not only their people but the movement of illegal merchandise, drug  trafficking, arms, cars -- anything where money could be made in grand scale.    ""The Buendia and Camarena killings were not directly related, except the common  denominator was the Federal Security Directorate. The people made so much  money, and they were so powerful, that they felt unstoppable.    ""Why kill a Buendia and a Camarena? Why kill anyone else who stands in your  way? Because they're in your way. These are the most notable cases, but many  other people were killed or disappeared as they became a threat.""    Buendia, who routinely published exposes in his ""Private Network"" column in the  Excelsior newspaper, was shot in the back at a parking lot next to his office  in the busy Zona Rosa neighborhood on the afternoon of May 30, 1984.    The columnist had made so many powerful enemies over the years that theories  quickly abounded on his murder. There were more than 275 hypotheses and dozens  of suspects. Among them: the CIA, oil workers union chief Joaquin Hernandez  Galicia and a violent right-wing group from Guadalajara.    Also among the early suspects was Jose Antonio Zorrilla, commander of the  secret Security Directorate. Zorrilla appeared at the scene within minutes of  the murder and, it was said, sent his men directly to Buendia's office to  remove incriminating evidence.    Many dismissed Zorrilla as a suspect because he was a source for Buendia --  even, some would say, something of a friend. Weeks before he was killed,  Buendia had written a column praising Zorrilla and the work by the security  police. The two had practiced target shooting together, and Zorrilla gave  Buendia a gun as a present.    But it was also said that Buendia was about to publish information linking  Zorrilla to drug traffickers. Zorrilla himself took up the initial  investigation, although the case was outside his jurisdiction.    President De la Madrid condemned the killing and promised action, but Proceso  magazine, which has followed the case closely, charges that a cover-up soon  began. An official investigation, delivered to Mexico City Atty. Gen. Adato 14  months after the killing, named former police agent Jose Luis Ochoa Alonso as  the ""material author,"" or gunman. Ochoa, called El Chocorrol (Chocolate Roll)  because of his dark skin, reportedly worked for Zorrilla until he was killed  six weeks after Buendia while making a call at a public telephone.    Proceso notes that a month after receiving the report, Adato declared the  assassination was ""not political"" and stated that there were an array of  suspects. De la Madrid named her to the Supreme Court, and her successor in the  attorney general's office, Renato Sales Gasque, said he had to begin the case  over again.    In February, 1987, Sales also announced the Buendia killing was ""not a  political case, but a police case."" He said El Chocorrol had been eliminated as  a suspect for lack of evidence. In January, 1988, the government assigned  Garcia Dominguez as special prosecutor on the case, and he too said he would  begin the Buendia investigation from scratch.    President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office last Dec. 1 vowing, like his  predecessor, to clean up government corruption. But unlike De la Madrid, who  stopped after jailing two government officials, Salinas has kept up a steady  pattern of arrests: union chief Hernandez Galicia, stock market tycoon Eduardo  Legorreta, reputed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and other lesser-known  traffickers and officials.    Opposition politicians charge that Salinas is undertaking a series of  publicity-seeking ""spectacular blows"" without fighting systematic corruption.  But Ed Heath, the departing chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  here, disagrees.    ""There is somebody at the top to start to set new standards. . . . There is at  least the outward conviction of a leader who says, 'I want this changed.' A lot  of people in the lower ranks of state and federal law enforcement are fearful  they might lose their jobs now because the Mexican government is trying to  clean up this problem. We are very encouraged by what we see,"" Heath said.    On June 12, the government announced that former police commander Zorrilla was  the ""intellectual author"" of the Buendia murder. Zorrilla was not at home when  police first arrived to arrest him, but he was picked up at another residence  days later.    A week later, former secret police officer Juan Rafael Moro Avila was arrested.  Moro Avila, a mustachioed part-time actor and motorcycle enthusiast, took the  spotlight before a roomful of reporters to make his defense. Ochoa, or El  Chocorrol, was the real assassin, he said, and was killed to keep him from  talking. Officials also said El Chocorrol was the gunman.    Moro Avila told reporters that Zorrilla ordered his underlings -- Jorge  Maldonado, Raul Perez Carmona and Juventino Prado -- to commit the murder. On  the day of the crime, Moro Avila said, he was having lunch at a restaurant when  Prado called him over a police radio to go by motorcycle to the Zona Rosa.    When he reached a downtown intersection, Moro Avila added, Carmona said to  wait. A few minutes later he heard gunshots.    But in a later statement, Moro Avila changed his story. He said he arrived  after the murder had taken place and saw Buendia's body lying on the sidewalk.  In both versions, El Chocorrol got on the back of Moro Avila's motorcycle and  the two sped away. Moro Avila claims, however, that he did not know Ochoa was  the murderer until after he was killed.    Ochoa ""was not a friend of mine. I don't associate with dark-skinned people,  only with fine people,"" Moro Avila said.    Despite Moro Avila's conflicting declarations, the government arrested  Juventino Prado and Raul Perez Carmona, heads of the Mexico City Intelligence  Directorate, and former security agents Sofia Naya, Jorge Lozada and Francisco  Orozco.    Zorrilla, like everybody else, denies involvement in the killing or a cover-up.  It is not the first time, however, that officials have linked him to criminal  activities.    Police sources say that Zorrilla was on the payroll of Rafael Caro Quintero,  the reputed drug lord who is in jail for the 1985 kidnaping and murder of the  Guadalajara-based U.S. drug agent Camarena.    At least half a dozen witnesses in Garcia Dominguez's official investigation of  the Buendia case said Zorrilla received money and cars from Caro Quintero and  payoffs from sub-commanders who worked for drug traffickers throughout Mexico.  One police source said Caro Quintero admitted during interrogation that he paid  Zorrilla $4 million a year for protection.    Caro Quintero and his men also carried security police credentials signed by  Zorrilla. Although investigators on the Camarena case saw the credentials, they  later disappeared when the investigation was turned over to the Federal  Security Directorate.    U.S. officials have long believed that security police were present during the  interrogation and torture of Camarena.    The Federal Security Directorate, a secret intelligence agency, was used in the  1970s to combat urban and rural guerrilla groups and was headed from 1977 to  1982 by Miguel Nazar Haro. Nazar resigned from the post after he was indicted  in San Diego in connection with a luxury car-theft ring. Some of the stolen  vehicles turned up in the possession of security agents. Prado, Perez Carmona  and two other police officials also were indicted in the San Diego case.    Nazar Haro turned over command of the security directorate to Zorrilla. By  then, the agency had a reputation of torturing political opponents and making  them ""disappear.""    ""They controlled the state police, and the Federal Judicial Police was  subservient to them. They came from the most powerful institution outside of  the presidency -- the Interior Ministry,"" a police source said.    ""Maybe they were asked to do things they were later owed a favor for. The  organization gained strength under Nazar Haro, and he continued to have a very  close relationship with these people. It's a fraternity. There was some loyalty  to Nazar Haro and some to the new man, Zorrilla.""    Zorrilla resigned his command in 1985 after the Camarena killing and news leaks  of Zorrilla's alleged ties to drug traffickers. The police agency was disbanded  that year.    Nazar Haro turned up again this year as head of the newly created Intelligence  Directorate. His appointment angered U.S. officials and caused such an uproar  among human rights activists that he was forced to resign. Prado and Perez  Carmona took his place.    Once Prado and Perez Carmona were arrested, hundreds of other intelligence  agents reportedly resigned or deserted the force. The agency was eliminated.    But the intrigue continues. Garcia Dominguez announced last week that Zorrilla  was responsible for another murder in 1985, that of Jose Luis Esqueda  Gutierrez, who allegedly possessed evidence connecting Zorrilla to drug  traffickers.    ""The motive for taking the lives of Buendia and Esqueda Gutierrez was the  knowledge they both had on Zorrilla's links to drug traffickers,"" Garcia  Dominguez said.    The prosecutor insisted the gunman who killed Buendia was not the dead  Chocorrol, but Moro Avila, even though Moro Avila does not fit the sketch of  the suspect drawn from witnesses' accounts. He said the evidence Zorrilla had  removed from Buendia's office consisted of cassette recordings of two telephone  conversations in which Buendia had advised Zorrilla of the information he had  allegedly linking the police commander to traffickers.    The Buendia case appeared solved, except that also last week, Mexican  newspapers reported another murder. A jailed police officer, Abel Cuevas  Uriostegui, was shot dead Wednesday night, allegedly as he led police to the  houses of two former Federal Security Directorate agents -- the agents who  supposedly were responsible for Esqueda Gutierrez's murder.    This week, officials arrested another former commander of the Federal Security  Directorate, Rafael Chao Lopez, who was second to Zorrilla. Chao was detained  on charges of illicit enrichment that allegedly stemmed from drug and weapons  trafficking.

Under pressure to solve the 1984 assassination, the government last month  arrested the former commander of Mexico's secret police and accused him of  masterminding ""Operation News"" -- the killing of Buendia.    Rather than quiet the clamor, however, the arrest has unraveled a dark network  of secret-police officials implicated in everything from drug trafficking to  murder.    Seven more members of the defunct Federal Security Directorate have since been  jailed, including two who had become co-directors of the Mexico City police  department's intelligence unit. The government then dismantled the  controversial intelligence unit where, it turned out, most of the former secret  police had found work.    The Buendia case has all the elements of a thriller -- an alleged gunman  subsequently shot dead in a telephone booth, contradictory testimony from  another jailed ""gunman."" But it is unfolding in daily newspapers and magazines,  where Mexican journalists are asking very serious questions about how high the  corruption might have reached.    Did former President Miguel de la Madrid find out who killed Buendia? What  about his interior secretary, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, who was responsible for the  police force? The media suggest that Bartlett Diaz, now education secretary,  and former Mexico City Atty. Gen. Victoria Adato, now a Supreme Court justice,  may have participated in a five-year cover-up of the killing.    Delivering his final report on the case last Friday, special prosecutor Miguel  Angel Garcia Dominguez asserted the contrary.      Support Cited    ""President De la Madrid and Interior Secretary Bartlett gave me their complete  support for solving the case,"" Garcia Dominguez said.    Although many questions remain unanswered, the case has shed light on other  crimes such as the 1985 torture-death of U.S. drug agent Enrique S. Camarena  and a San Diego-to-Mexico City car theft ring. Like the Buendia killing, both  involved members of the Federal Security Directorate.    A police source explained: ""The commanders had become powerful. They controlled  not only their people but the movement of illegal merchandise, drug  trafficking, arms, cars -- anything where money could be made in grand scale.    ""The Buendia and Camarena killings were not directly related, except the common  denominator was the Federal Security Directorate. The people made so much  money, and they were so powerful, that they felt unstoppable.    ""Why kill a Buendia and a Camarena? Why kill anyone else who stands in your  way? Because they're in your way. These are the most notable cases, but many  other people were killed or disappeared as they became a threat.""    Buendia, who routinely published exposes in his ""Private Network"" column in the  Excelsior newspaper, was shot in the back at a parking lot next to his office  in the busy Zona Rosa neighborhood on the afternoon of May 30, 1984.    The columnist had made so many powerful enemies over the years that theories  quickly abounded on his murder. There were more than 275 hypotheses and dozens  of suspects. Among them: the CIA, oil workers union chief Joaquin Hernandez  Galicia and a violent right-wing group from Guadalajara.    Also among the early suspects was Jose Antonio Zorrilla, commander of the  secret Security Directorate. Zorrilla appeared at the scene within minutes of  the murder and, it was said, sent his men directly to Buendia's office to  remove incriminating evidence.    Many dismissed Zorrilla as a suspect because he was a source for Buendia --  even, some would say, something of a friend. Weeks before he was killed,  Buendia had written a column praising Zorrilla and the work by the security  police. The two had practiced target shooting together, and Zorrilla gave  Buendia a gun as a present.    But it was also said that Buendia was about to publish information linking  Zorrilla to drug traffickers. Zorrilla himself took up the initial  investigation, although the case was outside his jurisdiction.    President De la Madrid condemned the killing and promised action, but Proceso  magazine, which has followed the case closely, charges that a cover-up soon  began. An official investigation, delivered to Mexico City Atty. Gen. Adato 14  months after the killing, named former police agent Jose Luis Ochoa Alonso as  the ""material author,"" or gunman. Ochoa, called El Chocorrol (Chocolate Roll)  because of his dark skin, reportedly worked for Zorrilla until he was killed  six weeks after Buendia while making a call at a public telephone.    Proceso notes that a month after receiving the report, Adato declared the  assassination was ""not political"" and stated that there were an array of  suspects. De la Madrid named her to the Supreme Court, and her successor in the  attorney general's office, Renato Sales Gasque, said he had to begin the case  over again.    In February, 1987, Sales also announced the Buendia killing was ""not a  political case, but a police case."" He said El Chocorrol had been eliminated as  a suspect for lack of evidence. In January, 1988, the government assigned  Garcia Dominguez as special prosecutor on the case, and he too said he would  begin the Buendia investigation from scratch.    President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office last Dec. 1 vowing, like his  predecessor, to clean up government corruption. But unlike De la Madrid, who  stopped after jailing two government officials, Salinas has kept up a steady  pattern of arrests: union chief Hernandez Galicia, stock market tycoon Eduardo  Legorreta, reputed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and other lesser-known  traffickers and officials.    Opposition politicians charge that Salinas is undertaking a series of  publicity-seeking ""spectacular blows"" without fighting systematic corruption.  But Ed Heath, the departing chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  here, disagrees.    ""There is somebody at the top to start to set new standards. . . . There is at  least the outward conviction of a leader who says, 'I want this changed.' A lot  of people in the lower ranks of state and federal law enforcement are fearful  they might lose their jobs now because the Mexican government is trying to  clean up this problem. We are very encouraged by what we see,"" Heath said.    On June 12, the government announced that former police commander Zorrilla was  the ""intellectual author"" of the Buendia murder. Zorrilla was not at home when  police first arrived to arrest him, but he was picked up at another residence  days later.    A week later, former secret police officer Juan Rafael Moro Avila was arrested.  Moro Avila, a mustachioed part-time actor and motorcycle enthusiast, took the  spotlight before a roomful of reporters to make his defense. Ochoa, or El  Chocorrol, was the real assassin, he said, and was killed to keep him from  talking. Officials also said El Chocorrol was the gunman.    Moro Avila told reporters that Zorrilla ordered his underlings -- Jorge  Maldonado, Raul Perez Carmona and Juventino Prado -- to commit the murder. On  the day of the crime, Moro Avila said, he was having lunch at a restaurant when  Prado called him over a police radio to go by motorcycle to the Zona Rosa.    When he reached a downtown intersection, Moro Avila added, Carmona said to  wait. A few minutes later he heard gunshots.    But in a later statement, Moro Avila changed his story. He said he arrived  after the murder had taken place and saw Buendia's body lying on the sidewalk.  In both versions, El Chocorrol got on the back of Moro Avila's motorcycle and  the two sped away. Moro Avila claims, however, that he did not know Ochoa was  the murderer until after he was killed.    Ochoa ""was not a friend of mine. I don't associate with dark-skinned people,  only with fine people,"" Moro Avila said.    Despite Moro Avila's conflicting declarations, the government arrested  Juventino Prado and Raul Perez Carmona, heads of the Mexico City Intelligence  Directorate, and former security agents Sofia Naya, Jorge Lozada and Francisco  Orozco.    Zorrilla, like everybody else, denies involvement in the killing or a cover-up.  It is not the first time, however, that officials have linked him to criminal  activities.    Police sources say that Zorrilla was on the payroll of Rafael Caro Quintero,  the reputed drug lord who is in jail for the 1985 kidnaping and murder of the  Guadalajara-based U.S. drug agent Camarena.    At least half a dozen witnesses in Garcia Dominguez's official investigation of  the Buendia case said Zorrilla received money and cars from Caro Quintero and  payoffs from sub-commanders who worked for drug traffickers throughout Mexico.  One police source said Caro Quintero admitted during interrogation that he paid  Zorrilla $4 million a year for protection.    Caro Quintero and his men also carried security police credentials signed by  Zorrilla. Although investigators on the Camarena case saw the credentials, they  later disappeared when the investigation was turned over to the Federal  Security Directorate.    U.S. officials have long believed that security police were present during the  interrogation and torture of Camarena.    The Federal Security Directorate, a secret intelligence agency, was used in the  1970s to combat urban and rural guerrilla groups and was headed from 1977 to  1982 by Miguel Nazar Haro.

0,FT942-17111 ,"FT942-17111 _AN-EDGDVAAFFT 940407   FT  07 APR 94 / Suicide car bomb attack kills eight in Israel: Revenge attack by Islamic extremists fails to derail Cairo peace talks      By JULIAN OZANNE and MARK NICHOLSON      AFULA, NORTHERN ISRAEL, CAIRO   A suicide car bomber blew up a bus in Israel yesterday killing eight people and wounding at least 45. The extremist Islamic Hamas movement said it carried out the attack in revenge for the massacre of Palestinians in Hebron in February. Witnesses said children fled the explosion 'burning like torches' when the 385lb bomb exploded at midday at a central bus stop in the relatively peaceful northern town of Afula. The attack, one of the bloodiest yet seen inside Israel itself, prompted the government to seal off the occupied territories preventing Palestinian cars crossing into the Jewish state. The bomb blast coincided with talks in Cairo between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on implementing their peace deal. However, Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, said the peace talks would continue. Otherwise 'we are placing ourselves in the hands of these suicide bombers - and that is their wish'. The bombing by Hamas, which had vowed to avenge the lives of 29 Palestinians massacred by a Jewish settler in Hebron, will fuel growing Israeli right-wing opposition to the peace process. As promised, Hamas struck 40 days after the February 25 Hebron massacre  - the mourning period which, in Islam, must be observed before revenge can be taken. The Islamic movement warned Israel that suicide operations would increase. Shlomi Dahn, an 18-year-old schoolboy who ran to the scene after the blast, said screaming people whose clothes were on fire were trying to escape from the bus. 'It was like a battlefield,' he said. 'Bodies and parts of bodies were everywhere and there was blood, noise, smoke - everything like war.' Mr David Harbi, keeper of a music store who rushed to the scene, had burns on his hands where he had tried to douse flames on the victims' clothes. 'It was like the worst nightmare of the Jews,' he said - 'the feeling that if the Arabs have the chance they will drive us into the sea or kill us all'. In the aftermath Arabs in the town were randomly beaten. Israeli teenagers gathered at the charred bus stop to denounce the peace process and the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister. They chanted 'Kill the Arabs', and sang songs praising Dr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who was responsible for the massacre at Hebron. Mr Harbi said: 'The absurd thing was that in one of the school bags I saw Arabic language books. The child was trying to learn Arabic to prepare for the peace. Can you imagine that? If this is the price we have to pay for peace, we don't want it anymore.' Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: Mr Nabil Shaath, who has led the Palestinian delegation in talks with Israel on self-rule for Gaza-Jericho, said such incidents were 'one of the reasons we are pushing for the signing of this agreement - to stop the killing on both sides.' The attack showed the urgent need to complete as soon as possible the details of an Israeli withdrawal, he said. Editorial Comment, Page 17   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

However, we have not lost  hope that the crisis will soon blow over so the state's  constitutional institutions may again become active with the  participation and cooperation of the partners in the coalition  government to implement the document, ease the burden on the  population, and build the modern Yemeni state on modern  foundations that will ensure the sovereignty of law and order,  enhance the role of institutions, nurture respect for  constitutional legitimacy, respect the will of the people, and  be bound by the principle of a peaceful and democratic rotation  of power.    In this effort, we must emphasize our commitment to  inviolable and sacred national parameters, notably unity and  democracy. Unity is the source of the people's strength and is  a guarantee for stability, advancement, and national prosperity.    On this occaion, we renew the call for all disagreements,  contradictions, and problems to be ironed out through the  channels of democratic, objective, and sober dialogue, and  reason and wisdom. The homeland is not the exclusive property of  any one individual, party, or group. Nor has anyone the right  to claim custodianship over unity, the people, or any part of  the homeland. Unity is our people's communal property. We will  not squander our unity no matter what the price. He is in  error who thinks that the solutions to problems lay in  undermining unity or taking the homeland back to the era  preceding 22 May, 1990. The wheels of history have moved forward  and will not turn backward. The solution lay in rectifying  behavior and mistakes and taking a determined stand against all  kinds of corruption and the embezzlement of public money, the  due process of law, accountability, putting the general good of  the homeland before narrow or party interests, dissociation from  parochial affiliations, and desisting from stoking regional,  tribal, and other tendencies. The yardstick by which faith in  the unity of the homeland must be measured is action to advance  the unity of the people. This is because no homeland cannot  remain united unless its citizens share a common will and unless  their loyalty to their respective parties or regions takes  second place to their loyalty to their homeland. The homeland  is a trust that we must keep; the protection of unity is a  sacred national duty. None of us should take lightly any  attempt to tear up our country's unity or plunge it into  sedition or war. It is an unforgivable crime for a Yemeni to  kill his Yemeni brother or for Yemeni blood to be shed by Yemeni  hands. Therefore, it is every Yemeni patriot's sacred duty to  speak up against whatever may heighten tension or trigger armed  conflict.    Brother Citizens: My visit to Egypt and the United Arab  Emirates during the last week of the holy month of Ramadan was  an opportunity for me to meet with brother President Muhammad  Husni Mubarak and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. The  talks I had there were positive and useful both for our  bilateral ties and for joint pan-Arab action. The two brotherly  countries emphasized their full support for Yemen's unity and  deep concern for its security. We deeply appreciate Egypt and  the UAE and other Arab brothers for their brotherly stands and  the way they relate to our country's concerns.    In the name of all our people, on this happy occasion, I  send my greetings to all our Armed and Security Forces  personnel, who have consistently proved up to the sacred  national responsibility, which they are shouldering with  courage, devotion, and patience. They shall always watch over  our unity, freedom, and democracy and faithfully stand guard  over our national sovereignty and all the gains scored by the  people. To the best of their ability, they shall distance  themselves from all political differences and disputes. This is  because by staying loyal to God, the homeland, the revolution,  and unity, they thus remain above all partisan differences and  disputes.    I repeat my congratulations on the 'Id. God's peace and  mercy be upon you.     "

In fact, the administration that will take control of  Panama's destiny will have to face the crucial dilemma of  efficiently consolidating the canal management transition  process. The new government will also have to dodge neoliberal  impositions that could undermine the gradual integration process  of the canal infrastructures, which will revert to the national  economy.    The new government will face a new plan regarding relations  with the United States, which will be driven by the imminent  withdrawal of military troops and the progressive  nationalization of the canal. This situation is being  conditioned by cuts in the defense budget with the end of the  Cold War. The issue of national security is not a priority for  the region yet simply because the international financial system  replaced the confrontation of ideologies.    As the United States readjusts its economy to consolidate  the  360 million people market that NAFTA, an agreement also signed  by Mexico and Canada, will create, its regional priorities deal  with the eradication of drug trafficking, as the new Southern  Command chief proposed, and trade deregulation, as international  financial institutions are promoting.    Under the circumstances, it is necessary to redefine  bilateral relations not only politically and economically, but  also jurisdictionally to ensure a trouble-free transition of the  canal administration; that is, a transition that will not be at  the mercy of the country's political stability. This is why the  new government will have the prerequisite of restoring the part  of the Panamanian state's self-determination that the 20  December 1989 invasion removed.    On those grounds, leaders will have to apply daring  solutions  to the problems that bilateral diplomatic relations have  exacerbated over the last few years, namely the post-invasion  upheaval, collective mechanisms against drug trafficking, and  the transition of the canal administration.    In the regional arena, leaders must use dynamic solutions to  reinforce the nation's presence in organizations of political  consensus like the Rio Group. Leaders will even be compelled to  improve hemispheric relations, which visibly deteriorated after  the invasion because of the regime of rigid bilateral foreign  policies.    At the multilateral level, the new government will have to  determine its position on GATT, not just because of the timid  interest the current administration has showed, but also because  of its inability to reconcile the interests of the economic  sectors, which favor trade deregulation, and the industrial  sectors that remain skeptical because of the uncertainty that  joining this organization will generate. Given such a big  challenge, there is a need for a government with leadership and  the ability to establish consensus at the lowest social cost  possible; a consensus that will explain in equitable and  balanced terms the competitive advantages the country will have  upon joining the integrationist movement.    The approval of the Sea Convention Law [Convencion sobre  Derecho del Mar], which was postponed for the last few years, is  another pivotal issue in foreign policies because Panama holds  first place in world merchant marine tonnage and is on the  threshold of managing an interoceanic canal with the potential  to tap maritime resources.    Integrationist initiatives are usually the result of a  historic process of accumulation by which states modernize their  production processes by systematically embarking in  international trade to seek competitive advantages to ensure  strengthening their economies. These assumptions in Panama have  yet to materialize. That is why it is necessary to consolidate  the national economy, to bring it closer to the countries with  negotiating capabilities in the integration dynamics.    This is why we cannot conceive of separating political  integration from economic factors, nor can it (Central American  integration) be the result of rhetorical pronouncements that do  not come from objective analyses of the country's political and  socioeconomic realities. Therefore, by being aware of the  country's potentials and needs, the new government will have to  adopt measures aimed at increasing plans for regional  participation.    With this in mind, it will have to establish a series of  foreign policy priorities by modernizing the political  mechanisms of negotiation at the foreign ministry. Given the  challenges inherent to the canal administration, this  modernization necessarily means optimizing foreign services as  the key instruments to incorporating Panama into the Latin  American integration process.

AN EARLIER VERDIT HAD BEEN OVERTURNED. HE FACES LIFE IN PRISON  WITHOUT PAROLE.      By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Warren James Bland, a Los Angeles man who was labeled a career criminal last  year by a San Diego federal judge, was convicted Friday of being a repeat felon  in possession of a gun and, for the second time, faces being sentenced to life  in prison with no chance of parole.    If he receives that term, as he did in an earlier trial that was overturned, he  will be the first person in California sentenced to life without parole under a  4-year-old federal law that targets repeat offenders.    It took a U.S. District Court jury precisely 10 minutes to convict Bland, who  has spent 28 of the past 31 years in prisons or mental institutions, of  possessing a gun when San Diego police arrested him in February, 1987.    His first life sentence under the 1986 Armed Career Criminal Act was handed  down last year.    However, he won a new trial four months ago when a federal appeals court ruled  that U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving improperly told jurors during last  year's trial that Bland was wanted in the 1986 killing of a 7-year-old Pasadena  girl.    The second trial began Wednesday. Jurors began deliberating the case at 4:04  p.m. Friday and returned with the guilty verdict at 4:14 p.m.    ""I think it's the appropriate verdict,"" said Assistant U.S. Atty. Larry A.  Burns, the prosecutor in the case. ""I think the sentence was appropriate the  first time. Hopefully the court will reimpose the same sentence.""    Irving, who presided over the second trial, too, set sentencing for Dec. 19.    When Irving imposed the life sentence in August, 1989, he called Bland, 54, a  ""vicious, incorrigible predator."" Because of Bland's bespectacled,  grandfather-like appearance, Irving said, he is ""particularly dangerous"" and a  ""wolf in sheep's clothing.""    The conviction Friday marked Bland's 14th felony    conviction, Burns said.    ""He has become the measuring stick for other alleged armed career criminals,""  Burns said. ""I hear defense attorneys comparing their clients to him, saying,  'He's not a Warren Bland, judge, he's not a Warren Bland.'    Bland's first felony offense came in 1957, Burns said. He was most recently  released from prison in 1986.    In February, 1987, he was wounded and arrested by San Diego police and charged  in the torture and murder of 7-year-old Phoebe Ho of South Pasadena, whose body  was found in a Riverside County ditch. She had disappeared while walking to  school in December, 1986.    Bland also has been named as a suspect in the slayings of 14-year-old Wendy  Osborn of Placentia in Orange County, and Ruth M. Ost, 81, of San Diego.    San Diego police had been looking for Bland on the Riverside County warrant.  Officers found a gun in his car.    Bland was then charged under the 1986 federal ""career criminal"" law with  possession of a gun by a felon with at least three serious convictions. The law  sets maximum punishment as a no-parole life term.    Bland was convicted in March, 1989, of the gun charge and sentenced five months  later to life in prison. But, in July, 1990, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial, saying that Irving  should not have mentioned the Ho killing to jurors.    No juror could have remained impartial upon hearing that acquitting Bland might  mean releasing an ""exceedingly dangerous child molester and killer into the  community,"" a three-judge 9th Circuit panel said.    Bland remains in federal prison pending sentencing, Burns said.    Defense attorney Mario Conte could not be reached Friday for comment.

Another 12 fundamentalists were on the run, the gendarmerie added. It said the raiders took weapons from the Bougzoul barracks, 100km south of Algiers, after breaking in with help from four sympathetic soldiers. The attackers killed eight soldiers while gaining access to the arms depot, and then shot dead 10 more servicemen. They escaped in a waiting truck and two vans, but were later spotted by an aircraft and intercepted. A state of emergency was imposed in Algeria in February last year following the election victory of the now outlawed fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front.

0,FT941-5980 ,"FT941-5980 _AN-ECCCVAGRFT 940303   FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana fungicide poisoning Ecuadorean shrimps      By RAYMOND COLITT      QUITO   The Ecuadorean shrimp industry faces multi-million dollar losses for the second year in a row as a water pollution problem continues to hit production. In 1993 the industry suffered a Dollars 70m loss as toxic waste polluted the shrimp farms' water supply and cut production by about 16 per cent from the previous year's level. Recent studies have established that the toxic substances originate from nearby banana plantations, where fungicides are used to control the black sigatoka disease. Washed into rivers and the Gulf of Guayaquil by rain water, the toxins enter the shrimp cultivating pools, deforming and ultimately killing the larvae. Shrimp farmers insist that the shrimps that are being exported pose no health threat to consumers as the level of toxicity being encountered is too minute to affect humans. The so-called Taura syndrome, named after the area in Ecuador where it first appeared, has been spreading steadily since it was first discovered in late 1992. It puts at loggerheads the country's two largest non-petroleum export earners. While banana industry officials claim they have no alternative but to use the commercially available pesticides, shrimp farmers argue that the enormous quantity of toxins are endangering the entire eco-system, not only the shrimp industry. Says Mr Harold Muller of the National Aquaculture Association: 'Shrimp are a type of bio-indicator. If they cannot survive in a given environment, you'd know something is wrong with the ecological balance'. Indeed, the outbreak of the Taura Syndrome puts an end to the image of Ecuador being a haven for shrimp-growing because of its pristine waters. Taiwanese shrimp farmers who flocked to Ecuador to escape polluted waters in their country are now worrying whether the pollution will reach their shrimp farms in the southern region of the country's Pacific coast. According to Mr Muller, the principal toxins responsible for the deaths of larvae are the fungicides propiconazole (Tilt) and tridemorph (Calixin). He says the banana growers are combating a disease that won't go away, while the effect of their fumigation is killing millions of dollars worth of shrimp. Neither of the fungicides is able to eliminate the sigatoka disease. They are only effective in preventing its spread. Representatives of the Dollars 500m shrimp industry are calling for a complete moratorium on the use of the fungicide and for a government evaluation of the alternatives to its use. According to the president of the National Acuaculture Association, Alex Aguayo, the government ought to study the feasibility of introducing other types of banana trees that are more resistant to the sigatoka disease, thereby reducing the need for fumigation. In a seminar sponsored by one of the chemical companies producing the controversial toxins, leading marine biologists from around the world recommended to the Ecuadorean government a moratorium on the use of fungicides in the Guayas river basin. The government has formed a multi-sector commission to develop a strategy in response to the phenomena, which is unique to Ecuador. But shrimp farmers say action is needed now. They claim their survival is at stake, not only because of the Taura syndrome, but because of the rising production costs caused by movements of the national currency, the sucre. In the last 16 months costs have risen by 70 per cent while the Sucre sales price has remained stable.   Countries:-  ECZ  Ecuador, South America.   Industries:-  P0913 Shellfish.

City authorities were blamed for poor maintenance of the Songsu bridge (pictured left), one of the most heavily used in Seoul. Dong-ah Construction, Korea's third largest engineering company which built the bridge in 1979, said the bridge may have deteriorated because traffic use exceeded its design specifications. It said its legal responsibility to repair any defects had lapsed in 1984. Several other bridges in Korea have collapsed in recent years due to sub-standard work. The government may soon allow construction supervision by foreign companies to prevent future accidents. Authorities are expected to increase safety inspections of public infrastructures.

Minh, 33, keeps to himself. He rarely smiles, and he has no friends.    By his own admission, Minh was the man who assumed control of a foundering  Vietnamese refugee vessel last year and killed at least one of the people on  board in order to feed himself and the others.    ""Because of the other people on the boat, I did this thing and I hoped God  blessed me,"" Minh said this week in an interview. ""I am a Christian. I killed  this man on the boat to help the living. Personally, I think it's wrong, but so  many people needed to eat.""    Minh was among 10 men arrested and imprisoned when the refugees were rescued by  Philippine fishermen last June 28 after 37 days at sea. Philippine officials  investigated the stories of killing and cannibalism but determined that they  had no authority to prosecute -- the incident did not take place in Philippine  waters, and the vessel involved was not registered in the Philippines.    The 10 have been released, but Minh has yet to join the others. He has been  free for about a month, and camp authorities are watching to see whether there  will be any attempt on his life.    ""We feared a bit that he might be mauled,"" said Jan Top Christensen, field  officer for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.    Last summer, when the refugees arrived at the camp, there was great animosity  toward those who were thought to be the leaders, Christensen said. The  committee of refugees who help run the camp sent a note to Christensen asking  that the 10 who had been investigated be barred from living among them, he  said.    Now, almost eight months later, the anger apparently has subsided. So far,  Christensen said, there has been no trouble as Minh moves between his cot in  the storage room and the camp hospital, where he works as a janitor.    Minh said that much of what has been said about him and reported in the press  is not true. He said the killing and the cannibalism were not just his idea,  that it was agreed to by all of the remaining refugees among those who had set  out ill-prepared for what they thought was to be a voyage of only a few days.  The others turned on him later, he said, because they did not want to accept  the blame for what they all had done.    ""They did not want to take the responsibility,"" he said.    Accounts of the voyage have come out in interviews with the survivors and  through documents and testimony at the court-martial of Capt. Alexander G.  Balian, who was commanding officer of the U.S. amphibious transport Dubuque  when it encountered the refugee vessel last June 9.    Balian was charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying orders for failing  to rescue the refugees, although he provided them with supplies and directions  to the nearest land.    Today, Balian was convicted of dereliction of duty and given a letter of  reprimand. But the six Navy captains hearing the case acquitted him of the more  serious charge of disobeying orders. The six captains had heard almost two  weeks of testimony at the court-martial at Subic Bay Naval Base in the  Philippines.    There is general agreement that more than 110 refugees were on board the vessel  when it set out from Ben Tre in southern Vietnam last May 22 and headed for  Malaysia. But the vessel's engine gave out after three days, and by the time  the refugees sighted the Dubuque in the South China Sea, between 10 and 20 had  died of starvation or drowned when they tried to swim to passing ships.      Took Charge of Boat    Before the encounter with the Dubuque, according to most accounts, Minh had  already taken control of the leaderless group and was rationing rainwater they  collected.    After the Dubuque moved away, Minh took charge of the food and water that Capt.  Balian had given the refugees. But the supplies were soon exhausted, and on the  28th day at sea, according to Minh, the refugees decided ""to use the dying to  help the living.""    Some survivors have said that they disapproved, that they agreed only because  they were too weak to resist. As the refugees weakened, some said, Minh and his  men became more cruel, using sticks and a knife to force starving passengers to  bail water.    Vo Thi Bach Yen, whose 4-year-old daughter died on the refugee vessel, said in  an interview last November that Minh beat her with his shoe when she attempted  to distribute water from the Dubuque to emaciated children.    Another refugee, Dinh Thuong Hai, said he protested when Minh and his men  suggested killing Hai's best friend, Dao Cu Cuong. The protest was ignored and  the man was killed.    Minh tells a different story.    ""Before the 28th day, all of the dead were thrown into the sea,"" he said.  ""After the 28th day we decided to use the dying to help the living. . . . The  people in the boat came to me. All of the people in the boat agreed with this  idea. It was June 18, and we decided to use this date to remember the dying in  the boat.""    Cuong, 30, was near death and had no hope of surviving, Minh said. He was  selected.    ""All of them agreed, including the close friends of the dying man,"" Minh said.    Some refugees sang songs, he said, and about 10 who were Christians offered a  prayer for the dying.    ""I did not want to do the wrong thing,"" he said. ""There were so many people.  All of these people believed in me and asked me to keep discipline in the boat,  and when they decided to use the dying, they asked me to do it.""    According to most accounts, two people were killed for use as food and three  others who died were eaten.    Minh admitted killing the first victim, Cuong, but would not say who killed the  other, a 13-year-old boy named Pham Quy.    ""I am afraid the people of the world misunderstand,"" Minh said. ""I was only a  member in a group of persons, so I didn't have the ability to force all of them  to follow me. I was only a man who was thinking more clearly than the others.    ""Please explain to all the people of the world that I had to do that to keep  all the people living. We were at sea in huge waves. I had no other choice.""    Minh said he is particularly upset that his mother, who lives in San Jose,  Calif., has rejected him. She sent him a newspaper article and demanded to know  if the allegations about him were true. He tried to explain in a letter, but  she did not believe him and will no longer communicate with him, he said.    Minh said he fled Vietnam because he had been in the air force of South Vietnam  and that after the Communists took over in 1975, he became an outcast. Last  summer's voyage was his 10th attempt to escape, he said. He had been caught  twice and spent four years in prison, he said.    He denied reports that he had been a paratrooper in a South Vietnamese infantry  unit known as the Red Berets. He said he was never in combat, and was a student  at a school for officers when the war ended.    Christensen said that Minh's account of his past appears to be true. He said  that as the truth is separated from the rumors about Minh, the other refugees  have become more willing to accept him. In recent days, he said, several people  have offered to take Minh into their homes in the camp.    The other refugees ""are kind sometimes,"" Minh said, and added: ""They invite me  to their homes for dinner or to do things. I always feel lonely because I have  no friends, no brother, no sister, no family in this camp.""    Minh said that he hopes someday to ""join in the life of the camp and help the  people of the camp."" But more than anything, he wants to resettle in another  country, preferably the United States.    The other refugees among the 52 who survived do not talk about what happened.  According to Yen, the woman whose daughter died, they wish to put the voyage  behind them. She said Minh came to see her after his release and seemed to be  seeking forgiveness for the way he treated her.    ""He asked me how I was getting along,"" she said. ""I was kind to him.""    Minh has recovered from a deep depression that followed his mother's rejection  and ""seems very stable and well now,"" Christensen said. ""He's doing a good job  as a volunteer at the hospital.""    Sooner or later, he said, some country will accept him.      Photo, Phung Quang Minh: ""After the 28th day, we decided to use the dying to  help the living.""

Minh, 33, keeps to himself. He rarely smiles, and he has no friends.    By his own admission, Minh was the man who assumed control of a foundering  Vietnamese refugee vessel last year and killed at least one of the people on  board in order to feed himself and the others.    ""Because of the other people on the boat, I did this thing and I hoped God  blessed me,"" Minh said this week in an interview. ""I am a Christian. I killed  this man on the boat to help the living. Personally, I think it's wrong, but so  many people needed to eat.""    Minh was among 10 men arrested and imprisoned when the refugees were rescued by  Philippine fishermen last June 28 after 37 days at sea. Philippine officials  investigated the stories of killing and cannibalism but determined that they  had no authority to prosecute -- the incident did not take place in Philippine  waters, and the vessel involved was not registered in the Philippines.    The 10 have been released, but Minh has yet to join the others. He has been  free for about a month, and camp authorities are watching to see whether there  will be any attempt on his life.    ""We feared a bit that he might be mauled,"" said Jan Top Christensen, field  officer for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.    Last summer, when the refugees arrived at the camp, there was great animosity  toward those who were thought to be the leaders, Christensen said. The  committee of refugees who help run the camp sent a note to Christensen asking  that the 10 who had been investigated be barred from living among them, he  said.    Now, almost eight months later, the anger apparently has subsided. So far,  Christensen said, there has been no trouble as Minh moves between his cot in  the storage room and the camp hospital, where he works as a janitor.    Minh said that much of what has been said about him and reported in the press  is not true. He said the killing and the cannibalism were not just his idea,  that it was agreed to by all of the remaining refugees among those who had set  out ill-prepared for what they thought was to be a voyage of only a few days.  The others turned on him later, he said, because they did not want to accept  the blame for what they all had done.    ""They did not want to take the responsibility,"" he said.    Accounts of the voyage have come out in interviews with the survivors and  through documents and testimony at the court-martial of Capt. Alexander G.  Balian, who was commanding officer of the U.S. amphibious transport Dubuque  when it encountered the refugee vessel last June 9.    Balian was charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying orders for failing  to rescue the refugees, although he provided them with supplies and directions  to the nearest land.    Today, Balian was convicted of dereliction of duty and given a letter of  reprimand. But the six Navy captains hearing the case acquitted him of the more  serious charge of disobeying orders. The six captains had heard almost two  weeks of testimony at the court-martial at Subic Bay Naval Base in the  Philippines.    There is general agreement that more than 110 refugees were on board the vessel  when it set out from Ben Tre in southern Vietnam last May 22 and headed for  Malaysia. But the vessel's engine gave out after three days, and by the time  the refugees sighted the Dubuque in the South China Sea, between 10 and 20 had  died of starvation or drowned when they tried to swim to passing ships.      Took Charge of Boat    Before the encounter with the Dubuque, according to most accounts, Minh had  already taken control of the leaderless group and was rationing rainwater they  collected.    After the Dubuque moved away, Minh took charge of the food and water that Capt.  Balian had given the refugees. But the supplies were soon exhausted, and on the  28th day at sea, according to Minh, the refugees decided ""to use the dying to  help the living.""    Some survivors have said that they disapproved, that they agreed only because  they were too weak to resist. As the refugees weakened, some said, Minh and his  men became more cruel, using sticks and a knife to force starving passengers to  bail water.

His capture  was requested by the Bolivian Interpol on charges of  participating in eight murders in the Bolivian city of Sucre.    The individual was identified as Juan Carlos Garcia Guaman  or  Guzman. He was a member of a paramilitary group during the  governments of Generals Luis Garcia Meza and Luis Arce Gomez.  He allegedly participated in the killing of eight Movement of  the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders.    Garcia was placed at the disposal of Federal Judge Adolfo  Bagnasco and will testify tomorrow.    The incident that prompted Garcia's capture occurred on 17  July 1980 when the group in which Garcia participated entered  the MIR party offices on Harrington Street, in Sucre, and  machine gunned the eight persons in the room.

So far,  the battle has not reached the level it had attained with the  Italians, with rifles, bullets, and machine-guns. So far, the  battle continues with the enemy, but with other weapons and  other methods. We want to be very careful this time. We do not  want the enemy to laugh at us. The enemy fears us. It says:  This land has an armed and trained people, prepared for  confrontation. It will bring us other methods. We must be  careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans: ""Hang them in the  public square,"" ""O leader, do not show mercy to any traitor""]    Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact  that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed  resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it  enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant  to this. [passage omitted]    We are a trained and armed people and more numerous in  number. Our population is larger now than in the past. We have  industry, agriculture, water, and potential. We can fight and  continue the battle for a longer period. [passage omitted]    We are now in a situation as if we were fighting against  America, so we are not importing American goods. We are doing  without them. We are as if we were fighting against France and  Britain, and we are not importing goods from Paris and London.  Our independence, sovereignty, and honor are above goods.  [passage omitted]    The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to  public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family  and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who  can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede  into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn  and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying  out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much  you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a  deluge. [crowd chants]    There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that  those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the  court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are  determined to storm the house and property of a traitor, and to  burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable.  In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation  should come to this, but those are the masses. [passage omitted]    Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied  evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family  were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said:  Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will  storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of  treachery.    Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers are  treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous;  al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous;  the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have  foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in  smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer  goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If  we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of  awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what  weapons are required for the battle.    If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do  not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver,  aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that  corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face  with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel  weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One  should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must  know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and  the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is  shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then  that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver  cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who  would defeat you.     "

The author, in a  fictional ""re-creation"" of the story, endeavors, as the title suggests, to  uncover the motive for such a heinous crime, but succeeds only in telling the  story -- which may be, in a sense, more than enough.    By definition, such a crime is impossible to understand: The blurb-writers here  describe it as ""mother-love and feminism gone mad,"" which is about as murky a  description of what happened as the trial lawyers managed when the dreadful  event occurred.    ""Aurora's Motive"" is short, scary and hair-raising, a parable about the  impotence of the individual always at the mercy of steamroller society; a muted  question put to the reader about the ethics of suicide, murder, human survival.  (In literary terms this harks back to ""The Ordeal of Richard Feverel,"" in which  a hapless young man is so relentlessly educated by his determined father that  the desperate, put-upon young man comes down with brain fever and dies), and  Horace McCoy's ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,"" in which an aging, would-be  actress, exhausted from a dance marathon and from life itself, begs her partner  to murder her and put her out of her misery. He does -- and is that murder or  is it mercy?      Set in Border Town    Aurora's story begins in the Spanish harbor town of El Ferrol. As the turn of  the century rolls by, Aurora grows up the daughter of a shrewish mother  obsessed by bourgeois conventions. Her father lounges at his club and is best  described as a parlor socialist, spouting notions about how the lower classes  are exploited in Spanish society; how women are oppressed (by the obligation to  produce children by the dozen; by their inability to make a living, survive on  their own and so on and so on).    No one in the family really listens to all this except Aurora, who makes the  fatal mistake of taking her father seriously. If women and the lower classes  are so oppressed by a stifling society -- very well; she will do what she can  to change this condition.    Aurora refuses to marry. She advertises in the local papers for a man to father  her child (and just as inevitably as if she were looking for a used car, she  inadvertently picks a lemon). Then she begins single-handedly the mad  ""education"" of the girl child who is born to her.    Modern American parents may wince at some of this, especially since this is a  true story. Good old Hildegart is bombarded with flash cards and maps and  alphabet blocks. She becomes a certified typist by the time she is 3, so that  she can join her mother in the composition of socialist monographs. Hildegart  knows absolutely everything there is to know about sexual reproduction by the  time she's 4, but of course her mother never gives her a single hug or allows  her to play with other children. Affection is part and parcel of bourgeois  society, Aurora argues, and other children harbor the values of that society as  surely as they carry germs or measles.      Author Goes Awry    Here, though, the reader may balk. What is the author getting at? Isn't it his  duty as an artist to point out the general dopiness of this theory, which is  fed to us one way or another, incessantly, in movies, after-school specials and  high-tone novels: ""Either you're smart, or you're loving, you can't be both,""  or, for women, an alternate ""Either, or conundrum: Either you're a happy wife  and mom, or you're a disciplined career woman, or you're a stressed-out  looney-tune who tries to ""have it all,"" and inevitably, fails. Wouldn't the  author like to say a few words on this subject, considering he's writing about  ""feminism gone mad?"" No, he wouldn't.    Poor Hildegart discovers men when she's 17. She's wooed by H. G. Wells, who  wants to introduce her to Havelock Ellis, the internationally known sexologist.  Her mother, incapable of love, takes to jealousy. Facing the possible loss of  her daughter, she shoots her dead. This is a cautionary tale, but against what?  Do we keep the kids away from the word processor until their age hits double  digits? Can't we hug them and teach them to be useful members of society at the  same time? Must education lead to certain -- and early -- death?

Isn't it his  duty as an artist to point out the general dopiness of this theory, which is  fed to us one way or another, incessantly, in movies, after-school specials and  high-tone novels: ""Either you're smart, or you're loving, you can't be both,""  or, for women, an alternate ""Either, or conundrum: Either you're a happy wife  and mom, or you're a disciplined career woman, or you're a stressed-out  looney-tune who tries to ""have it all,"" and inevitably, fails. Wouldn't the  author like to say a few words on this subject, considering he's writing about  ""feminism gone mad?"" No, he wouldn't.    Poor Hildegart discovers men when she's 17. She's wooed by H. G. Wells, who  wants to introduce her to Havelock Ellis, the internationally known sexologist.  Her mother, incapable of love, takes to jealousy. Facing the possible loss of  her daughter, she shoots her dead. This is a cautionary tale, but against what?  Do we keep the kids away from the word processor until their age hits double  digits? Can't we hug them and teach them to be useful members of society at the  same time? Must education lead to certain -- and early -- death?      Book Review    "

It was while being questioned about the freeway shooting that Brian Pratt  remembered that a trial was scheduled to begin later that morning in Los  Angeles Superior Court for Kirkton Phenor Moore, 29, who is accused of killing  Officer Daniel Pratt, 30, in the wake of a gang drive-by shooting two years ago  in the Hyde Park section of Southwest Los Angeles.    ""Suddenly, it just dawned on him,"" Lady said.

Brian Pratt, who joined the force after his brother's death, was unavailable  for comment late Wednesday.    Moore and girlfriend Raylene Brooks, 19, were arrested about two months after  Daniel Pratt was killed. Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the slain officer was  the first Los Angeles policeman to die as a result of a gang-related drive-by  shooting.    The officer was working undercover on the night of Sept. 4, 1988, when he and  his partner, Veronica DeLao, heard gunfire and chased a car they saw leaving  the scene of a drive-by shooting.    Investigators said the car turned and bore down on Pratt and DeLao in a service  station at the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Florence Avenue. During an  exchange of gunfire, Pratt was shot in the face. DeLao was uninjured.    Nearly two months after Daniel Pratt's death, Fox Television Network's  ""America's Most Wanted"" did a segment on the shooting and the hunt for Moore  and Brooks.    Moore, who had fled to Las Vegas with Brooks, saw the segment and agreed to  give himself up to KTLA newsman Warren Wilson. Wilson and a Channel 5 cameraman  met the pair in Las Vegas and drove them to the station's Hollywood studios,  where they surrendered to police.    In the trial that began about six hours after the freeway incident, Deputy  Dist. Atty. William Gravlin told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury that there  was sufficient evidence to link Moore to the killing of Pratt, a six-year LAPD  veteran.    He said in opening statements that Moore's fingerprints were found on the  murder weapon and that DeLao identified Moore as the man who killed the  officer.    Moore, who has maintained his innocence, sat quietly throughout the trial's  opening statements and initial witnesses.

Messages painted on shanty-town walls are warning inhabitants of Lima and key provincial cities they risk death if they attempt to turn up for work. President Alberto Fujimori cancelled plans to attend a presidential summit in Madrid as Sendero intensified its six-day campaign of terror in the capital. A policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded yesterday while on Monday night a car bomb wrecked Lima's Institute for Liberty and Democracy, killing at least four passers-by and a security guard.

The 73-year-old Rodriguez Porth, whose formal title was minister of the  presidency, was shot to death at 8:10 a.m. (7:10 PDT) just as he was entering a  station wagon parked in front of his house in the La Mascota district of the  city. His driver, Juan Gilberto Clara Carranza, and his groundskeeper, Benjamin  Perez, also died.    The Salvadoran government, the military and U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker  all blamed the deaths on the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a  Marxist guerrilla movement that has fought a nine-year civil war here. They  charged that the rebels are trying to provoke a violent right-wing reaction  that would endanger the massive U.S. aid program for El Salvador.      Widow's Suggestion    However, a guerrilla spokesman in Mexico City told the British news agency  Reuters that ""it is almost impossible"" that the FMLN, as the rebels are called,  carried out the murders. And Rodriguez Porth's widow suggested the killers  could have been ""terrorists from the right.""    Rodriguez Porth, a founder and one-time director general of Cristiani's ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena party), was the second senior member of  the party to be assassinated in the last two months. Atty. Gen. Roberto Garcia  Alvarado died April 19 when his car was bombed. In addition, an unsuccessful  attempt was made April 14 on the life of Vice President Jose Francisco Merino.    Although they deny responsibility for these attacks, the rebels have pledged to  make El Salvador ""ungovernable"" under Cristiani's leadership.    In a news conference at the end of the day, Cristiani said the killing of  Rodriquez Porth demonstrates that the ""dark forces"" of the FMLN ""don't want  peace, nor reconciliation, nor agreement nor progress for the country.""      Punishment Vowed    In reply to questions about a possible violent government or Arena reaction,  the president stressed that ""we are going to respond under the law . . . and  punish those responsible for this crime . . . but we will not be provoked into  sinking the country into a whirlpool of violence.""    Rodriguez Porth was a natural target for the rebels. Over the years, first as a  lawyer and a member of the country's wealthy business establishment, then as a  law professor, diplomat and official of Arena, he was a bitter critic of any  opponent of right-wing policies. He consistently advocated hard-line action  against the National University for supposedly harboring FMLN supporters.    A close friend who held similar opinions, Francisco L. Peccorini, was shot to  death March 15. The FMLN acknowledged killing Peccorini, a dual  American-Salvadoran citizen who had retired from teaching philosophy at Cal  State Long Beach.    Rodriguez Porth, who served as foreign minister during a right-wing military  dictatorship in the late 1970s, probably was best known to the public for his  almost daily denunciations of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whom he  called a Communist dupe.    Yet, although he had been an unrelenting advocate of hard-handed suppression of  the FMLN, Rodriguez Porth last week called for talks with the guerrillas to end  the civil war. It was this that led his widow to say Friday that he could have  been murdered by the right.    Friday's killings clearly were well planned. As the official walked the 20 feet  from his front door of his house at 240 La Mascota St. to the Jeep Cherokee  parked at the curb, the killer sat on a motorcycle about 50 yards away. He  evidently knew that Rodriguez Porth never used bodyguards and left for work at  the same time nearly every day.    Just as Rodriguez Porth clambered into the back seat of the car and the two  other men were walking to the front doors, the motorcycle drove up and stopped.  Watched by a jogger only 90 feet away and two housekeepers from a home across  the street, the killer calmly but quickly walked to the curb-side and fired  three shots into Rodriguez Porth's upper right chest.    He turned and shot Perez once and Carranza twice and then climbed onto his  idling motorcycle and drove away as Perez's wife and small child came to the  door. The roar of the departing motorcycle did not drown out the sound of the  child crying ""Papita, papita.""    The attack was over in less than two minutes.    In a statement read to reporters, Ambassador Walker said that the killing was  ""an act of mindless terror . . . that fits the pattern of other recent  terrorist attacks and killings.""    That, he said, is to ""do something so atrocious, so provocative, so repugnant  that the government, or others, must retaliate."" The ""others"" Walker mentioned  are the right-wing death squads that killed thousands of FMLN supporters and  other anti-government critics in the early 1980s. Many Arena leaders are widely  suspected of involvement in the death squads, which were responsible for 17  killings during the first four months of this year, according to the human  rights office of the Roman Catholic Church.    In fact, the guerrillas proposed last month to call off attacks on government  and Arena leaders if Roberto D'Aubuisson, another founder of the party and one  whose name is most often linked with the death squads, were tried for the 1980  assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. The offer was rejected.    In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying that President Bush  ""strongly condemns the vicious murder"" and ""again calls on extremist groups to  put an end to the violence in El Salvador, noting that only through the  renunciation of terrorism and war, and the acceptance of democracy, will there  be peace.""    ""The president noted a pattern of violence against government officials in El  Salvador by those who seek to destroy the democratic gains made in that  country,"" the statement said.    Although Walker said he expects the government to pursue the killer ""within the  legal system,"" powerful Arena leaders were speaking of revenge within an hour  of Rodriguez Porth's death.    ""We are facing outright terrorism,"" said Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a former army  colonel who once led a military mutiny against Duarte's government. ""They are  troglodytes, and the only way to make them understand is to fight fire with  fire.""

Rodriguez Porth, a founder and one-time director general of Cristiani's ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena party), was the second senior member of  the party to be assassinated in the last two months. Atty. Gen. Roberto Garcia  Alvarado died April 19 when his car was bombed. In addition, an unsuccessful  attempt was made April 14 on the life of Vice President Jose Francisco Merino.    Although they deny responsibility for these attacks, the rebels have pledged to  make El Salvador ""ungovernable"" under Cristiani's leadership.    In a news conference at the end of the day, Cristiani said the killing of  Rodriquez Porth demonstrates that the ""dark forces"" of the FMLN ""don't want  peace, nor reconciliation, nor agreement nor progress for the country.""      Punishment Vowed    In reply to questions about a possible violent government or Arena reaction,  the president stressed that ""we are going to respond under the law . . . and  punish those responsible for this crime . . . but we will not be provoked into  sinking the country into a whirlpool of violence.""    Rodriguez Porth was a natural target for the rebels. Over the years, first as a  lawyer and a member of the country's wealthy business establishment, then as a  law professor, diplomat and official of Arena, he was a bitter critic of any  opponent of right-wing policies. He consistently advocated hard-line action  against the National University for supposedly harboring FMLN supporters.    A close friend who held similar opinions, Francisco L. Peccorini, was shot to  death March 15. The FMLN acknowledged killing Peccorini, a dual  American-Salvadoran citizen who had retired from teaching philosophy at Cal  State Long Beach.    Rodriguez Porth, who served as foreign minister during a right-wing military  dictatorship in the late 1970s, probably was best known to the public for his  almost daily denunciations of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whom he  called a Communist dupe.    Yet, although he had been an unrelenting advocate of hard-handed suppression of  the FMLN, Rodriguez Porth last week called for talks with the guerrillas to end  the civil war. It was this that led his widow to say Friday that he could have  been murdered by the right.    Friday's killings clearly were well planned. As the official walked the 20 feet  from his front door of his house at 240 La Mascota St. to the Jeep Cherokee  parked at the curb, the killer sat on a motorcycle about 50 yards away. He  evidently knew that Rodriguez Porth never used bodyguards and left for work at  the same time nearly every day.    Just as Rodriguez Porth clambered into the back seat of the car and the two  other men were walking to the front doors, the motorcycle drove up and stopped.  Watched by a jogger only 90 feet away and two housekeepers from a home across  the street, the killer calmly but quickly walked to the curb-side and fired  three shots into Rodriguez Porth's upper right chest.    He turned and shot Perez once and Carranza twice and then climbed onto his  idling motorcycle and drove away as Perez's wife and small child came to the  door. The roar of the departing motorcycle did not drown out the sound of the  child crying ""Papita, papita.""    The attack was over in less than two minutes.    In a statement read to reporters, Ambassador Walker said that the killing was  ""an act of mindless terror . . . that fits the pattern of other recent  terrorist attacks and killings.""    That, he said, is to ""do something so atrocious, so provocative, so repugnant  that the government, or others, must retaliate."" The ""others"" Walker mentioned  are the right-wing death squads that killed thousands of FMLN supporters and  other anti-government critics in the early 1980s. Many Arena leaders are widely  suspected of involvement in the death squads, which were responsible for 17  killings during the first four months of this year, according to the human  rights office of the Roman Catholic Church.    In fact, the guerrillas proposed last month to call off attacks on government  and Arena leaders if Roberto D'Aubuisson, another founder of the party and one  whose name is most often linked with the death squads, were tried for the 1980  assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. The offer was rejected.    In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying that President Bush  ""strongly condemns the vicious murder"" and ""again calls on extremist groups to  put an end to the violence in El Salvador, noting that only through the  renunciation of terrorism and war, and the acceptance of democracy, will there  be peace.""    ""The president noted a pattern of violence against government officials in El  Salvador by those who seek to destroy the democratic gains made in that  country,"" the statement said.    Although Walker said he expects the government to pursue the killer ""within the  legal system,"" powerful Arena leaders were speaking of revenge within an hour  of Rodriguez Porth's death.    ""We are facing outright terrorism,"" said Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a former army  colonel who once led a military mutiny against Duarte's government. ""They are  troglodytes, and the only way to make them understand is to fight fire with  fire.""

Last week,  several aid agencies including the French charity, Medecins Sans  Frontieres, or MSF, accused the Liberian Peace Council of  murdering two nurses in Grand Bassa County, and they expressed  concern for the lack of respect being shown for humanitarian  efforts. Well, today, the Liberian Peace Council's secretary  general, Octavius Walker, called us up from Monrovia, and he  told Josephine Hazely that he objected to the claim that they  had been involved in the killing of the two MSF workers.    [Begin recording] [Walker] Sorry, it is not true. It is just  designed to spoil the good reputation of the Liberian Peace  Council. Since the war started, we have never killed any  civilians. We have never killed any civilians, so when the  story came out I went to the Medecins sans Frontieres office in  Monrovia and their director showed me a copy of the release that  (?reported it). They told me that it was a local newspaper that  accused the Peace Council of killing the two nurses. But  according to the release, no faction's name was mentioned. In  fact, on that particular day, the Liberia Peace Council and the  NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] fought so they do not  know exactly which faction killed the two nurses.    [Hazely] But it is a bit superfluous for you to say since  the  war started you have not killed any civilians, is it not?    [Walker] I can prove it, yes, it is true. We have never  killed any civilians. Even if the NPFL fighters surrender to  us, we do not kill them.    [Hazely] Why are you so sure that you did not kill the two  male nurses of Medecins sans Frontieres? After all, you were  fighting, it could have been you.    [Walker] I am sure my boys....[pauses] In fact we are  fighting a professional fight. We do not shoot when NPFL are  shooting at us. We wait till they are tired before we attack  them. So my boys are professionals and I trust them.    [Hazely] Our reports say these two aid workers were killed  at  Compound No. 2. Now, who controls Compound No. 2?    [Walker] The Liberian Peace Council presently controls  Compound No. 2.    [Hazely] Well, so, there you are. You could have killed  them.    [Walker] No way. We took over 6,000 civilians from that camp  and turned them over to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] in Bassa. We have  never killed any civilians.    [Hazely] All right, then. The aid agencies were generally  complaining about the manner in which you are harassing and  making their work completely difficult in Grand Bassa, where you  are. Now why are you preventing the aid agencies from operating  normally?    [Walker] For the aid agencies now going to our territory,  they and myself are now negotiating. For the past two weeks,  they have been inviting us to meetings and they went to my  chairman, Dr. George Foley, and we have worked out modalities.  Just on the 29th of last month, March, we (?carried) ECOMOG  chief of staff with other members of the (?High Command) of  ECOMOG. We went to Rivercess, and our territory and they saw  the whole area, so we are working out modalities for the  Medecins sans Frontieres to go and start their work.    [Hazely] Well, okay. Have you or have you not been stopping  aid agencies from working in your areas?    [Walker] We have never stopped anybody. They came to us to  talk to us to allow them to go in. We have never [words  indistinct] those modalities yet. [end recording]     "

'The crime has been solved. The criminal has been identified, the investigation is proceeding, and we expect him to go on trial,' the first deputy interior minister, Mr Mikhail Osadze, said on radio. Mr Woodruff, who according to unconfirmed US press reports was working for the Central Intelligence Agency, was killed with a single bullet to the head on August 8 while travelling in a car with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's security chief. Mr Osadze, speaking to Reuter by telephone, said the unnamed suspect had apparently fired in an attempt to stop the car in which Mr Woodruff was travelling, but had not intended to kill any of the passengers.

The troops were on Nigerian territory and had no  ""expansionist"" intentions, he added, explaining that the aim was  to show local people that they had not been abandoned by the  authorities.    Press reports said that last week Cameroonian paramilitary  police carried out a raid against Abana fishing village in Cross  River state, killing six people. Six women have been reported  missing since.    THE GUARDIAN newspaper, citing sources close to the security  forces, said the Cameroonian gendarmes threw the baby child of  one of the villagers into the water after she said she did not  have to pay them money they had demanded.    Fourteen fishing vessels were sunk during the raid, the  independent newspaper said.     "

By JOHN MITCHELL and JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Gang member Durrell DeWitt Collins was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison  Friday for the 1988 shooting death of Karen Toshima in Westwood Village, a  killing that shocked Los Angeles into the realization that street violence is  not limited to minority neighborhoods in South and East Los Angeles.    Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht noted in sentencing Collins  that the 23-year-old defendant had committed an ""unspeakable act."" But he  observed, at the same time, that Collins had been in trouble since age 11,  adding that society had also failed Collins.    ""It happens again and again,"" Albracht said. ""He (Collins) didn't burst on the  scene in Westwood. These young people are no secret to us. They are walking  time bombs. We failed the Durrell Collinses of the world.

Albracht could have sentenced Collins to two consecutive life terms on two  convictions: one for shooting Toshima and the other for attempted murder in  firing at rival gang member Tyrone Swain in a street confrontation that led to  Toshima's death on Jan. 31, 1988.

""Although my sister was not the intended victim, it was nevertheless a killing,  which was pre-intended, and my sister and family, as a result, have suffered  because of Collins' premediated action,"" Kevin Toshima wrote.

Collins, who was identified by probation authorities as a member of the Rolling  60s Crips, sat with head bowed during the 40-minute hearing. He showed no  emotion when his sentence was announced.

Toshima, a graphic artist from Long Beach, was strolling with a friend along  the bustling streets of upscale Westwood Village, adjacent to the UCLA campus,  late on Jan. 30, 1988, when she was shot in the head.

That's how Gerald Lee Bishop Sr. remembers  his son's volatile, on-again, off-again relationship with longtime girlfriend  Marina Garcia of Huntington Beach.    The relationship turned deadly on June 3, 1988, according to prosecutors, when  the 22-year-old Gerald Bishop of Westminster strangled and drowned Garcia, then  buried her body in the desert near Victorville and went back later to dig a  deeper hole.    Now, it is up to a jury to decide what was in Bishop's mind at the time of the  killing. Jurors began their deliberations in the case in Orange County Superior  Court on Thursday after attorneys presented their closing arguments.    Jurors will have to determine whether Bishop killed his longtime girlfriend in  a fit of rage over her desire to end the relationship and thus, as his attorney  says, should be convicted of manslaughter; or whether, as prosecutors maintain,  Bishop acted deliberately to commit an act of murder.    The distinction could mean the difference between Bishop spending the rest of  his life in prison -- the upper term if he is convicted of first-degree murder  -- or serving an 11-year maximum prison sentence for manslaughter.    ""There was clearly premeditation in this killing, and we want to see him held  accountable for it,"" Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard F. Toohey, the prosecutor in  the case, insisted in an interview.    That was the line of argument that Toohey stressed Thursday morning as he  presented his closing argument in a Santa Ana courtroom.    ""There was absolutely nothing sudden"" about the killing, Toohey told jurors.  ""There's no question that this was an intentional act.""    And the evidence of that, he said, is ""overwhelming.""    The day before Bishop strangled and drowned the 23-year-old Garcia in the  bathtub of her Huntington Beach home, the prosecutor said, Bishop had indicated  to a friend his plans to kill his estranged girlfriend.    And once the act was done, Toohey said, Bishop tried to cover it up by cleaning  up her residence, then taking the body out to the desert outside Victorville  and burying it.    He later returned with his brother to dig a deeper hole, fearful that the body  might be vulnerable to coyotes or discovered by passers-by, the prosecutor  said. And he then tried to get rid of Garcia's car by giving it to a hitchhiker  who apparently did not know how to drive and got in an accident near Long  Beach.    Once arrested, Bishop told police that he did not know Garcia's whereabouts.    That version of the events surrounding the killing remains essentially  unchallenged by defense attorney David Biggs, who declined to have Bishop take  the stand to testify in his own defense during a trial that began last week.      'Heat of Passion'    Biggs, seeking a manslaughter conviction for his client, told the jury that  Bishop killed Garcia in ""the heat of passion"" and that her death was the result  of ""an emotionally straining relationship"" which erupted into a sudden, vicious  quarrel between the pair.    Bishop, who has graduated from high school but had learning difficulties, had  no intention of killing Garcia that day, his attorney argued.    Gerald Bishop Sr. does not believe his son is a murderer, either.    ""It was just an extremely volatile relationship -- two kids chasing each other  and fighting for the better part of 5 years,"" the elder Bishop said in an  interview.    ""Somebody was going to get seriously hurt, and it just happens that she was the  one.

The statement followed UN confirmation of a Moslem attack on Brcko on Tuesday night which killed three people. As the Bosnian Serb assembly met for the second day in Brcko, Mr Karadzic said: 'The corridor must be strategically deep enough to defend.' His remarks heightened fear of clashes because the corridor is 6km wide and not thought of as 'defensible'. He warned that the 'criminal behaviour of the Moslems and Croats' will make the 'Serbs cede much less land than they hope for'. Last night Bosnian Serbs accused the Moslems of a new attack on Brcko while two separate artillery attacks were launched on the Moslem town of Tuzla, killing two people and wounding five.

As Germany reacted in shock and dismay yesterday to the news of the worst racial killing since unification, Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, announced that the security services were gathering evidence for a clampdown. Action would be taken in the near future, he said, but refused to give details for fear of undermining its effect. Thousands of Germans staged spontaneous anti-racism demonstrations in several cities including Hamburg, Berlin and the northern town of Molln, near Lubeck, where the killings took place. Berlin's protest was co-sponsored by its 140,000-strong Turkish community. The government's top criminal prosecutor announced that he was taking personal control of the investigations into the killing of the 51-year-old Turkish woman, and two girls aged 14 and 10. They died after two houses occupied for many years by Turkish migrant workers were set on fire. The police were tipped off by two informants, both of whom yelled: 'Heil Hitler.' Nine other occupants of the building were taken to hospital. The attack was condemned as 'shocking' and 'disgusting' by politicians on all sides of the political spectrum, except for Mr Franz Schonhuber, leader of the extreme rightwing Republicans, the largest far-right party in the country, who declined to comment. 'Hatred of foreigners is hatred of human beings,' Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, declared. 'The state must act with determination against all terror and crime . . . The powers and competence of the police to fight right-wing terrorism must be strengthened and concentrated.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed outrage on German television. On a state visit to Mexico, Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the federal president, who has repeatedly warned against racial violence, expressed grief over the victims of 'senseless, disgraceful violence'. The attack also sparked renewed charges that the government had failed to take firm action against a rash of violence against foreigners, and had instead become bogged down in an interminable debate on how to stop the flow of asylum-seekers into the country. The latest victims were not asylum-seekers, but long-time Turkish residents in Germany. At least one of the girls was born in the country and had lived all her life there. The three deaths bring to at least 14 the number of deaths from racial attacks in Germany this year. Two other murders were attributed to neo-Nazi gangs at the weekend - one of a German who was allegedly burned to death because his skinhead attackers thought he was Jewish.

DeShawn Stallsworth, who was 16 when he shot and killed Armando Bracamontes,  16, in the head, was tried as an adult.    Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez recommended that Stallsworth begin serving  his term with the California Youth Authority and be transferred to an adult  prison when he turns 25.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Michaels called the Aug. 8, 1989, murder on Wunderlin  Avenue ""an incredible, senseless and stupid killing.""    Michaels said Stallsworth had planned to rob a nearby house, but the occupants  weren't home. He then saw a group of young people nearby, who included  Bracamontes, staring at him.

The judgment is likely to embarrass the government of President F W de Klerk, who has long denied claims that police have been involved in violence that has left 11,000 people dead since 1984. In the court judgment, Mr Justice Andrew Wilson accepted prosecution evidence that policemen killed 11 people, many of them women and children, at a funeral vigil after an official of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the conservative Zulu group, asked police to help eliminate political rivals in the area.

Mr Laurens Brinkhorst, director of DG11, in charge of the Commission's environmental affairs, suggested a way around the issue - should Norway join the EU - would be to allow its whalers to continue culling of the minke whale for a two-year period, after which the policy would be reviewed. However, neither member states nor Norway seem prepared to accept the Commission's suggestion. Norway last May announced that it would allow killing of minke whales in defiance of an eight-year ban by the International Whaling Commission.

The problem lies  in what they are after. Traditions are only just taking shape in  the relations between Poland and Ukraine, because, until quite  recently, the two countries were under control of the almighty  KGB, and their special services danced to the same tune. The  history of these relations has only started to take shape,  although not in the best spirit. Its first page is the fate of  Anatoliy Lysenko, major of the Mostyskyy Rayon (in Lvov Oblast)  Department of Ukraine's Security Service.    On 23 August 1993, the major of Ukrainian special services  was arrested on the territory of Poland and accused of  espionage. It is already the fourth month that Anatoliy has  been under investigation. The trial will be held soon. It is a  strange case -- the major was arrested not far from the border.  On his trip to Poland, Anatoliy was accompanied by his whole  family -- wife, student daughter, and a little son. He did not  receive permission to leave from his authorities -- for lack of  time. Doctors insisted on the fourth operation on his son, and  the parents decided to seek the advice of an experienced Polish  specialist. In addition, there was nobody he could ask  permission from -- the chief was away on leave, and his deputies  were afraid to take the responsibility upon themselves. The  Lysenko family decided to go to Rzeszow on their own, though  they did have corresponding documents for crossing the border.    Nowhere in the history of special services worldwide will  one  find a precedent in which a whole family would be engaged in  spying. The version maintaining that Major Lysenko collected  intelligence information seems, to put it mildly, doubtful not  only to professionals. It is a different matter that the Poles,  taking advantage of the distress of the Lysenko family, did  everything in order to lure the major to their territory. The  first officer, who was in charge of the Mostyskyy Customs House  and who, apparently, ensured free border crossings for more than  one cargo, could not but interest his Polish colleagues. The  Mostyskyy Customs House is the gate to Western Europe, and  officers of the local department of Ukraine's Security Service  are a Klondike of intelligence information. The ""proofs"" of  espionage about which Lysenko's wife writes in her appeal to the  Ukrainian president, are ridiculous. Lysenko allegedly asked one  Pole to bring a few newspapers from Poland; another time, he  asked about who was going to head the religious community in  Przemysl and when the clergyman there would be replaced.  Finally, the most serious accusation -- he helped a Polish  citizen to bypass Customs. Based upon a testimony of their  citizen, Polish special services charged the major with  espionage and applied to him an article of the Criminal Code  envisaging between five and 15 years imprisonment or capital  punishment.    Although, Major Lysenko has yet another choice -- to betray  his fatherland. The Poles are offering him a job in their  special services, to bring his family, and adopt Polish  citizenship.    Meanwhile, Ukraine's Security Service, having abandoned  their  colleague to the mercy of fate, maintains calm and pretends that  nothing has happened. The Poles show greater interest in  Lysenko's case, because they already repeatedly hinted that  Ukrainian leaders should come to his rescue. Judging by  numerous hints, it is not just a matter of Anatoliy Lysenko's  fate. It appears that we are dealing here with the worst  variant of relations between special services, where the rule  ""tit for tat"" is in effect. Consequently, Ukrainian special  services pushed their Polish colleagues to a decisive step, or  else the Poles decided that attack was the best type of defense.  As a result, Ukraine's Security Service Major Anatoliy Lysenko  celebrates the coming of the New Year in a Polish prison, his  wife Olena haunts the thresholds of high-ranking officials, who  can only help by appointing a lawyer. Perhaps, they do not want  to help? It only remains for us to wonder what kind of logic  the Polish special services adhered to by picturing a modest  rayon official as the greatest Ukrainian spy. It is possible  that Anatoliy does not even have an idea about this. Now, his  colleagues will welcome him as a hero....     "

0,FT934-10114 ,"FT934-10114 _AN-DKGAGAFLFT 931106   FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Idyll of the countryside: true or false?      By PATRICIA MORISON   NOSTALGIA and romanticism shapes the artist's perception of the countryside quite as much as that of the prospective clients. So paintings provide poor evidence for the way in which the countryside has changed over the years. This is the theme of a thought-provoking and enjoyable small exhibition, Toil and Plenty; Images of the Agricultural Landscape in England, 1780-1890. The exhibition is first at Nottingham University Art Centre and travels to the Yale Centre for English Art in the New Year. If you cannot see the show, the book by Christiana Payne is extremely interesting and so readable that it would be an excellent choice for the bookshelves of any country-lover. In Yale, the exhibition will become a more splendid thing for adding pictures by names such as Francis Wheatley, Stubbs, and Samuel Palmer from the Paul Mellon Collection. Despite being much smaller, the Nottingham version has an attractive and interesting selection of artists: Rowlandson; Turner (the large oil, 'Ploughing Up Turnips Near Slough' is nearly as depressing as the title suggests); Peter DeWint; William Collins (father of the novelist); Ford Maddox Ford and Sir George Clausen. Several artists appear in an unfamiliar guise. John Martin, famous as the dotty visionary, was a painter of conventional harvest landscapes, although his haystooks have a slightly batty touch. Clausen appears as a Social Realist who in the 1880s, influenced by Millet and Bastien-Lepage, produced 'Winter Work', an impressively tough image of the farm labourers' working conditions. Photographs used for the painting also show him to have been the first photographer to take unposed pictures of farm labourers. At the same period, Helen Allingham painted the conventionally picturesque, happy, rosey-cheeked family of labourers harvesting a field of golden corn. Probably she invented her idyllic scene. Even if smallholders might still have used a sickle, it would be odd for a woman to wield it while her husband bound the stooks. After reading or seeing Toil and Plenty, you will look more beadily at country pictures. Another virtue is that Payne is mercifully dispassionate and non-doctrinaire. The impression is that she actually appreciates painting, which is rare with exhibitions selected to illustrate a particular social historical theme. All too often the artist who subscribes to the 'myth' (militarism, myth of childhood, patriachy, colonisalism) is condemned for it. Allingham, however, is not bashed for being a pedlar of myth and inaccurate to boot. Nor are other artists who throughout a century of profound agrarian change chose to paint scenes which delighted their eye and opened their public's pocketbooks. However, the theme is more complicated than that, and other values are projected onto the woods and fields. The view Constable painted from the upstairs window, across his father's vegetable garden, surely had a personal meaning to him. For other artists, including Turner, awareness that England was at war imbued the rural scene with patriotism. For Samuel Palmer and Edward Calvert, whose wood-engravings perhaps sit slightly oddly in the show, the landscape was the work of a divine intelligence. Harvest was not only picturesque but a potent symbol of God's mercy and man's virtuous toil. The book, rather more than the exhibition, sets the painted landscape against the political background of social unrest, repeal of the Corn Laws, vicious Game Laws, and trades union agitation. Life for the poor in the towns was always worse, but for decades it was a close-run thing. The harvest festival introduced by the Anglican clergy in the 1840s was an image of social harmony and honest toil. Its pictorial equivalent was an art which then as now, showed the countryside as benign, inspiring, and timeless.

Gayane Arustamyan, Press-Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Supreme Soviet, told SNARK Azerbaijan is always violating the  international conventions demonstrating inhuman attitude to the  POW and hostages.    Ms. Arustamyan mentions the facts of non-extraditions of  bodies of those Armenians who were killed in prisons of  Azerbaijan, bringing as an example the case of Hrachik  Petrosyan, born in 1954, died as a result of tortures on January  5, 1994, in Baku.    The Azerbaijani authorities, underlines Ms. Arustamyan,  prevent the representatives of International Red Cross to get  acquainted with the conditions the POW and hostages live in. In  connection with it the international control should be organized  to keep strictly the rights of the POW and hostages.     "

SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The Bush Administration stressed four legal justifications Wednesday for its  invasion of Panama: the protection of American lives, the defense of the Panama  Canal, the backing of the nation's ""democratically elected"" officials and the  pursuit of an indicted U.S. drug criminal -- namely, Manuel A. Noriega.    International law experts said the first reason is the strongest and the last  the weakest.    ""I think they can make a much more plausible case for this than the invasion of  Grenada (in 1983) or the Dominican Republic in the '60s,"" said American  University law professor Robert K.

Because thousands of Americans are scattered around Panama and Noriega's troops  have shown a willingness to harass and even kill them, President Bush had  reason to use military force to protect them, Goldman said.    By contrast, the Reagan Administration justified its invasion of Grenada by  pointing to the danger faced by a small group of American medical students, a  rationale that was rebutted by international law bodies. Critics noted that the  students could have been evacuated without U.S. troops overthrowing Grenada's  government.    Under the norms of international law, nations are justified in using military  force abroad to defend their citizens from hostile military action. But the  response also must be limited to the amount of force necessary to protect the  citizens.    The classic example of such a military move, law experts said, was the 1976  Israel raid on the Ugandan air base of Entebbe. Landing there, Israel commandos  rescued their citizens who had been held hostage and then left, without  attacking Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.    Several law experts, while agreeing on the need to defend American lives in  Panama, questioned whether a full-scale invasion is justified under  international law.

0,FT933-1344 ,"FT933-1344 _AN-DIXCIADJFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Liberal hopes   MR PADDY ASHDOWN is right to ignore those who would have him declare that the Liberal Democrats will support a future Labour government but not a Conservative one. The role of his party is still what that of British centre parties has been for most of the century: to prevent the parties of the left and the right from moving towards the extreme. To do that it is necessary to keep them guessing, at least between elections. There would also be no political advantage in promising a post-election pact with Labour now. The effect might be to deprive the Lib Dems of their most precious current asset, the anti-Conservative protest vote. It would anyway reduce Mr Ashdown's party to that of an appendage. That said, the Liberal Democrats profess views that are virtually indistinguishable from those of the 'modernisers' in the Labour party. At the Lib Dem conference in Torquay this week nothing was proposed by anybody, including Mr Ashdown himself, that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, could easily quarrel with. The Liberal Democrats stressed individualism, within a community framework, overseen by an active government; at its conference next week Labour is expected to favour an active government, community values, and room for individual expression. Mr Ashdown's party favours a Scottish assembly, regional parliaments, reform of the House of Lords and proportional representation; Mr Smith's a referendum on the latter and a version of all of the other proposed constitutional changes. Both parties are pro-European, Mr Ashdown's the more strongly of the two, but in the Liberal Democrats' case there has been some retreat, as in their leader's speech yesterday, from the notion that Brussels knows best. The two opposition parties would both propound full employment and greater government expenditure, Labour while limiting tax increases, the Liberal Democrats while attempting to explain them. More to the point the growth in support for Mr Ashdown's party is largely explicable by the unpopularity of the government. The Lib Dems have established a base as the principal challenger to the Conservatives in the west of England; they are no such threat to Labour in the north. This is in line with the historic experience of the Liberals since 1945: when the Conservatives are in power but out of favour, the non-socialist alternative party does well. At this stage there is little point in picking holes in this or that Liberal Democrat policy document. They are far from power, and their best chance might be, willy-nilly, to vote with a Labour government, assuming one is elected. It may be, however, that the present increase in support for the Lib Dems is no mere blip - that, as Mr Ashdown intimated yesterday, further hard work by the party will bring further advances in public support. This is possible, but it is not entirely for Mr Ashdown to determine. If Labour is seen at its conference next week to be on the way to true modernisation, it may begin to attract voters in natural Liberal Democratic territory. If not, the reverse could be the case. Again, if the Conservatives trip themselves up for another year or more, Mr Ashdown will reap a rich harvest; if the Tories recover their sense of purpose, they may begin to recover their electorate. It is the fate of British centre parties thus to be at the mercy of Labour and the Conservatives. Much was said in Torquay about the feel of things being different this time. Mr Ashdown has projected himself as an anti-politician, a British Ross Perot. It has taken him, and his party, a long way. He is more popular than either Mr Smith or the prime minister. He can do little other than carry on as an independent force, waiting to see what turns up.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

Kuito,  N'dalatando, Malanje, and Benguela are the focus of tension over  the past 24 hours. The shellings are continuing in Kuito, Bie  Province, and the government forces are still blocking the  enemy. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports:    [Abraao] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA],  National Police, and civilian defense are still scoring  victories whenever the rebel forces try to break any of the  government lines. Unable to attack the government positions  directly, the Black Cockerel soldiers have chosen to shell with  its heavy artillery the major centers sheltering large crowds.  Shells of various caliber have been fired since the early hours  of this morning at the center of the city. The number of  victims over the past 24 hours is not known, but hospital  sources say that more than 15 people were killed early today.  Well informed sources of the FAA Operation Command in Bie say  that judging by the movements and intensified shelling of the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  rebels, the next few hours may hold serious violence,  pain, and mourning for the martyred population of Kuito which  has been (?besieged) for 502 days.    There is a similar situation in the city of N'dalatando,  where UNITA is still shelling. After the UNITA rebels were  repelled by the government forces yesterday, Savimbi's soldiers  requested reinforcement from Huambo, Uige, and Zaire Provinces.  Our correspondent Abilio Correia reports:    [Correia] Five Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola [FALA] battalions that tried to occupy government forces  positions in the west part of the city were repelled due to the  bravery of the valorous FAA combatants, National Police, and  civilian defense. In their disorderly retreat, 12 UNITA rebels  were killed, and they abandoned four 82-mm mortars, five PKM  weapons, seven AKM's, and an assortment of ammunition.  Lieutenant General Manuel Jose Nego also said that UNITA is  still moving soldiers and war materiel from Huambo, Zaire, and  Uige Provinces to reinforce its positions in the outskirts of  N'dalatando and launch a big offensive over the next few days,  with the aim of taking the city. Today, the rebels shelled the  city with more than 80 shells from long-range guns between dawn  and 0900.
